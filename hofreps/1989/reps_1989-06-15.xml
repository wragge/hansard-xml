<PARA> That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its outrage at the massive and indiscriminate slaughter of thousands of unarmed Chinese pro-democracy demonstrators and bystanders by units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Beijing on 4 and 5 June 1989;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) condemns the subsequent repression by the Chinese authorities of intellectuals, teachers, students, workers and others who sought to express their political views peacefully;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) calls on the Chinese Government to end these violations of human rights, to commence a process of open and democratic consultation with the Chinese people, and to treat all those, including those in positions of high responsibility, who have expressed peaceful opposition to its policies with dignity and humanity;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) expresses its belief that the recent processes of economic reform in the People's Republic of China, which have brought significant benefit to China, the Asia-Pacific region and the world, cannot succeed in the face of the systematic repression of legitimate democratic aspirations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (5) recognises the work of Australian diplomats and their staff who at times of trauma and difficulty are prepared to risk their personal safety to ensure that the lives of Australian citizens are not endangered. </PARA>
<PARA>In six years of government I have never witnessed such a tragedy as we have seen in China in recent days. It is the tragedy of a country's authorities using its own troops to shoot and to kill thousands of its own people, so many of those people being unarmed, idealistic young students campaigning peacefully for a better future. Obviously, we were all deeply moved-I certainly was-last Friday to take part in a memorial service in Parliament House, with Senator Chaney, representing the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), and others, which reflected, I believe, the feelings of all Australians about the horrifying abuses of human life and human rights which have occurred in China. I felt very strongly, as I am sure everyone did, the absolute despair of the Chinese students present and their palpable fear about the predicament of their friends and relatives, and, overwhelmingly, their fear for the future of their own country. </PARA>
<PARA> I know-and I am sure that every member of the House shares that apprehension-that this is a very worrying time for Chinese students in Australia. We in the Government are aware of their fears about being sent home to China in its current state. We have already announced that visas for Chinese students will be extended until 31 July and that no action will be taken during this period against Chinese nationals who have already overstayed their visas. I again take this opportunity of assuring Chinese students and their Australian friends that the Government of Australia will keep their situation under close and sympathetic review. Obviously, we would consider sympathetically the cases of any students who could in any sense be in danger by a return to China. I have mentioned 31 July, but that date too will be kept under review for possible extension depending on the assessment of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members will know, the Government received last week a request from a Chinese consular official in Sydney, Ms Dong Qi, to be allowed to stay in Australia. I can now inform the House that the Acting Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Holding) has approved Ms Dong's application to stay in Australia on humanitarian grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> In these tragic times we extend our sympathy to the Chinese-Australian community, sharing the profound sense of mourning for those who have lost their lives and for those whose ideals and aspirations for their country have been so barbarously crushed. I will be discussing our response to the situation in China with a large delegation of members of the Australian-Chinese community tomorrow morning. The Government has already offered $200,000 to the Red Cross for humanitarian assistance in China. </PARA>
<PARA> The action of China's leadership is by any analysis a tragic blow to political and economic growth in China over recent years. It is a matter of pride for this country that successive Australian governments under the leadership of Whitlam, Fraser and me have put great effort in almost the last two decades into developing a constructive relationship with China-a constructive relationship built on mutual interests and respect. It is well known that I have taken a personal and close interest in developments in China and the benefits which the open door policy brought to China, to our relationship and to our region. </PARA>
<PARA> Immediately following the infamous events of 4 and 5 June I cancelled my visit to China which had been scheduled for October this year. We have suspended other important visits to and from China; for example, the visit by the concessional finance team from China, which was scheduled to come here. As honourable members will know, we have also cancelled a planned naval visit to China by HMAS Parramatta. I can say to the House that in the prevailing circumstances Australian Ministers will not be visiting China. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion before us summarises the feelings of not just those on this side of the House but, I know, all honourable members and, indeed, all Australians. It is important that in this country we state our attitude clearly, directly and unambiguously. Honourable members will be aware that the Government has strongly communicated its views to the Chinese authorities both in Beijing and here in Canberra, including our view that the current situation is not a viable basis for the future development of China and is palpably against China's international interests. As honourable members will by now be aware, I have written to Premier Li Peng expressing the Government's condemnation of the brutal massacre of unarmed civilians in Beijing and expressing the hope that all people who have made their political views known publicly will be treated with dignity and humanity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has evacuated non-essential diplomatic staff, Australian students and tourists from China. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the role of the staff in our Embassy in Beijing and in our Consulate-General in Shanghai. Their work has been in the great tradition of Australian officials overseas who have worked long hours in difficult and sometimes dangerous conditions to carry out the Government's policies and to help Australians in need. I also take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the dedicated efforts of officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Office of National Assessments, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, and other government departments who have worked very long hours to provide assistance and advice to the Government at all hours of the day and night. </PARA>
<PARA> It is still too early to make an accurate assessment of what may occur and the implications for the region. It is certainly one of the major issues that I will be discussing with the leaders of countries that I will visit during my forthcoming overseas visit. It will be a matter very much near the top of our agenda. The sheer scale, the callousness and the barbarity of the slaughter in Beijing cannot but substantially affect the international standing of those leaders who ordered and condoned such action. However, while we in this place and in the country as a whole are as one in expressing that view, I hope we will also be as one in having the earnest hope that sanity will prevail in China and that the Chinese leadership will again return to the sorts of policies and outlook which have in recent times promised such benefits for the country, our region and the world. As the motion which is before the House notes, the recent processes of economic reform in China have brought significant benefit to China, to the region and, I believe, to the world. There can be no question that those policies of economic reform and change cannot, and will not, succeed in the face of the systematic repression of legitimate democratic aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible to measure the personal tragedy of those who have suffered, those who have been killed or those who are now subject to the entirely objectionable, horrendous process of information seeking that we in Australia would call `dobbing in' which we now see has extended into the areas of family member against family member. It is impossible to measure the tragedy of the imposition of this regime of barbarity, callousness and information seeking, which pits community member against community member, family member against family member. These sorts of tactics may for a time enable the authorities to impose their will. That cannot be doubted. But equally certain is the fact that those sorts of tactics, that sort of approach, cannot endure. At some time-and we must all hope, sooner rather than in the more distant future-the entirely legitimate aspirations of the people of China for a freer society in which the rights of human beings will be properly recognised will come to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy is a personal tragedy. It is a tragedy for the people of China; it is a tragedy for the region; and it is a tragedy for the world. I am confident that this motion, having embraced all of those considerations and thoughts, will be one which all honourable members will join in supporting. The unanimous passage of this motion will mean that not merely the Government but the Parliament and the people of Australia will have put on the record for all time the totally unacceptable nature of the barbarity which has been practised and the tragedy which has eventuated in China. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say on behalf of the Opposition that we support the motion. In terms of the statement which has just been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), we are pleased that Ms Dong's application to remain in Australia has been approved. We agree that the motion mirrors the concerns felt by this Parliament and the overwhelming majority of Australians about what has occurred. Additionally, as one who formerly served for such a long period as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I thank the Prime Minister for making particular reference to the work of Australian diplomats, the risks that they take and the peril upon which they embark, in the execution of their duties. I am pleased that the motion, which expresses outrage and condemns the conduct of the Chinese leadership, draws proper attention to the performance of those who seek to serve this country overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has in the main forsworn criticism of the Government's handling of the matter. I will touch on that point briefly in my remarks today. In a motion such as this we emphasise the tragedy in China today-a tragedy which has been expressed by so many of us as we have recorded our horror at what has occurred. What makes the tragedy so much worse is that students and others were not killed in an attempt violently to overthrow a regime; rather, in expressing their urge for greater freedom in a peaceful manner. It is, of course, part and parcel-a point held so frequently and voiced so often by honourable members, particularly those on this side of the House-of the history of communism that dissent will be crushed, as crushed it was yet again on 4 and 5 June. The world has received a terrible reminder that communist regimes at regular periods in their history engage in slaughter, pillage and destruction in the pursuit and the hold of their ideology. It is essential that the current Chinese leadership be convinced by the international community that orchestrated intimidation, orchestrated terror, orchestrated purges, arrests and bloody murder will not be costless-as, dare I mention, were the recent Chinese actions this year in Tibet which, tragically, were ignored by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There remains a risk that divisions within the current Chinese leadership could lead to much more widespread killings and arrests, similar to those which occurred in 1969 during the Cultural Revolution. Australia is a concerned member of the international community and, dare I mention it, a concerned member of the Western Alliance. I raise that point because the Western Alliance is not an alliance solely for strategic purposes; the Western Alliance is an alliance of democratic nations which believe fundamentally and fervently in freedom, justice and the rule of law. Nations which hold these views, which work to them, which have established them in their parliaments and democratic processes, following the suffering of so many millions over centuries to establish such concepts in government, are duty bound to continue to apply pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government may have acted correctly to date, but, regrettably, the Prime Minister's statement gives little evidence of additional pressure. I urge the Government to be continuously vigilant, to substantiate the concerns that have been put to the nation, to consider for the future, for example, the freezing of aid to China, as has been recommended by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid; to consider the recall of the Australian Ambassador; to consider extending the period in which nationals of the People's Republic of China may remain in Australia-not just until 31 July, next month, as referred to by the Prime Minister but for a period of one year, as has been allowed in the United States of America; and to consider action in international bodies, such as the United Nations Commission for Human Rights, to condemn the slaughter, pillage and destruction and to seek its cessation. </PARA>
<PARA> The stark reality of the horror of recent events may have shaken people-including those in the Government of Australia-into a more realistic view of the People's Republic of China than perhaps they previously held. That reality so reached by these events must compel the consideration of further measures so that the actual practice of pressure accompanies the mere appearance. Whilst I agree with the action of the Prime Minister in the letter he referred to, which has been so well publicised, I must say that a letter that is becoming dog-eared in the bowels of the Chinese bureaucracy must not be alleged to be the high watermark in our actions following the terrible events of recent times. I do believe that on occasions the Government has been naive, simplistic and oft times romantic in its dealings with this great nation of China. I trust that such overtones are not allowed to arise again. I express these views in this democratic forum as is my right and, indeed, my duty. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicate yet again that for the greater part of the period since the weekend before last I think the Government has acted correctly. I urge the Government not to rest on what it has done but to take account of some of the measures that I have put before the House today for consideration, for only by consistent and applied pressure-not just from this great nation of ours but by the coordinated action of freedom loving nations around the world-can some effect be felt in a country such as the People's Republic of China. In short, we ought to ensure that that is not simply behind us, that there is more to be done and that it ought to be done as part of a coordinated international approach-reality dictates essentially a Western approach-to seek to maintain the pressure. The Opposition joins with the Government in supporting the motion and calls on the Government to ensure that such pressure is maintained on the Chinese leaders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a couple of remarks about this motion. I do not disagree with its basic points. I would like to say something about a question which I had hoped to ask at Question Time. That question reads: Whilst I realise the problem of the so-called economic refugees, does our attitude regarding the repatriation of Vietnamese refugees in Geneva suggest that we have the same naive views about the Hanoi junta as the Government and the Opposition had about the Chinese Government until two to three weeks ago? Totalitarian governments behave in certain ways. Many of our people on both sides of the political fence will never learn. Some 11 or 12 years ago this House almost unanimously, with my disagreement, passed a motion of condolence for the well loved Chairman Mao.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members of the Opposition may sling off at us but they should think about it. Honourable members believed that Chou En-lai was kind and loving, as were Mao and his wife during the so-called Cultural Revolution. They were certainly very impressed by the `New China' after the Cultural Revolution. Similarly, they were shocked by Khrushchev's exposure of Stalin but loved the `new' Soviet Union until it invaded Hungary in 1956. They were again impressed by the new peace loving Soviet Union until the events in Czechoslovakia in 1968. Then again they were happy with the Soviet Union until Afghanistan. Now, again, the Soviet Union leaders are the goodies. I remind this House that Cuba, Vietnam and the Soviet Union have not condemned the Chinese Government because they share the same totalitarian beliefs and believe that that is the way to deal with dissent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly simply to associate the National Party of Australia with the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock). I do not believe that any Australian was not shocked and deeply moved by the graphic and horrific footage that has come out of China in recent days. The circumstances that have prevailed in that country must raise doubts about the humanity of some of its leadership. We wholeheartedly endorse the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition and we take note of the sage-like remarks of the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman).</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I entirely agree with what has been said by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock). I remind the House that on 23 May I asked the Prime Minister the following question about China:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I ask the Prime Minister whether his Government will advise the Chinese Government of the wholehearted support of the Australian Government and of this Parliament for the aspirations for democratic rule which are now so widely expressed in China. </PARA>
<PARA>This was before the murderous events which we now know of. In his answer, the Prime Minister, amongst other things, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We will not tell the Chinese Government how to conduct its affairs, other than to make it clear that we support the moves towards free expression of views by the people of China and that we want it to handle this matter without violence and with a respect for fundamental human rights. This Government will not tell the Government of China, outside those obvious indications of what we believe ought to happen, how otherwise it should conduct its affairs or what particular system of government will operate in China. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask: Why not? Why would we not say that we wholeheartedly support democracy as the only possible sane, sensible and protective form of government? Why do we have to say that we will not meddle in the internal affairs? The Prime Minister has said that he supports the entirely legitimate aspirations of the Chinese people. Those aspirations were the aspirations felt before the tanks moved in. They are the aspirations which are now felt. Nothing has changed. All that has happened is that we have witnessed murder on a large scale. It is a large scale by our standards and a small scale by the standards of that Government which has killed many many times the number of people that were killed in Tiananmen Square. I ask: What has changed? The answer is, nothing. I say to this Government: the next time any question of democracy arises, be it in China, South Africa, Fiji or any other country, let us take the one view-that is, that democracy should be supported regardless of any other form of government and regardless of what we may see as our short term interests to go quietly when it comes to criticising a powerful nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to take up a point which was raised by the Leader of the Opposition. Chinese students will have until 31 July to stay in Australia. There are over 8,000 students, not all young people, in Australia. I would have thought that we would do one simple thing and say, `If you are afraid that you will be persecuted, imprisoned or killed when you return to China, then you may stay here because we will not send you back to such a hazard'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add a few words to what has been said by the speakers who preceded me. I agree with the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) that we should not be selective when we condemn barbarism wherever it happens, and that we should support democracy. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) said that the events that occurred in China, about which I am as shocked as anybody in this House, are the hallmark of communist regimes. He is probably forgetting everything that has occurred over the last 40 or 50 years. Barbarism and terrorism are not the hallmark only of communist regimes; they are the hallmark of any dictatorship, whether capitalist or communist. We have only to think about what went on 40 or 50 years ago in Germany, a capitalist country, a capitalist regime, and Italy under Mussolini. Thousands of patriots in Chile are being killed by a dictator. It is true that at night we do not see on our television screens the murderous death squads that we have seen on the streets of China.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we want to sound honest, sincere and genuine about these things, we should refuse to make any deals with a government such as the Chinese Government which is taking measures to kill the cream of its youth, in front of the whole world and in broad daylight, no matter what policies it has on trade and open government. Until the Government in China is replaced, I think we should refuse to deal with it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I noted the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), in his contribution to this debate, to the effect that the Government had shown no concern about the atrocities committed by the People's Liberation Army on the people of Tibet. I found that a cheap and unnecessary shot in this debate. In fact, it is wrong because, as members of this House would be aware, in a motion in this House this year I moved that this House condemn the action of the Chinese Government and the People's Liberation Army for the atrocities committed by them in Tibet. The House should not forget that many members of this Parliament, including members of the other place, signed a petition instigated by me condemning those actions in Tibet. That petition was presented by me to Mr Lu, the First Secretary to the Chinese Embassy, only a short time ago. Members of the Government, including Senator Gareth Evans, have made the concerns of this Government about those atrocities known to the Chinese Government and the Australian Government, quite frankly, has condemned the Chinese Government on the atrocities in Tibet. It was a cheap shot.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. When will the progressive tightening of monetary policy during the last 12 to 18 months bring about an improvement in our current account deficit?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The critical issue in the whole question of the current account is the change in the savings balance of Australia. The Government has done more than I think anyone in the House would have expected of it as far back as 1983-84 or 1985-86 to change the balance of savings in this country to facilitate a reduction in the current account deficit. In 1985-86 the current account deficit was around 6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), but in the period since we have seen a shift in the Budget balance of the Commonwealth of 5 percentage points of GDP and we have seen a 2 percentage-point lift in Australian private savings. In other words, we have had a 7 percentage-point change in the savings balance, which, all things being equal, should have been sufficient to have reduced a 6 percentage-point current account deficit to a surplus of one percentage point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that that has not happened because all things are not equal and we have had a concomitant lift in investment going the other way of about 4 percentage points of GDP. That has meant that the reduction in the current account deficit has not been that reduction which would otherwise have been implied by such a dramatic shift in savings, but a diminished reduction in the current account deficit of only 2 percentage points because of a call on savings by the private sector for investment of about 4 percentage points of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA> That leads one to the simple conclusion that we cannot afford a shift in investment or a call by the private sector of that dimension. Therefore, policy is now directed at cutting that call back; that is, monetary policy is now supplementing that work which fiscal policy has done in freeing up those 7 percentage points of savings overall which alone should have been sufficient to have done the job. Now monetary policy will cut back that call by the private sector on savings and it will do so, of course, in due course as it has its effect on those price sensitive areas of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA> Because domestic demand has been running at around 11 per cent of GDP and product growth has been running at around 5 per cent, about 5 or 6 percentage points of GDP has come as imports. Obviously that balance will shift as domestic demand changes. We have seen the enormous amplification of imports with a rise in domestic demand and on each and every occasion in the post-war years we have seen a big close-down in imports as domestic demand itself has closed down. So those goods which were formerly going to export and which are now consumed domestically will start to be put to export again as domestic demand moderates and as our competitiveness-we are now very competitive-allows us to ship goods and to import compete.</PARA>
<PARA> It is those fundamental features which will change the savings balance. But, as always in these questions, we get this sort of naivety as if the 7 percentage points of shift in the savings balance never occurred. The Opposition, in its analysis, overlooks the fact that there has been a 7 percentage-point shift in the savings balance in this country. That is what has been achieved. The dramatic improvement in the fundamentals, such as the profit share, the maintenance of wage restraint and the big shift in savings towards the private sector, has promoted a growth in private investment, the likes of which we have not seen. As good as that is by itself, it is too heavy and too strong for the current account; hence policy is aimed at cutting that back.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has not put any policy options on the table to deal with that problem.</PARA>

<PARA>The Opposition addresses them, but does not say how that will be done. It does not say whether the surplus will be bigger and in which way it will cut outlays or lift taxes to get it. He refers to a wages policy but specifies only a wages policy tied to productivity. He refers to having a steadier monetary policy. This is really a good line-`a steadier monetary policy'. It is not a tighter monetary policy or a looser monetary policy, but whatever it is-tight or loose-it will be steadier. He continued, `and we have got a whole schedule of micro-economic reform'. These are classic Peacock utterances. We get them every week. We had them when he was shadow Treasurer and we now have them from him as Leader of the Opposition, and we know why. Of course, nothing specific is added to this by the shadow Treasurer, because everything he has said on outlays has been countermanded by his fellow shadow Ministers on the front bench. As a consequence, the Opposition has no policy. Yet it persists in asking questions of a government which has established and maintained fundamental shifts in the savings balance.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I am aware that the New South Wales Government has announced plans to increase public hospital fees for private patients of the order which he has described. The Opposition does not seem to be aware of that fact, although it has been publicised in the press, because I have listened to two days of drivel in the Senate concerning the level of private insurance contribution rates-and not one mention was made of those planned increases, even though the single biggest factor generating increases in private health insurance contribution rates in New South Wales is the private patient charges in the public hospital system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The New South Wales Government has announced plans to increase the fee for standard private ward accommodation from $150 to $170 per day. This is a rise of 13.3 per cent which is almost twice the rate of inflation. It seems particularly hard to justify those increases when, only 12 months ago, the same Government increased charges by 15 per cent. So, in a period of 15 months, the Greiner Government has announced planned increases of 30 per cent in private charges in its public hospitals, which must feed through to the contribution rates. Another reason the Government is concerned is that these rates are distinctly higher-in many cases much higher-than the rates prevailing in all other States.</PARA>
<PARA> In a letter today I pointed out to the New South Wales Minister that, while that State has exclusive responsibility for setting those fees, the Commonwealth Government has responsibility to approve those fees for health insurance purposes. As I and honourable members on this side of the House have a genuine concern, unlike the pretended concern of the Opposition over the last few weeks in relation to the level of private insurance contribution rates, I have pointed out to the New South Wales Minister that I am very concerned about these proposals. Firstly, I am reluctant to approve proposals for health insurance fees which incorporate increases almost twice the rate of the consumer price index over the last 12 months; and, secondly, I am concerned at the effect of charges of this magnitude on private health contribution rates in New South Wales and the general destabilising effects of these proposals. Honourable members on both sides of the House, whatever the differences in their points of view, have all been arguing about the importance of having stability in private health insurance rates. We cannot get stability if we have a State government, such as the Greiner Government, increasing rates by 30 per cent in a period of some 15 months.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I have told the New South Wales Minister that I will not approve these fees until officers from both departments have gone carefully through and discussed fully all the implications of such increases in health insurance for the private hospital sector and for private patients in the public hospital system. That indication has been given to the New South Wales Government today. We, on this side of the House, have in the legislation that is now before the other place a clear commitment to stability and moderation in health insurance increases. Honourable members on the other side of the House pretend that they have an equal concern. The Greiner Government gives them the lie.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The New South Wales Government always talks about New South Wales Inc; it never thinks of government in terms of the community. This Government is shocked by the New South Wales Government's decision to close the power station and Huntley colliery. It is pretty galling in view of the fact that only in September last year the New South Wales Minister for Minerals and Energy, Mr Pickard, assured employees involved and the Commonwealth Government that the New South Wales Government had no intention of closing either operation. A press release was issued last September following a delegation led by the honourable member for Cunningham, the honourable member for Macarthur, and the honourable member for Throsby. The General Manager of the New South Wales Electricity Commission, when calming down the workers, reminded all staff that, on two separate occasions-one of which was a personal visit-the Minister for Mineral and Energy, Mr Pickard, had assured workers at Tallawarra power station and Huntley colliery that the Government had no intention of closing either the power station or the mine, but adjustments had to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Huntley work force responded magnificently to the demands that they reduce production costs following criticisms by the New South Wales Commission of Audit. The mine achieved cost reductions of the order of 30 per cent, mainly through voluntary retirement and the effects of the September 1988 work arrangements decision. Only in April this year the New South Wales Electricity Commission seemed to be of the view that the mine was fully competitive; it was exporting and it had got its costs right down.</PARA>
<PARA> If the New South Wales Electricity Commission, carrying out the bidding of the Minister, claims to have acted commercially in deciding to close the mine and the power station-as is evident from its press release-it should be asked why it did not act commercially in not seeking to sell these facilities. There is no evidence in the Electricity Commission's public announcements that this step was taken; it appears that it has just closed the mine. I get lots of lectures from the New South Wales Minister about what are State rights and what are proper arrangements between governments and I listen to those lectures. But he did not even have the dignity or the good grace to inform me of his decision to throw those 500 people on the scrap heap.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member's question provides me with an opportunity to reveal the great secret that he has a passionate interest in the visual and performing arts-an interest which the Government shares. In the current three-year period we will be expending some $450m on the capital program for higher education. In doing that, we will be recognising the very important contribution that the performing and visual arts make to Australia and to our educational system generally, the contribution they make not just to our cultural life, important as that is, but also, directly and indirectly, to the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is perhaps worth mentioning a tiny bit of history now. During our opponents' seven years in office a mere $10m was expended on the capital program and capital facilities for the arts generally within higher education. This Government, on the other hand, in 1989 has already committed some $28.6m, for instance, to the New South Wales Institute of the Arts for a permanent building in Albion Avenue. We are carrying out a very important program in conjunction with the New South Wales Government to restore and refurbish the former Rozelle Hospital for the Sydney College of the Arts at a cost of $11.5m; and there is a further project, worth just under $10m, at the Northern Rivers campus of the University of New England. That is a very important contribution in itself.</PARA>
<PARA> Later today we will confirm announcements and decisions to expend a further $30m during the next two years, which will include expenditure on developments at the University of Technology, Sydney, the University of Western Sydney, and the Macarthur Institute of Higher Education; and on a very important project at the arts city site in Melbourne which will bring together a large number of visual and performing arts activities, including the highly regarded Swinburne Film School. This means that approximately $60m has been committed to support the capital facilities of the arts generally, including design, in the higher education system. I should also mention that we have indicated to the Queensland Government that we are prepared to commit approximately $14m to the relocation of the Queensland Conservatorium on the condition that the Conservatorium can arrange an appropriate amalgamation with another institution. I understand that that objective is well advanced.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to recurrent funding, for the period from 1983 to 1989 an additional 4,000 places have been created for study in these areas. That is a 40 per cent increase which brings the total figure for capital and recurrent funding over the triennium to around $64m. This is a long-awaited improvement in the very high quality education that is provided in the arts. The only problem is that it is a commitment that only this Government can make because there is at least a $300m funding gap in our opponents' proposals. Therefore, commitments of this kind simply cannot be believed when made by them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;However, we recognise the fact that there are disparities in the distribution of employment growth both in New South Wales, which he specifically referred to, and in other parts of the nation. In part, this has occurred because of different levels of skill distribution and, of course, structural imbalances that exist within the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the regional situation in New South Wales, I am pleased to tell the House that employment growth overall has been quite strong; but, as I have indicated, there have been disparities in the rates of growth. I will illustrate by using the figures for the past three months. Employment rose by 2.2 per cent in the three months to April in Sydney overall; in the Illawarra and the south-eastern region, which includes Wollongong, employment rose by 4.4 per cent; and in the north coast region employment rose by 15.3 per cent. In other regions employment growth has not been as satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Government has not been sitting on its hands in the face of these sorts of statistics. We have introduced the Skillshare program and the Newstart program, which are specifically targeted to provide assistance to those areas which have the highest rates of long term unemployment. In addition, the Government has established the Office of Labour Market Adjustment, which is designed to address the labour market effects of structural adjustment at both the national and the regional levels. Within the Government, we have a preliminary working party examining the delivery of government services on a regional basis, and we are considering establishing a high level task force to address these issues further.</PARA>
<PARA> These issues are not solely the responsibility of the national Government; they are very keenly the responsibility of the State governments as well. With the sorts of activities carried out by the New South Wales Government which we heard of a few moments ago from my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy concerning the coalfields of the Illawarra area, is it any wonder that the difficulties the honourable member for Reid has referred to exist in that State?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. I am glad to be able to advise the House that, following an exhaustive examination of the Fishermans Bend site, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation is satisfied that the levels of radiation inside the buildings on that site are at acceptably safe levels. There were extractions from various ores on the site between 1941 and 1964, and it is possible that if there has been any operating at unacceptable levels-because in those days people were not quite so sensitive about things like radioactivity-it would involve people who worked on the site up until 1964. However, there is nothing to indicate that since 1964 there has been an unacceptable risk to health. The level of exposure is about the same as one would get from a number of pieces of industrial equipment to be found in factories throughout Australia. About 40 people worked in that area prior to 1964, and health follow-up will be provided as appropriate for those people. Low level site contamination has been found at 10 locations, including underneath two small buildings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The recommended clean-up procedures, if fully implemented, could result in 200 to 300 cubic metres of material being moved off site-the equivalent of about 15 semitrailer loads. At the moment CSIRO and ANSTO are examining options for removal and safe storage of that material. While ANSTO does not consider the operation to be technically complex or hazardous, the logistics will need careful management because of the sensitive nature of the problem. Essentially, ANSTO found that there was a significant area of contaminated soil, principally under a sealed car park. There is also a storage area, or a cupboard in one building, and a gardener's shed which had what we would regard as unusually high levels of radiation. Perhaps in some previous period significant amounts of material were stored there. I am glad to say that the situation appears to be much less serious than was feared some time ago, and I am grateful to ANSTO for its very thorough and comprehensive report. I have also directed that the report be made public. We have nothing to hide and I hope that honourable members will take an opportunity to read the report.</PARA>

It is not a proposal which has any merit or sense in it at all. It would do nothing obviously to assist the situation of the people in China, and our major concern as a Government and as a country must be, I believe, to take those courses of action which are calculated to create a situation where the previous sorts of reforms being undertaken in China can be proceeded with, and a situation where there will be a repudiation by the leadership in China of the policies it has embraced over recent weeks. There is no conceivable way that the course of action suggested by the honourable gentleman in his question could have any such beneficial effect in that direction. It would be a negative complication. It is not something which has been suggested or contemplated, as far as I am aware, by any of our friends in the West. No-one has contemplated that and, if I may say so without being too offensive, it is manifestly an irrelevant and illogical suggestion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. He will be aware that, subject to an unsuccessful Federal Court appeal, Mr Buschmann was deported on Sunday, 11 June. It should be pointed out to the House that Mr Buschmann's deportation involved false statements on his visa application; it was not in any way related to his alleged activities in Chile. It should also be pointed out that prior to deportation, and that action being commenced, Mr Buschmann's supporters were counselled that in the Department's view the best course of action would have been for him to depart voluntarily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Buschmann had, in discussions about the manner of his deportation, expressed concerns about his personal security. He was offered a choice of flights back to Sweden and decided to return via Tokyo and Amsterdam. We have now received advice that the flight did in fact land at Anchorage, where Mr Buschmann and his Australian resident travelling companion were detained by United States authorities. At this time it is unclear on what basis they were actually detained. The Government has instructed our Embassy in Washington to raise these matters with the United States Administration. The Government, through my colleague the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, has made strong representations to the United States at senior levels, expressing the view that the Australian deportation of Buschmann, taken after legal proceedings in Australian courts, should not be interfered with and that he should be allowed to continue his journey to Sweden, where he has resident status.</PARA>

We have a combination of tight fiscal, wages and monetary policies to deal with a position where the Australian economy is operating at an unsustainably high level of activity which is attracting with it a level of imports which is unsustainable. Therefore, all arms of policy must be kept tight if we are not, in the alternative, to have a situation in which the Australian dollar would collapse and interest rates would go through the roof, and there would be a recession.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Corio for his question without notice. I think it is terribly regrettable that some expositions are made by some people opposite and other commentators which would imply that every Australian family and pensioners have some degree of responsibility for Australia's overseas debt. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the process of those sorts of fear campaigns and suggestions being made, comparisons are made between Australia's debt position and that of countries such as Argentina and Mexico. Those sorts of comparisons are thrown around recklessly and without any foundation whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation is that Australia's net foreign debt amounts to 31.6 per cent of gross domestic product, GDP, which is down from the 32.4 per cent of a year ago. There is absolutely no comparison to be made with the countries that are mentioned in this sort of stupid nonsense that is peddled by the Opposition. In the case of Argentina and Mexico, their foreign debt is of the order of 70 to 80 per cent of their GDP, as against the much lower proportion in Australia. The other major distinction between Australia and those countries is that in their cases it is debt which is substantially owed by government, whereas in the composition of Australia's debt the honourable gentleman will see the total absence of any basis of fact for the frightening suggestions that are made.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the composition of Australia's net debt. Who owes it? The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics statistics-those for the December quarter of 1988-show these simple irrefutable facts. The private sector owes 61 per cent of Australia's net foreign debt; the States owe 14 per cent; and Commonwealth and State authorities owe 25 per cent. There is no net debt at all owed by the Government of Australia. Those are the facts. Either those on the other side of the House, who would say to every Australian family and every pensioner, `You have this debt hanging over you', are ignorant, which would not be entirely surprising, or it is a deliberate attempt to misrepresent and intimidate the pensioners and others in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the Commonwealth Government owes no debt. In fact, because the Commonwealth Government has pursued the tight fiscal policies it has over recent years, we have had no borrowing on behalf of the Commonwealth Government since March 1987 and in the period since then we have been repaying debt. In that way we have reduced the public sector borrowing requirement to zero and we have reduced the level of national indebtedness. We have not been prepared to rest on our laurels. Not only have we conducted the tight fiscal policy in regard to our own budgetary decisions, but in the most recent Premiers Conference we announced cuts of around $1.2 billion off the approved borrowing limits for Commonwealth statutory authorities and about another $1 billion off the borrowings by the States.</PARA>
<PARA> So, the facts are very simple. The overwhelming proportion of the debt is owed by the private sector, and that represents decisions which have been taken by commercial enterprises in this country on the basis that with that borrowing they will be able to undertake enterprises which will generate an income which will give them profit and the capacity to meet their indebtedness. Those are the facts. I repeat that no debt is owed by the Commonwealth Government of Australia, and therefore those on the other side-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In October 1987 the Government unveiled its policy to bring to an end 35 years of detailed economic regulation of domestic aviation. At the same time we announced significant changes to international passenger and air freight charter policies. It remained to complete a review of the aviation area by reassessing our approach to scheduled international services. International air services throughout the world are established and operated within a complex network of bilateral intergovernmental agreements. Typically, these agreements cover the airlines that may fly on particular routes, the aircraft types and number of services to be operated, and the fares and rates to be charged on these services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia is part of this worldwide network of bilateral air service agreements. We have 27 such agreements with other countries, with one new agreement pending. Worldwide, there are over 2,000 air agreements in place between individual countries. Air services between pairs of countries are expanded when their governments trade aviation rights, leading to additional commercial traffic points and increased numbers of services. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Australian context, in the time of this Government the expansion in aviation rights has been enormous. Fourteen new international airlines have commenced services to Australia, and an additional 4.9 million airlines seats have been introduced by Qantas Airways Ltd and other airlines into and out of Australia. It was not the Government's intention, in reviewing international aviation policy, to change Australia's participation in the worldwide bilateral network. Big changes are occurring in international aviation, however, and the competition is getting considerably tougher. The so-called `megacarriers' are becoming more predominant, integrated marketing agreements between global carriers are emerging and the development of powerful computer reservation systems can give airlines dominant market power. The system of bilateral trading in these circumstances ensures Qantas's participation in world aviation markets and thus guarantees our share of world aviation revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government chose to examine Australia's approach to negotiating air service agreements to ensure that we are getting the best possible deal. It rejected the simple notion of Australia's adoption of an `open skies' policy under which any foreign airline could fly to Australia even if its government denied the Australian carrier a fair chance to compete on an equal basis. No country of any aviation standing, or any of our bilateral aviation partners, has adopted such an approach by unilaterally deregulating landing rights for foreign carriers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's review was particularly prompted by a surge in inbound tourism last financial year. Because seats were scarce, not everyone who wanted to travel to Australia was able to do so. The Government was determined to ensure that Australia's approach to negotiating aviation rights was able to meet the growing demand for travel. Historically, the interests of Qantas were the predominant factor when the Government was considering entering into new air service agreements with foreign governments or amending existing ones. The reason was clear: in the past the bulk of Australia's international aviation market was derived from carrying Australians into and out of the country. If Australia had allowed these services to be swamped by foreign airlines there would have been little incentive for those airlines to develop tourism to Australia, and we would have lost significant overseas earnings for our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Good reason though there may have been for the approaches of the past, the fact was that the emphasis was on trading `like for like' benefits. Access to Australian cities for foreign carriers often depended on Qantas being granted access to similar-sized cities overseas. Indeed, access has sometimes been refused to a foreign carrier where our own did not have an interest in flying to its country. But this approach no longer maximises our national interest. Australia is now a major tourist and business destination in its own right. In some cases the approaches which served the country well when our markets were smaller and different are simply no longer appropriate. We now have a variety of markets-some with very high growth rates such as Japan where the number of tourists increased by 64 per cent in 1988 over the previous year. Our share of international traffic generally is growing at a much faster rate than that of the rest of the world. Between 1987 and 1988 the number of tourists arriving in Australia increased by 26 per cent compared with a world growth rate of 9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Tourism Research has estimated that overseas tourists accounted for 1.4 per cent of gross domestic product in 1987-88, and, directly or indirectly, some 103,000 jobs. It also estimates that in the same year revenue from overseas visitors contributed $4.8 billion to the Australian economy. While undoubtedly there are costs involved in earning the tourist dollar, foreign spending in Australia is expanding the services provided by the hotel, restaurant, entertainment and transport sectors. The effects of this expansion in output and employment are in turn transmitted throughout the economy as the industries directly affected by the increased tourist spending in turn purchase services from other Australian industries. </PARA>
<PARA> An important objective in our negotiating strategy therefore must be to increase net earnings from inbound tourism, along with flow-on benefits to industries servicing the tourism sector. On the other hand, the views of Qantas remain important. Qantas's own contribution to Australia's economy and balance of payments, through its enormous overseas earnings, is significant-some $1.9 billion in 1987-88. It is also a major promoter of Australia as a destination for tourists. </PARA>
<PARA> What has to be struck is a balance. The review suggested a number of ways in which our approach could be broadened so that in negotiating air services agreements with other nations we secure the best balance of overall benefits for Australia, including a bigger slice of the world's tourism and trade, as well as advancing Qantas's ability to compete in the expanding international market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accordingly decided that, while seeking to win rights for Qantas to serve a wider range of destinations and build a more sophisticated network of services, it will also:</PARA>
<PARA> include a wider range of views in determining our negotiating strategies, particularly tourism and trade views as well as those of Qantas;</PARA>
<PARA> demonstrate a readiness to encourage new services by foreign carriers where these will lead to improved tourism and trade opportunities for Australia generally;</PARA>
<PARA> promote growth and competition by developing arrangements with other countries giving airlines greater commercial freedom to introduce new services and respond more quickly to market demand;</PARA>
<PARA> examine the benefits that could flow from a separate Australian international airline operating scheduled cargo services; and</PARA>
<PARA> highlight to foreign carriers the opportunities for serving the full range of Australian gateways, whilst recognising that Sydney will remain an attractive destination. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government will continue to:</PARA>
<PARA> maintain a flexible approach to international passenger charters in the interests of promoting inbound tourism;</PARA>
<PARA> approve supplementary services promptly to enable airlines to cater for surges in demand; and</PARA>
<PARA> exercise minimal control over air fares. </PARA>
<PARA>More Liberal Approach</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Taken together these measures represent a significant change of approach. This could be described as a more hard-headed economic approach to air services, and fuller analysis of where to capture the economic and other benefits for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> A strictly reciprocal exchange of entitlements will no longer apply. Instead we might well give new services to a foreign carrier where Australia can win realisable longer term benefits of increased tourism, or flights for the foreign carrier might be traded for access to new destinations for the Australian carrier, even where Qantas may not plan to use those rights for some time. This is likely to mean greater receptiveness to requests by foreign carriers to fly to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Overseas airlines should not expect that Australia will give them a free ride. We are proposing a more liberal approach to the trading of aviation rights, certainly; but what is in it for Australia as a whole will be the dominant consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>More Flexible Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> To promote growth and competition, the Government will push for more flexible arrangements with other countries to give airlines greater commercial freedom to introduce new services and to respond more quickly to market demand. Wherever possible Australia is renegotiating air services agreements and arrangements in a forward looking manner. For instance, we are now agreeing increased flights one to two years ahead of current requirements. This means more certainty for the airlines to meet demand quickly-and it means less intervention by governments in this process. </PARA>
<PARA> This approach is particularly appropriate in growing markets-for example, Thailand, Singapore and Japan. Consequently, on the Australia-Thailand route five additional B747 services can now be brought on by the airlines at any time. On the Japan route up to an additional eight B747 services can be operated from October this year and through 1990. Similarly, on the Singapore route there is provision for another eight B747 services to commence from October through next year. Moreover, as recently as last week, we reached agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany to permit an additional four B747 services per week to operate from April next year. From April 1991 a further two services a week will be permitted, thus allowing Qantas and Lufthansa to offer a combined total of 14 flights a week between Australia and West Germany from that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The advantages of a more flexible approach to airline services are already proving successful in overcoming seat shortages created by seasonal peaks. Airlines need to know that they will be able to operate more services during peak periods such as the northern summer, Christmas and school holidays to meet the additional demand for seats. The Government will continue its policy of giving prompt approval to airlines applying for supplementary services in peak periods. This will allow carriers to plan additional services with confidence, and it gives travellers certainty in obtaining seats when they wish to travel. </PARA>
<PARA> During the 1988-89 peak period the Government approved some 500 additional air services, representing a 31 per cent increase in flights over the 1987-88 peak. This was in addition to the services which carriers were already operating. These supplementary services eased the difficulties faced by air travellers in making forward bookings at this time. They also provided a large boost to the economy by ensuring that airlines were able to carry as many passengers as possible into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Freight</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Air freight has growing importance for the economy and for Australian exporters, and since 1983 we have progressively liberalised freight services. Over 90 per cent of air freight capacity operated to and from Australia is on scheduled passenger aircraft. In the last couple of years this capacity has increased by a staggering 260 per cent to an annual total of approximately 735,000 tonnes. Scheduled pure freighter capacity has also recorded substantial growth in the order of 60 per cent since 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Six scheduled carriers now operate dedicated international air freight services into and/or out of Australia from West Germany, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and the United States of America, but Australia does not have a dedicated pure freight operation in its own right. In some markets Qantas buys space on the freight aircraft of other airlines, and in other cases it leases freight aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> In announcing the deregulation of domestic aviation in October 1987, the Government indicated that its policy of maintaining Qantas as Australia's sole international scheduled carrier would continue for the foreseeable future. However, the Government is now considering whether different arrangements could apply to freight, as distinct from passenger services. Another important step was taken in 1987 when this Government removed restrictions on the operation of freight charter flights and allowed the carriage of any type of cargo in any mix into and out of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result we believe Australia now has one of the most liberal air freight charter policies in the world. In 1988, the first full year after this initiative, the number of freight charters approved increased 50 per cent over the number operated in the previous year. A full review will be undertaken later this year to assess overall results and the scope for further opportunities. Preliminary results indicate Australian exporters have benefited from the liberalisation of freight charter policy and from the substantial increase in freight space available on scheduled passenger services. Nevertheless, some exporters of primary produce, particularly in Victoria and Western Australia, continue to experience difficulties with existing scheduled services. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interests of seeing whether further gains in the freight area might be made, the Government has decided to examine the costs and benefits of allowing a separate Australian international airline to operate schedule cargo services. This study will be completed by October 1989 concurrently with the Government's review of the operation of its air freight charter policy. To assist in examining this concept, the Government will shortly advertise for expressions of interest from Australian carriers wishing to operate scheduled air freight services to and from Australia. In weighing up the costs and benefits, particular attention will be given to the volume of demand, frequency of services and the destinations likely to be required by export industries, as identified by the expressions of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Also relevant is the possible cost to Australia of securing agreement from other governments for a separate Australian carrier to operate over such routes. On the plus side, the benefits could provide a better service for Australian exporters by providing a greater choice of freight carriers and services offered. </PARA>
<PARA>Smaller Gateways</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In spreading the benefits of air services as broadly as possible, the Government acknowledges that it has a role in encouraging both scheduled and charter air services to all of Australia's international gateways. The Government has already introduced measures to assist smaller gateways in attracting international air services-specifically, the reform of its international passenger charter policy and the removal of restrictions preventing Qantas from carrying international passengers of other overseas airlines on its services between cities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In its review of international passenger charter policy in 1987, the Government significantly broadened the categories of charter traffic able to fly to Australia. These changes were aimed at increasing inbound tourism and encouraging the development of air services at smaller gateways. Over 150 major inbound tourist charter flights have been approved since October 1987. This represents an increase of 21 per cent over the similar period before October 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Smaller gateways have benefited from these services. The United Kingdom airline Britannia Airways operated charter services to Cairns and Perth over the 1988-89 Australian summer period. After a successful season Britannia has received approval for an expanded charter program for 1989-90. After operating charter services to Sydney and Melbourne in 1988, the Polish Airline LOT increased its charters to Australia in 1989 to include services to Brisbane and Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government encourages airlines to operate to smaller gateways, local communities also must play a role. The most effective means of attracting carriers to smaller gateways is through local promotion. No-one can force foreign carriers, whether they are scheduled or charter operators, to fly to a particular destination, and ultimately it is up to State and local authorities and the tourist industry to convince foreign carriers of the commercial attractiveness of their individual gateway. </PARA>
<PARA> Active promotion by north Queensland of its region has led to a rapid increase in international services. As a result, Cairns is now recognised internationally as a highly desirable tourist destination, and attracts interest in its own right by foreign carriers. Twenty-three international flights now operate each week through Cairns and the number of international passengers using the airport increased by 88 per cent in 1988 over the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA>A Changing World</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Having achieved strong growth levels on all its major routes, Australia must maintain and build on them. This has to be done in a rapidly changing international environment. Developments in Europe towards a single market in 1992 will make European Economic Community carriers much more competitive against foreign airlines. Qantas therefore needs the flexibility to respond to this changing regime in order to continue to compete. In our own Asia-Pacific region, our national carrier faces great challenges and even greater opportunities. In this region demand for international air travel is growing faster than anywhere else in the world. According to the World Tourism Organisation, growth in the Pacific Basin region was 18 per cent in 1988 compared with a world growth rate of almost 9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas has access to most of the major markets in Asia and the Pacific, and hopes to open new services to the Republic of Korea shortly. The Australian carrier needs improved rights to enable it to build a more comprehensive network of services in these markets. The recent purchase of Air New Zealand by Qantas and a group of Pacific basin carriers shows the potential for the development of a market alliance in our region. Many carriers are rationalising their operations by concentrating their services on a central `hub' from where feeder services ferry passengers to and from other destinations. Further afield, Qantas's future operating strategy in Europe is likely to be dependent upon its use of `hubs' at London and Frankfurt, using its own rights in combination with those of other airlines to serve and develop markets beyond these cities. These are just some of the responses that must be made by Australia to keep pace with changes world wide. The Government considers it vital to ensure that Australia keeps abreast of emerging changes in the international aviation environment, and can respond effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>Minimal Price Control</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Australia has one of the most liberal pricing regimes in the world, and the Government approach since the early 1980s has been to stay out of pricing matters, leaving carriers as free as possible to set fares in response to market conditions. As a result, a great variety of international fare types are available in Australia, and fares on most routes have dropped in real terms over many years. The benefits to the Australian consumer are obvious, and the Government will further reduce involvement in price control by simplifying the air navigation regulation that deals with international air fares to the minimum necessary, and by doing away with outdated enforcement provisions before the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Australia will broaden its approach to individual aviation negotiations by placing weight on the national benefits that can arise from enhanced tourism and trade opportunities, as well as the benefits that can arise for Qantas. We want to encourage foreign airlines who are willing and able to concentrate their marketing efforts on promoting inbound tourism to Australia, and we will give favourable consideration to proposals from airlines which are directed towards boosting inbound tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the thriving inbound traffic flows from Japan, the United States of America and New Zealand, Australia hopes to build bigger flows from Europe and South East Asia as well. Minimising barriers to foreign carriers will assist in maintaining the growth of tourism and maximising the benefits to Australia overall. At the same time, securing realistic benefits in return for the Australian carrier overseas will mean increased opportunities for participation by Qantas in foreign markets, and will guarantee Australia's role as a significant force in world aviation as we enter the 1990s. I commend the statement to the House and I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes this initial move to the major reformation of Australian international aviation. We welcome the presentation of the paper International Aviation: Maximising the Benefits, a long-awaited paper which we on this side of the House expected would be presented as long ago as last February. I suppose it is not without significance that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) made his statement today, on the very day on which the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) has presented its draft report on travel and tourism. That draft report must be one of the most incredibly perceptive and condemnatory documents ever levelled by a government organisation at the aviation policies that have been followed in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at that document we will see the reason why it was essential that the Minister make his statement to the House and why it is absolutely essential that the Government implement its reform program as soon as possible. The IAC has identified two major points. The first point is that the Australian and overseas travelling public have been ripped off to the tune of 20 per cent for years. It states that the air fares operating to, from and within Australia are 20 per cent too high. More importantly, the report indicates that the cost to gross domestic product of our aviation policies, both international and domestic, is as much as $650m annually. I will quote from a short section of the report:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's analysis has shown that Australia is worse off because of the restrictions on the capacity of airlines to carry passengers. International air fares are of the order of 20 per cent higher than need be; and this ends up costing Australians $40m annually in GDP, and $200m in real aggregate consumption. These losses are principally due to the consumption losses that Australians face. Consumers cannot travel as much, and they cannot purchase as many other goods and services. Australia is worse off if the agreements have raised fares by anything more than a mere 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> These figures do not account for the loss of inbound tourism as a result of higher fares. With fares 20 per cent higher than they need be, the loss of inbound tourism could be costing Australia a further $450m in GDP. </PARA>
<PARA>The Industries Assistance Commission gives a similar summary regarding domestic aviation. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has estimated that the current restrictions on domestic aviation are costing the Australian community about $150m annually in GDP and $120m in real aggregate consumption. This has been evaluated on the basis that the efficiency of domestic aviation would improve by 10 per cent in a less regulated environment. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the story: for years we have managed to have a protected international air fare regime on the basis of protecting the interests of Qantas Airways Ltd. Historically, that has probably been the right decision. But in the last decade things have changed dramatically. Millions and millions of dollars have been invested in tourism infrastructure, but we have not had the airline seats to bring people in to take advantage of that investment in tourism infrastructure. In that respect the Opposition welcomes the fact that we will see at least some changes in the international aviation regime. For years, the real problem with the tourist industry in Australia was our physical location. The biggest impediment was the tyranny of distance. In recent years the biggest impediment has been the tyranny of the high international air fare. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at some of the air fare regimes that exist at the moment to and from Australia, we get a pretty fair indication of what is occurring. For example, the fares between Australia and Japan have traditionally been amongst the highest in the world. It seems crazy to me that at a time when that route has provided our greatest growth area, with full aircraft operating between Tokyo and Australia and when every fifth and sixth freedom carrier operating to and from Australia is full, we have not enabled the opening up of more seats on the route. I welcome the news that provision will be made for some further capacity on that route. Apart from the fast growing routes of Hong Kong to Australia and Japan to Australia, there has been amazing growth in recent times in tourism out of Europe. I believe that potentially Europe must be one of the largest growth markets for Australian tourism. Indeed, it is one of the fastest growing markets for tourism into northern Australia. I hope that we will now see a much more liberal approach to a number of those European carriers which have indicated over the years that they wanted to come to Australia or that they wanted to increase their number of flights into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> European tourists are our biggest spenders. It is all very well to talk about what the Japanese spend. They do spend a lot of money in Australia, but the plain fact is that the Europeans use our infrastructure more. They use our restaurants more; they use our hotels more. This sort of expenditure provides the capacity to create jobs for our kids. Let us make no bones about it: the only industry in Australia at the moment that has the capacity to provide big job numbers is the tourist industry. I have said so many times in this House and in debates such as this one on international aviation that we should never forget the fact that every time we increase the net number of international visitors by 25,000 we create another 1,400 jobs for our kids. In recent years the tight availability of seats has not allowed employment growth for our young people within industry to take off to the extent that it should. Although the IAC report indicates that there might be a few problems in providing highly skilled labour for the tourist industry it does say that the present training programs are such that they can accommodate rather large numbers of increased international visitors. </PARA>
<PARA> I really welcome the Minister's statement that in future when international air rights are negotiated they will include a wider range of views in determining our negotiating strategies, particularly tourism and trade views as well as those of Qantas. If there has been one major criticism of governments of both political persuasions it is that in terms of the bureaucratic negotiations of the air rights those vital sectors of the industry have been left out. As I go around the tourism industry around Australia I find that more and more tourism bodies are expressing a real sense of frustration that they have not had an input into what should happen in terms of expanding our air rights. In a meeting as recently as a fortnight ago the Brisbane tourism association expressed a great deal of frustration that the negotiations with Korea had reached a stage that they thought the Koreans had almost given up any hope of being able to operate in Australia. I am pleased that the Minister has indicated that we will soon have some rights available between Australia and Korea. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also pleased that the Minister has said that if air rights are negotiated it does not necessarily mean that Qantas has to operate on that particular route. One of the great problems we have faced is the fact that it has almost been a necessity for us to be able to provide mutual services by both carriers before those agreements can be finalised and can go ahead. I cite as an example the recent protracted negotiations with Lauda Air, the Austrian carrier which had one flight to Australia and wanted a second flight. It has experienced some frustrations in getting that second flight. I understand that it has been solved now. It seems crazy to me that we have a number of air rights in operations that are not used. It would seem that they have not been used because Qantas does not have the equipment or the desire to operate on those particular routes. That is not a correct situation to have either. Qantas has had rights to Vienna for donkey's years. The fact that it does not use the rights does not mean that the Australian industry should be deprived of tourists who want to come out of Austria on direct services to spend their money within the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week in Canberra I was very pleased that the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding), with his new responsibility for tourism, invited me to meet with the Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation of Egypt. It was significant that the Egyptian Minister in his speech-he was here trying to get some interest in reviving air services between Australia and Egypt-cited the fact that the air agreement was signed by King Farouk way back in 1951. It had been sitting there and the rights had not been used since that time. One wonders just what sort of tourism traffic we might get out of Egypt. There is certainly quite a large section of the population of Egypt who travel. We should never close our minds to the fact that we have the capacity of fifth and sixth freedom traffic carriers to build the numbers coming into Australia. I would imagine that Egypt Air would be in that European market ferreting around for every passenger it could possibly get on the long haul service to Australia. One would think that in a case like this such a carrier would make a contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the point that the Minister has made that Qantas does not necessarily have to operate on that particular route, one of the things raised in the IAC report released today is the fact that we should be looking at giving other Australian carriers international rights. While in some cases that might be a problem in terms of the bilateral agreements, on a number of our bilateral agreements we do have provision for a second carrier other than Qantas to go into those areas. I would think that is one particular area that the Government should examine very closely indeed. It is true that Qantas is primarily a long haul carrier. Qantas has the equipment for long haul routes. In many respects there are regional routes around the place that the domestic airlines could slot into very well indeed. That could be part of an overall policy and reaffirmation of the present situation by giving Qantas access to the domestic routes as a trade-off to allowing the present carriers rights to operate on those areas in which Qantas does not operate at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> There must be some concern that the Minister's statement did not make any direct comment regarding the present situation that Qantas faces. It has had to cancel a number of services, particularly into Queensland. I understand that more than 50,000 seats will not be available in and out of Queensland this year as a result of those reductions in services. It is going on in other States as well. We recognise the real problem that Qantas has at the moment, not only in being able to provide its own maintenance but in the shortage of aircraft. Whilst not wishing to cause the Government any embarrassment by trying to open up the privatisation debate, the other interesting thing that the IAC alluded to in its report was the real necessity to look at the funding aspect of Qantas, and perhaps the privatisation of it, if it were going to continue to grow and maintain itself as a very real force in the international aviation industry. The report made particular reference to the problems that Australian airlines face as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to see that the Government is going to maintain the flexible approach to the situation of charters. There has been a growth in the charter market. I think it has been welcomed. It certainly has had a tremendous effect in north Queensland, and no doubt in Perth as well. What we never seem to realise in this country is that in purely tourism terms more passengers are carried by charter operators out of Europe for holiday purposes than on any of the scheduled airlines. To a great extent that situation can be taken as read in a number of other areas of the world as well. In the United States there are massive charter operators that we have never really bothered to tap. There is a huge charter operator in Canada who looked here but thought it was all too hard and ultimately decided not to go ahead with its application. There is a future for charters on pure tourism traffic. Charter operators have the capacity to be able to provide low fares. As the IAC report rightly pointed out, low fares are one of the real problems that we have in and out of Australia. It cites as an example that Qantas's operating costs are about 30 per cent higher than some of the more efficient operators. That is probably true. But if we look at some of the fares that are available on the long haul-we are looking at return fares to Australia from the United Kingdom of about $1,000-we can see the tremendous difference and incentive for people to fly on charter airlines to come here for holidays. I would hope that we would give every encouragement to some of those great world charter operators to come into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no mention in this report about what would happen in the case of dual operators operating on some of those present routes. I have been reading with interest the fact that Virgin Atlantic Airlines has approval, in principle, to operate between the United Kingdom and Australia. Virgin Atlantic is a low cost operator. To a great extent it took over from the old Laker services across the north Atlantic. It has had a tremendous growth in the area in which it has operated. It has had the capacity to reach a whole new market. When Sir Freddie Laker appeared before the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism he referred to the have nots. He was right. They are the people who do not have the money to pay the high fares to come to a place such as Australia, especially on a long haul route. The have nots are a huge market. They have a great capacity to service the visiting friends and relatives market which, surprisingly, are big spenders when it comes to tourism. I would hope that we would look at some of what we might loosely be able to label the scheduled charter operators to be allowed into Australia as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I would like to take up is the statement by the Minister about encouraging the airports in some of the lesser populated areas of Australia to go out and attract international air services to the smaller gateways. I say with some sense of pride, but quite humbly I hope, that I was a member of the Cairns task force which went around the world in 1983 and 1984 drumming up services for Cairns International Airport. Apart from the fact that it was hard work, it was a great learning experience for me. One of the things that I did learn was just how important it is for an airport to be independent in drumming up business. I spoke to a number of airport authorities, including the one at Manchester. At that stage Manchester was virtually the only non-government airport in the United Kingdom. Although Manchester probably did not have too much to attract major international operators, the airport authority there decided it would go after the business. It managed to get most of the major charter operators to operate to and from Manchester, which was important, and built up a whole new industry around that city. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most fascinating things that happened in Manchester was the turning of the Manchester Airport into a profit-making centre. It would be the most commercial airport operation I have ever seen in my life, at no cost to taxpayers at all. That airport contains shopping centres, about seven restaurants, picture theatres and poker machines. It even has a sky-fry on the roof, which is the local version of McDonalds, where people take their kids on a Sunday afternoon and buy them lunch or afternoon tea and watch the planes go by. That is a whole new industry. </PARA>
<PARA> One would hope that with the loosening up of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) we will be able to get some entrepreneurial spirit in those areas as well. When we get into government and privatise the FAC, I suggest that we should look at making sure that the FAC has the capacity to turn itself into a commercial operation and in fact go out and hunt down business. It is amazing where that business can be found if one looks for it. If we do manage to get into place a more pragmatic and more acceptable international air fare regime, there is no reason why cities such as Cairns, Perth and Adelaide, and maybe even Rockhampton, cannot send representatives out into the world to look at the sorts of markets that they can promote. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only a minute or two left to debate this comprehensive statement that the Minister has made. I now refer to the deregulation of the freight market and the proposition that the Government is looking at, that is, the possibility of starting up an independent air freight operation. I think that would be welcomed around Australia because there has been a great deal of concern expressed for a long time about the inability of a number of primary producers to get their freight to some international markets. As we are looking for every hard earned dollar that we can possibly get to boost our balance of payments, it seems crazy to me that primary producers in places such as Tasmania-the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) has approached me on a number of occasions about this-find it almost impossible to air freight their primary products to the South East Asian markets. Primary producers in South Australia have been concerned about the availability of space. I think there would be tremendous possibilities for us of developing some of those international markets. We hope that the Government will see the sense, before October if possible, of throwing open that area to see whether we can get a dedicated freight operator to operate from Australia to these markets. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of my comments, the Opposition welcomes this statement as a first move in the major reformation of Australia's international aviation industry. We see it as the beginning of what we would hope would be a much more open regime, a regime that would allow the free flow of passengers into Australia and which would allow the Australian tourist industry to receive the full benefit of the expenditure of tourism dollars. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The purpose of this statement is to outline the Government's decisions on the higher education capital works program for 1990 and 1991, and allocations from the national priority fund for 1989. I will also summarise the significant reforms to Australia's higher education system which have been effected in the past 18 months. Honourable members will be aware that when I announced decisions on higher education funding for the 1989-91 triennium, it was not possible to allocate capital works funding for 1990 and 1991 due to the significant process of restructuring involving almost every higher education institution in Australia. The extent of the restructuring process required detailed discussion between the Commonwealth Government and institutions. Accordingly, I established a task force on amalgamations. The task force reported to me in April. That report provided the basis for supplementary decisions on higher education funding for the 1989-91 triennium. They follow decisions on recurrent funding for 1989-91, and the 1989 capital program which I announced last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me now briefly outline the future structure and character of Australia's higher education system. It will be evident to honourable members that it will be a radically different system from that which we have come to know. In short, the landscape of higher education in Australia will be transformed. As a result of the restructuring process set in train by the Government, and of decisions made by institutions and State governments, the number of institutions will be reduced by half, from the current 72 to around 35. Most of these institutions will be universities. More importantly, they will be a new kind of university, drawing on the traditional universities, but also incorporating the strengths of the former college sector. They will be larger and stronger institutions. This transformation will occur because almost every university, particularly the larger universities in the capital cities, will merge with one, or more, colleges of advanced education. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has created the environment, and provided the opportunities and incentives, for this restructuring to occur. It has urged institutions and State governments to consider the benefits of the establishment of larger higher education institutions. However, the Government has not dictated how institutions should respond. It has not drawn up a list of institutions which, in its view, should merge, nor has it proposed any funding reductions for those institutions which choose not to merge. </PARA>
<PARA> Our predecessors in 1981, arbitrarily and without consultation with any of the institutions concerned, forced mergers on a large number of institutions and cut funding in anticipation of savings resulting from the mergers. Not surprisingly, that approach adopted by the previous Government left a legacy of underfunded institutions, some of which had difficulties in establishing a coherent direction despite the best efforts of those working in the institutions to make the best of bad decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of contrast, this Government has explicitly stated that it will support only mergers which have the support of the institutions concerned. It has said that savings resulting from the mergers will be retained by the institutions and it has provided assistance to institutions in meeting the initial costs of amalgamation. There have been lengthy, detailed and some may say protracted discussions between institutions. They have identified the benefits which will flow from mergers. They have also identified the difficulties and problems which will inevitably arise in any restructuring process of this magnitude. They have sought solutions to those problems. They have asked and received support and advice from the Commonwealth in that process. As a result of agreements which have been reached by institutions, a new pattern of higher education in Australia has now emerged. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is now able to make decisions on the higher education capital program for 1990 and 1991 and on allocations from the national reserve fund. Details of these decisions are contained in the funding statement, but in short:</PARA>
<PARA>79 new capital projects worth some $314m will be commenced in 1990 and 1991, bringing the number of major new projects to commence during the 1989-91 triennium to 128. These projects represent a total Commonwealth capital commitment of some $550m;</PARA>
<PARA>$20m has been provided during 1989 for renovation to assist institutions to meet urgent needs for refurbishment of run-down facilities;</PARA>
<PARA>$19.5m will be provided in 1989 and 1990 to assist with the initial costs of mergers. Assistance will also be provided to institutions which are still considering merger options;</PARA>
<PARA>$2m will be provided to support some 20 projects aimed at improving quality and equity in our higher education institutions; and</PARA>
<PARA>$9.1m will also be provided in 1989-90 to help fund the initial costs of voluntary early retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The results of the increase of $870m in funding for higher education which I announced last year are already evident. Student enrolments grew by 7.3 per cent in 1989, the largest increase since 1975. In total, an additional 49,000 student places will be created over the course of this triennium. Major new buildings are appearing on campuses all over Australia. The refurbishment of many older buildings has commenced. New employment opportunities for academic staff are opening up all over the country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the near future, additional funds to support new research infrastructure will begin to flow, strengthening the research capacity of universities and colleges. The massive injection of resources into higher education has provided a more positive environment for reform and change. Over the past decade, higher education has been afflicted by low levels of growth funded at marginal rates, a small capital works program, growing levels of unmet demand, deteriorating buildings and few opportunities for academic staff. There was a general environment of stagnation, low public esteem and a lack of purpose and direction. That has all changed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has put higher education back on the public agenda in this country. It has ensured that the community fully understands and appreciates the vital role of our universities and colleges in helping this country to adjust to changing and adverse economic and social circumstances. In my ministerial statement in September 1987, I identified a range of issues which, in the Government's view, had to be addressed if community confidence in and support for higher education was to be restored. However, the Government recognised that, if it was to provide the additional resources which the system needed, it could only do so in the knowledge that its quality and effectiveness would be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> We can now move forward with full confidence that those objectives have been met. Through reforms to management, staffing and resource allocation, which balances institutional autonomy with public accountability, Australia's higher education institutions will be stronger and more vigorous than in the past. Not surprisingly, some of these reforms have generated a great deal of debate, fuelled in part by misconceptions or misrepresentations about the Government's intentions. Where those concerns have legitimacy, and where constructive and workable alternatives have been put forward, I have not hesitated in changing or modifying the Government's approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been assisted in this process by the independent advice of the Higher Education Council (HEC) of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. I have referred to the Council a number of issues, including the form and content of education profiles. The Council's advice has been tabled in the Parliament. As a result of the HEC's consideration, further changes will be made to education profiles if and where any demonstrative evidence of unnecessary Government involvement in the affairs of institutions is apparent.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me emphasise again a point I have made time and time again. There is a difference between governments requiring institutions to address contemporary issues and concerns, and the Government dictating how institutions should respond. We have done the former; we have not done the latter. What we have begun to establish is a more stable and secure environment in which institutions can manage themselves. We must now build a lasting consensus about the nature of the relationship between higher education institutions and the Government which funds them. The establishment of 35 larger and more comprehensive institutions will assist with planning and reduce the unnecessary duplication and competition which arose from a number of smaller institutions seeking growth and expansion in similar discipline areas. Stability and certainty in planning will be further aided by the restoration of full triennial funding. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1989 Budget context, I will announce resource allocations for higher education in 1992. Discussions will be held with institutions on their plans for further growth in 1992, particularly in priority areas. Decisions for the 1990-92 triennium will then be announced in November. This will be the first full triennium for the unified national system of higher education. The management of that system will essentially be left to the institutions themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The reforms and changes which are outlined in the statement will be progressively implemented. These changes will require the patience and cooperation of all parties. I am confident that the unified national system will, when fully established, have the strength and endurance to meet the community's many and changing demands for the coming decade and into the twenty-first century. I seek leave to table the supplementary funding decisions for the 1989-91 triennium and the report of the task force on amalgamations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say at the outset that the Opposition welcomes the opportunity to debate the future course of higher education in this country. In fact, when we go back through the Hansard record, we note that this Parliament has not been the forum for discussion and debate on this critical issue. It is no wonder that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and this Government, as a result of their policies, are the recipients of a torrent of abuse by the tertiary education sector. The whole of this sector is in a state of chaos, confusion and uncertainty. The Minister seems to be driven by some blind ideology of central control and reform for the sake of reform. He still thinks that he will be the Treasurer in the next Keating Government. He is keen to make his mark and to impress his candidature for the Prime Minister's job. I have been responsible for this portfolio for a month or thereabouts--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my colleague the honourable member for Gippsland for his complimentary remarks. One thing that strikes me as I go around and talk to people is that the Minister seems reluctant to acknowledge all of the good things that are happening in the tertiary education sector-in our universities and colleges. Despite the intrusions of government, many of our institutions are of international standard and are staffed by people who are more interested in the pursuit of knowledge and excellence than in the distractions of the Minister's politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In making a rational assessment of both the demerits and the achievements of our institutions, any sensible person would have an obligation to substantiate the benefits of so-called alleged reform. The missing link in this debate-the missing ingredient from the Minister's statement today and all his other statements on this subject-is a clear statement of education benefit to be reaped as a result of his proposals for a unified national system. The Minister has a pre-occupation with economics and saving dollars. He is driven by the utilitarian approach. He talks about productivity. I recognise that our tertiary institutions have a role to play in respect of boosting national economic productivity, but it is wrong to suggest that productivity is the be-all and end-all; it is wrong to place too great an emphasis on it. I have come from the industrial relations portfolio area. It is convenient for the Minister to heap some of the blame in respect of the lack of progress in our economic area on to the tertiary education sector. In fact, this is a mere distraction from the Government's other failings in terms of its economic management and, in particular, the failure of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to provide this country with sensible, reasonable economic outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement provides capital funds and specifies allocations of those funds for the triennium. The statement would have been made earlier but for the amalgamation process which is an integral part of the Minister's drive for reform. His reform leads to a greater control of those institutions by Canberra. There are a number of mechanisms by which that control is established. One of the mechanisms was the abolition of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission (CTEC), and its replacement by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. I say that is a mechanism for greater control because CTEC, regardless of one's views about it, was something of a buffer between the tertiary education sector and the Government. The Government's abolition of CTEC and its creation of a new body has given it a puppet for control to be vested in the hands of the Minister. That has been a very effective mechanism by which the Minister has increased Canberra's control over the sector. </PARA>
<PARA> A second significant mechanism by which this Government has centralised control has been educational profiles. The thing to know about educational profiles is simple: if the head of an institution does not come to an agreement with the Government he will not get the dollars he needs to run that institution. That is the gun at the head, which is a favourite mechanism of this Minister and this Government. A third mechanism for control by Canberra of our tertiary institutions is a very common one used by people on the Minister's side of politics and that is to have fewer institutions. The fewer there are, the less they will badger the Minister and the less they will demand that he receive deputations to hear their complaints. The Minister was keen to announce today that there will be a big reduction in the number of institutions he will have to deal with from 72 to 35. Another instrument of control is the Australian Research Council, and the Government's guidelines for the Government to dictate the allocation of research funds. It is the Government which will pick the winners in the research field. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no wonder that, as one goes around the country talking to people who are concerned about this issue, the cries of concern within our community are very loud. I have some quotations which typify that concern. The first one is from Geoff Maslen, writing in the Age on 23 May 1989. I do not think he is of my political persuasion, which adds to the force of his comment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Three remarkable aspects strike the observer of these vast structural reforms; the magnitude of the change, the absence of clear or sensible reasons for some of the proposed mergers, and the lack of any outcry from those affected. Bemused students, dazed academics, overburdened administrators, all seem unable to respond, at least publicly. It is as if the Federal Government's deluge of documents: the green paper, white paper, science statement, research report and taskforce recommendations on amalgamations, has been too demanding, too confusing, all too much. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet there is anguish on both the college and university campuses. </PARA>
<PARA>The second quotation is from Professor Paul Bourke, who states:</PARA>
<PARA>Ordinary language begins to break down when the minister insists that no directed centralisation is under way . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a sham, not to put too fine a point on it, for the minister to insist that no coercion or direction is at work here. Virtually every institutional move recently reported by his taskforce-</PARA>
<PARA>the outcome of which we are partly discussing today-</PARA>
<PARA>and indeed the taskforce itself, has been driven by the perception within institutions that, if they do not comply with the guidelines of the white paper, their operating base will be altered. The proposition that the mergers exhibit some voluntaristic, state-based process is an affront to public intelligence. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Penington, Vice-Chancellor of one of the leading universities in this country, asks the rhetorical question, `Why were we not listened to', and says:</PARA>
<PARA>It would be easy to attribute the faults to an over-ambitious young Minister in too much of a hurry to show that he had fixed higher education in his rush to move on to the next portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA>Maurice Weidemann, a senior academic at the Australian National University, refers to the processes of reform as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . ill-conceived and badly brought-up proposals for tertiary education of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training . . . </PARA>
<PARA>To give another example of the breadth of concern I will quote from a publication of the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . most university amalgamations lack an educational or financial rationale. </PARA>
<PARA>What an indictment that is of this Minister. This group, representing academics throughout the country, says of his proposals for reform that they lack an identifiable rationale. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . most of the present round of higher education institutional amalgamations were driven by opportunism, empire building and fear of the consequences of failing to fall in with the Government's wishes. </PARA>
<PARA> The meeting accused the Minister . . . Mr Dawkins, of outrageous interference in the affairs of higher education institutions with demands for immediate amalgamations and veiled threats of financial penalties for non-compliance. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure the Minister will have a response to those widespread criticisms on the basis of vested interest. They are all from the tertiary institutions themselves, so let me give another quote from somebody outside our institutions, somebody held in very high regard in this country, Sir Arvi Parbo. He has written a letter to the Age which was published this morning, and is obviously sufficiently moved by his concern about the future of our tertiary institutions. His letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>In business and commerce, world-wide experience has shown that the way to achieve excellence is to break large centrally controlled organisations down into business units, to set targets which will stretch them, and to give them the maximum amount of authority and autonomy to run their businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> The central organisation sets the broad policies and exercises overall financial control, but does not interfere with management decisions which are best made close to the action. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>If my understanding is correct, there is cause for deep concern and alarm by all who depend on the vital contribution of higher education and university research to Australia's future-and that means all of us. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very comprehensive condemnation of this Government's actions in the area of higher education. Time is short. Let me re-state my concern that we do not have ample opportunity to discuss these issues. People who are genuine in their concern about the future of these institutions should look very closely at some of the proposed amalgamations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has said that he has not held a gun at anybody's head. He should pick up the telephone and talk to people in Western Australia. He comes from the west. I have spoken to a number of people there and they have been very frank. I will not give the Minister a list of names because that is not something they would appreciate. I have spoken to those people, and I am amazed that they are so concerned, and feel so threatened in respect of their funding. The Minister has said, and it is amazing that he should do so, that none of these amalgamations will happen unless there is a generally favourable response from all the participants. Let us look at the situation in the west. We have very strong and vocal opposition to the merger from both campuses at Murdoch University and the University of Western Australia (UWA), particularly from the staff and students. Less than 27 per cent of UWA academics think there are sound academic reasons for the merger. The UWA faculties of arts and economics have formally condemned it. The student guilds of both institutions are opposing it on the grounds that there are no valid educational advantages.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a classic response. The Minister says we should disregard their views in respect of the future of these institutions because he does not like their politics. If he thinks that is the way to run a higher education policy, he is on his own. That is a very out of touch comment and seems to me to suggest a policy driven by ideology rather than practical considerations. If a Liberal has a sensible thing to say, the Minister should take notice of it instead of casually disregarding it. An anti-amalgamation petition was signed by 7,000 people. What does the Minister say about that? Does he say they were all Liberals? I think most of them will be by the time of the next election. The fact is that the Minister has not taken this opposition into consideration, and it is hard for him to justify some of the statements he has made in this House today. Those people's concerns are genuine. Their concerns are about educational considerations taking a distant, second place to financial considerations. Whilst everybody has a proper concern for financial considerations, their main concerns must be for the standard of education being delivered to the Australian population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Time does not permit me to comment on some of the other amalgamations. I would like to do so; I think they are important. I have some concerns about the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and the Footscray Institute of Technology. I think that amalgamation will proceed, but we have to ask ourselves whether there is a sufficient meeting of minds as to purpose, as to the mission of such a combined institution, and as to whether or not it will achieve the aims of its proponents. It is all very well for the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths) to go around getting a few cheap headlines on the front page of the Sunshine Courier or wherever, but in the end someone has to assess it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is totally opposed to these coercive mergers. When we are returned to government we will abolish the unified national system; we will abolish the imposed educational profiles; we will withdraw the arbitrary requirements for amalgamations imposed by Labor; we will stimulate healthy competition among institutions which will promote excellence of achievement among students, staff and institutions; and we will modify Labor's guidelines for the Australian Research Council to ensure excellence and reduce bureaucratic interference. We will do all that whilst maintaining the rolling 1989-91 triennial system and the number of places projected in the 1988 Budget by granting national education awards. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should begin by asking where the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is. Here he comes-Dr Debt is back in town. It is good to see that he is going to take up the debate. The matter before us today is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The continuing failure of the Hawke Government to develop an economic strategy which is resulting in confusion and adversity for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>This guy must dislike going overseas because every time he does some of his colleagues get a sudden rush of honesty and start putting the facts on the record and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) starts running off at the mouth about all sorts of new short term panaceas to solve the problem. I noticed that, although the Prime Minister started out his answer in the House today about the deductability of mortgage interest in a way that seemed to please the Treasurer, the Treasurer got decidedly twitchy as he went on, when the Prime Minister said it was on the agenda, that he was having a look at it. The Treasurer had obviously thought he had won the day. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Treasurer to his favourite newspaper, the Financial Times, the newspaper which apparently guides most of his thinking in international matters and which he has spoken about favourably in the past. In the latest issue he has been totally damned, as has his economic management. It says, `The Australian economy is mired deep in crisis and the outlook is awful'. The Financial Times goes on to emphasise that there are two main problems facing the economy-what it calls endemic inflation, and chronically low savings levels. It draws attention to the fact that a serious fiscal imbalance is being created by a range of savings disincentives and too many incentives for unproductive expenditure. The paper concluded its remarks on Australia by talking about the need for political leaders to encourage Australians to develop a greater sense of realism and perspective if it is not to be forced on them by the outside world. This is a classic final remark by that newspaper and one to which, of course, the Treasurer will pay absolutely no attention-just as he has ignored all other warnings in recent months on the state of the Australian economy. It is always somebody else's fault; it is always easier to shoot the messenger; and it is never worth listening to the views of those outside. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be interesting to hear what the Treasurer says about his favourite newspaper, the Financial Times, because he more than anyone else has to start the process today of generating a greater sense of realism in this country; otherwise the world outside will bring its judgment to bear on his economic management. He will probably deny the substance of this report, as he denied the warnings of Moody's Investor Services Inc. and Standard and Poor's and as he denied the undoubted warnings of the Economist and a host of other organisations and individuals such as the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, his former economic adviser, Barry Hughes; the Business Council of Australia; and the Confederation of Australian Industry. He has ignored several warnings by the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the OECD, where he has just been. All of these groups in the last six or eight months have put on the record warnings about the parlous state of the Australian economy and the unfavourable trends inherent in our economy as a result of his economic mismanagement. Yet he will remain and this Government will remain totally complacent, continuing to refuse to acknowledge the magnitude of our problem. They certainly will not set about trying to solve those problems. All we will get is a dose of standard cynicism and a genuine attempt to confuse people by disinformation rather than address the issues. </PARA>
<PARA> This country is obviously in a crisis. It is not being too tough these days to make that sort of statement. We are particularly vulnerable to the world economy. We see world activity slowing and we see the possibility of shrinking export markets, falling commodity prices, rising world interest rates and a whole gamut of homegrown domestic problems against that background. Our inflation rate is accelerating; on the latest data our rate is triple the average for major OECD countries. Our balance of payments continues to deteriorate. It looks as though we will get a $17 billion current account deficit for this year, and further deterioration is predicted for next year. Australia already has the third worst current account deficit to gross domestic product ratio of the 24 industrialised member countries of the OECD. Our current account is substantially worse than those of neighbouring newly industrialised countries and other Asian countries with which we compete. </PARA>
<PARA> Our international debt is exploding. Our present net debt is just over $100 billion and there is the prospect, as we saw in one newspaper report this week of findings of the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, that net debt in the next 12 months could go to $120 billion or $130 billion. We cannot rule out further explosions beyond that, given the recent trend in the exchange rate and the continuing run of monthly balance of payments record numbers. This country's gross debt per capita figures are about 10 times worse than those for the Philippines, five times worse than for Brazil and Korea, and three times worse than for Chile and Argentina. I know the Prime Minister tells us not to worry about those debt numbers. He would have us believe that the $100 billion net debt is not a problem. He can go on thinking that if he likes but there are not too many people in Australia who will accept his arguments, which are without substantial backing. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of interest rates is now such that they risk plummeting this economy into recession. This is the standard response of this man to economic difficulties. The Treasurer plunged us into recession in 1985. He was lucky then that the world kept growing; but from now on we are about to see him plunge us into recession again, at a time when the world is moving against us.</PARA>
<PARA> Over and above that, we are plagued by a host of structural factors and inefficiencies: low and declining productivity, low domestic savings, declining international competitiveness, narrowly focused exports, a struggling domestic manufacturing sector, excessive dependence on imports, a tax system that discourages savings and investment and encourages debt, a grossly inefficient system on the wharves, coastal shipping that cries out for competition, and far too much enterprise tied up in government. Not even the Treasurer's blokes in the right wing of the Party in New South Wales support him on privatisation. So, what hope has he of doing anything substantial in that area?</PARA>
<PARA> What is his response to this? It is complacency; it is cynicism. The sort of performance we have seen from the Prime Minister in his absence serves as a very good example of the extent to which those opposite will go to distract attention from the real issues rather than deal with the facts. The Treasurer on several occasions in recent months has taken a particularly complacent attitude to the state of our balance of payments. As each month has come along it has never really been a problem. We can go back to February, when he said in his balance of payments press conference, in answer to the question `Is the policy response the correct one?':</PARA>
<PARA>The answer is very definitely in the affirmative. </PARA>
<PARA>That was three or four months ago. A journalist asked:</PARA>
<PARA> So, all we have to do is sit tight and everything will be sweet. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is a case of certainly not panicking as some commentators would like to have seen the Government do. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on like that on a number of other occasions. When he was asked how long it would take for monetary policy to have its effect on investment expectations-that was his statement on 18 April in another press conference-he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It will moderate, I think quickly; I think it is happening now. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of complacency that we get from this guy. As he was darting off overseas for his holiday at the taxpayers' expense, just a few weeks ago, he had time for a quick doorstop. He said, `The current stance of policy will do it; it will work', and off he went. This is an example of total, unbounded complacency. The point is that he cannot deliver; he has run out of economic ideas and he cannot deliver. He cannot cut spending, he cannot privatise, he cannot put in place genuine micro-economic reform, he cannot deregulate the labour market, he cannot reduce interest rates, and he has no policy on savings. </PARA>
<PARA> All he has, as the Prime Minister said in his absence, is a policy of hope. On one particular occasion, in the press conference on 8 June, the Prime Minister at the Paddle shoe factory was talking of hope. He mentioned hope on four or five occasions as his only response. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't see any need from them to go higher-</PARA>
<PARA>he was talking about interest rates-</PARA>
<PARA>and I certainly hope that that is the case . . . we've just got to hold on for a while until we get the level of activity down. I just hope that we are going to see that before too long. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>But, as I say, it is one of a number of indicators-</PARA>
<PARA>again talking about the unsustainable nature of our activity-</PARA>
<PARA>And I think if you take them all together, I think we are starting to see the signs of a levelling off. I certainly hope so. </PARA>
<PARA>A few sentences later he said:</PARA>
<PARA>You would think and hope, as I say, that the level of interest rates that exists now, together with other tight arms of policy of wages and budgetary policy, one would hope that in combination that will be enough to bring the economy back. </PARA>
<PARA>It is totally a policy of hope and it is without any foundation whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer stands up in the OECD, as he reports to us, boasting about the tightness of his fiscal policy. The other OECD countries do not need such a tight fiscal policy. I do not see the Treasurer standing up boasting that he has record levels of interest rates and that he is outdoing all of those countries on the level of interest rates, in terms of his performance relative to that of his OECD partners. They are not the relevant ones; they are only part of the world. Our near neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region are the ones he should worry about. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the result for the average Australians? The result is basically one of total confusion. They are confused in a number of respects about what they are supposed to do, where they are going, how they are meant to perform and how they will actually survive in a Hawke-Keating economic situation. They are confused about the current state of the economy. They know that things are crook, but they do not know how bad they are and the Government will not tell them. The Treasurer will never release any of these new forecasts. Australians are confused as to why interest rates have to be so high. They know that they are much lower in the rest of the world. They do not know yet whether they have peaked. They do not know yet whether they will go any higher and they have no idea from the Government about the timing of any of that. </PARA>
<PARA> They are confused about whether they should spend their tax cuts and wage increases or whether they should save them as the Prime Minister has begged them to do. They are a bit confused because they are given the tax cuts but they do not know whether they should keep them, spend them or save them, what should they do? They are confused as to how they are to use these tax cuts. The Treasurer himself, as he left for overseas, suggested that they might use them to pay their mortgages. They all went home and did their sums and they worked out that his tax cuts are probably worth about $80 a month from 1 July. They are already up for, on an average mortgage, $160 a month in terms of increased home loan repayments. Undoubtedly, they are totally confused about that as well. </PARA>
<PARA> They are also confused about what Bob Hawke and Paul Keating said-particularly what the Prime Minister said-in relation to raised living standards when they see the balance of payments problems, the debt problems and the inflation problems on which they receive more information now almost every day. They are also confused about how they will continue to keep their homes or how they will continue to keep a roof over their head, not to mention the concern of many Australians now as to how their children will ever be able to afford to buy a home. They are also confused about how their children will repay our foreign debts when they are all presently struggling to pay off their own Bankcards and to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA> People in Australia are also confused about how they will be able to grow old gracefully with some financial security. We are back here today because this guy did not listen to the warnings of institutions and individuals in the Opposition a year ago when we said that the Government cannot make major changes to something as important as superannuation, announce them in May by press release, not deliver the legislation until about a year later and have it debated about 13 or 14 months after the event. There is total confusion and all we have seen so far in the Senate is clear evidence that he has not any idea of what he is doing with approved deposit funds (ADFs), superannuation or whatever. He would not understand it, yet he has thrown that industry and the future of most Australians into unbelievable turmoil. </PARA>
<PARA> Most Australians are also confused because, despite the Government's rhetoric to the contrary, they do not see much evidence that the Government can cut expenditure. They did not see any need for the Treasurer to go overseas on his recent trip. They do not see any particular need for the Prime Minister to chuff off overseas to the cricket at Lords. They get confused when they see all those sorts of conspicuous consumptions on the part of Government Ministers at times when their own economic well-being is sliding, and sliding quite dramatically. They are also confused as to how many more jobs they will have to take on to support their families. They are also confused about how the rich mates of the Prime Minister seem to be getting richer while the poor and the middle income earners in this country continue to struggle to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA> They are confused as to why the Government just does not do something about these and a host of other problems that exist in our country today. They fear that the situation is about to get worse. They know that there is a recession on the way and they are very concerned that their jobs-the one thing that this Government wants to claim credit for-are now at risk. The Treasurer might run around boasting about creating one million or 1.3 million jobs, but he has put those jobs at risk. The bottom line is that the average Australians are taking a beating in terms of their standard of living. They are struggling to pay the current interest rates and they now have to live with a situation where the Treasurer has put their jobs at risk.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), the shadow Treasurer, just had a chance for a debate on policy, but he did not put one up. He should not keep asking about debates on policy, because he is devoid of one. The shadow Treasurer has had the job for weeks now, he was the shadow finance spokesman before that, and he has been given a run by the Press Gallery waiting to see what he has on offer. The days and weeks tick over. What we find is that he is just like many other people in the Opposition; big mouth, no policy. In other words, he comes in here like a commentator. He thinks that he is still working for the Business Review Weekly, writing a weekly column. He does not understand that having a job like he now has requires establishing a policy, a strategy. He thinks it is good enough to hand out a bit of abuse, to say, `The Treasurer is overseas on holidays, the Prime Minister is about to take a holiday overseas', and to refer to `rich mates'. He has the hide to talk about our risking a recession in the economy when he was the principal adviser to the former Treasurer who presided over the first negative growth in 30 years. There was not just a recession; there was actually a contraction. It takes a special talent to make the economy contract. Yet that is what the honourable member succeeded in doing.

The honourable member for Wentworth pushed the Australian economy into a situation where it actually contracted; he did not just slow the growth. He put nearly a million people on the scrap heap. He now talks about people's houses being at risk, but when he was around those people never even had a job. This is the kind of attack we get. But we never hear of an alternative policy structure. No-one listening to this debate today, in the Press Gallery or outside, has heard an alternative policy from the Opposition. What is the honourable member advocating? Lower interest rates? Is that what he is advocating? All we get is a saccharin grin from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and nothing from the honourable member for Wentworth. They will not respond. They attack us about interest rates but when I ask them whether they would have lower interest rates, they sit there with embarrassed smirks on their faces. In other words, the shadow Treasurer made a totally disingenuous comment. He knows that if interest rates declined demand would simply go on longer and power on further unless there were a massive change in fiscal policy of the order of 3 or 4 percentage points of gross domestic product (GDP). That is what we would be talking about-about $12 billion to $15 billion out of outlays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wentworth told us originally that he would hold the tax cuts. Then he wilted under pressure and said that he would keep them. First he said that we should not pay them; then the first time pressure was applied he said that they should be paid. He was then asked in an interview whether he believed there should be cuts in government spending. The honourable member replied, `Yes I do'. But within a week the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) said that the Opposition would not touch welfare, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) said that no school would be worse off under the Opposition and the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) insisted that Medicare would not cost more. Where does that leave the honourable member for Wentworth? He said that he would cut public expenditure but immediately he was contradicted by three shadow Ministers.

<PARA>The Opposition says more is needed, but is struggling to establish its credibility. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a nice little quote. It has a nice little kick in the tail there. As the honourable member likes to quote British journals, perhaps I should quote from the Economist, which said:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke and Mr Keating have led a revolution in the Labor Party, born of the need to change Australia's international competitiveness . . . The Opposition's problem is that Labor is doing all the things that the Liberals should have done long ago. </PARA>
<PARA>Oh, ho, ho, ho. That quote is from the Economist's survey on Australia dated 6 May 1989. Everyone in the world is a wake up to the Opposition. It has sat around for 25 years watching Australia's capital stock weaken. The fact that the economy can now grow by only 5 per cent without straining the leash of its capacity and therefore seeing demand spill into imports has been caused by the fact that for 30 of the past 36 years the Liberals have had the run of the place. For seven of those 30 years the honourable member for Wentworth was in there advising the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong. He left us with a sticky wicket. We have had to pick up the pieces and repair in six years the indolence of 25 years. That is the truth about this country's current situation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has presided over the biggest shift in fiscal policy in any Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country. At Question Time the shadow Treasurer asked me a question about savings. I told him that we had shifted the savings balance by seven percentage points of GDP since 1983-84 or by seven since 1985-86 and that that alone should have been enough to repair the current account imbalance. Any OECD or International Monetary Fund expert prescribing for Australia would have said, `Shift your fiscal policy and your public savings balance'. We have done that. But at the same time we have had a concomitant lift in investment of 4 per cent of GDP which the country cannot afford and which monetary policy is now holding back. It is as simple as that. But the shadow Treasurer does not believe that he has any requirement to put forward an alternative policy. He stands up here as if he were still a Business Review Weekly commentator. He has not yet understood that he has changed roles, that he is now a shadow Minister and he has a responsibility to put forward an alternative policy framework. </PARA>

Where are they now? We have not heard them. Basically, the Opposition has not got its act together any more than it had at this stage in the last parliament. Before the 1987 election the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) said that he only had to press the button on the computer and the tax policy would spit out. The then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong, said that all the Opposition's policies were in place. At that time I said to the Prime Minister, `This crowd have no policies.

Argentina's gross external debt as a percentage of GDP is 67 per cent. That of the Philippines is 99 per cent. Australia's is 37 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member can say what he likes-I am talking about gross external debt as a percentage of GDP. But even if we were talking about debt per capita, the Opposition would distort that. The shadow Treasurer made a cheap speech full of distortions, but the fact is that the countries he mentioned have external debt to GDP ratios of two and three times that of Australia. Their debt servicing ratios are one and a half and three times that of Australia. The honourable member persists in running his own country's position into the ground in public debate. That has always been the stock-in-trade of the Liberals-loyal to Australia when it suits them and disloyal when it suits them. That is the position. When we started today we had all been on holidays. It is interesting that apparently the Opposition thought the place could not function without my returning, but now that I have returned it argues that it cannot function with me. The Opposition had better make up its mind one way or the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member stated that Australia's position was five times worse than that of the Philippines and 10 times worse than that of Argentina. He was wrong on both counts. He was prepared to give the House misleading information. He said that interest rates were 18 1/2 per cent. I remind him that the Opposition, in government, presided over interest rates of 22 per cent. When I put the question to him, `Are you advocating lower interest rates', he sits there mute. Let us look at the forays and the retreats that the Opposition has engaged in in the last couple of weeks. It said that it would give the States taxing powers, but a day later it had to slink away from that. The Opposition said that it would withhold the tax cuts; yet, under the pressure of one interview-the Opposition would go great cutting six percentage points out of GDP and public outlays-it went to water on tax cuts. I mean, really! Where does the Opposition think it will travel with that kind of approach?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has this framework: we have a seven percentage point shift in the savings balance and a tight monetary policy that will rein in demand and, with it, imports in the current account. We have enormous structural change under way with the biggest lift in our history in the factor shares going to profits. We have the biggest investment phase ever. We have enormous micro-economic change in the financial system and the tax system. What policy-what single policy-has the Opposition proposed? If I asked my colleagues, `What economic policy of importance does the Opposition have two years-plus into this Parliament?', not one could answer honestly that it had one thing. </PARA>
<PARA> We know nothing about the Opposition. It just slips and slides around the issue because that is the standard Liberal way. The Opposition thinks that it will dodge the journos up to the poll, treat the Press Gallery like mugs, as it tried to do in 1987, get to the wire and hope that it slides over because of a bit of disaffection with interest rates and house prices. That is what the Opposition thinks. I can tell it this: it has now lost three elections and it is coming up for No. 4. Opposition members will get another three years in here to spend their time, wandering around the corridors at night, having cups of tea in each other's offices, plotting against each other and working away. They will slot another three years of their life into the oblivion of opposition. After about a decade they might just decide that maybe a few policies do matter and that the Australian public has come quite a long way from those crazy years when they called all members of the Australian Labor Party coms. For 20 years the Opposition trafficked on reds under the beds and the claim that the Chinese and the Russians were coming to get us. Just maybe they will realise that they need a few policies and that the public has woken up to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the Opposition's honeymoon with the Press Gallery, if today's performance is the best it can do, as each week goes by and its empty, vapid performances are observed, it will find that it has been found wanting. The judgment of the Opposition will be as harsh now as it was in 1981-82 when it shoved this economy into a massive recession, massive unemployment and the first negative growth in 30 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate is about the Government's failure to develop an effective economic strategy. Once again, all we heard from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) today was more empty words, more vapid sentences and more abusive language. The Australian people are concerned about where their country's economy is going. They are desperately worried. Yet we have a Treasurer who now slinks out of the chamber because he cannot take the heat of the kitchen. He runs out of the country so he does not have to face the people. Now when there is a matter of public importance before the chamber, we again see the Treasurer running away from the realities facing this nation-the realities which come home every time a person gets his salary cheque; the realities which come home every time a wife goes to the shops and sees day by day the cost of living in this country continuing to rise. They know what is happening to their country and the Australian dollar. They only wish that this Government would show some responsibility in this most crucial area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I want to talk about today is one of the critical problems facing Australia-domestic savings. We have a Prime Minister who walks the streets of this nation calling on and imploring people to save their mythical tax cuts of April. We are told that we must increase our domestic savings. At the same time, as a demonstration yet again of the Government's inability to coordinate its economic policy, the Treasurer, who has just slinked out of the chamber, has increased taxes on superannuation by nearly 1,000 per cent over the last 5 1/2 years. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nearly 1,000 per cent. Yet the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) told us to save. If members of the Government have any difficulty understanding these concepts, I remind them that superannuation in Australia accounts for two-thirds of our domestic savings. In other words, the viability, security and confidence of the Australian people in this method of saving is absolutely fundamental if the Government is seriously going to say to them, `Save more and save Australia'. The Opposition parties support that objective. We want to see domestic savings increase. We desperately need to do it. My colleague the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) pointed out that by the end of this year or early next year we may well see our national debt approaching $120 billion to $130 billion. It is now over $103 billion and it is going up at the rate of $1 billion a month. Yes, we desperately need domestic savings, but one thing is certain-we will not be able to achieve that if the Government continues with its present policy, which we have seen in the Senate in recent weeks and which we will see in this chamber probably tonight or tomorrow, of once again increasing superannuation tax merely as a means of finding an easy way to increase revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the House and the Australian people that when the Fraser Government left office we had a tax on superannuation of 5 per cent of the lump sum at the appropriate marginal rate. Within a year that had been increased to 30 per cent on lump sums. I will tell honourable members why it did not stay there. This Government discovered that the tax take from that mechanism was less than $200m a year. It said, `This won't do. We have to bring forward the tax. We'll change the tax mix. We'll introduce four new taxes and we'll con everybody into believing that no-one has lost one cent'. Guess what, it increased revenue, on its own estimate in a full financial year, by $1.4 billion. That is being taken from superannuation savings and contributions on lump sums and the capital which had been accumulated by superannuation funds across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will never be forgiven for that because it is attacking the very rights of the Australian people-some 3.7 million of them-to have some financial independence in their retirement. Yet we are told by the Prime Minister, `Save more money. Save your tax-cut money for Australia'. For heaven's sake, he pleaded in the Age newspaper of 8 June. In all the major dailies of Australia at that time we read of the Prime Minister pleading for savings. All I can conclude is that he has lost control of his Treasurer. He has certainly lost control of his economic policy if he is unable to see that the fiscal policy being applied by the Treasurer and the impact of his policy on domestic savings are an absolute scandal. That is why we have been fighting it so strongly in the Senate and why we will continue to remind the Australian people right up to the next election when their wrath will be brought down on the Government's head to an extent that we have not seen since the days when the Whitlam Government was thrown bags and baggage out of the chamber and down the road. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia will not forget and forgive the Government because, above all, people deserve the right to see their funds protected. They deserve the right to see their funds invested for their interests, and their interests alone. Instead, the changes which the Government has brought forward since 1988 have been a slow, painful and cynical attack on people's ability to keep out of the welfare system. This is a concept on which the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) and I agree. We say that people should be encouraged to stay out of the welfare system. But where has the Minister been during this debate? There has not been a word from him, yet we are told that in a few weeks we will have Labor's grand retirement income policy. All I can say is that if the Government is unable to demonstrate its capacity to connect its economic policy and fiscal policy with its retirement income policy, once again it is selling a sham. It is selling dud coinage to the Australian people and they will return it in kind at the ballot box. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that in the process the Government has destroyed the basis of confidence which is absolutely fundamental if we are to persuade people to save for the future. I refer the House to May last year when the Treasurer gave us one of his grand, eloquent strategies. He told us two things. He said he would change all the tax arrangements for superannuation. But guess what? Once again we had the thimble and pea trick. He said, `Nobody will lose one cent'. What was his other promise to the 3.7 million people involved? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Together these changes complete the Government's review of superannuation tax arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> People can therefore plan for their retirement with complete certainty and confidence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer said that in May last year. He promised the industry that the legislation would be introduced in August. We saw nothing until the closing days of November last year. He promised the industry a fair and stable arrangement. We had half a dozen press releases which formed the policy. On that basis, the industry collected from the Australian people approximately $1 billion in revenue which it is holding. I said to the Treasurer today, `Who owns the interest from that $1 billion?', all of a sudden he has amnesia. He does not want to know about it. The same question was asked of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) in the other place: Who owns the interest on that $1 billion? Again, we have seen collective amnesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Party does not want to know, and I will tell the House why that is so. We are probably not talking about a revenue gain of $1.4 billion; it is more likely to be $2 billion in a full financial year. The Government is embarrassed by it, it is afraid of it, and it does not want the Australian people to know the truth. The Government certainly does not want to know who owns the approximately $150m interest that it has been ripping out of the pockets of the 3.7 million people who have been doing the right thing by Australia and by themselves, which is to save so that they will not be a cost burden to their children and to future generations. The Government by its action is saying to the people, `Don't believe us, don't do what we are telling you to do. We want you to save but you really mustn't do it because if you do you are stupid'. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that persons in receipt of an average income today, and especially people in receipt of low incomes, are going backwards, not just in terms of superannuation taxation, but in terms of their capacity to live in this country, their capacity to pay interest rates, their capacity to survive, their capacity to give their children anywhere near the same opportunities they had when they were young. The Government has taken this capacity from the Australian people and it has given them nothing except false promises. Government members are false prophets. This is a false government and it will fail at the polls at the next opportunity. </PARA>

But when it comes to demanding of them, to asking of them, to requesting of them, a policy, a strategy, their alternatives, if they were in government, what they would introduce as policy, we hear nothing. There is a vacuum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apparently, the Opposition has learnt nothing from its lesson of 1987-that is, a party cannot enter an election campaign expecting the Australian public to consider it seriously as an alternative government if it has no policies. It has apparently learnt nothing since that time. As I say, it is now June 1989. We have been waiting for the Opposition's tax policy. It promised that we would see it in August 1988. We are still waiting to see it. It is now about nine months late. No mention has been made today during the contributions to the debate by Opposition members of any strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> For the benefit of Opposition members, let me explain to them what a strategy is. A strategy means having policies; it means having the right policies, and it means sticking to those policies even if they are unpopular in the short term. That is what this Government is doing. After listening to this debate today it is clear that the Liberals have no strategy and no policy. Let me make it clear that the Government will not be abandoning the policies which it has in place because they form part of a strategy which is directed at addressing Australia's economic problems. As I say, they may not be politically popular policies at present, or in the short term, but they are the correct policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The only way to solve the current economic problems is through the Government's policies. We do not disguise the fact that there are some serious problems facing the Australian economy. But the relevant questions one must ask in these circumstances are: Does the Government acknowledge that there is a problem in the Australian economy? Have we put in place policies to remedy and address those problems? The answer to both of those questions is yes, we do acknowledge that there is a problem, and we have put in place policies which address those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two main problems facing the Australian economy. We face an unsustainably high level of deficit on the current account and we face an overly high level of external debt. I make it clear that the Government's monetary and fiscal policies have been and remain the primary focus of this Government's economic policies. They have been tightened considerably over the past year. Let me refer to the current account. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) made quite clear today, as he has time and again in this House, all of the arms of macro-economic policy-I am talking about monetary policy, fiscal policy and wages policy-are tight and they are playing their role. </PARA>
<PARA> For the benefit of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), let me run through those policies. Monetary policy has been tight for some time. It was tightened again a fortnight ago. It has been tightened because we want it to slow some of the interest-sensitive areas of demand which have underpinned the surge in total demand. Fiscal policy is also tight. Let me remind the House that we have had three years of reductions in government spending. We have turned outlays around during our period in government from about 30 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), because we have made the hard decisions to cut spending, to about 25 per cent-something that the Opposition could never do during its period in government. The Fraser Government, for all the present Opposition's talk of smaller, more efficient, better targeted government, never had the gumption, the courage, or the vision to know that Australia did have to better target its spending programs and that it did have to reduce the size of government. We have done that. We have reduced outlays from 30 per cent to 25 per cent of GDP and we will be achieving this year a surplus on the public sector borrowing requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The other arm of overall economic policy is wages policy. We have had a tight wages policy in Australia for six years. If we talk to Australian workers they will confirm that wages policy has been tight. But the benefit of our wages policy is that we have been able to generate in Australia 1.4 million new jobs, the fastest rate of job growth anywhere in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and twice the average rate of job growth in the OECD countries. All of those arms of economic policy are tight and they are all designed to slow demand. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) did not say much in his contribution. I scored him six out of 10 for presentation and a massive fail in terms of content. He spoke in this place for 10 minutes with absolutely no policy and no strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the question of debt. As the Prime Minister said in Question Time today, Australia's net external debt is over $100 billion; but, of that, 61 per cent is owned by the private sector, 25 per cent by authorities and 14 per cent by the States. The private debt, which is 61 per cent of the total debt, is based on commercial decisions. They are decisions which will produce wealth and jobs for Australians over time. I remind the Opposition that the Commonwealth has not borrowed for two years. We have been repaying debt. We repaid $1.6 billion in 1987-88 and $3 billion in 1988-89. We have been busy generating Budget surpluses and repaying foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to conclude by making a few points about the inconsistencies in the Opposition's approach today. As I said, what we have heard today from the Opposition is nothing. We did not hear anything about its policies in relation to fiscal matters. Its previous finance spokesman, Senator Stone, is a great example of the inconsistencies which exist in the Opposition parties. He is on the public record as saying in September last year that it would be irresponsible for big tax cuts to be given on 1 July, for which the Government has legislated. Yet, only a week ago in the Senate, Senator Stone moved an amendment calling on the Government to introduce the tax cuts, describing them as long overdue. He is totally inconsistent. He seems to ebb and flow with the political breeze, as most people on the Opposition benches do. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Treasurer also has a yes-no policy on tax cuts. One week he wants the States to raise income taxes and the next he walks away from that. One Sunday on a television program he says that the tax cuts should not be paid. The next Sunday, under a bit of heavy interviewing from one interviewer, he backs down and says, `Yes, of course the tax cuts should be paid'. There are grievous inconsistencies on the Opposition side. The new Leader of the Opposition talks, as I have said, about a kinder, softer and more compassionate society. But the reality is that while the Opposition parties have changed leader they have been overrun by the ascendancy of the New Right. One has to be reminded of the preselection victories of the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred) over the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee), of McLachlan over the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) and the recent preselections of Kemp and Costello. Where is the Opposition Leader's softer and kinder rhetoric in all of that? The fact is that there is none. There are irrefutable contradictions in his soft rhetoric and the ascendancy of the New Right in the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I await the Opposition's policies. It has not announced any today. If it is going to talk seriously about an alternative economic strategy it is about time it put up some policies in relation to economic attacks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the amendments be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the amendments is to incorporate changes proposed by the Senate to enshrine in legislation the Auditor-General or his agent as an auditor of the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) and all its subsidiaries. There is also a Senate amendment which we might as well deal with now, concerning variations in financial targets. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst not opposing the amendments, I wish to make the following comments: The suggested amendments fly in the face of the government business enterprise (GBE) reforms and, I think, will impose an unnecessary discipline on the AIDC. The situation should be that the Corporation makes its recommendation on the question of the auditor based on commercial and government policy considerations. It ought to be able to examine bids put to it by various auditors, to compare the services which have been offered and the price of those services and reach conclusions on who should be the auditor. It would then submit its case to the Minister and support its recommendations with what we hope would be well researched documentation. The Minister of the day would be required to test the argument and then make a final decision. The meeting of requirements for public accountability would always be one of the tests applied. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) has indicated that his current intention is to have the Auditor-General remain as auditor of the Corporation. Despite this, I do not believe that the Auditor-General needs to be enshrined in legislation as the auditor of the Corporation. The decision of an auditor about another auditor should be made on the basis of conditions at the time, as mentioned earlier. It is difficult to believe that we will achieve greater efficiency and accountability by saying that, whatever other circumstances arise, the Auditor-General must be the auditor of any organisation. The best results will be obtained by having a situation where the Auditor-General must compete with other auditors. This is thought to be the best way to impose discipline on both the Auditor-General and the GBEs. Nevertheless, it is very important from the Government's point of view that the new structure of the AIDC be incorporated as soon as possible, so we are prepared to submit to the amendments put up by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment in the Senate's schedule of amendments involves tabling in the Parliament any ministerial directions involving variations to the AIDC's financial targets. That amendment also flies in the face of GBE reforms. The argument is that the GBEs will become more like the commercial sector. Here is a situation where we do not have a company such as Coles-Myer or Elders IXL Ltd which has to table in the Parliament every time it changes a commercial objective. Here we are saying that we want the GBEs to be more like the private sector. At the same time, by accepting this amendment we would be saying that if they are going to change their financial targets the directions have to be tabled here in the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that the AIDC will provide the Minister with a corporate plan. The plan will set out the objectives of the Corporation and the overall strategies and policies to be followed. The plan will incorporate financial targets which will outline overall financial strategies, including forecast revenue and expenditure. That target is to be agreed to in advance by the portfolio Minister. The financial targets are intended to be strategic in nature and will outline in some detail the operational plans of the Corporation. Therefore, if the ministerial directions regarding the financial targets were tabled in Parliament there is the real risk that confidential information could be disclosed, placing the AIDC in a distinct disadvantage compared to its competitors in the marketplace. Public accountability would have been ensured in that the annual report of the Corporation--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments which were put up here by the Opposition and which have been accepted by the Government as a consequence of their passage in the Senate are in accord with what I thought were fairly reasonable principles. I address firstly the question of the use of the Auditor-General. The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) spoke of the imposition of an unnecessary discipline. It is extraordinary for a Minister to refer in that way to an audit of an organisation-the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC)-which is still going to be, at worst, 70 per cent owned by the Government as trustee for the nation. The Minister says that it is an unnecessary discipline to require audits to be done by the Auditor-General as he can go and get anyone he likes. In the Minister's own State there is a body called the Victorian Economic Development Corporation (VEDC). It was responsible for a tremendous performance! One of the recommendations of the auditor inquiring into its performance was that the requirements of the audit laid down in the normal practice did not meet the requirements of the Auditor-General there and, because the standards of the Auditor-General were not applied, the responsibilities of the Government were not met. That is a practical example of what happened in the Minister's State.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It had a private auditor, yes, but he did not do the job because the requirements of the Auditor-General were not laid out for him in his instructions. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts, an all party committee, says that where a government corporation is concerned the Auditor-General has a statutory obligation to report to Parliament and, therefore, he must accept that responsibility and report to Parliament. If he chooses to go around the corner and subcontract out to a private auditor on written instructions-not like the Victorian situation-it is okay. The difficulty here is that the corporation itself can get lumbered with two fees if it is not careful. I hope that that has been taken into consideration in the application of these rules.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly the Auditor-General has a responsibility to this chamber that can be met only by his reporting to it, and he can report to it only on the adequacies of the accounting procedures of a corporation, in this case the Australian Industry Development Corporation, if he has done the audit or it has been done on his account by an accredited agent to his satisfaction and according to his instructions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is your birthday; happy birthday, Clarrie Millar. I was saying that we have this plan for the AIDC, a three-year program, and one of the Government's leading left wingers says, `That plan is no good because it does not meet the social obligations and requirements of the government of the day. Therefore, I direct you to charge less for those services in the national interest'. So down come the charges all round and down comes the profitability all round and that goes back. The Government wishes to have that swept under the carpet. One of the requirements of being more commercial and more competitive in the marketplace and of seeking a listing on the stock exchange is a thing called full disclosure. The ALP is not too good on full disclosure: it is a brand new concept to it. Companies are required to make a full disclosure. The Government is saying, `We want these bodies to be more commercial, but we cannot tell you about the Minister's direction about changing'. Why? Because he has made a political decision. It is not a commercial decision; a commercial decision is something else. The stock exchange requires a body, as a matter of listing, to table such information. That is why I asked the Minister whether he had been briefed or was just reading a speech. Anybody could have told him about that. That was the VEDC's failing; it had problems with that. As the Minister said, this matter had no relationship with Coles or Elders IXL Ltd. They are totally unrelated. They are not owned by the Government; they just pay hefty taxes to it. The Government owns currently 100 per cent of this Corporation. The Minister imposes Government policies on it and he requires the plan to be changed. Those obligations are quite fanciful. If he thinks that is the way in which he can conduct the business affairs of a government corporation, I inform him that that is unrealistic and quite outside the laws of the stock exchange on which the Government is to seek listing for the AIDC. Not only that, he is attempting to hide things from the investors, the people out there who put money into the project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the prospectus for this float eventually comes out, we ought to have a good look at it to see what its aims are. If the aims differ from those of a normal prospectus, I suspect the Government is attempting to mislead the public. If they are different from those of a normal prospectus, we will know that seeking a listing for a 10 per cent sale of a government instrumentality is a very poor attempt at conning the public into putting some money into places where the Government should put it. Alternatively, it should privatise the whole operation. A 10, 15 or 20 per cent sale is absolutely nothing and will make a mighty poor investment for the average investor unless the Government comes clean, gives him a fair go and sells the lot, puts it into the commercial sector or funds it properly. It is a mishmash; it is a very poor attempt to do something with what is at the present moment a very poor operation. </PARA>

<PARA>Last night the Government agreed to Australian Democrat amendments to the Social Security Act which require the development of a 008 service. The Government accepted the amendments to ensure the passage of important social security legislation, including record increases to family allowances and the historic indexation of family payments. In doing so, we informed the Democrats that the amendments were purely symbolic because they require what the Department of Social Security already does. Last night Senator Powell said of the amendments:</PARA>

Once again they are trying to make grossly cheap political capital out of a situation which is important, but certainly the outcome of which is not as a result of their making one way or the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These amendments concern the provision of a toll service for social security clients to make calls to the Department of Social Security for the cost of a local call. A report tabled in this Parliament recently by the appropriate committee of this chamber demonstrated that there were shortcomings in the capacity of the Department of Social Security to adequately inform clients and potential clients of changes in Government policy. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has just made the point that many families who are concerned about their capacity to gain access to family assistance packages, the family allowance supplement, and so forth, is a good case in point. For that reason we have always supported the view that the Department of Social Security must ensure, wherever possible, that the availability of services is open to people, especially following changes of policy when, obviously, there is a build-up of interest in what the changes mean and the effect that those changes may have on individual Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday in the Senate when this matter was raised by the Democrats, my colleague Senator Bishop sought leave at the third reading stage of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 to move a motion which would refer the question of costing and other related matters to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration so that it could properly be dealt with. It was the view of the Opposition in another place that those matters might involve some costs. We do not know what costs as the Government has not told us. Of course, the Democrats are not responsible at all for spending money, nor will they ever be. Usually, as a party, they are involved in spending public money willy-nilly merely in an attempt to win the odd vote here and there as a demonstration of their alleged concern for people. I might add that this concern has been stripped absolutely bare by their grotesque behaviour in another place in recent days in relation to the superannuation legislation when they were quite happy to sell down the drain 3.7 million Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, we are not objecting to these amendments. Of course not. This is a sensible proposal, if it can be applied. The Minister has assured us that the only area of Australia which is not effectively covered is parts of country New South Wales. Consequently, we will support the Government's objective in this regard. We certainly do not intend to divide the chamber on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA> That the amendment be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>Without wishing to delay the House unduly, I would like to take this opportunity to make one or two brief comments on the amendment to clause 11 (c) of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 which was passed by the Senate last night. As a consequence of that amendment, clause 11 (c) is to be deferred until 1 January 1990 after the report of the findings of the McGirr inquiry into Commonwealth and allied veterans. While I commend the Opposition's interest in the inquiry I remain unconvinced that that is the real reason for the deferral. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), made it clear in the recent debate in this place that the Opposition is not in basic disagreement with clause 11 (c). This is further reflected in the fact that clause 11 (c) has been left intact and has simply been postponed to a date when its commencement is likely to go more or less unnoticed. As I suggested in this place in relation to this clause during the second reading debate, the Opposition has been under pressure from certain sources to do something about clause 11 (c) and I believe that it has taken the easy way out. The Opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Farrer, said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the coalition accepts that it would be wrong to create a situation which is more generous to British veterans here in Australia than to Australian veterans. </PARA>
<PARA>But, as he very well knows, this amendment may result in British veterans receiving the service pension on far more generous standards than those applicable to Australian veterans if the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) continues to hold to its present line. British and Commonwealth veterans who never left their own country during the war, and many of whom where never in danger from the enemy, could receive a pension which Australians can only receive if they incurred actual danger from the enemy. </PARA>
<PARA> It was never the intention of the Parliament, when the extension of eligibility for such pensions to British and Commonwealth veterans was introduced, that these veterans were to receive pensions on more generous terms than our own veterans. Until the AAT case of Farrow, these veterans have never had any expectation and have never received any promise of being eligible for the service pension. We now have the potential for the Opposition's actions to raise impossible hopes amongst the Australian ex-service community. I remind this chamber that the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Farrer, made it quite clear in this place on 11 May that the Opposition was not addressing the situation of Australian veterans. There is no unlimited fund of money to do so and there is a need to clarify the eligibility of British veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Farrer, previously implied that the Government hoped to ease clause 11 (c) through the Parliament under the umbrella of the extension of benefits for the peacekeeping force in Namibia. That suggestion was completely unfounded. This is simply the first opportunity to clarify the intention of the Act. The Government is not prepared, at this stage, to jeopardise the extension of full repatriation benefits to our Defence Force personnel in Namibia by rejecting the Opposition's amendment. In order to ensure that our Defence Force personnel are not disadvantaged, the Government is reluctantly forced to accept the amendment. In conclusion, Mr Deputy Chairman, I would like to put on record that I wish you a very happy day today and I appreciate the great job that you do in the chair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Affairs Amendment Legislation Bill is an important matter. In one sense, it is quite historic because, except for the amendments relating to the Veterans' Entitlements Act, this is the first time in five years that I have succeeded in getting up a specific amendment to a veterans' Bill for good and proper reason. I welcome the comments by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) that he accepts this amendment, however reluctantly, as was signified at the death-knock last night in the Senate by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus), who represents him in that chamber. This amendment to clause 11 (c) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Page 4, paragraph 11 (c), line 18, to leave out `Commencement: Day of Royal Assent', insert `Commencement: 1 January 1990'. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to clarify the situation because the Minister, in his comments in dealing with this Senate amendment-which was the original amendment moved by me in the House of Representatives many weeks ago-has opened up several aspects which need to be placed in context in the time available. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the coalition has been totally responsible in its approach to this issue. Had we interfered more dramatically with the wording of the Bill, perhaps the Government might have had grounds to criticise us. In fact, we chose a responsible way to tack a very small but significant item on to the legislation which provides repatriation cover for our Australian troops in Namibia. It is not a bad tactic, but it is a sharp tactic. We are seeking to amend a clause buried in an important Bill about which there is no criticism. Of course, all parties fully support the passage of repatriation cover for our Australian troops who are carrying out their quite dangerous duties as members of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group peacekeeping force. I am delighted that there will be no further delay in the passage of this repatriation granting legislation and that the cover, so far as those Australian troops in Namibia are concerned, will be backdated to their embarkation to Namibia last February. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the timetable, this commitment has been in the pipeline for years. Wrangling between the Department of Defence and other departments added to the delays, which resulted in the legislation to provide repatriation cover not even coming before the Parliament until many weeks after our troops were physically on the ground in Namibia on the African continent. The Government has been very slow with the timetable in respect of this legislation. It has now seen the light, and I give credit to the Minister for accepting our amendment to clause 11 (c) of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay tribute to the role of the Returned Services League (RSL) in highlighting the impact of that clause and producing some very interesting, specific cases-some of which came up in Senate debate-concerning eligibility. One case concerned Commonwealth veterans who had moved to Australia, lived here for 10 years and one day, and then applied for assistance. Clause 11 (c) seeks to clarify that the legislation specifically relates to those veterans who have campaign medals and who at some stage during World War II left Britain as part of their service to that country at that time. This has been picked up as part of the Commonwealth allied veterans' entitlement. Mr Deputy Chairman, as you well know, there are Australian soldiers who were issued with a return from active service badge and who, under the previous coalition Government-to be fair-or this Government have not received an eligibility for a service pension. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole area of service pension eligibility, especially as it relates to Commonwealth and allied veterans, has quite properly been referred by the Government to an official inquiry which is being conducted by Jocelyn McGirr, a member of the Repatriation Commission. Here we have the Government wishing to take unilateral action in respect of that eligibility for Commonwealth veterans ahead of the outcome of that official inquiry, which is also looking at the very justifiable case of the merchant marines in terms of their eligibility for coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. We know that that official inquiry will report in September. All we proposed, quite responsibly, was that the commencement date of clause 11 (c) be delayed until 1 January 1990 to allow for the production of that official report into this policy area. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is still in office at that time-it could well not be because the election could be held on 12 August 1989-and the Minister is still in his portfolio, the Government will have the opportunity before 1 January 1990 to alter further the provisions in respect of eligibility of Commonwealth veterans. It may want to legislate further on this matter in the light of the McGirr report. We have made that option available by virtue of our amendment. Alternatively, if, in the light of the McGirr report, the government of the day-whether it be a coalition government or the current Government-decides that the thrust of clause 11 (c) should stand without any further alteration, then the commencement date of 1 January 1990 will automatically apply by virtue of this amendment. This amendment was adopted unanimously in the Senate and hopefully, and I think probably, it will be adopted unanimously by this Committee of the Whole in a few minutes time. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had a breakthrough for commonsense in respect of this amendment. The procedures of our bicameral Parliament and the role of the Senate as a House of review in producing this satisfactory outcome to this important Bill have been justified. I reiterate the coalition's total support for the provision of repatriation cover to our troops serving in Namibia. Further troops will be sent there when the original troops are rolled over at six-monthly intervals, and they, too, will receive repatriation cover. I acknowledge the role of the RSL and its concerns in relation to this question of eligibility. I will be having further discussions with the National President of the RSL in relation to the ramifications of this amendment to clause 11 (c). I look forward to the tabling of the McGirr report-it is due in September-in relation to this issue. Some quite deliberate decisions can be made at that time before the new commencement date of 1 January 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I simply draw the Committee's attention to a letter I received today which deals with veterans' matters. A lady who attended the Sydney Town Hall rally wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> I have never been to any rally like that before and as for speaking out as I did its never been done before. </PARA>
<PARA>She chose to speak out because, as she said:</PARA>
<PARA>You saw us there and as you said we are sick of the way the Hawke has taken so much from us. </PARA>
<PARA>She was referring to veterans and war widows. This lady continued:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I did say any exservice man who votes for the Hawke Government is out of his mind . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I can only concur with that comment from a lady who attended that famous Sydney Town Hall rally involving some 1,500 veterans. It was no rent-a-crowd, but a very wide cross-section of veterans from throughout the Sydney veteran community, including a number of RSL office-bearers. I welcome the change of heart by the Government, demonstrated by its decision to accept our amendment to clause 11 (c)-an amendment which was also supported by that other party in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) said, these amendments arose from some points that we made during the Audit Amendment Bill's progress through the Senate. They have essentially been agreed to in the form that we wanted them. Our concern in both cases I guess was the accountability of the process to Parliament, and the amendments to clauses 7 and 26 establish a procedure that satisfies us. In the case of clause 7, which looks at transferring funds between parliamentary departments, there is now a requirement in the amendment that the Minister may give the direction transferring those funds and any subsequent amendments to that direction only in accordance with the recommendation in writing by either the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House of Representatives, or by both the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, as the case requires. It is in that sense that we have established parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of clause 26, which is to do with providing a statutory basis for legally binding guidelines, the amendment reflects some words of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills to the effect that these regulations will be treated as disallowable instruments, as I understand, for the purposes of section 46a of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, and as with regulations it will be notified in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, tabled in both Houses of Parliament and may be disallowed by either House within 15 sitting days of being tabled in that House. So in both cases parliamentary scrutiny has been re-established to our satisfaction, and we support the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Stage 2 development, Commonwealth Government Centre, Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA>This referral is for the construction and fitout of a 12-storey office building of 12,500 square metres on Federal Government land on the corner of Stanley and Wills Streets in Townsville. The location is adjacent to the existing Commonwealth Centre and will provide a readily identifiable focal point and enhance the service delivery of government activities to the public in the administrative precinct of the city of Townsville. The cost for the construction of this proposed work is $31.5m at May 1989 prices. It is proposed that the building accommodate the entire Australian Taxation Office activity in Townsville and it has been designed to meet the specific requirements of Taxation, including ground floor shopfront space for cashiers and client interviews. Currently the tax offices are spread over three separate locations around the city of Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA> The office has experienced rapid growth due to recent Government initiatives and is also undertaking a major office modernisation program which will significantly increase space requirements. Initially the Australian Taxation Office will occupy eight out of the 10 office floors, the other two levels having been designed to permit a separate tenancy until required for a planned 20 per cent growth of taxation activity in Townsville. Two above-ground parking levels will provide for 100 cars and additional space for motor bikes and bicycles. A basement level for secure storage will also be provided. The existing Commonwealth offices in Townsville are still quite new but are now fully utilised, and client departments are required to lease premises to satisfy their expansion requirements. A number of these leased premises are well below acceptable standards. Substantial long term savings are available through office construction over leasing. </PARA>
<PARA> My Department has determined that savings of $21.2m will be realised over 15 years in Townsville, based on a current rental rate of $240 per square metre and an assumed rental growth of 8.5 per cent per annum. This project demonstrates the Federal Government's on-going commitment to the north Queensland region and will ensure a better delivery of service to the general public in the Townsville area. Subject to parliamentary and Budget approval, construction is expected to commence in March 1990, with completion by March 1992. I table drawings of the proposed works and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose this reference to the Public Works Committee, which no doubt will look at the project with its usual detailed attention. Nevertheless, we again point out to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) that it is our view that, despite the claims that he constantly makes in relation to these references, it is noticeable that with election day coming closer all the time we are having a rash of these developments in sensitive electorates. I quote the Minister's claim in his statement to the House:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Substantial long term savings are available through office construction over leasing. </PARA>
<PARA> My Department has determined that savings of $21.2m will be realised over 15 years in Townsville, based on a current rental rate of $240 per square metre . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This does not take into account all of the costs that the Government would incur or the opportunity cost of the funds-the $31m that is being invested. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the Minister again that, if the Government can find these massive savings in terms of investment in its own buildings, it seems surprising that the Commonwealth Bank and other Government statutory authorities continue to sell pieces of real estate to developers and offer to lend them the money to buy them. The Commonwealth Bank knows that it is much better off having its capital in the business of banking, just as government should have its capital in the business of servicing the community and not in capital assets of this nature. If it is good enough for the Australia and New Zealand Bank and the Commonwealth Bank to sell existing assets and rent them back and if it is good enough for major retailers such as Coles-Myer Ltd to do so, it is a clear message that these very successful business organisations do not find it appropriate to own property of this nature. The claims the Government makes of substantial savings cannot be genuinely substantiated; but it is up to the Public Works Committee to look into that aspect and to report back to this Parliament. We will not stand in the way of the Government's proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> I close by pointing out that we in the Opposition see merit in the efforts that have been made in recent times to decentralise the activities of, for instance, the Australian Taxation Office in a regional centre such as Townsville. We support that wholeheartedly. In fact, we think there should be more of it. It has been a successful move and no doubt the additional premises are needed. The only question we raise is whether taxpayers' money is being spent to the best advantage by building these buildings, as compared with leasing from private enterprise as is being done by so many other business enterprises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This proposal to construct a 12-storey Commonwealth Government office building in Townsville at an estimated cost of $31.5m has been supported by the Minister at the table, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West), for some considerable time in recognition of the recommendation made by his Department that there was an urgent need for these additional facilities in Townsville. The building will be located at the corner of Stanley and Wills Streets, on Federal Government owned land adjacent to the existing Commonwealth Centre. The first Commonwealth Government Centre, costing $12m, was completed in 1985 and opened by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in September of that year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This new building is seen as being essential to accommodate the Australian Taxation Office, which presently operates from rented accommodation in three separate locations in the city of Townsville. The Federal Government, as the Minister said, is expected to reap substantial savings by not having to pay the rent for these existing facilities. I repeat what the Minister said: that is highlighted by the estimate by the Department that there will be savings of $21.2m to be realised over 15 years, based on current rental rates in Townsville of $240 per square metre and an assumed rental growth rate of 8.5 per cent per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> This current project is desperately needed in Townsville. Not only the facilities of the Australian Taxation Office, but also an expansion of other departments in north Queensland to provide for the ever growing population and development that is occurring in that region, have to be accommodated. There is a firm hope that the Cape York space facility will be proceeded with and in that event Townsville will become a major administrative and support centre for that facility. This initiative by the Minister has earned for him the enduring gratitude of the people of north Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Stage 2 development, Commonwealth Government Centre, Hobart. </PARA>
<PARA>This referral is for the construction of stage 2 of the existing Hobart Commonwealth Government Centre to accommodate staff from various Federal Government departments. If agreed to, construction would cost $19.9m as of May 1989. An accommodation study conducted by the Australian Property Group of the Department of Administrative Services determined that there was a need in Hobart for continued growth in office space for Federal government activity. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal would therefore provide an additional 9,200 square metres of usable space on the existing underutilised Commonwealth Centre site. This would not only provide a focus for Federal Government services in a central location in Hobart but also significant savings in rent on leased accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been decided that the Department of Social Security will be the principal occupant of the existing centre, allowing it to collocate various elements currently in leased space. The Australian Taxation Office would vacate the existing centre and move to leased space elsewhere. Occupants of the extension are planned to be the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Official Receiver and legal aid offices of the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Trade Practices Commission, the Australian Electoral Commission and the Department of Administrative Services. A number of these occupants will relinquish leased accommodation, resulting in annual savings of about $2.3m in rent. </PARA>
<PARA> The accommodation study I referred to also highlighted the cost effectiveness of accommodating Australian Public Service staff in Federal government owned buildings as opposed to leased accommodation. It was determined that greater savings would be achieved because of the move to reduce the Federal Government's rental bill through the construction of its own office accommodation. Based on a current rate of $190 per square metre and assuming a rental growth of 5 per cent per annum, savings generated over 15 years through office construction over continued leasing amount to $5.2m in net present value terms. Savings would also be available from collocation of Federal government functions, the provision of common use facilities and more effective service delivery. </PARA>
<PARA> These savings will assist the Government's social justice strategy by minimising the cost of Commonwealth office accommodation in Hobart, resulting in savings in lease costs, and by providing an asset for the Federal Government and increasing the value of the Commonwealth estate as well as utilising a Federal Government owned site suitable for further development. It will also enhance the centre for the delivery of Federal Government services, meet the local council's views on the need for sympathetic development of the block and assist the construction industry and, of course, local employment in Hobart. Subject to parliamentary and Budget approval, construction is expected to start in January 1990 with completion by about December 1991. I table drawings of the proposed works and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

We can only be surprised at the number of motions of this nature coming before the Parliament in this session. Clearly, there is a degree of pork barrelling. I will not repeat the remarks that I made on the previous occasion when I pointed out that the Government should not be spending taxpayers' money in this fashion but should be following the lead given by private enterprise in leasing and encouraging construction of new building for lease back to the Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a couple of brief points. First, I commend the activities of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) in regard to the Commonwealth Government Centre in Hobart. I believe that this project will do much to benefit Hobart, and it will do so in two ways. First, it will benefit those who use the centre. It will enable the centre to return to the function for which it was intended originally-a single location to which people who have business with the Commonwealth can go, confident that their affairs can be dealt with in the one centre. Increasingly, because of the demands on space by the Australian Taxation Office, that has not been the case. The Tax Office has taken over a greater part of the building and various other departments of the Commonwealth have been scattered around the city. This project will enable the Commonwealth to have its services centrally located at great convenience to those who seek to use them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, at present the site is unattractive and very strongly windswept. The design will maximise the utilisation of the site. It will retain some of the best features of the existing site-for example, the sunken gardens-and the street frontage will be dealt with in a sympathetic way, consistent with the lower scale surroundings of the nearby streets. This is a very important and well judged design and I take this opportunity to put on record appreciation for the work to date of the project architect, Harry Leong, who supervised the site and has already done some significant and important design work in Hobart, principally the work on the marine laboratories and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation building. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that for me this project represents a consummation of considerable effort. When I was first elected I was approached by the building and construction industry. I had a number of meetings with that industry which, at the time, was lamenting the downturn in construction and the sluggish state of the Tasmanian economy. There is no doubt that the Tasmanian economy has been very much the sick man of Australia, and obviously the electors have sought to rectify that in the most effective way. We look forward to 28 June when there will be a change of government in Tasmania which will, no doubt, improve the economic circumstances of my State. </PARA>
<PARA> The building and construction industry put to me the need for Commonwealth involvement in building projects. One of the matters which I took up at that point and for which I have continued to lobby is the Commonwealth Government project in Hobart. This is the second major capital works project which I have helped to bring to fruition. Firstly, we had success in obtaining a new building to house the Institute of Antarctic and Southern Ocean Studies at the University of Tasmania, a major development in which key funding status was obtained through the Department of Employment, Education and Training and subsequent capital grants were obtained to ensure that it would be located on the university campus at an estimated cost of $8.2m, based on costing at that time. Probably now it would cost more in the order of $10m, although I do not have the exact figures for present day costings. The Commonwealth Government Centre is the second project on which I have strongly pressed the Minister for Administrative Services since my election. I believe that there is a coherent and logical case for it. It is not a case of pork barrelling. I point out that those who seek to oppose me in my own electorate have consistently argued that a test should be applied to the success of local members-their capacity to bring home the bacon. With these two major capital works projects, I feel very proud at least to have had a big bite at a big hunk of bacon. </PARA>

<PARA> A range of allegations appeared in the media in early 1988 and included: a bonus payment to a shipowner was incorrectly paid; there were irregularities in overtime payments to the same shipowner; and certain bills lodged by the same shipowner were unjustified. Another allegation was reported claiming irregularities in the tender process for the construction of Australia's new Antarctic vessel, the Aurora Australis. </PARA>
<PARA> That was not all. Further allegations surfaced once submissions were called for. These included concerns about the performance of the Division's shipping broker; that the Commonwealth procedures had not been followed in arranging a fruit and vegetable contract; that the Lady Franklin, a vessel chartered by the Division for the past expedition season, was unsafe; that there were irregularities in the tender process; and allegations about staff-management relations. </PARA>
<PARA> As if that were not enough, the Committee was also embroiled in the resolution of a conflict over the status of the charter party of the Division's major carrier, the Icebird, and the circumstances surrounding the retirement of the former Director of the Division in December 1988. Some of the matters were investigated by the Australian Audit Office, the Australian Federal Police and a special committee set up by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories-the Division's parent Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's findings on these issues were consistent with the findings of the other agencies in that the Division has had a history of lack of care in some administrative matters. That kind of sloppiness generated concerns that business dealings were not conducted at arm's length and that certain companies were being favoured. A concern also developed that not all available information was considered in coming to decisions on these concerns which in turn led to a lack of trust in the Division. At the same time, this lack of trust was generated by Division staff leaking information to the press and running their allegations in public. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations concerning the bonus payment, overtime payment, the fruit and vegetable contract, the tender process for the new vessel, and the safety of the Lady Franklin, although there have been continuing assertions about the Lady Franklin which the Committee has referred to the Department. The matter of the Icebird contract was resolved within the Icebird related companies and the potential that existed for the Icebird to be removed from service-a very serious matter in the Committee's view-was not realised. However, this issue highlighted the negligence of both the brokers and the Division in not checking the contract carefully and not monitoring all developments in the Icebird companies. A close relationship has existed between the Division and the brokers since the early 1950s. The Committee is concerned that a formal relationship apply and that performance review mechanisms be exercised periodically in the event of a broker being used constantly by a government agency. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to issues on which the Committee can be more positive. The Committee conducted an inspection of the Kingston headquarters of the Antarctic Division in July 1988. From that exposure, in addition to the content of submissions and the evidence presented to the Committee-not to mention the direct experience of one of our members, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), in the Antarctic-the Committee became impressed by the committment and enthusiasm of Division staff to the Antarctic and Australia's Antarctic program. However, in conjunction with that has come an awareness of the alarming state of resources within the Division. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee asked for a submission from the Division and was confronted by facts that would lead to a reduction in the Division's programs. There was no safety officer; stores and equipment were running down to crucial levels; and the number of expeditioners had increased significantly in recent years, leading to a range of administrative strains. The Committee is convinced that the Division must be provided with further resources for it to maintain a safe, efficient and productive program. The assessment of the Division to do this at a very basic level would mean an increase of $1.2m and 20 staff. The Committee has recommended that the Department of Finance give urgent consideration to an increase in funds using this assessment as a guideline. </PARA>
<PARA> The second positive area focused on by the Committee was scientific activity. The Committee was cognisant of the important role played by the Antarctic Science Advisory Committee (ASAC). In examining ASAC's role in relation to the Committee's terms of reference, the Committee was keen to encourage a broader representation on ASAC and to provide qualified involvement with Antarctic management in so far as it impacted on the implementation of science programs.</PARA>
<PARA> Before turning to my final comments in relation to the tabling of the report, I take this opportunity to thank, first of all, Andrew Newmarch from the Public Accounts Committee staff and two other members-Amanda Garlick and Celeste Conlan-for their help in preparing the report. Most of all, I thank my colleagues for their dedication over the quite long period of the Committee's inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I leave this final sentiment and philosophy with the House tonight because in some ways, I guess, the Committee's report amounted to a turning point in what started out to be purely an administrative inquiry, because that inquiry was overtaken in the past few weeks by the Government's statement that it will not sign the Antarctic minerals convention, but rather will seek to implement a conservation strategy. The Public Accounts Committee believes that this course of action will undoubtedly place further policy and administrative strains on the Division but believes that it will be significant in preserving the last vestige of pristine environment for the world. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes to amend the Subsidy (Cultivation Machines and Equipment) Act 1986 and the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Act 1985, to give effect to Government decisions announced in the economic statement of 12 April 1989. The intent of the proposed amendments is to terminate both subsidy schemes as from 12 April 1989, with a two-month transitional provision for the phasing out of the schemes, which will give the industry time to adjust to the new trading environment. As outlined by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the April economic statement, the Government is determined to ensure that fiscal policy is kept tight in order to maintain downward pressure on Australia's trade deficit. To that end the Government has decided to implement a number of savings measures which will be incorporated in the August 1989 Budget. These savings are intended to offset the cost of the measures announced in the economic statement which will assist families and pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of these strong budgetary pressures the Government considers it would be inappropriate to exempt outlays associated with industry assistance and development. In the Government's view, the most appropriate means of effecting the necessary savings in this area is to terminate the grain harvesting and cultivation equipment assistance schemes. Neither of these schemes has made a contribution commensurate with its cost towards achievement of the Government's policy goal of creating internationally competitive and export oriented Australian industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has put in place a range of positive assistance measures aimed at improving the efficiency and international competitiveness of our manufacturing sector which have been available to the grain harvester and cultivation equipment manufacturing sectors. These include the heavy engineering program, the 150 per cent research and development tax incentives, grants for industrial research and development, and a range of extension services through the National Industry Extension Service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to address the Bill. The Subsidy Legislation Amendment Bill is designed to terminate subsidy schemes to give effect to Government decisions announced in the April economic statement. The termination of these assistance schemes will result in savings to the Government of $19m during 1989-90 and $10.4m during 1990-91. One can deduct from that figure the cost of recalling the House of Representatives, which totals about half a million dollars. The cost saving in this legislation is obviously favoured by the Government. However, as far as the industry knew, assistance under the Subsidy (Cultivation Machines and Equipment) Act and the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Act was due to be paid on 31 December 1990. Further, the Industries Assistance Commission inquiry into the industry last year supported the continuation of the bounties. It suggested that they should be extended beyond 1990. The farming industry helps our balance of payments situation. The Government's debts do not help.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is particularly difficult for an industry to operate in an environment in which the rules of the game are consistently changing. This Government has ensured that few, if any, industries have not been affected by its inability to recognise the commercial need for some sort of consistency, and consistency is one of the hallmarks of business. Opposition members have spoken in this chamber time and again about this need for consistency, but to no avail. Consequently, I now move, on behalf of the Opposition, the following second reading amendment which has been circulated in my name:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> `whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) its peremptory action in terminating bounties without notice; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) its disregard of the need for certainty and predictability in industry policy; and</PARA>
<PARA> calls on the Government to announce as quickly as possible the proposed new policy initiatives promised in the April economic statement'. </PARA>
<PARA>It will be recalled that when the Government announced the termination of the subsidies it stated that it would shortly bring forward new policy initiatives relevant to this sector. There has been a deafening silence. Government members departed for their winter vacations but they forgot that the House may be recalled. I repeat that the Government said it would shortly bring forward new policy initiatives relevant to this sector. The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) would know only too well that there have been no new policy initiatives in this area. Instead, Government members departed for their winter vacations. Half a million dollars later we have returned here, and we see no new initiatives. </PARA>

The Government says that it will knock off the subsidies, and that a grand plan will be introduced, yet it does not introduce a grand plan but still knocks off the subsidies. It is not surprising that facets of industry and the Western Australian Government-and it has quite a record!-have been arguing for interim assistance. The Government's amendments will go some way towards providing that interim assistance. It is a pity that the Government does not consider this sort of need prior to the introduction of legislation. This series of amendments is aimed at easing the period of transition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Subsidy Legislation Amendment Bill. This legislation is part of the Government's overall program to reduce protection, over time, to Australian industry, to expose industries to the true costs of international competition and to encourage, through other positive assistance measures, increasing exports by manufacturing in Australia. Since this Government was elected in March 1983 we have embarked on a range of programs in a number of industries which have been aimed at reducing, over time, the protection regimes which apply to those industries. A few which come to mind immediately are the textiles, clothing and footwear industry plan which was announced late in 1986 and which comes into effect this year, the motor vehicle industry plan, the steel industry plan, the chemical industries plan and a whole range of other specific industry plans which have as their objective the reduction of protection over time and the exposure of those industries to true international competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will make a general comment in response to the contribution made by the shadow Minister for business, privatisation and consumer affairs, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). Australia has suffered from the legacy of the McEwen years-if I may explain them in that way-in which industry in Australia was protected by an extremely high wall of protection. It was part of a strategy in which that Government in the 1950s and 1960s thought that Australia's future prosperity could be provided basically from the sheep's back simply by exporting a bit of wool and a bit of wheat and a few of the minerals that we dig up out of the ground. It was through that strategy that it was thought that Australia could in the long term maintain and improve living standards. The growing internationalisation of world economies and the growing international trade in manufactured and value added goods has shown in the 1980s that countries which want to maintain and improve living standards over time cannot rely on a strategy which simply provides for exports from primary industries and a high wall of protection in the traded goods industries. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia is to improve its living standards over time-that certainly is a fundamental objective of this Government-it is essential that, while we do not diminish the efforts of our primary industries, we expose our value added industries to world competition and through positive assistance measures encourage those industries to get into the export market and export goods and services in the value added area. We live in a part of the world which is now the fastest growing regional economy in the world-the Pacific basin. More goods are now traded across the Pacific than across any other trading areas in the world. We in Australia have to be part of that regional economy. It is essential if we want to improve our living standards that manufactured goods and exports of services are encouraged and increased in the world market. </PARA>
<PARA> In his contribution the shadow Minister suggested that little or no assistance was provided by this Government to the agricultural equipment sector. The Government has put in place a range of positive assistance measures which are aimed at improving the efficiency and international competitiveness of our manufacturing sector. These measures have been available to the grain harvester and cultivation equipment manufacturing sectors. In that respect, I refer to the heavy engineering program, the 150 per cent research and development tax incentive scheme, the grants for industrial research and development and, of course, a range of extension services provided through the national industry extension service. All of those programs have been available to the agricultural equipment sector, and particularly to those firms in the business of manufacturing grain harvesters and cultivation equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> The grain harvesters and cultivation equipment industry is part of the agricultural equipment sector which, according to the latest data I have, has a total employment of nearly 8,000 people and total sales of around $570m. It is a sector of some importance to the economy. In the total sales of $570m, imports coming into Australia of that agricultural equipment totalled $190m in 1986-87 and exports of Australian produced agricultural equipment sold overseas totalled only $49m in 1987-88. Out of an industry of $570m or more per annum the exports in the last year for which data is available totalled only $49m. Despite the assistance given over a period of years by this Government through a range of programs, the export numbers which derive from this industry are still very small in percentage terms. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in the introduction to my speech, if Australia is to maintain and improve its living standards over time it is essential that we begin to export far more products than we presently export. Despite the fact that we have given a range of general assistance to this industry, as well as providing bounties over a period of years, it has not taken up the opportunities available to it in exporting goods overseas. Bounty assistance has been provided to this industry for the production of grain harvesters and equipment and cultivation machines and equipment. The production of bountiable goods is a small percentage of total agricultural equipment. Some figures might put that in perspective. For instance, sales of bountiable harvesters were only $36m in 1987-88. That is about 6 per cent. Sales of bountiable cultivation equipment were $102m in 1987-88. That is about 18 per cent. We can then say that the total employment involved in the production of bountiable goods was around 2,000 people. We provided through this bounty program in 1987-88 bounty assistance which totalled approximately $4m for grain harvesting equipment, which went to some 19 firms, and $11m for cultivation machinery which benefited 153 firms. That is the background to this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister at the table, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons), has indicated in his introductory remarks to this Bill that since the terms of trade collapse in 1985-86 the Government has had to make some tough decisions in relation to fiscal policy, industry policy, wages policy and monetary policy. The decision which we took earlier this year to terminate bounties to sections of this industry was taken in the context of fiscal policy. We had to keep fiscal policy extremely tight and we had to look at all elements of government expenditure. Bounties are certainly part of that. If we are looking at government spending overall it is not reasonable to say that some areas of government spending should be eligible for cuts and others not eligible. We have to look at the whole range of government spending. In doing that we have to look at industry assistance programs. So we looked at the money which we provide by way of bounties and other assistance to this industry. The Cabinet had to make a decision about whether the bounties, which are basically a taxpayer subsidy, were leading to a more competitive and export oriented industry. The conclusion which the Government reached after a full examination of all the facts in relation to this taxpayer subsidy was that this industry was not exporting more and it was not competing any better with imports into Australia. The issue of whether the bounty was assisting this industry to be more competitive was therefore questionable. </PARA>
<PARA> I talked earlier about the importance of exports. In this industry in 1987-88, again the last financial year for which figures are available, exports of grain harvesters and cultivation equipment totalled about $4.5m; that is, 3 per cent of sales. That is well below the average for manufacturing industry in Australia. Australia does have some economic problems and, as I have indicated, that means that the Government has to respond in a serious and determined way through its industry policies, its fiscal policies, its money policies and its wages policies. I have been a member of this place for more than six years and I always find it confusing, if not somewhat irritating, that the Opposition, which fairly consistently opposes in this place virtually all of the tough decisions which this Government makes, never offers any alternative policy of its own. Governments do not enjoy making tough decisions. For instance, governments do not enjoy making the vast array of expenditure cuts which we have had to make to Budget outlays over the past few years to reduce Budget spending. </PARA>

We had seven years of the Fraser Government and, despite all the rhetoric about small government, better government and more efficient government, nothing was ever achieved during that period. The Opposition knows and the honourable member making that interjection knows that government outlays as a proportion of GDP during the Fraser years increased. The Opposition comes in here and waxes lyrical about the tough decisions the Government is making and how they ought to be made over a longer period, and how dare we hurt individual firms or industries, but when it comes to making the hard decisions which are needed in the Australian economy, the Opposition simply does not have the gumption to propose any policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I spoke in the debate on the matter of public importance today-I will not deviate from the Bill for more than a minute to make this point-about the alleged lack of a government strategy to tackle our economic problems. We listened to two Opposition speakers, including the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). He has not once come into this place and outlined what the Opposition's alternative strategy would be for the economy. Those opposite harp about wages and fiscal policy, spending cuts, the tax cuts which are coming up on 1 July, and high interest rates, but when it comes to putting the policies on the table and letting the public know what the alternative government's policies and strategies might be for the economy, there is this horrifying vacuum-just nothing comes from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I see the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) in the chamber tonight. I hope he will make some meaningful contribution towards this debate and towards outlining what the Opposition would do not just to this legislation, but to broader legislation concerning industry assistance, because that is very much the substance of this Bill. This Government has put in place a plan for the motor vehicle industry. Here we have a remarkable thing: the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) is shaking hands with the endorsed candidate for the seat of, I think, Bruce. </PARA>

The reality is that the public is very confused about the sorts of policies the Opposition might offer if elected to government in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come back to the Bill before the House. Less than one-third of the agricultural equipment sector is employed in producing bountiable goods. Sales of those goods total 24 per cent of sales of agricultural equipment. The bountiable goods sector is focused on the domestic market, with export sales, as I have indicated, being only 3 per cent of total sales. The Government had to take a tough decision. We have had to take tough decisions ever since the terms of trade collapsed in 1985-86. As I have said, those decisions have resulted in a reduction of government outlays from close to 30 per cent in 1985-86 to around 25 per cent today. In terms of the overall Budget figures, we have turned around the $9.6 billion deficit which we inherited in 1983 to a surplus which this financial year will run ahead of $5 billion or $6 billion. So there has been a dramatic turnaround in fiscal policy under this Government. We have provided smaller government but better government and we have targeted programs according to needs. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Subsidy Legislation Amendment Bill, we had to take the tough decision, the hard decision, about taxpayers' money being used to provide bounties to a particular industry. They had been provided for some time but, despite those bounties, there was no substantial evidence that the industry was becoming more competitive, that it was replacing more imports of agricultural equipment or that it was getting into the business of exports. As I said, exports from this bountiable goods sector were only 3 per cent of total sales. If taxpayer subsidies are to be used to support industry, to provide a protection regime, they ought to be provided on the basis that those industries get into the business of exporting goods and services and thereby contribute to improving Australia's export performance and so reduce our balance of payments deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that this Government has put in place a range of industry programs. They have applied to industries such as the textiles, clothing and footwear industry, the motor vehicle industry, the steel industry and the chemical industry. Over time, they will lead to reductions in protection, and in doing so they will lead to a better economic performance in Australia. They will open up Australian industry to proper international competition, they will reduce taxpayer outlays and, over time, we will see-the evidence is already there-more exports of value added goods and lower costs; and consumers will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this was a hard decision for the Government to take, but I think it is the right decision. It is consistent with our policy of reducing protection. I hope that Opposition speakers in this debate will at least have the fortitude to embrace the need for a lower industry protection regime, because through lower industry protection we can provide a more internationally competitive Australian economy and a better deal for consumers. I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), and in so doing I take exception to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby). I think the way the Government is treating both the grain harvester industry and the agricultural cultivation industry in this legislation is typical of its treatment of so many parts of rural Australia. What we are seeing is almost a double standard. We have listened to an apologist for the Government talk about how we are going to make the industry more competitive and how it is important that we should make the industry face international competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But we are talking about an industry that gets absolutely no protection. When the really hard decisions have to be made and when the Government has to face up to reality it still offers the motor vehicle industry and the textile industry considerable protection, despite all its claims of being a government that offers low protection and so on. In fact, in the motor vehicle industry there is still at least 50 per cent tariff protection, and in the textile industry the level of protection is even higher. Yet because the Government decided-I must admit that I agree with it-to replace a tariff with a bounty, it now refers to taxpayers' subsidies for an industry of the order of only 10 per cent. The Government conveniently talks about subsidies for other areas in Australia in a different language. It is interesting to compare the difference between the bounties and the subsidies. In an industry about which the Government really does not care too much it keeps talking about taxpayers' subsidies, yet when we look at tariff protection we see that consumer subsidies are treated differently. </PARA>
<PARA> The Subsidy Legislation Amendment Bill highlights the Government's treatment of rural industries and, in particular, the lack of consistency, the lack of predictability and the lack of certainty. The Government has talked about what it is doing for the industry-things such as the heavy engineering plan, the 150 per cent research and development write-off, the extension services and various such things. But they are fairly minor and very much on the fringe of what is involved in this industry. As I have said, we have seen a total lack of consistency, predictability and certainty. We should consider those businesses that are manufacturing grain harvesters or cultivation equipment and consider the decision making process of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has actually legislated to pay bounties until the end of 1990. That is a further 18 months away. The Government has actually passed a Bill to do this. We can imagine the industry saying, `Okay, we will plan on the fairly predictable basis of what the Government is going to do'. What has happened? Last year there was an Industries Assistance Commission report which not only supported the payment of that bounty-which is only 10 per cent of the wholesale price-but also recommended that it should be extended. We can imagine the bewilderment of manufacturers after the April economic statement, in which the Government said, `We will not continue this program for the 18 months that we promised and legislated to do through an Act of Parliament. We will suddenly chop it off'. Imagine the bewilderment of the manufacturers who had thought that they could plan on that and knew that the Industries Assistance Commission recommended the continued payment of the bounty. </PARA>
<PARA> Some manufacturers have made a couple of comments which I think highlight their bewilderment when they suddenly realised that the Government had reneged on what they thought was a fairly watertight guarantee. One manufacturer sent a letter to all his dealers in which he said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a comprehensively undesirable situation that Manufacturers, Machinery Dealers, and Australian farmers have been placed in. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I would stress the arbitrary and brutal way in which the Government has acted in this case . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was the reaction of one of the manufacturers. What have the manufacturers actually done with this bounty? As this manufacturer pointed out, the bounty enabled his firm to restrict price rises. By way of example, the price rise on one of his machines has been less than 5 per cent per annum in the past five years. I think that is quite an achievement. Not only is it something that the manufacturer should be proud of but it shows that he was trying to service his customers. One can imagine his bewilderment when he found that, overnight, the Government had whipped away something that he believed the Parliament had guaranteed for at least another 18 months. The Government obviously felt that it could keep changing the rules whenever it suited it. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened subsequently? We have seen the oldest trick in the book, known as the hard copper and the soft copper. In other words, a hard talking person comes into a room and hits those within it very hard. The hard person then leaves the room and the soft talking one comes in. After the hard copper says, `We will chop the whole thing off in April', the soft copper comes in and says, `Maybe we should reconsider. Any firm order as of 12 April would still attract the bounty'. The Government is hoping that it will not have to carry the odium that it ought to carry for having reneged not only on a promise but also on a piece of legislation that guaranteed that this bounty would be paid at least until the end of 1990. So the Government has played the oldest trick in the book and it deserves to be condemned for it. That is one of the reasons that we have moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hard not to believe that the Government had planned this all along-that the April economic statement would announce the hard decision that on 12 April all manufactured items would no longer attract a bounty and then the Government would come back with the soft-soaping statement that any firm orders would be honoured. This is fairly typical of the way this Government has behaved in a number of areas. It is reminiscent of its treatment of a number of other groups. I draw attention to one that is affected in my area, the primary industry manufacturers. Unlike the manufacturers of grain harvesters and cultivation equipment, tractor manufacturers in Australia get a raw deal. I wish briefly to recall a speech I made in this place on 13 April last year, when I drew to the attention of this chamber the treatment received by tractor manufacturers in Australia, referring in particular to Waltanna Tractors in my electorate. As this manufacturer has to import some of the parts that go into his tractors, he has to pay duty on those parts, yet if someone wants to import a complete tractor there is no duty whatsoever. If ever there were a case of a government discriminating against a local manufacturer, that must be it. I drew this to the attention of the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), who said in his reply to the debate that he would undertake a further examination of that matter. Despite the fact that this was over 12 months ago, nothing has been done to address this problem. In other words, this manufacturer still has to pay import duty on the parts that go into the tractors that he assembles, yet someone who brings in a fully imported tractor pays no duty. I wonder where the consistency of the Government is when it talks about trying to make industry more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to add a little to my example of Waltanna Tractors. Despite this discrimination, it is continuing to try to develop new products and has developed an extremely innovative product this year-namely, a tractor that has rubber tracks rather than the normal tyres. This not only improves the pulling ability of the tractor but also reduces the compacting of the soil, which can be an environmental problem. Despite the fact that this Government gives this firm negative assistance, it has continued to show that it is determined to be at the forefront of manufacturing in this country. I wonder why the Government continues to treat agricultural manufacturers with such disdain and why it refuses to provide a consistent and predictable policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the point that a number of manufacturers believed, in good faith, that this Government had passed a Bill that would guarantee that a bounty would be continued at least until the end of next year, yet by the stroke of a pen the Government decided, in its statement on 12 April, that it would chop out that bounty and leave those people high and dry. For that reason, it is my pleasure to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Ryan. I would like to read part of the amendment to honourable members. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the House condemns the Government for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) its peremptory action in terminating bounties without notice; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) its disregard of the need for certainty and predictability in industry policy; and</PARA>
<PARA>calls on the Government to announce as quickly as possible the proposed new policy initiatives promised in the April economic statement. </PARA>
<PARA>On that last point, I would like to draw to the attention of honourable members the fact that, despite the April economic statement promising new initiatives, it is now June and we have heard nothing about those initiatives. I can sympathise with the manufacturers of grain harvesters and cultivation equipment if they feel very disillusioned with the treatment that this Government has given them. Clearly, many people would like to see these wonderful new initiatives if they are going to take away support, because then the following question arises: Why is it that nothing has been announced?</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude on this point: The honourable member for Bendigo seemed to take a bit of latitude and asked where the Opposition's policies are. I can tell the honourable member for Bendigo that there are well over 20 policies that have now been issued by the coalition Opposition. If the honourable member for Bendigo cannot get hold of copies of them, I will not assist him in finding them. Some of those policies have covered the major areas of economic policy. In particular, the industrial relations policy which has been on the table now for three years and which has been modified is not only well known but also highly regarded throughout industry. Likewise, the framework of the economic policy was released well over a year ago, and the detailed policy no doubt will be released fairly soon. For members of the Government to suggest that the policies are not available merely shows their ignorance and inability to bother to read what has been published. We have released well over 20 policies. They have been very well received, and I suggest that the members of the Government should spend a little less time trying to mislead members in this chamber about the reality of what is going on. I have pleasure in supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Ryan. I suggest that the Government has behaved in a very shabby manner in the way it has treated the manufacturers of grain harvesting equipment and cultivation equipment. </PARA>

It is very interesting to see the way in which the opposition has treated this legislation. The relevant extract from Hansard of 8 June 1989 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next Bill we are debating is the Subsidy Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, which is designed to terminate the Subsidy (Cultivation Machines and Equipment) Act 1986 and the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Act 1985. This Bill has its origins in the April economic statement-</PARA>
<PARA>that has been referred to by other honourable members tonight-</PARA>
<PARA>The termination of these assistance schemes will result in a saving to the Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>that is a saving to the public, the taxpayers-</PARA>
<PARA>of $19m during 1989 and $10.4m during 1990-91. Whilst the Bill is obviously favourable for the Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is an interesting statement. It makes one think that legislation is put through Parliament, according to the honourable senator, on the basis of its being favourable to the Government. I thought it would be favourable to the basic economic thrust of policy within Australia. Senator MacGibbon went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it does not do much for the industry operating in an environment of total unpredictability. </PARA>
<PARA>This legislation had a sunset clause in it and in its original introduction stated that there would be a four-year sunset clause. How the Opposition can say it is unpredictable is beyond me because, at the end of a four-year sunset clause, every industry will be on notice that the type of bounty that is available will have been available only for that time. Senator MacGibbon said:</PARA>
<PARA>The industry was told some time ago that this bounty would stay on grain harvesters and farm equipment. In the April statement the ground was cut from under its feet. The Bill contains an amendment to provide a transitional period. </PARA>
<PARA>That would take the industry through until July 1989. There follows the crux of the matter. This is where the hypocrisy of those on the other side of the House comes in. Senator MacGibbon in the Senate said:</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the Opposition does not oppose the legislation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members sitting on the other side of the House tonight do not oppose the legislation that was introduced in relation to measures announced in the April statement. Opposition members in the Senate went on to move the following second reading amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA>this is not the shadow Minister at the table, but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA>condemns the Government for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) its peremptory action in terminating the bounties without notice; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) its disregard of the need for certainty and predictability in industry policy; and</PARA>
<PARA>calls on the Government to introduce as quickly as possible the proposed new policy initiatives promised in the April statement. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the total input from the Opposition in relation to this legislation in debate in the Senate on 8 June 1989 by Senator MacGibbon. It leads me to expand the debate into the sort of operation we had at that time when industries in Australia were struggling, on many occasions, to develop an industry which was worth while and economical, and where they had a market where they could sell their products. Many of the industries in Australia have had to face up to one or two economic decisions during the last 15 years. Firstly, could they develop an industry based on an Australian market? Secondly, did they have the capacity to develop an industry which could expand into a world market with great potential? Tragically, many of the industries which had Australia's agricultural industry as a base could not, and did not, have the opportunity to expand in a way which would enable them to substantially develop on the world scene. </PARA>
<PARA> In the late 1970s and early 1980s we had an opportunity in Australia to develop industries which could have sold their products on worldwide markets. The question should be asked: Why did we not do that? Why were they denied the opportunity to do that? We need to go back a bit further to look at Australian industry during the last 30 or 40 years to see what has happened in Australia. Our motor car industry is one example. In 1952-53 Australia was producing the equivalent number of cars to that produced by Japanese manufacturers-between 300,000 and 400,000 motor vehicles a year. Today, the Japanese industry, without any protection, produces 17 million cars a year. The Australian industry, which has been protected behind a tariff wall, and which tried to develop its industry based on a population of 12 to 13 million people in those years, still produces between 350,000 and 500,000 vehicles a year. </PARA>
<PARA> There is clear evidence that there have been two policy operations afoot in the economics of manufacturing in Australia. One is the policy that the Japanese adopted in the 1950s, which set them on the path to conquering the world. The other was a clear indication in Australia, supported by Liberal and National Party conservative governments, that we should hide behind tariff walls. As a result, companies stagnated and went absolutely nowhere in the world market. A lot of our grain harvester and tillage equipment manufacturers found themselves facing the problem that, rather than having a worldwide approach to their production, their approach was based on subsidies and tariff protection, on closed shop operations. We have suffered, as a nation, because of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983 and the election of the Hawke Labor Government, things have changed. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) espoused this very clearly at Question Time today when he detailed to the Australian people the fact that we have been obliged to put into operation policies which should have been implemented many years ago. The legislation before us deals with a small sector of the Australian manufacturing industry which is seeking to produce a product based on the Australian market alone. These manufacturers have had up to 30 years to develop behind tariff walls, behind protection. But the policies have been wrong. I am not saying that those who ran or worked in this sector were not good operators or good managers, but the policies imposed on them for those 20 to 25 years meant that they were aiming at a very small market. At no stage were they in a position to look outward and compete on a world market. They were producing for a very restricted market. </PARA>
<PARA> We can add to that policies which were based on fixed exchange rates. In the late 1970s and early 1980s these manufacturers had to deal with an exchange rate that made it virtually impossible to compete against imports. I first arrived in this Parliament in 1980 and I made speeches in this place in 1981 criticising the Fraser Government for the policies it was putting forward during the resources boom at that time. It was saying that we would be able to sell so many resources on the world markets, that our exports of coal, wool, and wheat would be so astronomical-I do not know where it got its advice from-that we would need to import to balance our payments. So we were to have a situation which was to be the opposite of what we are facing today. The Government of that time regulated the exchange rate, and had many of these industries been in operation today they would have been looking outward and not inward. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of those industries, because of the sort of people in charge of them and the skills of the workers, would have been able, given the opportunity, to compete on the world market and sell their products. They would not have been selling one or two grain harvesters in Australia; they would have been selling hundreds on the world market had they been competitive. But, because the then Government and the bureaucrats were setting the exchange rate, there was no way that they could have been competitive in those days. The Government at the time had regulations in place which restricted their ability to sell on the world market. The then Government allowed companies from overseas to have subsidiaries here but denied them access to the world market. We are paying the price for that today. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill tonight recognises reality. Senator MacGibbon, in his speech in the Senate on 8 June 1989, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the Opposition does not oppose the legislation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition realises the mistakes made in the past. It is putting forward an amendment which says that we are being a little bit rough because we are taking tough decisions, but it does not oppose the legislation. Even the Opposition recognises that this Government is putting in place the correct economic measures. If members of the Opposition who debate this issue tonight wish to challenge me, perhaps they may consult some of the new candidates they have endorsed for some of their seats. Even some of the candidates endorsed for the Liberal Party in the last month will tell us-and they have told it to me privately-that they do not have any time for the policies that were adopted by the previous coalition Government. They have said to me-and in particular the endorsed candidate Ian McLachlan-in the last day or two--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I spoke to him three years ago when I was leading the Prime Minister's country task force around Australia. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons), will back me up on this. Ian McLachlan said to me that the Government was instituting the measures that he wished conservative governments had put in place in the past. He said that we were doing the hard work, and perhaps his supporters would pick up the benefits of it. No doubt that sort of attitude prevails in the community today. There are opportunists out there who see that this Labor Government has set out not only to turn the Australian economy around but also to take issues to the public. That should have been done many years ago. The Hawke Labor Government should not have had to bring such measures in. Australia wasted seven years of opportunity under the Fraser Administration. I do not quibble about that, because we have fronted up to these issues. We have put in place measures which have rectified the taxation system; we have put measures in place to assist heavy engineering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just yesterday I had the pleasure of visiting a heavy engineering firm in Moorabbin. The executive officer of the Latrobe Regional Commission and I talked to businessmen who will be travelling to London next week. One hundred businessmen are going to London to speak to a United Kingdom investment and trade seminar on the basis that we are now looking out to the world, not inwards. This man, who is in the heavy engineering business, explained to us how, in the late 1970s, week after week he watched his colleagues go broke. Luckily, and with good business management, he was in a position to take advantage of some of the sales taking place then. In his factory I saw heavy engineering equipment that today would cost $4 1/2m to $5m to buy new. In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, with his skill in tool making and in computerisation, he put that equipment into operation and today he has one of the best heavy engineering facilities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have people who have taken an opportunity, who have really worked hard under the economic policies that this Government has put in place. I could take an hour to talk about other companies which have done exactly the same thing. Those companies and their workers realised that they had no future in dealing with a population of only 16 million people in a world that has 5,000 million potential customers. They are looking outwards now. This legislation is saying to people in those industries that unless they set their sights on world markets, unless they set their sights on world opportunities, there is not a great deal of future for them. One's time is limited if one thinks that one can make equipment in a world competitive situation based on a small production and without any real outlook on the world market. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment moved by the Opposition states-referring to the Government:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) its peremptory action in terminating bounties without notice;</PARA>
<PARA>that is totally wrong because there was at least four years notice-</PARA>
<PARA> (b) its disregard of the need for certainty and predictability in industry policy; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is no way in the world that there is not certainty. There is no way that it is not predictable. We are saying to people in industry that the days behind the McEwen wall are gone. They must look to the world market; they must look to producing economically. It is no good any government in Australia saying today to a producer, `You must produce a product' or `You will be able to produce a product for $30,000', if our competitors can deliver it to us from overseas, with shipping costs included, for $20,000. That is an absolute charge on the Australian customer and on the consumer which in the long run spells ill for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last couple of minutes available to me I would like to stress the importance to rural Australia of the changes that have occurred. The area that I represent in McMillan is one of the major dairy areas of Australia. I keep repeating this because I think it is very important. I attended a meeting of some 1,500 irate producers in my electorate at which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and I sat on the stage and explained what we were doing for the dairy industry. At that big public meeting, I felt, from the stage, that we had a good reception from the majority of those at the meeting. However, outside that meeting we saw the Minister's car kicked in, we saw the police car kicked in and we saw a massive demonstration on behalf of rural and conservative Australia. This happened not very long ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Honestly, I could take that Minister back to that area tomorrow and he would be praised and thanked for the strength of his conviction and for the changes that he has made to that industry. The future that that industry has today is new; the industry is reinvigorated and it is outward looking. All I can say to our Opposition opponents is, `Stop looking backwards'. If they ever want to get anywhere they should start looking forward. This Government has done more for this nation in seven years than they could possibly have done in thirty years. </PARA>

He stood up with 20 minutes to speak on the Subsidy Legislation Amendment Bill. His object was to talk out the time so that hopefully the Government would be able to bring in some amendments which we are due to discuss tonight. He has actually managed to achieve it. He has spoken for 20 minutes on a Bill in which he obviously had some peripheral-and I use the word in its kindest sense-interest and knowledge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was transfixed by his statement, which I think goes to the very heart of many Government statements at the moment, that he had spoken to Mr McLachlan, the recently endorsed candidate for Barker, and Mr McLachlan had endorsed the Government's policies in relation to this matter. When I interjected and asked him when he had spoken to Mr McLachlan, he answered that it was three years ago. I think that is a real measure of this Government's attitude to and involvement with current situations in Australia. Three years ago would be about where the Government is at when discussing the matters which are before the nation at present. If one looks at any of the issues which come before the Parliament at the moment, three years ago would be almost exactly where the Government would be thinking and acting. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that we are here as a Parliament because the Government has to put before the Parliament amendments moved in the Senate in relation to a number of Bills. The Senate has been considering those Bills, the Government has not been able to deal with the situation and now we have before the Parliament a matter on which the Government Whip has to stand up and speak for 20 minutes in the vain, inglorious hope that the Government will have some messages from the Senate which this House can consider. I just hope that those people who are listening to this broadcast will understand that this House of Representatives has been brought back, at a prodigious cost to the Australian taxpayer, at this stage simply to look at matters which have been before the Senate and at this hour of the night, 16 minutes past 9 o'clock, those matters are still not before us. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a sad and unhappy reflection on the management of the Government at present that this House of Representatives has been brought back in a manner which has not enabled it to discuss the matters which must be discussed if these issues are to be finalised before the operative day of 1 July. I think it is a sad but very telling and utterly characteristic aspect of the Government's management of the business of the day that at this stage we are in a position where there are no propositions before the House which would enable us to discuss the amendments. We have a situation where the House will have to meet tomorrow at even greater expense to the Australian taxpayer. It is a sad and unhappy reflection on the capacity of this Government to manage not only the parliamentary business but also the business of the Government of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not accept the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition. It is interesting to note that, if one takes a very objective view of this debate tonight, it is patently obvious that the Opposition, in its comments tonight, had very little to say. For example, if one reflects on the comments made by my friend and colleague the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) in quoting the contribution by Senator MacGibbon in the Senate in the course of debate, one will remember that there was only one paragraph of speech relating to this particular amendment in the Subsidy Legislation Amendment Bill. The context of that one paragraph was a series of cognate Bills that were dealt with by the Senate. Again, if people take the opportunity to read the contribution by Senator MacGibbon, they could conclude that, like the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and most certainly the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), he was attempting to make a contribution for contribution's sake without having anything of any great substance to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for McMillan made reference to the newly endorsed candidate for the Federal Division of Barker, Mr McLachlan, who served as the President of the National Farmers Federation on a number of occasions. References were made by the honourable member for McMillan to when he was the chairman of the Prime Minister's country task force and had the opportunity, as the leader of that group, to meet with Mr McLachlan and to discuss issues like this and related matters. References to those matters were greeted with considerable disdain by those honourable members who were in the House at the time. I succeeded the honourable member for McMillan as chairman of the Prime Minister's country task force and I occupied that position until 6 April this year. I can certainly endorse the remarks of the honourable member for McMillan. It is all very well for people to make those sorts of comments, but I am sure they feel uncomfortable that their newly endorsed candidate at the next election should be seen talking to people who have held these positions in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot have it both ways. As the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) commented in his speech, one cannot be seen to be attacking all the hard decisions that this Government has had to make during the past six years or so and, at the same time, fail to tell people exactly what one intends to do. For example, I noted that the honourable member for Wannon suggested that the Opposition had already come up with 20 or more policies in the past few months, but in Question Time after Question Time in this House when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and other leading Ministers have called for some of the key policy elements to be addressed by the Opposition they have drawn a blank. Time and time again we have asked the Opposition to tell us where it stands in relation to taxation policy. Where does it stand on monetary policy or on the question of wages? Where does it stand on the very vexed question of protection? On all these matters our questions have been met with a deafening wall of silence. </PARA>
<PARA> Why would we not be met with a wall of silence? As the honourable member for Bendigo pointed out in his fine contribution, under the leadership of Black Jack McEwen and the team that followed him, Australian industry was almost shattered by a combination of high tariff protection and an overvalued dollar. Who can forget that almost seven years ago the Fraser Government was talking about the possible demise of the Australian iron and steel industry. It is quite incredible to think that in this day and age a nation of 16 million people-an important island continent in this part of the world-could contemplate the demise of its iron and steel industry. I find the whole matter quite unbelievable. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to delay the House much longer, but I wish to point out that the comments made during the Senate debate on this Bill by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) described exactly the Government's position on this legislation. I wish to comment particularly on the last part of the Opposition's amendment. It should be noted that the Government has already put in place a number of very positive assistance measures for the manufacturing sector which I have already outlined in the second reading speech earlier tonight. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce will announce further assistance measures at an appropriate time in the near future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the amendment be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill, which was introduced into the Senate and has now come to this House, will exempt from tax a portion of the investment income of complying approved deposit funds (ADFs) which receive most of their income as interest. The income to be exempt is broadly that part of the approved deposit fund's normal assessable income-that is, income other than taxable contributions and certain non-arm's-length income that is taxable at the top personal marginal rate and attributable to amounts held on deposit, including accumulated earnings at 25 May 1988 for certain eligible depositors. </PARA>
<PARA> Eligible depositors are those aged 55 or more at 25 May 1988 and those aged 50 or more at 25 May 1988 who, on or before that date, rolled over to the approved deposit fund all or part of an eligible termination payment which had a concessional component-that is, an approved early retirement scheme payment, a bona fide redundancy payment or an invalidity payment, regardless of whether any part of the concessional component was rolled over. </PARA>
<PARA> The tests of exemption are in two stages. First, an ADF will have to satisfy the following conditions in respect of the year for which exemption is sought: the fund is a complying ADF; at no time during the year do the fund's assets include either units in a pooled superannuation trust or life assurance policies; and at least 90 per cent of the fund's normal investment income consists of interest, payments in the nature of interest or amounts included in assessable income in respect of long term discounted securities. Secondly, an ADF that satisfies those conditions-that is, a fixed interest complying ADF-in a year of income must have met the conditions at all times from the year of income in which 1 July 1988 occurred until the year when the exemption is sought. This test will only become relevant in years of income after the year in which 1 July 1988 occurred. The purpose of the amendment is to relieve eligible depositors from the impact of the tax otherwise payable by an ADF on income attributable to those depositors amendments in the ADF at 25 May 1988. It is to be a precondition of the exemption that ADFs pass on the benefit of the exemption to eligible depositors. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government would have preferred that the Bill remain as it was introduced, reflecting the measures which I announced as part of the 1988 May statement. However, owing to specific concerns of the Australian Democrats in the Senate-that is, to protect people aged 55 or more from the 15 per cent tax and to roll over into a fixed interest ADF before 25 May 1988-the amendment has been accepted by the Government. The reason the Democrats proposed this change was that funds which have most of their income as fixed interest income and do not have equities in their portfolio cannot stream the imputed credits which would otherwise be available to them to reduce the level of tax to zero or close to zero. I guess the Democrats' logic was that because these are basically fixed interest ADFs, the 15 per cent tax is a tax which has been imposed after certain depositors would have lodged funds in the ADF without knowing of the Government's intention in design terms to impose a tax of 15 per cent on fund earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition moved amendments to remove the 15 per cent tax on all fund earnings but made such a mess of them that all that happened was that in moving amendments to remove the tax from superannuation funds and ADFs it omitted the superannuation business of life insurance companies, friendly societies and pooled superannuation trusts. In the end the Opposition found that its amendments were incompetently drafted. I must say that we have had an amazing piece of theatre. We have had a few firsts in Australian politics arising from this. </PARA>

It then asked why the Government, as it knew about these amendments, did not point out to the Opposition that they were incompetently drafted. I suppose there is nothing like coming out and saying something as one believes it to be, but in terms of political naivety that takes the cake.

<PARA> The Opposition faces a major defeat. The legislation will go through. The industry holds the Opposition in absolutely naked contempt. The industry has made it quite clear what it thinks about the legislation. A press report from National Mutual states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition gave every indication that it would support the legislation. In fact, the shadow Minister for social security and retirement incomes proposed at a front bench party meeting that the tax on fund earnings be supported. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Opposition policy. Therefore, the superannuation industry made the appropriate changes in investments on the basis that the Government's announcement would be passed into legislation. That is why National Mutual and other majors in the superannuation industry came out in such a public way against what has happened. A news release from National Mutual, under the heading `Super tax legislation chaos', stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Superannuation fund members were badly treated when the Senate failed to pass the super tax legislation, according to leading fund manager National Mutual. </PARA>
<PARA> Group Managing Director, Mr Eric Mayer, today warned of chaos within the superannuation industry if the Bill was not passed by June 30, 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> `Members and trustees are now in a state of limbo in relation to benefit entitlements and tax arrangements,' Mr Mayer said. </PARA>
<PARA> He said, actions taken by trustees, administrators and members to . . .accommodate . . .the proposed tax regime will be invalidated and will need to be reversed to the extent possible if the legislation is not passed. </PARA>
<PARA> `The costs, both in dollar terms and in terms of the doubt and uncertainty hanging over the market, will be enormous', Mr Mayer said. </PARA>
<PARA>The newsletter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Coalition's actions contrast strongly with its implied acceptance of the Government's May superannuation taxation package. Indeed, the coalition's November Retirement Incomes Policy launched six months after the May statement-</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat, `launched six months after the May statement'-</PARA>
<PARA>maintained and reinforced the market place's view that it would not oppose the Government's taxation proposals. Investment managers will now need to consider restructuring unit prices to back the investment tax provisions which have already been deducted and recalculate both members' benefits and fund crediting rates. They will also need to consider realigning portfolios and possibly reducing holdings of Australian equities. The amendments passed by the Opposition and the Democrats will apply one set of rules for privately run super funds and another taxation scheme for those funds run by life officers. One wonders whether the Opposition-</PARA>
<PARA>and at that stage the Democrats-</PARA>

In particular, I would have thought it would be a prime requirement of coalition policy to see savings of Australians invested in superannuation funds, rather than abroad. In fact, I think it probably is a prime requirement of coalition policy, but it has been messed up by the phenomenal, massive incompetence of the honourable member for Bradfield. Only he could have managed to turn such a principle on its head: having locked and streamed imputed credits from franked dividends into the portfolios of superannuation funds so that those imputed credits could then reduce the 15 per cent tax on fund earnings to zero, in order to give funds an incentive, in the competitive business of superannuation, to run the tax to zero so that their funds--</PARA></TALK.START>

That is the essence of the change. That is why the 15 per cent fund tax was imposed. In a sense, it was not imposed to collect the tax, but in order to see the tax run down, with streamed imputed credits, and a high requirement of Australian capital formation-something which I would have strongly supported. Apparently, that was not to be the case. Such sense did not prevail. We have ended up with exactly what we wanted.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The level playing field that the honourable member talks about is the removal of the fund tax altogether. He does not understand the simple point that if the fund tax is not imposed, the Australian super funds will not buy Australian equities. If they do not, they will invest offshore. That is a simple, basic point that never seems to have entered the honourable member's mind. He is too wrapped up in his retirement income policy to see the big picture of what the whole savings investment-capital formation point is all about. It is about the operation of the tax law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The result will be that the only area in which the tax will not apply will be to people aged over 55 who have rolled over their lump sum into these approved deposit funds which have a different character from that of a superannuation fund, in that some of them have in their portfolios basically only fixed interest securities. Because they have only fixed interest securities, the 15 per cent tax would therefore fall more heavily upon them. Not having any equities, they would have no imputed dividends with which to offset the tax. Because of that, we have agreed to this amendment. To some extent-a very small extent-it upsets the pristine quality of the change. Having said that, I can see Senator Haines's and her Party's point in seeking to protect these people aged 55 and over who she believed could have been disadvantaged because, unknown to them, the Government had in its hands a design change which would have removed 15 per cent of the funds' earnings and hence impacted on their overall earnings after they had rolled their lump sum into the ADF for retirement purposes to age 65 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the amendment represents a piece of embroidery on the main fabric of the Bill. It will not pose any real problems. The Opposition has accused the Government of not pointing out to the Opposition why its amendments were incompetently drafted. That is a political first. For the Opposition to stand against capital formation in Australia stock exchanges by trying to knock the funds' earnings out goes against everything the Liberal Party has ever said about the stock market. All of the stockbroking firms that have been in contact with the Opposition over that period would have told it the same thing. I can only conclude that the only reason that the Opposition has persisted with the charade is so that the honourable member for Bradfield is not totally and publicly embarrassed for his raving, rank incompetence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Chairman, I trust that you will allow me the same liberality that you have allowed the Treasurer (Mr Keating). He has had the opportunity to make some quite extraordinary claims about me and, by extension, my Party. I want to clarify some of the matters he has raised. I refer first to the question of the amendment. Unlike Government members, when we make an error, we admit it. I was responsible for the amendment and I accept that responsibility. My only defence, which is a very legitimate one, is that the areas that were excluded from the amendment were not in the Bill which was under review at the time. That was a technical error which was not picked up by our legal advisers-nor was it picked up, with respect, by the Clerks of the House. I accept the responsibility and lay the matter to rest. We have seen in the Senate in the last two weeks the greatest farce in respect of this legislation that has ever been seen in any parliament. The Government's spokesman in the Senate, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), was unable even to get his own amendments right time after time. I will now demonstrate that in regard to most, if not all, of the points he has raised he is wrong; the Government remains wrong in its analysis, as is the Treasurer in the allegations that he has made tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been accused, for example, of gross inconsistency. I was accused of that in the Senate by the Minister for Finance and again tonight by the Treasurer. Let me clarify this matter once and for all. Tonight the Treasurer claimed that the coalition gave no indication before 9 May 1989 that it would seek to remove the tax on investment earnings of superannuation funds. In the Treasurer's defence-and it is a pretty miserable one at that-he drew on a press release put out by National Mutual Life which, as I said by way of interjection earlier, is the only superannuation company in Australia that has come out publicly in his defence. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Treasurer of the official position adopted by the Life Insurance Federation of Australia (LIFA). Ever since last May LIFA has consistently said that it does not support an investment tax or, for that matter, the front end tax. It has always supported an end tax-in other words, one takes one's benefit and then one pays one's tax. That has been LIFA's consistent position throughout. That has also been the position taken by National Mutual. What it said in its press release, to me and probably to other members of this House on numerous occasions, is that it had to apply regulations on the basis of the May statement, followed by a number of press releases, most of which have been inconsistent with those that went before. Time after time we had clarifications put out by the Treasurer, but at no stage did we have any legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government left the industry with one of the greatest crises it has ever faced this century-that is, the problem of how one applies laws which do not exist. The Government is taking from contributors over $1 billion of revenue on the basis of a damn press release. It knew that it was technically breaking the law. It knew that any one of those 150,000-odd people who would probably retire in any financial year could take it to court-for that matter, the Commonwealth could probably be taken to court also-and win. None of those taxes or collections were enforceable by law because there was no Act of Parliament to support them. The man responsible for all of that sits opposite me tonight. He is the one and only person who has to accept the responsibility for one of the most grotesque shambles in the legislative history of this Parliament. Everyone talks about precedents. We are now in our second year in this new building. During that time we have seen this grotesque performance from the Government. Editorials in the Australian Financial Review, the Australian this morning and the Melbourne Herald last week were all extremely critical of legislation by press release and the general shambles that you brought into this Parliament in recent weeks because you were not here for a start to control your own legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Chair was here but the Treasurer was not. That is the basis of the problem we have before us tonight. Within days of the May 1988 statement I attacked the superannuation tax proposals in the Parliament because the Treasurer was unable to meet his fundamental commitment that `no-one's end benefit would be reduced by one cent'. The Treasurer can attack me as an Opposition member with extremely limited capacities in terms of access to expertise in what is undoubtedly one of the most complex pieces of legislation ever introduced into this Parliament. I am thankful that I made only one mistake. I would like to know why it is, with all of the Treasurer's resources-that of the Treasury, the Department of Finance and the mis-named parliamentary draftsman from whom I got no support whatsoever. When we asked for the opportunity to talk to the men or women who had actually drafted this legislation to ensure that our amendments were consistent with it, in his typical school boy manner the Treasurer dismissed this suggestion and refused to allow us access.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer should not come in here and try to bully me, because it will not work. I will give him back everything that he can possibly throw at me. I will multiply it by 10 every time. If he wants decent legislation there is a role for the Opposition as well as a role for the Government. I remember the commitment made to the Australian people in 1983 by the Prime Minister when he became the leader of this nation. He said then that there was a role for the Opposition in the parliamentary context. He wanted the Opposition to be fully involved. What rot! When we asked for the basic support to ensure that our extremely complex amendments were absolutely correct and consistent with the legislation, the Treasurer said no. He is being a bully boy once again, throwing his weight around, as if anyone is going to take any notice. </PARA>
<PARA> When we drafted our amendments the second time, we got them right. As I said earlier, the only trouble was that our amendments were directed at removing a tax. The Government's amendment, as we have seen today, is, to all intents and purposes, restoring a tax to this package which nobody wants. Why do they not want it? The Treasurer inherited a tax situation and effectively multiplied the average aggregate tax by not much short of 1,000 per cent. That is not a bad effort! The Treasurer skulked out of the chamber today when I was debating this subject in the matter of public importance debate. I told the people what the Treasurer is not prepared to tell them. I said that when he introduced his 30 per cent end tax, he was not satisfied with that. Why? Because the revenue implications were too small-a miserable $200m or so. He got the smart idea of bringing a tax forward and then knocking off $1.4 billion in a full financial year. That is his own estimate; not mine. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that his refusal to tell us what the actual taxes are in this package of four new taxes can only be put down to the fact that the return this year and in subsequent years will be a lot more than $1.4 billion. It will probably be around $2 billion for starters. If I am wrong, the Treasurer has the opportunity in this chamber to give us the figures, which his colleague in the Senate refused to do. My attempts on various occasions to get these figures in this place have been equally unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make one final point on this subject. In my speech to the Price Waterhouse-Urwick seminar on 26 July 1988, which was published in the newspapers, I said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition parties have respected the right of government to pass through Parliament key elements of it's Budget package. While we continue to support this principle, let there be no doubt that the Liberal and National parties will expect the appropriate superannuation legislation to meet the letter of the Treasurer's unambiguous commitment-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, that there will be no losers-</PARA>
<PARA>If he is able to meet this commitment, or to make the necessary amendments to ensure that he does, the Government has no right to expect that the Opposition will support automatically the easy passage of this legislation through Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>That was our consistent position. We have never varied-not one dot. The only person who has varied has been the twisting and gyrating Treasurer and his mate in the Senate and various other people on the Government benches. For the Government to claim that the coalition gave no indication of its concern before 9 May is as inaccurate as Senator Walsh's other recent press statements on this subject. No doubt Ministers want to forget what happened in the Port Adelaide by-election when there was a swing against the Government of 14 per cent. The major issue was superannuation. Exactly the same thing will happen next time right across the nation, not just in the Port Adelaide by-election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation and the amendment before us have been watched with considerable interest by the 3.7 million Australians who are in superannuation funds. One could not blame those people for feeling a little confused about what the current situation might be because, after all, people want some degree of certainty when they make arrangements for superannuation in the longer term. The situation that we are in now is, to say the least, a quite chaotic one. It is also quite clear that the Government gives scant regard to its own commitments in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out that the Treasurer (Mr Keating), in respect of these superannuation Bills that the two Houses have been dealing with in recent times, clearly said in May 1988 in his economic statement that no-one's end benefit would reduce by one cent. That is very clearly not the case with the legislation and the amendment now before us. That is why the Opposition moved on 9 May in this chamber to remove the 15 per cent tax on fund investment income as it applied to all superannuation funds. The Government rejected those amendments. We now have before us this strange hybrid animal which is the product of collusion between the Australian Democrats and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment is meant to quarantine persons between the ages of 55 and 65 from the effects of the 15 per cent investment tax on approved deposit funds and roll-over fund income. This is a most unjust solution to this problem and is also administratively very messy. It is quite obvious that it would have been far more equitable from the outset and, administratively, far more rational to have accepted the amendment that was originally moved by the Opposition to remove across the board the 15 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also very clear that the amendment that has been brought into the chamber tonight-this hybrid amendment produced by the Government and the Australian Democrats-destroys the so-called level playing field that the Treasurer hopes to establish through this legislation. It builds in some very clear anomalies, particularly in terms of the differential rates that now apply between various people in different age categories. In fact, we have a situation not dissimilar to the problems often encountered in other areas of tax legislation; for instance, where there are differential rates in respect of personal income tax and company tax. This can open up all sorts of difficulties in relation to tax avoidance. We now have a two-tiered system. We have a situation in which those below the age of 55 pay higher taxes on superannuation income than those over 55 years of age. In fact, we have three rates: one applying to those under 55 years of age, one applying to those between 55 and 65, and one applying to those over 65. Also, those persons under 55 years of age could pay a full 15 per cent tax on fixed interest portfolios. Furthermore, those over 55 years of age must leave ADFs at age 65 with potentially less secure incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The most alarming consideration that arises out of this is that people changing jobs and placing their superannuation in an ADF may be caught for the full 15 per cent while in that situation. With the Government making so much fuss about industry restructuring and the job mobility that must go with it, that will be a very real restriction on enhancing job mobility in Australian industry. The losers overall very clearly will be the vast majority of the 3.7 million Australians, almost one-quarter of the population, who are in superannuation schemes and aged under 55. I have noted during the debate on this matter in the Parliament and in the media that we have had some most extraordinary and confusing estimates of the revenue involved. One thing that I hope will come out of tonight is some very clear estimates from the Government as to exactly what revenue is involved in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We might be very lucky to hear that because I think the Government does not exactly know what are the real estimates in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My other area of concern relates to the very inequitable nature of these amendments in relation to the effect on domestic savings. We all know that if we are to reverse the situation that has grown up over the last quarter of a century whereby our trading position has deteriorated substantially-a quarter of a century ago we were the eighth ranked exporter in the world and we are now twenty-third-by building up the investment base in this country we have to have the savings to do that. What we have before us now is a very major disincentive to saving and it will not advance one iota our position in preparing for the decade to come and the next century in terms of building up our industry with an investment base. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has made much of the support from one organisation in the superannuation area, the National Mutual organisation, in correspondence he read out here tonight. I think it would behove the chamber to be aware of some of the other commentary that exists in this area on where the views of the bulk of the superannuation industry lie in relation to this matter and this strange hybrid amendment that has been brought into this place by the Government and the Democrats in collusion. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a letter dated only yesterday, 14 June, to the Opposition's shadow Minister for social security and retirement income from Mr J. K. Denver, Executive Director of the Unit Trust Association of Australia Ltd. I will not read the letter in its entirety; I shall just read some pertinent paragraphs which I think clearly refute the so-called industry support that the Treasurer claims in respect of this matter. In referring to this legislation, the letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Unit Trust Association of Australia Limited . . . is the representative body for Australian public unit trust managers. These trust funds come under the definition of prescribed interests for legislative purposes, and comprise funds investing on behalf of their unitholders in properties; company shares listed on the Australian and international stock exchanges; short-term money market instruments; registered first mortgages; and a range of superannuation and rollover products. </PARA>
<PARA> UTAA Members manage 90% of all public unit trust funds in Australia, on behalf of some 600,000 small investors. Overall, funds under management at the end of March, 1989 amounted to $32 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with deep concern that I write to you on a matter of the utmost urgency. The UTAA seeks to advise the Government and all Opposition parties of the impracticality and completely unworkable nature of the proposed amendments to legislation currently before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The UTAA wrote to the Treasurer on June 24, 1988 following the May Economic Statement. A copy of the letter reflecting our sincere concern over the introduction of a tax on retirement savings is attached for your consideration. The possible distortions created by a tax which discriminates in favour of sharemarket investments is of no benefit to anyone, least of all superannuation beneficiaries. We raise this matter again in the present circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to detail further its concerns and arguments. Another letter is from the Life Underwriters Association of Australia to Senator Haines, Leader of the Australian Democrats in the Senate, dated 14 June. It draws attention to the comments attributed to Senator Haines in the Canberra Times of Tuesday, 13 June. Paragraphs two and three of the letter-I draw on this before going on to make reference to the comments that the Life Underwriters Association has about these comments-in quoting from the Canberra Times, state:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The Leader of the Democrats, Senator Janine Haines, said from Adelaide yesterday that the Democrats had agreed to the amendment, which addresses the party's concerns for the over 55s who are taking early retirement and rolling over their superannuation into approved deposit funds. She said the amendment protected the members of approved deposit funds rather than the funds themselves. This was more satisfactory than the Democrats' original amendment, defeated by the Government and the Opposition, which protected the funds. </PARA>
<PARA> ``What the big insurance and life funds were worried about was if the approved deposit funds themselves were covered, there would be a flood of people leaving the other funds . . . the Government's amendment covers the fund members and not the funds, she said.''</PARA>
<PARA>It is referring to Senator Haines. The commentary of the Life Underwriters Association of Australia Ltd is quite fascinating. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> If the substance of these paragraphs is accurate then I particularly call your attention to the second sentence of the introductory note circulated with the draft amendments together with the last paragraph of that page. </PARA>
<PARA> The second sentence states unequivocally that the exemption applies to the fund not the depositor. The first sentence of the last paragraph on that page states the purpose as ``to relieve eligible depositors from the impact of the tax''. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear where industry support lies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I strongly endorse the comments of the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) that the performance of the Government on this legislation and indeed this amendment is little short of disgraceful. The way the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has attempted tonight during the committee stage to turn the attack on the Opposition is little short of a joke. The fact is that the Treasurer had a year to introduce this legislation. He gave the Opposition two days to look at the legislation before it was actually presented to the Parliament. Frankly, if the Government is serious not only about the legislation but also about the stature of the Parliament, it should not treat the Parliament with that sort of contempt. Furthermore, it should not treat the Australian community with the sort of contempt that it has by legislating, as it has in this case, quite outrageously simply through a press release.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We, on this side of the House, have always argued that the amendments before the House this evening and other aspects of this legislation need to be looked at in a broader context-the context of encouraging Australians to get into superannuation funds so that they can provide for their own retirement and so that, in the longer term, we can relieve the pressure on the state pension and, therefore, on the Federal Government's budget. When looking at this in context we have to take into consideration the fact that superannuation is the major source of savings in Australia. We are at a stage in our history where we simply need urgently to encourage savings-something that the Government is aware of only in rhetorical terms but which it is not prepared to act on. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bradfield has pointed out that the Government has introduced four taxes on superannuation, including the 15 per cent investment tax on superannuation funds. As the honourable member for Bradfield pointed out, we have opposed this. We have opposed it in another place, we have opposed it in this House and we have opposed it with widespread support from the industry. The consequence of what the Government has done will be to reduce by up to 17 per cent the end benefit of superannuants. I hope that the Treasurer will remember his statement that this legislation would lead to no-one's end benefit being reduced by one cent; yet end benefits will be reduced by up to 17 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer can hardly argue on the one hand that the Government's total revenue from the legislation will be in the vicinity of $1.4 billion per annum-and perhaps it will be substantially more-and say on the other hand that this will not affect the end benefit. It simply does not make any sense. The Treasurer is the one who is always telling us that we have to be rational and logical. How can he take $1.4 billion away from people and say, `You will not be one cent worse off.'? It does not make any sense. The Australian community knows that it does not make any sense. Let me make this point: we will be going around this country not only pointing out that the Government has done that to superannuants and saying that it is snatching money away from those people and reducing the incentive for others to get into superannuation funds, but also telling people in electorates such as Kingston that our friend Senator Haines did a dirty deal with the Government and is equally responsible for this rip-off of superannuants. We will be going around saying that all over Kingston and all over the rest of Australia. Senator Haines went to water on this issue and introduced this amendment that apparently the Treasurer is suddenly inexplicably excited about. We will not be telling the Australian community, `Forget about that and forget about the consequences of it'. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Treasurer will continue to argue that this legislation, the amendment and so on will not have any effect. He will say, `Do not worry'. That is what he says the whole time. He says, `The J-curve will work and my monetary policies will work. Do not worry. Just hold on. It is all going to happen'. None of those policies have worked, nothing has happened and the same applies here. People ought to worry. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment itself is plainly discriminatory. The Treasurer likes to talk about a level playing field, yet he supports this amendment. He says that this amendment is absolutely fine by him because it protects people over the age of 55. Fair enough; it will protect those people who turn 55 by 25 May if those people are in approved deposit funds with more than 90 per cent of their fund in fixed interest. That is pretty discriminatory. What happens if people are aged 54, 53 or 28? It does not help them. It helps only those people who are aged over 55. If we are talking about a level playing field that hardly makes any sense. It is hardly a level playing field, yet the Treasurer says that he is quite happy to go along with this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer also made a point which I think most rational people would regard as pretty incoherent. What is really rational about all this is that the Government is encouraging the funds to invest in equities. The Treasurer has said, `You do not have to worry if you are a fund that is investing in equities. As long as every cent of your investment is in the stock market you do not need to worry about it'. That is what the Treasurer wants the funds to do. He is creating a climate to encourage funds to invest in equities. He is right to point out that honourable members on this side of the House are happy to see investment in equities; of course we are. But the Treasurer is encouraging funds to put everything into equities. </PARA>
<PARA> People running superannuation funds obviously want to spread the risk. Obviously, they want to invest in a lot of different securities-not just in the share market. Any superannuation fund manager would tell honourable members that. We had the great share market crash in October 1987. That would have made the funds pretty wary, if they had not been wary before. Apparently, the Treasurer did not notice the share market crash. He thinks that funds should be putting all their eggs in this one gigantic basket and, if the basket is dropped, so what? Apparently the Treasurer does not worry about that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is something fundamentally irrational about this whole body of legislation, particularly the 15 per cent investment tax on the superannuation funds which is simply economically irrational. Here we have a government that uses the rhetoric that most members of this Parliament use in the context of superannuation, yet when it comes to the practice it is supporting an amendment which is downright discriminatory, which is quite contrary to the principle of creating a level playing field, and it is playing around with legislation which is designed to encourage funds to put all their eggs in one great big risky basket. That is where all the investment has to go. The Treasurer has said to the funds, `If all your investment goes there you do not need to worry'. Somehow the consequence of that is that no-one's end benefit will be reduced by one cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, if that is the way the Government thinks superannuation, the major source of savings in this country, should be managed we can see perfectly clearly why savings are such a major problem in our economy. The Government has rejected every other measure that has been put forward, even by the Treasurer's boss, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). He has put forward a whole lot of different plans-some of them I think very respectable plans-for encouraging savings through changes to the taxation system. The Treasurer has rejected all those plans. Effectively, he is saying, `The place I want savings is in the share market and I want those savings through superannuation'. Basically, that is the end of the story. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I regard the amendment that the Australian Democrats have effectively brought forward, which is supported by the Treasurer and the Government, as irrational and discriminatory. But we would not be surprised to find amendments from the Democrats irrational and discriminatory. The Government's whole strategy is simply economically incoherent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;People who are 55 years and older and who have deposited with approved deposit funds (ADFs) apparently will become beneficiaries as a result of the amendment proposed by the Government tonight. Of course, some funds are excluded. As I understand it, the end result will be the removal of the 15 per cent tax on superannuation fund earnings by funds with certain characteristics. I noted what the Treasurer (Mr Keating) had to say earlier. He talked about the removal of the 15 per cent tax on fund earnings and he said that this impacted on eventual benefits. He said that he had some sympathy with the Australian Democrats who advanced the case of this narrow group of potential beneficiaries-those who have invested with ADFs and who are over 55 years of age. He said he had some sympathy with the Australian Democrats. This legislation involves a reduction of approximately $70m in an expected take, if we can believe the Government's estimates, of in excess of $1.4 billion in a full financial year. In expressing that sympathy with the Australian Democrats the Treasurer acknowledges that his measure will cause the revenue to suffer a reduction of $70m. Yet he still hangs on the statement he made in May 1988 when he said, `No-one's end benefit would be reduced by one cent'. That is clearly an unsustainable claim, and only someone with the gall of the Treasurer would maintain it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We need to remember that that tax was previously collected on lump sum payments to superannuants on their retirement. If that is changed as these total measures intend, modified by the amendment before us, in the vicinity of $1.4 billion in up-front taxation will be taken out of the amount available to the funds investment. Blind Freddy would know that, if $1.4 billion in up-front taxation is taken out in a full financial year, the funds concerned will not have that $1.4 billion to invest. If they do not have that $1.4 billion to invest, as they had hitherto, they will not earn the same amount on their investments. They will earn on their investments minus $1.4 billion. How could anyone claim in this place with a straight face that `no-one's end benefit would be reduced by one cent'?</PARA>
<PARA> On that statement hung the undertaking by the Opposition to support or contest the nature of this legislation. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) is quite justified in now saying that the Treasurer did not meet that particular criterion, because it is patently clear that, if $1.4 billion is taken out of the total available to the funds for investment on behalf of their policyholders and potential superannuants, their investments will be reduced. If the investments were earning a modest 10 per cent in interest, then $140 billion would be lost. How could the Government possibly claim that, at the end of the day, any superannuant, collectively or individually, who has invested for 10 years in a fund which has $140 billion taken out of its funds will not lose one cent? Superannuants will lose a damn sight more than one cent. One would not need to be a mathematician to arrive at that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer relied on the one statement by someone in the industry which criticised the attitude of the coalition parties. He chose to quote Mr Eric Mayer of the National Mutual Life Association, a respected and respectable individual in his field. He dwelt on a part of Mr Mayer's press statement which said that there would be absolute chaos if the Bill was not passed by 30 June 1989. Of course, that is right. There will be absolute chaos. There is a great deal of chaos already. There is administrative chaos already and in prospect, but there will be a great deal more. By selectively quoting Mr Mayer the Treasurer conveniently ignored all the supporters of the position we advocated. He did not deign to refer to a spokesman for the AMP Society who said this morning that he estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 middle-aged and older investors in the AMP alone would suffer because their deferred annuity schemes would be discriminated against by these measures in general, and this amendment in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the AMP, those people's investments in AMP would have served the same purpose had they been in an approved deposit fund. They were there for the same reason. But those people, given the knowledge which was available to them at the time when they planned their affairs, and their not unreasonable expectations, thought that this was the way to go. They now find they are discriminated against compared with those who have invested in ADFs in the categories we have mentioned. The previous amendment to taxation measures concerning superannuation funds went through this Parliament as recently as three years ago. One would have thought that, given the major changes made then, people would have been free to plan their superannuation affairs with some certainty as to the future. They surely could have expected that those measures, once in place-it was a big lick and a major change-would have insured them against major changes in the foreseeable future, and certainly in the life of this Government. But that is not to be, and that is the situation we are confronted with now. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer also said `These measures generally lock super funds into the equity markets in this country'. That is true to some extent, but it is based on the premise that companies issuing equity in this country will all attract franked benefits-that imputation benefits will be available to them. The truth is that many companies in Australia whose shares are listed on the stock exchanges around the country earn profits overseas. They do not benefit from the imputation provisions. Those companies' dividends are not tax free. The funds which have invested in companies which earn some or even all of their profits overseas do not pay tax free dividends to their shareholders. If they happen to be superannuation funds, they are not tax free. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure is an attempt to drive people into the Australian equities market and claim that they will get some tax free benefits from companies. That is plainly not the case. The equity market in Australia is hardly big enough to cope with the enormous funds which superannuation funds, ADFs and the like are controlling. They are very powerful indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take this opportunity to comment on two aspects of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill. Most Australians would be aware that we are sitting today, tonight and tomorrow to allow the Government to pass important legislation, with amendments, which must be finalised by the end of the financial year. Not all Australians are aware that this unnecessary sitting has been necessitated by the Government's decision to leave this complex legislation until the last minute in an attempt to pressure the Parliament into passing it without significant scrutiny, debate and amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to comment on the two fundamental issues involved in the legislation and on the amendments. The first is constitutional and goes to the heart of our way of governing ourselves and our way of restraining the state. The second concerns the policy objectives of broad economic policy in a time of unprecedented national and family debt and in a time of an ageing population. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before us, with it amendments, is a legislative ratification of law by press release. Last year the Treasurer (Mr Keating) told the Australian people and the Parliament that he had decided upon certain changes to superannuation schemes in Australia and upon certain new taxation measures covering superannuation. He declared that the changes would be retrospective to the date of his press release but could not say when the legislation would be tabled. He insisted that the Parliament would have no right to challenge the legislation when it was introduced because superannuation funds, investors and individual Australians would have made decisions on the basis of his statements-however vague-on that day. As the Law Council of Australia commented, the approach taken by the Treasurer was a mockery of the role of law and of the Parliament. I want to draw on the statement released by the Law Council on this matter, and particularly as it related to these amendments, so as to provide an objective context for our deliberations tonight. The Law Council noted the view of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in its 1986-87 report:</PARA>
<PARA> The practice of `legislation by press release' carries with it the assumption that citizens should arrange their affairs in accordance with announcements made by the Executive rather than in accordance with the laws made by Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from the debilitating effect of the practice on the Parliament, it leaves the law in a state of uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee was not the only critic of law by press release. The Law Council also quoted Chief Justice Mason of the High Court of Australia who had observed in 1975-and this is relevant to the fact that the legislation was announced long before it appeared in Parliament, and now there are amendments to it-as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>There is, first, the risk that the proposed alteration will not be made by Parliament and there is, secondly, the possibility, sometimes unfortunately realised, that the law when enacted will not correspond exactly with the antecedent announcement. Above all, it is a technique calculated to encourage people to disregard, and, indeed, to disobey the law. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is exactly what has happened over the last several months. People have had to organise their affairs outside of the law and now the legislation, with its amendments, despite the Government's bullying will differ from the original press release intentions. The Law Council outlined the legal dilemmas facing individual citizens as a result of law by press release:</PARA>
<PARA>The individual, with his advisers, is placed in a most unsatisfactory position. He is forced to adjust his business transactions in anticipation of the proposed legislation. He does not know, and cannot ascertain, the detail of the future provisions. Nor indeed can he be sure that the legislation will in fact be enacted or whether, if enacted, it will accord with the announced details. He may not even become aware of the media statement because it does not form a part of the law of the land and is not published as if it were. </PARA>
<PARA>The Law Council's assessment of the constitutional and political consequence of this practice is most significant. The most fundamental objection to the practice, the Law Council said, `Is that it involves a usurpation of the Parliament's legislative power by the Executive'. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It is beside the point to say that parliamentary approval will be obtained in due course. The scope for proper consideration by the Parliament is severely limited by the media statements. </PARA>
<PARA>If ever there were a legislative action by a Government which highlighted the propensity of an executive to ignore or bully the Parliament, if ever there were a clear example of the value of the Senate as a House of review and as a check and balance for the House of Representatives, this Bill is such an action, such an example. This Government, and the Treasurer in particular, have displayed a dangerous executive arrogance and brinkmanship, and all the propaganda about an obstructionist Opposition cannot hide that fact. That is the first aspect of the political context of this extraordinary sitting and this legislation with its amendments in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> I am forced to be brief concerning the second aspect. This legislation concerns superannuation. Its origins and objectives, however, have to do not with retirement income, not with security and independence for the aged, but with the revenue and political needs of the Government. Let us be clear that this legislation is about taxing the savings of workers in a way which delivers this Government immediate tax revenue. Let us be clear, therefore, that as a superannuation Bill it has been distorted. It represents a lost opportunity to structure incentive and reward for thrift into the national superannuation regime at a time when the nation needs to boost savings and to prepare itself for an expanding aged population. My colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) has outlined in detail the deficiencies of this legislation. Outside this place he has provided a comprehensive and innovative alternative policy package for superannuation and for retirement security and independence. </PARA>
<PARA> My comments have been intended to focus on two broader questions-firstly, the political objectives of this legislation which are based on the short-term revenue needs of a Government weary of fiscal discipline and prone to tax anything which moves; and, secondly, the arrogance of the Labor executive and its disregard for the Parliament and the rule of law. On both counts this Government stands condemned before the Australian people, desperate as they are for principled, non-political and long-term responses to this country's daunting economic and social problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For many people, superannuation is critical as it is the only real form of forced saving, apart from buying a home, that they have for their retirement. Confusion about the attraction of superannuation as an investment comes as the Australian population steadily ages, a fact which will increase demand on government for pensions and social security for the aged. As the baby boomers reach the peak 45 to 54 years age group in the 1990s, they will want to save more. Given the potential problems with government funding of the aged, they will need to make serious plans to support themselves in retirement. This generation will ask what is the best way to provide for themselves when they retire in the next century. The National Australia Bank Ltd estimates that public outlays for the age pension will have to increase from 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product in 1985 to almost 4.5 per cent in 2025.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In reviewing the impact of Treasurer Keating's April statement, the superannuation industry is beginning to realise that the tax changes he announced will tip the balance against superannuation for many lower wage-earners while at the same time making the age pension potentially much more attractive. It seems to me that three words emerge consistently from commentators on the Government's superannuation proposals. Those words are not words that this Government prides itself on, such as incentive, equity, compassion and public interest. Those three words are `increased tax revenue'.</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth reflecting on what one or two of the commentators have said. First of all, Robert Brown, a partner and superannuation specialist with accountants Duesburys, criticises the new superannuation laws as `unnecessarily complex'. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Keating regularly and incorrectly states that the government will make no further changes to the superannuation system and that people `may now plan for their retirement with certainty and confidence', . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately these statements are often contradicted by his colleagues such as (Social Security Minister) Brian Howe, who believes that massive restructuring of the system is necessary. Howe is likely to be proved correct, if only because our political masters seem to have an insatiable desire for more revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Glenda Korporaal, in the Bulletin edition dated 16 May, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The big tax changes in the May mini-Budget of 1988 and last month's reduction in personal tax rates will both reduce the relative attraction of putting an extra dollar of income into superannuation rather than using that dollar to invest elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Despite the promise by Treasurer Paul Keating that `no-one's end benefit would be reduced by one cent', it is hard to see how the decision to tax employers' contributions to super funds by 15% and the decision to tax super funds' investment income by 15% cannot reduce the final benefits of investing in superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> Keating counters that the tax rate for the end benefits will be reduced. However Treasury's aim was purely to get its hands on the billions of dollars flowing into superannuation through union super funds and the greater awareness of the need to provide for retirement. The changes will reduce the cumulative amount at the end of an individual's working life which will be available to be taxed at the lower rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that a cent today is worth a lot more than the same one cent in 20 to 30 years after it has been eroded by inflation-which is why Treasury decided to take most of its share of the take up now rather than wait for the hereafter. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, John Stackhouse said in that same Bulletin edition-referring to the Treasurer, who sits opposite:</PARA>
<PARA>This man tells us we must save because we're in hock to foreign bankers. He also warns that Australia faces a social crisis because of our ageing population. Yet this government's greed for taxes and its sticky, meddling fingers changing our superannuation rules encourage us to spend, not save. In fact, most of us will be better off if we splurge our nest eggs and grab the old age pension even though it will send the economy down the drain. Not surprisingly, our exclusive polls shows this is what most Australians want to do. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Most Australians favour compulsory superannuation for all workers. An overwhelming majority also believe they are entitled to a lump sum payout and should be able to spend the money any way they choose . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The findings, from a special survey of 1,165 Australians aged 14 and over, shows the political difficulty the Hawke government faces in trying to switch the superannuation system from a payout to a pension base. Support for the status quo ranges across the entire political spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA> However, if the Hawke government wants to change the lump-sum system, it will meet the strongest opposition from its own supporters, who emerge as most attached to the lump sum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In summary, I think people are confused about this legislative jungle. To use some of the words that the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) used, the whole thing revolves around legislation by press release. I agree with him entirely when he used the words `a grotesque legislative shambles'. In the short time available to me this evening at this late hour, in explanation of the confusion that people are suffering, I think it is worth mentioning that a couple of days ago on television the so-called expert from the Life Underwriters Association, when asked about the superannuation package, said that the industry just did not understand it. All I can say is: if the experts in the industry do not understand the legislation, then how are those who are listening to the debate this evening and indeed those who are up in the gallery expected to handle what is in the legislative package?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to refer to what Noel Whittaker said in the 11 June edition of the Brisbane Sunday Mail. He referred to the prospect of the amendment before us this evening. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> After all this time had elapsed, the Opposition and the Democrats decided to oppose one section of the legislation only-that which related to the tax on superannuation-rollover fund earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> Their argument went like this-Mr Keating promised that nobody would be a dollar worse off as a result of the changes and certainly funds that invest heavily in shares may pay no tax because of imputation credits. </PARA>
<PARA> But what about those funds that adopt a lower risk strategy and invest in a larger proportion of cash, bonds and property? Their earning rates will be lower so their members WILL be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition and the Democrats thought that was inconsistent and discriminatory. They said to the Government: `Let's keep it simple and give everybody a level playing field. Maintain a flat entry tax of 15 per cent on contributions but abolish the tax on earnings of superannuation and roll-over funds so that less volatile funds won't be disadvantaged'. </PARA>
<PARA> The small amendments proposed by the Opposition and the Democrats sounded fair and reasonable. What was the Government's reaction? `Either you pass it in its entirety or we throw out the entire Bill'. </PARA>
<PARA>This evening we have heard a personal attack by the Treasurer on the honourable member for Bradfield, in which he referred to `raving, rank incompetence'. I think I would far prefer to have those words said than to be regarded as the bully boy of this Parliament and, indeed, the man who goes down not as the most outstanding Treasurer in our history but in fact as the Treasurer who has dragged us into the banana republic regime. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to refer to what Noel Whittaker said in the Sunday Mail. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It now appears the Government and the Democrats have come to an agreement that will allow passage of the Bill . . . This still leaves a Bill that discriminates against the thousands of Australians under 55 who prefer to stay in Capital Guaranteed Investments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not want to be associated with it, and regrettably neither do the Australian people. The unfortunate fact is that they are stuck with the decisions of this Parliament. They are stuck with wrong decisions made for the wrong reasons when the realities are that the Government appears to have provided an amendment purely to appease the Australian Democrats, with scant regard to the realities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At one stage of this sad exercise there was even an attempt made by the Government to talk to the Opposition. That is all it was-an attempt at an official level. No attempt beyond that was ever made to actually enter into negotiations with us. Perhaps the Government realised then that, when I said that we were going to stand our ground, that is precisely what I meant. I want to say in this chamber, at this hour of the night, that, while we may have lost this battle, we have not lost the war. We will continue to press these issues right to the line, right up to the next Federal election. There will not be a man or woman in this country who will not know well in advance of polling day which party they should vote for in terms of what is the best package offered for their retirement income and their ultimate security. There is simply no case to force people yet again to pay record levels of tax on their superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> No effective case has been presented by the Treasurer tonight, despite all his personal attacks on me, as to why imputation is somehow the holy grail. Perhaps I could give him a simple lesson in economics on this point. Back in the days of the Fraser Government I was probably the first member of this Parliament who argued strongly against double taxation on dividends. My record on this subject is absolutely pure. When I am asked why I am arguing that there should be no imputation in relation to superannuation fund income, I point out that the answer should be abundantly clear. Clearly, one does not need imputation if one does not have to pay tax. The whole purpose of imputation is to avoid having to pay tax. The whole essence of the Opposition's case in relation to the removal from this legislation of the 15 per cent investment tax was to put funds in the situation where they could make decisions on the basis of the market. The whole objective of superannuation is not to subsidise Government policy, regardless of how right that policy might be in terms of the absolute benefits of investment in Australia, which I am sure all members of this Parliament would support. The fundamental responsibility of fund managers is to get the best return possible on the investments put in their charge by 3.7 million Australians who, as I said earlier today in the debate on the matter of public importance, ask nothing more from managers except that they use their best offices to maximise the return. </PARA>
<PARA> Using the same language as we heard recently in the Senate, the Treasurer kept talking about the need for imputation and how we wanted the funds to invest in Australia. The sad fact is this: over the past 12 months or so the record of the major superannuation funds in Australia, with imputation, demonstrates quite conclusively that the average impact has been virtually negligible. Why is that? It is for a very simple reason. After the October crash there was a massive flight out of equities. People were scared. That was a perfectly sensible response in the circumstances. These funds, managing up to $100 billion belonging to ordinary men and women, put more of their money into capital resources, government paper and surer investments and less into equities. It was only towards the middle of last year that the balance started to return. Regardless of the tax implications of this legislation-and the Treasurer would do well to listen to what I am saying because he might learn something; he has demonstrated only total ignorance up to now-the funds regard taxation as only one element among a whole host of elements which determine their investment strategy. The basic thesis is that one should have a 30-30-30 type formula-30 per cent in equities, 30 per cent in property and 30 per cent in government paper and other fixed interest securities. That is regarded as a reasonably ideal portfolio. The other 10 per cent, of course, fluctuates depending on market opportunities as they appear. </PARA>
<PARA> In that total context, I can assure this House that imputation is not the holy grail; it has not made any major impact. The fundamental fact is that after a period in which imputation has been offered to superannuation and life offices, the final statistical analysis shows that there has been virtually no change. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table prepared by TPF&amp;, which is the world's second largest actuarial advisory company. The Treasurer has approved the incorporation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issues that we put before the House tonight are essentially comprehensive and straightforward. We continue to claim that this amendment, which has been forced on the Government by the Australian Democrats, is not in Australia's interests. This amendment will protect only those who were over 55 years of age on 25 May 1988 and who had approved deposit funds with more than 90 per cent invested in fixed interest. There is no protection for similarly aged people in deferred annuities and, consequently, this is a most discriminatory amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government tells us that there will be about 100,000 beneficiaries. That may well be true. However, when one is dealing with such a small number of people over such a relatively short period, the fact is that over 10 or 15 years the movement of population through deaths, drop-outs and various changes that take place will guarantee that at some point in those 15 years there will not be a cracker in it for anyone. This is because the administrative costs of maintaining a totally separate set of trust deeds to provide for these people will, in some cases, be comparable with a 15 per cent tax-assuming that one has to pay the full tax and we have been told by the Treasurer that that is not necessary on imputation-and, at the end of the day, most schemes will probably drop this type of investment altogether as not being worthwhile for the relatively small number of people who are covered. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, as was pointed out in the Senate today by my most esteemed colleague, Senator Bishop, some 5,000 people in similar types of investment have been left out. Why? Because it is too difficult to include them. Yet the Treasurer told us that he wanted an equitable system, a level playing field, something that will be fair to all. The only way he could achieve that with equity was to have a system that did not require an investment tax on fund incomes. That and that alone is the way in which the Treasurer could have met his fundamental and first commitment to the Australian people which was that no one's end benefits would lose one cent. Even with the reduction or removal of that 15 per cent tax, I cannot guarantee that every person will be safe from loss. I can guarantee that because of the direction taken by the Government, the losses to hundreds of thousands of superannuants will be up to 17 per cent on final benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I wish to make briefly is the whole question of the treatment of trust deeds. I seek permission to table a memorandum submitted to us today by Mr R. J. Ellicott, QC, on the whole question of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill which we are now debating. </PARA>

<PARA> 1. Where rights have become vested in depositors as a result of the provisions of a trust deed, it would not be possible to deprive them of their rights without their consent. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. A trust deed must sometimes contain a power to divest contingent rights or vary the interests of beneficiaries. However, in the absence of such powers or of power in a court to vary a trust, the trust deed must operate according to its terms and it will not be possible to divest vested rights. Similarly, rights to future income from a fund cannot be changed unless provisions enabling a relevant variation of the trust exist. </PARA>
<PARA>Some advice which we and the Government have received suggests that companies such as the AMP Society are lucky enough that when they developed their original trust deed they had a catch-all clause to protect them from future policy changes. That is an exceptional situation. Thousands of trusts will have to be changed at great cost. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much has been said by the Opposition in this debate about the structure of this tax and about superannuation. The disappointing aspect is that so few honourable members opposite understand the mammoth changes and the rationality of those changes that the Government has put into place. When this Government came to office, only 38 per cent of Australians had access to superannuation. Today that figure is nearly 100 per cent. For nearly 30 years Opposition members sat in office without making one change at all to superannuation. Now they pretend that they had some kind of interest in it. They had no interest in it. They had no tax on lump sump benefits. If someone took his superannuation entitlement as a pension, that weekly pension attracted the full rate of tax. On the other hand, if that person took superannuation as a lump sum, he paid tax on 5 per cent of the amount-next to nothing. If he were on the marginal rate of 60 per cent at the time he would have paid about 3 per cent of the total. So it was 3 per cent for lump sums but 60 per cent for a pension if a person was on the top marginal rate, or an average rate of 30 or 40 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That was the kind of tax policy applying to superannuation under the Liberal and National parties. Although it was a joke and available only to a minority of Australians-it was not generally available, but that always suited the people they thought supported them-it was allowed to remain. They did not care about savings, rational economic policy or capital formation. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) is attempting to interject. I remind him that he was heard in silence. The Liberal and National parties sat there asleep, just as they did for the 30 years before. </PARA>
<PARA> When we came to office we put a tax on lump sum benefits-a tax on the end benefits. Tonight many Opposition members asked, `How could you collect $1 billion tax and have beneficiaries not lose their entitlements?' That has been their claim all night. The answer is that they do not understand the nature of the change. Whatever the benefits which were accruing-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member would listen for a second he might learn something. With a big effort he might just get there. Whatever was accruing in a fund, whatever benefits stood in a fund, to a superannuant's account, 15 per cent of that always belonged to the Government. Whether that stream went until finality and the 15 per cent came out, or whether it was five, 10, 15 or 20 years before finality, that sliver of 15 per cent of the superannuant's account belonged to the Government. All we have done is bring that tax forward to apply now rather than 20 or 30 years hence. That is where the $1 billion comes from without affecting end benefits by one cent. That is what I said in May 1988 and that is what I repeat tonight. However, the Opposition has dishonestly applied that one cent statement to the tax on fund earnings. That is what the Opposition did.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should be quiet. He has done poorly enough in the whole exercise. I thought that out of shame he would shut up. The bring-forward of the 15 per cent, the $1 billion, does not affect end benefits by one cent. There are two taxes here: there is the bring-forward of the end benefits tax-the 15 per cent on contributions as they go into the fund-and there is the 15 per cent tax on fund earnings. There are two 15 per cents and two different taxes. As to the 15 per cent tax on fund earnings, as I said in May 1988, a fund could, if it changed the pattern of its equities versus fixed interest securities or property mix, reduce that 15 per cent tax to zero. It could do so if it changed the balance of its portfolio more in favour of equities. I claimed that most would and they did. But not all of them did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then we had a fatuous claim by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) who thinks that the most extravagant, outrageous thing that can be said ought to be said. He is like a little boy poking his tongue out in the Parliament while it is on the radio-that is, say whatever you can and slink out. He said, `What the Treasurer has done is insist that funds take 100 per cent risk by putting 100 per cent of their earnings, their portfolio, in equities, in the share market'. Does he not remember the share market collapse? The fact of the matter is that share portfolios in these funds typically would be no more than 40 per cent of total portfolios. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The measure has been supported by National Mutual, the AMP Society and every sane person who believes in having a proper basis of taxation for superannuation. What the Government has done with superannuation is align its tax treatment of superannuation with all other forms of saving. As superannuation existed under the Rip Van Wingle years of the Liberal Party, it was not taxed on the way in; it was not taxed in the fund; it was taxed only on the way out of the fund. All other forms of savings were taxed on the way in; taxed in the fund; but not on the way out. Let me give a demonstration. If one puts money into a bank account one does so with one's after tax income; so it is taxed on the way in. If one has money in a bank account and interest accrues to it, one pays tax on it; so it is taxed while it is in there. But one can than take it out free of tax. What we have done is change the tax treatment of superannuation and aligned it with all other forms of savings. So now it is taxed on the way in, taxed while it is in, but not on the way out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In aligning the tax treatment of super with the tax treatment of all other forms of savings, we have given superannuation a proper, rational and permanent place in the Australian taxation structure. I should have thought that if Opposition members were interested in savings, superannuation and the equities market they would applaud the Government for giving a rational basis of taxation to this industry. That is what has happened: that is what the amendments are all about. The bring-forward is simply the bring-forward of a tax which was formerly a tax on the way out. It is now a tax on the way in. But in bringing it forward, we concertina 20 or 30 years of tax into the year the contributions are made and that will amount to about $1 billion this year.</PARA>
<PARA> That is a totally rational change to the tax treatment of superannuation, but as well as that we allowed occupational superannuation through the 3 per cent case to be given to the whole work force-denied by the Opposition but supported by us-so ordinary working men and women could have a share of the tax provisions of superannuation, which were formerly only left for people in the public sector or in more grand private sector scheme. As a result, there will be larger aggregate savings in superannuation. Whether that leads to larger national aggregate savings depends on people's savings propensity, but at least there will be a greater proportion of funds going into superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> My mate over there-I cannot remember his electorate; our little fat friend from Victoria-referred to ADFs. He said, `This is shocking about ADFs. People may be mobile. You know, they've got this mobility. They leave a job with superannuation, put their money in the ADF and now they will find that there is some discriminatory tax treatment'. Who put the ADF there in the first place? It was not the Opposition, even though it had 30 years in which to do so. We put it there. The ADF is the superannuation parking station. If one happens to leave a job with superannuation one can put one's money in the ADF until one picks up another job with superannuation, or one can leave it. Under the previous Government, if a person had a job which included superannuation benefits for 20 years and was then fired, he received his benefit, which involved mainly his contribution, and was then waved goodbye. That was the end of the person's superannuation entitlement. Now people can put their money into an approved deposit fund established by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is telling us that this proposal introduces some discriminatory tax basis. But what about a person who happened to be caught up, as many people were, in the recession in 1982 caused by the previous Government-a person who had been in a job for, say, 28 or 25 years, had made superannuation contributions and all of a sudden found himself out on the street? Do honourable members know what such a person got back in the main? His fund contributions and a kind smile! Such people were not able to take their contributions and the vested benefits and put them in an ADF, because no ADF existed. Yet Opposition members tonight are saying, `Isn't this shocking? We will now have a discriminatory basis for taxation on super funds in ADFs'. Such a scheme did not exist under the previous Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has introduced all of these changes: mobility and portability in regard to ADFs, the rational tax treatment of superannuation; the alignment of the tax treatment of lump sums with the tax treatment of superannuation pensions, and annuities. The whole annuities business has been developed by this Government. The whole superannuation industry has been reinvigorated by this Government. Millions of people now have superannuation. Is it any wonder that the superannuation industry supports the Government? Of course it is; we have remade it. We are now conducting a review with the life offices to remake the whole life insurance industry by rationalising the tax structure. The Opposition has never given the life offices tuppence worth of thought. It allowed that question to lie dormant for years. Now all Australians are involved in occupational superannuation. There is rational tax treatment for superannuation; equality between the tax treatment of superannuation lump sums and superannuation pensions; the portability of approved deposit funds; compulsory vesting for the 3 per cent; and a supervisory structure for superannuation funds by way of a government supervisory office. The previous Government did nothing. We have totally revolutionised savings through superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we have also reduced the general tax rates while that has been occurring. We have reduced the previous Government's top marginal rate of 60 per cent for those who did get a superannuation pension to 49 per cent, and it is heading towards 47 per cent. Seeing that the Opposition always cries crocodile tears for battlers, I refer to the bottom marginal rate under the previous Government of 30 per cent, which under this Government has been reduced to 24 per cent. So under the previous Government the bottom rate was 30 per cent and the top rate was 60 per cent. Talk about going to sleep! The jokers opposite were asleep for three decades of public policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred) talked about the Unit Trust Funds Association. He said that such funds opposed this legislation. Do honourable members know why? They are in the property game; they are opposed to the equities market. The Association went to the Opposition and said, `This is a dreadful piece of legislation; knock it over for us because a lot of these super funds will now go to the equities market and not to us'. This is called self-pleading, but such organisations could sell the Opposition the town hall clock. The Association said to the Opposition, `Hang on; we are in the property game and we do not like investments in shares and stocks in the equities market. Please knock over this legislation and give us an open slather field'. The Opposition said, `Yes, we will'. Talk about wide-eyed Simon!</PARA>

I could refer to other matters raised by the Opposition, such as how the $1 billion would cost people money. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) asked how end benefits could not be reduced having regard to the $1 billion. I have demonstrated how they could not be reduced. The honourable member for Mayo said that they would have to be risky and take a 100 per cent investment in equities, when the shadow Minister had said it would be 30-30-30-that is, 30 per cent in equities, and in some cases as high as 40 per cent. As I said, the 15 per cent tax on lump sums can be reduced to zero if funds change their portfolio arrangements. But if they wish to persist with fixed interest securities, the 15 per cent tax will be levied upon them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We heard from the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) a complaint about government by press release. In fact, we made a major budgetary statement in the Parliament, in the way in which every government has portended major changes. One could not draw this legislation without consulting the industry, with a long lead time, without it becoming a public matter. It was, properly given public status by the Government in the first instance and then drawn properly, which was an entirely sensible thing to do. Finally, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) talked about Glenda Korporaal, who had said that this legislation reduced individual benefits. I can only say about Ms Korporaal, whose articles I have been reading from time to time, that her brain has been addled by working for a business magazine. She ought to go the Australian Financial Review and get back to a bit of hard journalism, instead of the soft stuff that we get in business magazines. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude where I began: the Government supports this amendment. I repeat that the performance by the honourable member for Bradfield cuts new political ground. He complained that the Government did not apprise him of the inconsistencies of his amendment. So the Government was required to tell him that his amendment was faulty. He put out a press statement saying that he had been ambushed by the Government because he had incompetently drawn an amendment and that the Government had known about the details of his amendment, but had the indecency not to tell him. I can only say that that cuts a bit of new political ground. Because his colleagues in the Opposition know that streaming imputed credits means that the vast bulk of savings in super funds can now be streamed into the equities market for capital formation rather than being streamed offshore, they must know of the enormous inconsistency of the position adopted by the honourable member for Bradfield with regard to the debate in the Senate and his obstructionist behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> He said tonight, `We've given you the run around for a couple of months, haven't we?'. That is his definition of opposition: obstructionist, irresponsible behaviour simply to delay the process of legislation and of governments. Then, when he is caught out by massively incompetent performance, he screams political foul, that it was up to Senator Walsh to say to him, `I must tell you that you have incorrectly drawn your amendment which you have designed to defeat our legislation. So just to guarantee that it gets defeated, we will draw the amendment for you correctly'. That ranks as the most crass and absurd political proposition in a long time. It must be clear to the Opposition frontbench that the honourable member for Bradfield is a great load to carry and that the quicker they jettison him in one of their revolving doors, the quicker they might get a decent retirement incomes policy. </PARA>
