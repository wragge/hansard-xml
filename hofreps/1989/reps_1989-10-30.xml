<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This guffaw that comes from the members on the other side is typical of the contributions they have made on this issue from day one. The fact, very simply, is that the industrial dispute between those who were the employees of the airlines and the airlines has ceased to exist. It ceased to exist as an industrial dispute when the employees resigned from the airlines. There was no employment nexus between the members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) and the airlines when they submitted their resignations. Against that position, the Industrial Relations Commission sought to retain some opportunity for the AFAP to have some role in the dispute. Despite the best efforts of the Industrial Relations Commission to achieve that outcome, the attitude of the AFAP was such that the Commission finally said--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commission finally said that the basis of the resumption of normal operations was such that it did not involve the AFAP. It involved the signing up of individuals in contracts that had been drawn up by the two airlines-contracts that were vetted by the Industrial Relations Commission, or accepted by it as being in accordance with the guidelines of the Commission. The Industrial Relations Commission decision said to the AFAP that there could still be a position in which there may be a role for the AFAP: firstly, if it removed the embargoes on its members signing individual contracts, which were now the basis of the award; and, secondly and thirdly, if it accepted the decisions and guidelines of the Commission. The AFAP has consistently refused to accept the position laid down by the independent umpire, the Industrial Relations Commission. In that sense, there is no industrial dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members-Oh!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition members can make all the noise they like. The fact is that the Industrial Relations Commission, which presumably knows more about this than the buffoons on the other side of the House, and which understands the industrial relations system better than those on the other side of the House, has said that the industrial dispute is over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that the industrial dispute is over does not mean that there are not problems in the aviation industry. I have not said that there are not problems in the aviation industry. The question was not: Are the problems in the aviation industry over? The question was: When will the industrial dispute be resolved? I put myself in the same position as the Industrial Relations Commission. I would rather have the support and the position of the Industrial Relations Commission on this than the position of those opposite who, from day one, have identified themselves completely with the pilots. As I have said, there has been this unholy troika: the pilots, the Opposition and Norm Gallagher. It is a very likely combination because they all want to see the industrial relations system in this country destroyed. That is the aim of the pilots; it is the aim of the Opposition; and it is the aim of the Norm Gallaghers of this world.</PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, because of the resilience that has been shown by the airlines and with the support that has been provided by the Industrial Relations Commission, the fact is, as the Industrial Relations Commission says, that the industrial dispute is over. What is happening is that the airlines are gradually rebuilding the aviation industry in this country and they are doing it on the basis outlined and supported by the Industrial Relations Commission. That is, the aviation industry is being rebuilt on the basis of individual contracts which are being signed in increasing numbers by pilots recruited in this country and overseas. The industrial dispute is over.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question to the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support by saying that over the last weekend in particular I have noticed considerable wet weather damage to roads in my electorate, especially local roads. I ask the Minister: What is the current position concerning road funding? Will the current level of road funding be maintained?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2038" SPEAKER="Brown The Hon R.J." NAMEID="5A5" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CHARLTON" MINISTERIAL="LAND TRANSPORT AND SHIPPING SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member has brought to my attention on a number of occasions his concern about some of the roads in his electorate. As he indicated, quite correctly, some of the local roads have suffered damage over the last few weeks in particular as a result of the weather in Victoria and generally down the eastern part of Australia. He asked whether the present level of funding would be maintained. The short answer to this is yes. Not only will it be maintained, but it will be maintained in real terms as a result of the indexing that we have built into the Australian centennial roads development program that we adopted from 1 January this year. The effect of that was that the total level of funding for roads at the Federal level-I think everyone must understand that there are three levels of government involved in funding roads-increased by almost 10 per cent. That was ahead of the inflation rate and indicates that the $120m in extra funds for roads from the Federal Government contains a real increase as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The total amount of funds that went to Victoria from the Federal Government represented a 13.3 per cent increase. For local roads the increase was about 9.2 per cent, which again is ahead of the inflation rate. I understand that there are difficulties on the part of local government in meeting the sorts of commitments that it has-the same applies to State governments-and that is one of the reasons why successive Federal governments have chosen to supplement their funds and why we have maintained and continued that general principle. The honourable member asked whether it was likely that that funding would be maintained. As far as we are concerned, it will be. As a result of the particular index that we have adopted we will be building real increases into it. The question is whether or not it is likely to be maintained under all possible circumstances. It will be maintained because this Government will remain in office.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us examine what the alternative may be. I do not know whether the Opposition has ever retreated from or repudiated an undertaking that was given by the honourable member for Deakin when he had shadow ministerial responsibilities in this area. He suggested that it was doubtful whether the Federal Government should fund local roads at all. It was his opinion that the Federal Government should withdraw from that area. That has never been repudiated by any subsequent spokesman for the Opposition, nor has it ever been repudiated by any of the numerous Leaders of the Opposition who have occupied that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was also interesting that, as a result of a series of conflicting statements that had been made by the Opposition and Opposition spokesmen from time to time, the Australian Automobile Association asked as early as April this year for a definitive statement from the Opposition. It said in a news release:</PARA>
<PARA> The time has come for the Opposition to put its money where its mouth is instead of merely jumping on the road funding bandwagon.</PARA>
<PARA>A number of responses have come from different members of the Opposition from time to time. The person who has shadow ministerial responsibility for this area at present is the honourable member for Gilmore. In an interview with 4QN in June of this year, the honourable member for Gilmore said:</PARA>
<PARA> We will be releasing that figure-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, a firm figure of increased road funding, presumably-</PARA>
<PARA>very shortly.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in June. It is now the end of the year. We still have not received that figure. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We will have the biggest road funding increase from the Federal Government in the history of this country.</PARA>
<PARA>If it were to be the biggest increase, it would need to exceed 32 per cent because that was our increase in 1983-84 and that would represent an increase of about $450m. So that is one commitment that has been made-$450m.</PARA>
<PARA> Another commitment was made by the honourable member for Gilmore when he said, in response to a question from Don Chipp, that the Opposition hoped to raise funding for roads by 2c, 3c, 4c or 5c a litre. If it is 5c a litre, that is an extra $1,000m. The National Party candidate out in Calare has gone on the record as saying that the Opposition, if it ever came to government, would allocate a minimum of 7c a litre to road funding. That represents about $400m. The Leader of the National Party of Australia, addressing a National Transport Federation meeting in Melbourne, reported in the Canberra Times of 6 August 1989, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We give you a guarantee that a coalition government will substantially increase the level of Federal road funding in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> The next Federal Liberal Government will increase these returns-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, fuel excise to roads-</PARA>
<PARA>to 8c a litre.</PARA>
<PARA>That is another $600m. So we have had this whole range of promises. These people go around the country-and between now and whenever the next election is held they will go around the country-spreading their promises like confetti. This is a good example. Those promises range from an increase of $142m to an increase of $1.3 billion.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I conclude on this point: Here is a copy of their definitive statement on the economy and on taxation. Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to the amount of the statement the Opposition uses for the section on transport and communications. How many words are there about road funding in that definitive statement? Not one. How much additional money for road funding is in that statement? Not one cent. That is the commitment of the Leader of the Opposition and all those fellows sitting behind him. Like confetti, they spread around this country promises about the amount of additional money they will spend on roads. Local government, the AAA and the NRMA are not mugs. Honourable members opposite are the mugs for assuming that they are.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications and follows the answer of the Prime Minister to my previous question and his reported statement that the Government has done all it can to solve the air pilots dispute and that it is now up to the airlines to rebuild their services. Does this mean that no further initiatives will be taken by the Government to help resolve the problems in the airline industry to cut the devastating losses now being sustained by the tourist industry and other industries?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2040" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, of course, has taken many steps to try to ensure that we have as much capacity as possible, but the one step that we have never been prepared to take is the sell-out option that the Opposition has advocated from the day the dispute began. We have no intention whatever of taking the sale option. Honourable members opposite stand in this place and tell us what a great wages policy they would have, what a great economic policy they would have, and how they would reduce inflation and lower interest rates, but at the same time in this dispute the Opposition has stood here day after day in this House and told the Government that we should negotiate with the airlines. The only person who has said anything different from that is the new spokesman for industry, technology and commerce, who said that we should go down the individual contract path. Everyone else says that we should be negotiating with the pilots. The Leader of the Opposition has been saying that, the tourism spokesman has been saying it and the economics spokesman has been saying it. The Government is not going to take that option because, obviously, that is a highly irresponsible position for the Government to adopt. It would mean selling out wages policy, which of course is what the Opposition would do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's position in this dispute demonstrates its total incapacity to govern this country. When honourable members opposite were in government last they abysmally failed to control wages and in all the time they have been in opposition they have never been able to learn the lesson of the past or the lesson of the present, which is that if you want to govern this country effectively you have to have an effective wages policy. That means that you have to have a lot of support for that policy. When individual groups stand up against that policy, we have to be tough and firm about it. The weak-kneed attitude of the Opposition in saying that the Government should negotiate outside the wages policy and throw it out the window disregards inflation and adverse economic effects and simply demonstrates the Opposition's total unfitness for office. The Government has no intention whatsoever of adopting that course.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Community Services and Health. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a report regarding the proposed sale of Medibank Private? What are the fiscal and health policy implications of this proposal?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2040" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BONYTHON" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question and I note that he at least is concerned for the 300,000 Medibank Private contributors in Queensland-a concern not shared by the Opposition. Last week we discussed the dilemmas of the Opposition in relation to its child-care policy. I will turn to this aspect of its tax policy because the Opposition claims that it will save $1,600m out of the sale of four assets in its first year in office, the assets being Qantas, the Australian Industry Development Corporation, the Pipeline Authority and Medibank Private.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the Opposition does not spell out how much it estimates it will receive from the sale of Medibank Private, whether it is $300m, $400m or $500m; however, whatever its estimate, it is wrong. It is simply a sleight of hand. There is no money to be made by the Government out of the sale of this private non-profit organisation. It is no good the Opposition pretending that it does not know this. The Opposition is well aware of who established Medibank Private. The Opposition knows who established it, who owns it and whether it can be sold.</PARA>
<PARA> It was the coalition parties which established Medibank Private in 1976. The Fraser Government gave as its reason for establishing it the fact that it would inject greater competition into private health insurance and would provide the Government with a window into the operation of the health insurance industry. Those two things are as important today as they were 13 years ago when Medibank Private was established: to enable competition with the private health industry and to give the government a window into the operations of that whole industry. Since it was established by the Fraser Government it has become the most successful and efficient private fund, providing cover to 2.2 million Australians and holding reserves of $263m. I want to draw the attention of all members of the House to a letter from the former general manager of the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) and Medibank Private, who was general manager for most of the Fraser period of office. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition's proposal to sell Medibank Private as part of its asset-raising programme is nothing more than a confidence trick. Consider these incontrovertible facts:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Medibank Private is already a private fund (Australia's largest and best).</PARA>
<PARA> 2. It receives not one cent from the government.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. It pays not one cent to government.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. It owes nothing to government.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Its reserves are those of its members and do not belong to government.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. The sale of Medibank Private would not attract any funds to consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> The creation of Medibank Private was one of the Fraser Government's best decisions and its proposed destruction by a future Liberal Government would be an act of sheer folly.</PARA>
<PARA>Those views of Mr Williams are shared by Mr Fred Millar, the Chairman of Medibank Private, another Fraser Government appointee. He told the Courier-Mail newspaper on 25 October 1989 that he could not conceive what value a non-profit organisation would be to anyone and there was no sense in the Opposition proposal. The only reason we have seen for selling it off is a reason given by the honourable member for Ryan, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government should not be involved in providing services which can be delivered more efficiently outside the realm of government control.</PARA>
<PARA>That is simply ideological hogwash. It is simply an ideological predisposition without any facts at all to back it up. Already Medibank Private is run independently of government. The HIC is widely acknowledged as not only the most efficient health fund in Australia but also one of the best run businesses of its kind in this country. Any business that can get a consumer approval rating of 93 per cent is certainly comparable with any of the industries in the private sector. The only possible rationale-and there is one-for selling it off would be to sell it off as some kind of premium to another health fund in order to reduce competition in the private health industry. Even that is most unlikely because there are serious legal impediments to the Opposition's proposal. Legal opinion was obtained by the Fraser Government in 1981 on this point on the proposed sale of the HIC. That legal opinion made it quite clear:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth does not in any legal sense have any equity in the HIC or in its assets. There are no doubt many other problems involved in what would be legally and administratively a very complex exercise.</PARA>
<PARA>It is about time the Opposition admitted its blunder. This proposal, like the whole economic action document, is simply a con trick.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The supporting statement which was distributed with the election speech said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We pledge that by 1990 no child will need to live in poverty.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the statement that was distributed, and it was the statement which was arrived at after considerable consultation on the part of the Government with those in the welfare sector. In fact, what was done was to set as benchmarks proportions of pension which would be regarded by those best able to make the judgment as providing a level of financial remuneration to lower income families which, when provided, would meet the pledge that there would be no need for any child to live in poverty.</PARA>
<PARA> The increases in both family allowance and family allowance supplement announced in the April statement this year met those benchmarks which were set in consultation with the welfare sector. They met those benchmarks in full and they did it from July 1989, which was six months ahead of the schedule. Those payments go to mothers as of right on a regular fortnightly basis; and to ensure that the purchasing power of those payments is maintained over time, family allowance and family allowance supplement rates will be adjusted annually to maintain the benchmarks. The Government has made that concerted attack, which is unprecedented in the history of this country, while the promise of the Opposition in this context is not to maintain this attack on child poverty; its commitment is to slash welfare.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me examine in some detail what has been said within the welfare sector about the promise that I made on behalf of the Government, what it is conceived to have been in intent, how it has been achieved, and how it contrasts the position of the Opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the statement by the Brotherhood of St Laurence:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This pledge, the most specific social commitment of the century has been the subject of a historic package to provide a guaranteed minimum income for poor children whose parents earn less than about $300 per week.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Brotherhood said relative to what it regarded as the most specific social commitment of this century. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA>We congratulate the Federal Government on its work on child poverty, which represents a historic breakthrough in the national attack on child poverty. The Federal Government has now built a solid foundation of income security for Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> What did Julian Disney of the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) say in a letter dated 14 July 1989? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>As you know, about 2.5 million Australian families are now receiving the increased family payments announced by your Government in the April Economic Statement. ACOSS wishes to reiterate at this time our congratulations to your Government on the major increases in family allowances and also the increases in family allowance supplement (FAS) for older children. It is without doubt an outstanding achievement to have set, and now reached, the benchmarks for child payments for low-income families.</PARA>
<PARA>First of all we had the statement from the Brotherhood of St Laurence and then one from the spokesman for the Australian Council of Social Service. I repeat the latter:</PARA>
<PARA>It is without doubt an outstanding achievement to have set, and now reached, the benchmarks for child payments for low-income families.</PARA>
<PARA> ACOSS and our members believe these initiatives represent a major contribution to tackling the problems of child poverty and working towards a fairer society.</PARA>
<PARA>Next I refer to the statement by the Australian Institute of Family Studies entitled Families and the Tax Package, May 1989. The Opposition has rubbished statements from the Brotherhood of St Laurence and ACOSS. It can now add to those this statement from the Australian Institute of Family Studies:</PARA>
<PARA>By these means the Government's pledge to meet the benchmarks has been met. The new levels of FAS represent rises in real terms since 1983-84 of 41 per cent for younger children and 203 per cent for older children over the previous family income supplement payments.</PARA>
<PARA> For low income families especially, the decision of the Government to annually adjust all family-related payments in accordance with movements in the consumer price index, is the most significant long term reform of the tax package.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have had a statement from Bishop Hollingworth that the commitment has been met. The Brotherhood of St Laurence has referred to it as the most specific social commitment of the century and said that the pledge has been met. Julian Disney of ACOSS has said that it has been met and the Australian Institute of Family Studies has said that it has been met. It is little wonder that I can finally quote this from Bishop Peter Hollingworth on 20 August:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made real advances in recent years in building a more secure and adequate system of income support for Australians living close to or below the poverty line.</PARA>
<PARA>He concluded on this point:</PARA>
<PARA> These reforms are too important to be caught in the crossfire of political conflict.</PARA>

<PARA>In other words those in the welfare sector who know the facts say thank you to the Government first of all for consulting with them on the way to bringing about this historic reform; thank you, secondly, for meeting our pledge; and thank you, thirdly, for meeting it six months ahead of schedule. Fourthly, they condemn the Opposition for its miserable politicking on this and say to the Opposition, `For God's sake acknowledge the greatness of these reforms and adopt a bipartisan attitude towards this instead of your miserable intention of further slashing welfare if ever you get back into office'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be interested to see some evidence from the Opposition. Rather than having evidence from the Opposition, we have a number of statements which have very little basis to them at all. If a member of the Opposition could be accused of making a loose statement in respect of social security it would be the honourable member for Bradfield. The honourable member for Bradfield, as shadow spokesman in this Parliament, while he avoids open debate within the media, from time to time is prepared to make various statements about the extent of fraud in the social security system. For example, he said that fraud in the social security system was about 2 per cent and he made that statement relying on his position as Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts some years ago. Of course, he made no reference at all to the changes that have been introduced during our term in government-about 230 detailed changes designed to improve the administration of the social security system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Showing the same capacity for arithmetic as the honourable member for Mackellar, he announced that that saving of 2 per cent of social security expenditure would amount to savings of the order of $1.25 billion. On my calculation, 2 per cent of $21 billion is more of the order of $420m. But arithmetic is not a great concern of the Opposition, nor is consistency. Two days later the honourable member for Bradfield talked about what might be saved out of social security and that figure has become 0.5 per cent. He claimed that the Department of Social Security said that it was detecting 0.5 per cent of people cheating the system. In fact, the Department had said nothing of that kind.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I will tell you what the Opposition is about, which is a matter of great concern to me. The Opposition is about raising a spectre in this country which would effectively mean that anyone who applied for social security in this country potentially is about to defraud the system. Anyone whose life is dependent for a moment on social security is under suspicion and attack. I cannot understand why the Leader of the Opposition should refer to the issue of child poverty when, after all, the Opposition, in terms of its policies, is not about liberating people from their dependence on welfare and social security but trapping them. Essentially, that is what the honourable member for Wentworth was talking about when he mentioned these imaginary, illusory savings which have no impact other than labelling and stigmatising people in a traumatic period of their lives when they may happen to be dependent on the social security system. I return to the question of integrity within the social security system. Make no mistake about it, this Government has concerned itself with the integrity of the social security system. Any serious observer of this system knows that. Indeed, the honourable member for Wentworth said the same thing himself in April. This Government's record is a strong one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is not about going to the welfare sector. The Opposition is not game enough to go into the welfare sector and debate its policies and statements. The Opposition is not about debate but about casting a slur on anyone who happens to be going through a period of crisis in their lives. I very much regret that, and make no apology for feeling very strongly about it indeed.</PARA>

On the question of what governments are prepared to do, the record of this Government-indicated not only by the statements by me and the Minister but also by the endorsements that have come from within the welfare sector-shows that the judgments of those concerned with child poverty on a day by day basis are, firstly, that this Government has delivered on its promises--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course there will be situations where whatever money is provided by government will not, as a result of decisions made either by the children themselves or by their parents, go to the children to relieve the poverty which it is intended to relieve. No government in a democracy can ensure there will be no children living in poverty in a situation in which, after having paid out, as we will have this year, well over $2 billion calculated to address this need, there may be problems through either the action of children running away from home or parents not using the money which is made available to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not mind if, in the period between now and next election, the Leader of the Opposition carries on down this path because he will be saying that he wants to knock this Government for having spent over $2 billion in additional outlays to address this problem and deliver on its promise, when everyone in the welfare sector is saying that the Government has delivered on its promise. He wants to go around saying that the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Australian Institute of Family Studies and the Australian Council of Social Service are wrong in the judgments they make about the Government when they say that the Government and the Prime Minister have delivered on their promise. That is what those people are saying. The Opposition is saying to the Brotherhood and these other groups, `You are wrong; you have got it wrong when you attack the Opposition'-and that is what the Brotherhood has done. The Brotherhood of St Laurence has said to the Opposition, `Stop this miserable attack; it is ill-founded'. That is what is being said within the welfare sector. If the Opposition wants to go on saying these things, it may do so.</PARA>
<PARA> I particularly welcome this approach because, between now and the next election, there will be a contrast between the policies of this Government-not only its achievements-and the alternative policies. In terms of the achievements, the people of Australia will be asking themselves the very simple question: What did those opposite do when they were in office and had the opportunity of addressing the needs of young people in this country? They will remember that in the last 12 months of the time in office of that mob opposite, with this fellow as one of their Ministers--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition was one of the Ministers who, in that period, threw another quarter of a million Australians, particularly young Australians, onto the unemployment scrap heap. The people of Australia will be asking what they did in the education sphere. If we are to do something about the question of poverty and children, the first thing that we have to do is make sure that we collect enough revenue from those with a capacity to pay to put money into education so as to ensure that the kids will go to school. However, after seven years in office those opposite walked out leaving Australia with the most miserable record in the Western world in terms of retention rates in the education system. Thirty-six per cent of our kids stayed on in school. That was the record of honourable members opposite. That was their concern for children and whether they would ever be able to get out of the cycle of poverty. That was because they would not get the rich in this country to pay their tax. The only industry which flourished under those opposite was the tax avoidance industry. Because they refused to take the money from the wealthy, they did not have the revenue to put into a decent education system. After seven years in office they walked out with the miserable record-the worst in the Western world-of only 36 per cent of our kids staying on in school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We said two things: we said that we would ensure that those with a capacity to pay paid and we would remedy the taxation system. Part of that remedy was to bring in a capital gains tax. As a result of that, we have put money into the education system. We have increased by more than 50 per cent the allowances to kids, particularly those from low income families. So instead of having only 36 per cent of our kids staying on in school, the figure is now 58 per cent. By the beginning of the 1990s it will be up to 65 per cent. We did that by ensuring that those in the community with the greatest capacity to pay tax paid it, instead of it being a matter of choice as it was when those opposite walked out of office in 1983. Our record of 58 per cent of kids staying on in school will be compared with the Opposition's record of 36 per cent. The fact is that the rich are now paying their taxes rather than not paying them.</PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia will know that the Opposition has not learnt from the past because it will be going to them with a taxation policy which will promise a return of the rorts and the rackets of the past. John Elliott is the Opposition's puppeteer. He is the man who has it dancing according to his strings. What conversations did those opposite have with John Elliott before they brought out their capital gains tax policy? What deal did they do with him to give him a benefit of $17m into his kick? The Leader of the Opposition is saying, `Okay, John Elliott. You've shoved me up into office and now I will give you your pay-back'. Whereas Hawke and Keating in the Labor Government make sure that he pays his tax, the Leader of the Opposition says, `I'll give you at least $17m of it back'. That will be $17m that will not be available to look after the kids of this country. The Opposition's priority is to put Elliott before the kids. By the time we go to the election, that is the judgment that the people of Australia will have made. I can tell honourable members whose side they will be on-that of the kids; not that of the Opposition and its puppeteer.</PARA>

What has prompted the Leader of the Opposition to claim that his proposal will help small business, when more than two-thirds of the capital gains tax paid by companies is paid by the largest 1 1/2 per cent of Australian companies? Of course, it is an absolute sham.

He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Overall, the existing CGT is reasonable-especially with the inflation adjustment (perhaps that should be extended to losses as well). Further, appropriate or not, it is rendered essential by the gaps in the income tax system.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MH4">Mr JULL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 13 August the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said on A Current Affair, `If I cannot protect Australia against a small group who would destroy the Australian wage system and destroy the Australian economy, I would not deserve to be Prime Minister'. The plain facts are that one of the most vital elements of this economy, the international tourist industry, is being destroyed. As of today we have learned through Question Time that the Government has no future initiative for this industry, that there is no possibility that the Government will intervene again in terms of trying to resolve the pilots dispute, and that there is a very bleak future indeed in terms of the tourist industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us never forget that up until 30 June this year tourism was our biggest export industry; it was our biggest earner of foreign exchange, and now it is being shot to pieces by the complete inaction of this Government. It would be right to get up here and to go through the litany of suffering that is going on around Australia. We could give graphic details of how Tasmania has lost $50m and 2,000 jobs; of how the Northern Territory has already lost $60m; of how in Victoria 2,000 people have lost their jobs in the hotel industry; of how 417 conferences and conventions have been cancelled; of how in Queensland overseas visits are down by 30 per cent, and 150 conventions have been lost; of how on the Gold Coast alone 10,000 convention delegates are not now going to come; of how the Gold Coast has lost 80,000 room nights as a result of this dispute; and of how Cairns had lost $21m by the end of September. One can imagine what it will be like by the end of October. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not matter whether they are hotel operators or tourist operators or whether it is the local egg distributor or vegetable grower-there is not one section of the Australian economy that does not benefit from tourism; there is not one section of the Australian economy that is not suffering from this dreadful dispute, to which there would appear to be no end. Yet we have the Government going along with the gurus of the airline industry when it says that it can see no end to this dispute before Easter next year. On its usual predictions, it is probably two or three months out. Maybe we will not see this dispute over until about July or August next year. That is the continuing tragedy of this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has shown no sympathy whatsoever. Sure, the Prime Minister went to Darwin for 20 minutes and talked to the local tourist operators. He promised all sorts of things. What happened? Absolutely nothing. We heard the stories from the Prime Minister of how he had a special arrangement with the banks and financial institutions to look after the people in the tourist industry who are suffering as a result of this dispute. What has come from the banks? Has there been any sympathy? Nothing has come from the banks. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as though the Government was not put on notice. On 20 September this year the Prime Minister received a letter from the following: the Managing Director of Japan Travel Bureau (Australia) Pty Ltd, the Managing Director of JCT (Australia) Pty Ltd, the Director and General Manager of Kintetsu International Express Oceania Pty Ltd, the Director and General Manager of Nippon Royoko (Australia) Pty Ltd, the General Manager of the Tokyo Tourist Corporation and the Director and General Manager of the Yusen Air and Sea Service (Australia) Pty Ltd. Who are those people? They are the principals of the inbound Japanese tourist market, which provides 80 per cent of the visitors. That letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> The six undersigned members of the Japanese Tour Wholesalers Committee in Australia jointly look after about eighty per cent of the Japanese tourists who visit here. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, the year of the Bicentenary, was a remarkably successful year for Australian Inbound Tourism. </PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>In good faith, all of the undersigned have endeavoured to build upon the strong base established in 1988 and are now very alarmed at the rate at which the popularity of Australia as a destination is being destroyed by the air pilots' dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>The final paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we now implore that you exercise every influence available in order to bring normality back to the Australian Domestic Air Schedules as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>What has happened? Absolutely nothing. Australia is no longer on those inbound tourist programs for the Japanese next year. It will take years before we get that market back. The German market has given us a miss. We are not getting German tourists. The numbers from North America are down 25 per cent. But is the Government doing anything? No, it is doing absolutely nothing. There is no end in sight to this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the weekend we had the debacle of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) admitting on television that the Australian public has been misled for weeks and weeks as to the capacity of the Australian airlines system. We have all heard it. The whole House heard the Prime Minister say that at the end of September we would have 50 per cent capacity. Then it went up. Three or four weeks ago he was blowing his trumpet that we were hitting 62 per cent. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) is telling us now that we will get up to 80 per cent and we will probably have 90 per cent capacity by Christmas time so that people can get around on their holidays. The Government has been found out because those figures do not correlate at all. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Opposition has been making this point, it was up to the Melbourne Age to expose the sham of the air traffic figures out of Melbourne-35 per cent, according to an independent survey. If one wants to travel around Australia, one should look at the real figures. The Gold Coast has one of the very few airports in Australia that made a profit this year. What happened on the Gold Coast? What are the real figures for the Gold Coast in terms of the air traffic going in there? In July, before this dispute began, there were 158,180 seats into the Gold Coast. In September the figure had dropped to 9,000. Is 9,000, compared with 158,180, 50 per cent of capacity, as mentioned by the Prime Minister? Cairns usually has 17 flights a day, but it is now receiving five. Is that a true indication?</PARA>
<PARA> What is happening in the Northern Territory? I do not care what figures one looks at-the official statistics of the Federal Airports Corporation, the Ansett Airlines of Australia figures or the Australian Airlines Ltd figures: they will tell one that, at the moment, the Northern Territory is lucky to receive five air services a day. Up until now it has been receiving one and two services. Normally there are up to 50 flights a day through the Northern Territory. The Government has misled this House and it has misled the Australian people. The Prime Minister should be condemned, because we do have this farce and a situation where our number one export industry is in dire trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation where we could stand to lose $3 billion in the tourist industry this year. We have a situation where more than 20,000 people are already unemployed, yet the Government is sitting on its hands and doing absolutely nothing. It is about time that this House got behind a motion like this and condemned the Government for its inaction, for its complete destruction of the tourist industry and for the loss of jobs to the young people of Australia. For all those things this Government stands well and truly condemned. </PARA>

Over the years there is one thing that this Government has proven itself to be expert at, that is, the repeated untruths it expresses, which are designed to hide the facts, to mislead Australians and to put the performance of this Government in a totally different light to what the real situation is. Of course, during the time that we have been here and while this Government has been in office we have seen many examples of those repeated untruths. We have heard repeated untruths that relate to the economy; repeated untruths only last week that related to farmers; repeated untruths about child poverty-and we heard a whopper today!-of course, repeated untruths in respect of road funding; and repeated untruths about what the Government is doing about reforming the waterfront and what the Government is doing about Sydney Airport.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, as I was saying, is expert at these repeated untruths. One of those repeated untruths relates to what has been going on with this pilots dispute over the past couple of months in Australia. We have seen the Government deliberately mislead the Australian public. We had in the speech just made by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) the opportunity to highlight where the Government has misled this country over airline seat capacity. Over the weekend the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) brought to light just how untrue the Government's words are in relation to airline seat capacity. One thing which has really not been brought to light by this Government and really needs to be brought to light is the way in which ordinary Australians are being affected by the airline pilots dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So often we hear from the Government how big business is being affected and how the Government will pay compensation to the two big airline operators of Australia. We hear how all of this is the direction of the Government. However, we do not hear the Government talking about little Australians. I hate to use the term `little Australians', but I have to use it to give a comparison of the way in which this Government treats ordinary Australians. It is the ordinary Australians who have been ignored during the air pilots dispute, and I have many examples of the way in which they have been adversely affected. Here in Canberra, for example, I spoke to a hire car operator just the other day, an ex-Vietnam veteran and a person who is eligible for a totally and permanently incapacitated (TPI) pension. He choose not to take up the TPI pension but rather to enter the work force and, as a consequence of his efforts, he was able to purchase a hire care a little while ago. By purchasing that hire car he hoped to make a decent living for himself. As a consequence of the pilots dispute, his business has dropped to 6 per cent of its previous capacity. As a consequence of that, he has had to leave his rented home where his wife and children lived. His wife and children have had to move to another town, where her parents live. He is now renting cheap rooms here in Canberra in order to keep his business going. Why is he keeping his business going? Because if he sold it today he would not be able to pay the bank the money he owes. This is one example of how one individual is affected by this pilots dispute. We can go to other examples throughout Australia. If we go to a place such as Tasmania we can see how an ordinary Australian is faring there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason why Standing Orders need to be suspended is the way in which this pilots dispute is affecting ordinary Australians. I am trying to highlight to the Parliament exactly how that is happening. That is why Standing Orders need to be suspended. We have ordinary Australians, such as a butcher in Tasmania who has lost 80 per cent of his business, being affected. One would think that butchers in Tasmania would not be affected by the pilots dispute, but they are affected because the tourism industry is such a part of the economy of Tasmania. Within four weeks the butcher estimates that his business will be bankrupt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This situation is occurring right around Australia, whether it be in the Northern Territory, where major tourist activities have closed down in the last few weeks, or whether it be in Queensland, where all sorts of businesses are closing down because of the pilots dispute; and in Cairns major holiday and conference tourist operators have had to close off their business. It is for those reasons that the House needs to suspend Standing Orders in order to debate what I believe and what the Opposition believes to be one of the most important issues facing this country-an issue which this Government is not addressing and which is doing tremendous harm to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes this motion. It has been given no reasons by either of the speakers as to why it should accept it, despite the best efforts of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) to make the speech for the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) through constant loud heckling from the front bench to get him to alter his course. The fact of the matter is that none of the claims that have been made by the Opposition, as far as this Government is concerned, stand up, and they would not stand up on further debate-which is another reason why we ought not to have that further debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One thing is notable about those speeches: at no stage in any of the remarks that the Opposition has made in seeking the suspension of Standing Orders, nor on any of the occasions that it has debated this matter over the last few weeks, was there one hint of a suggestion that a way around this particular dispute would be for the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) to accept the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission to go and work on the basis of the contract signed by many ex-Federation members and a larger and increasing number of people who are pilots and are now working for the airlines but had not been members of the Federation, and thus resolve the problem. Not one word!</PARA>
<PARA> Now that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has been added to the front bench of the Opposition perhaps we will start to hear from him. In his claims yesterday on what ambit he could claim for his new portfolio responsibilities he was kind enough to include those which would normally have been associated with the shadow Minister for industrial relations, Senator Chaney, and the Opposition spokesman on small business, Mr Moore. At least as far as the remarks of the new industry spokesman for the Opposition are concerned, he considers himself as having two deputies in Chaney and Moore. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Ryan will produce some interesting outcomes in the weeks ahead. But the point, as he recognised when he was on the back bench, and as the Opposition ought to recognise, is that the resolution of this conflict now lies manifestly in the hands of the individual pilots. The only inhibition on a solution along these lines is the degree to which psychological pressure is placed on individual members of the AFAP by elements in the community that support its leadership and by the leadership itself. Only one element in the community is supporting that leadership in a way that inhibits the capacity of the average Federation member to go back to work, and that is the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The speech made by the honourable member for Fadden was front and centre in line with what the executive of the Federation of Air Pilots wants the Opposition to do. The Federation is going about the country-whether it has been encouraged to or not-and telling its members to hang on until after the next election and to give the Opposition some support, because the Opposition will surrender to it. That is the position being adopted and I believe it has been encouraged in that regard by the members of the Opposition, including the honourable member for Fadden. Looking at the nature of his speech, one can understand why there is at least a prima facie case for the position adopted by the Opposition. No concern has ever emanated from the Opposition. The pilots who seek to join up are manifestly being pressured both psychologically as well as actively and physically, as is well attested. No word of opposition to that treatment of the airline pilots who join up comes from the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> Instead, coming from the Opposition is one bogus motion after another, this being an example, in this place. The honourable member referred to concern about safety. When the airlines do fly, when the RAAF flies, when the pilots get up and operate, does the concern for the tourism industry come out and does the Opposition encourage people to fly on those aircraft? Does the bleating all over the place such as what we have just heard from the honourable member take place when that opportunity arises? No. What happens is that the Opposition comes into this place and dissembles about the state of safety in the Civil Aviation Authority to further discourage people from taking seats on aircraft and flying to the tourist destinations and providing work. </PARA>
<PARA> In case people think it was not bogus, I suggest for their edification that they read all the Senate Estimates committee hearings when the Opposition finally got an opportunity to run its position on the Civil Aviation Authority and safety. It is further evidence that every position that is put in this place is related only to the subliminal agenda and not to the issue that is being discussed at the time. It is not related to the tourism issue. It is not related to safety. It is not related to the ordinary people of Australia. It is related front and centre to the subliminal campaign of the Opposition to support the executive of the Federation of Air Pilots against the interests of its members, against the interests of the public and specifically against the interests of the tourism industry. That is exactly what the Opposition is about in this business. The honourable member who moved this motion is the chief perpetrator of that particular strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member who seconded the motion, in a speech which I can only say must be a case of me-tooism by the National Party, said to the Government, `We ought to debate this motion because the Government does not care about ordinary Australians.' From the outset of this dispute, the Government's principal concern has been the overall economic position of ordinary Australians, because that is the general situation that they confront and, secondly, the position of ordinary Australians who want to travel. Why does the Opposition think that the Government requested the RAAF to provide seats for these operations? Because we did not care about the situation of the ordinary Australian? Because we did not care about the needs of the people to get to see their relatives in states of crisis or whatever?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The people of Tasmania, I might say to the honourable member opposite, are being more than 50 per cent served by the RAAF. I might also say to him that on the one hand, one Opposition frontbencher from Tasmania is writing letters asking me to increase the number of RAAF flights to Tasmania, and on the other hand another member on the Opposition front bench is chastising me all around the country because he says that RAAF support for flying is political and the RAAF ought to be taken off. Opposition members should get their act together on this issue. They are canting hypocrites when it comes down to considering this matter, just as they are canting hypocrites on the subject of people losing their jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me go into that in some detail. What would the situation be in this country if the pilots' executive got its way? It is increasingly obvious to the public that two different positions are emerging among the pilots. The first is the attitude of the Federation leadership. The second is the attitude of ordinary Federation members who are trying in some way or another to break out of the psychological lock-grip imposed on them by the Federation, supported by the Opposition, in order to be able to get back to flying. </PARA>
<PARA> What position has the Opposition been adopting on this throughout? Its position has been to subvert every attempt made by the Government to get people back to work. If the Government were to fail in this, what would be the position of the ordinary Australia with a 30 per cent wage rise? The rise would flow through the system for the most powerful elements able to pursue it. We would have a massive rate of inflation-let us think of what that would do to those on fixed incomes in the community-and a massive rate of job loss. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not undertaken the course that it has on this whole dispute because it feels like having a stoush with the executive of the Federation of Air Pilots. It pursues its wages policy because that is what has provided ordinary Australians with work and opportunities to work over the last few years as we have gradually clawed our way back from the destruction of the Australian economy then being wrought on it by the three people who have now been appointed to operate the Opposition's economic policy. We have managed to claw back from that situation. The Federation of Air Pilots' executive threw itself into the breach to destroy that. It now finds its own position destroyed. It finds that the only element of hope in its position is the position being adopted in the House by the Opposition. This House must not encourage the Opposition in this course of action. There is too much at stake for the tourism industry. There is too much at stake for the ordinary Australian wage earner. There is too much at stake for those pilots who have braved the criticism of their colleagues in the pilots' executive and who have come back to work or who are thinking of doing that now. On those grounds the Opposition's motion deserves rejecting, as it will be rejected. </PARA>

Firstly, to my knowledge my office has never been informed of such a plan and did not withhold it, as the National Party candidate suggested in the article. Secondly, the statement the National Party candidate accused me of making was not made by me but by my colleague the member for Bundaberg, Mr Clem Campbell. The only disaster plan that I am aware of for north Bundaberg would be a plan by a declining number of people to vote for the National Party on 2 December.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is not a correct statement. I fact, what I said, commenting on the fact that the Leader of the Tasmanian Opposition had not involved himself previously with this issue and had not made any input at all in terms of seeing better services to Tasmania, was that if he had sought and obtained a meeting with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) I would eat my hat.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the sixteenth and seventeenth reports of the Committee for 1989, relating to the development of HMAS Stirling, stage 2, Western Australia, and northside development of civil aviation facilities, Darwin Airport, Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the reports be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The reports that I have just tabled refer to the following proposals: northside development of civil aviation facilities, Darwin Airport, and stage 2 development, including new submarine school, HMAS Stirling, Western Australia. The stage 2 development of HMAS Stirling consists of more than 35 individual projects ranging from additional accommodation and recreation facilities to new workshops, administrative buildings and wharf facilities as well as a new submarine school. The estimated cost is $135.6m at April 1989 prices. Since 1972 HMAS Stirling has been progressively developed as a naval support facility and was commissioned in July 1978. The need to develop HMAS Stirling further is the direct consequence of the decision by the Government to relocate half of the fleet to Western Australia and the establishment of the two-ocean navy concept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recommending that the works proceed, the Committee has drawn attention to the planning done by both Commonwealth and State agencies to ensure that adequate services and facilities are planned and in place to meet the demand caused by the influx of naval personnel and their families. The Committee has also recommended that environmental reviews of Commonwealth projects required under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 should be completed before a particular project is referred to it for examination. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report relates to the development of civil aviation facilities at Darwin Airport for domestic, international and general aviation services at an estimated cost of $72m at May 1989 prices. The Committee concluded that existing civil aviation facilities at Darwin Airport, particularly the terminal building, are inadequate and substandard. The Committee has also concluded that there is a need for the development of new facilities to improve the standard of service to passengers, to overcome the existing problems of congestion and to meet likely future demands. The Committee has recommended that two aerobridges should be provided for the domestic section of the terminal and that the Federal Airports Corporation should explore the possibility of the airlines making a financial contribution to the cost of those aerobridges. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I would like to make a couple of comments on the report of the Standing Committee on Public Works in relation to the Darwin Airport and the northside development. Again, I commend to the House the $72m worth of construction activity on the north side of the Darwin Airport; $3.5m of work has already commenced as a result of the letting of contracts last month, one contract going to the Northern Territory Department of Transport and Works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has been said in this House on a number of occasions, this developmenmt is extremely important not only to the construction industry in the Northern Territory but particularly to the travel industry. I think the $72m of work will add considerably to the Northern Territory economy but, most importantly, it will add to the long-term attraction of Darwin at a tourist destination. I welcome the finding of the Public Works Committee for a second aerobridge. I think it is extremely important that, if possible, that aerobridge be constructed. I also welcome the Public Works Committee's recommendation that the airlines contribute to the cost of the aerobridge. I think it is very important, if they are fair dinkum about the construction of this new airport, the future of the tourism industry in the Northern Territory and the civil aviation industry in Australia, that they be forthcoming in providing this assistance. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation is of vital importance to Australian manufacturing industry because Australian manufacturing industry is teetering on the brink of chaos and destruction. The prospect that there will be a serious fall-out and damage, loss of jobs and the failure of manufacturing industry is now a reality. One only has to look at recent statistics that have been produced by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures in Victoria to find that the break point has been arrived at. The single policy, high interest regime of the current Federal Government is going to bite and create a loss of jobs and failure in business. It is the most blunt instrument any government could use to control an economy that is running ahead of itself. The Government has initiated this policy, much to the detriment of home buyers in Australia, the building industry, the manufacturing industry and our exporters. It is a dreadful policy that will produce a rotten fall-out for many individuals. It is a high risk policy; a policy that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has time and time again defended, but it is a completely unwarranted policy in light of where Australia finds itself in the economies of the world today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The measures that the House is debating, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill and the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Bill, deal with commodities that are imported into Australia in such a way that, if they are to be sold by their exporters in Australia, they must be sold at a fair price. That fair price process is constructed by calculating the cost to the manufacturer of production and, in this instance, for some commodities a profit margin is being added. I believe that it is completely appropriate that whilst the Australian economy is in such a shambles we should have legislation of this type to protect Australian industries from predatory practices by foreign companies or foreign nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Many nations and companies subsidise the production of certain commodities. In order to gain a foothold in a market, those countries or companies will market at a loss. This very thing is likely to happen in the Australian sugar industry, where the Australian Government, properly, has removed all protection. We run the risk in Australia of Europe or some sugar-producing country, maybe Cuba, selling sugar at a loss on the Australian market. If it can sell enough sugar, it will put Australian sugar producers out of business or make life so hard for them that they will give up. Then they have a captured market within Australia. That dumping process, selling at a loss-an approvable loss-is really a technique to gain a foothold in the market, to carve out a niche for another country or company and, in that way, damage the whole industry, which has taken so many years to build up in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The practice is carried out in a number of areas. The vulnerable industries in Australia are the horticultural and agricultural industries, which are small and which do not sell in world markets, and Australian manufacturing industries. The practice of dumping onto the Australian market can often be entered into to wipe out a competitor which is starting to export into a market that the foreign country wants or it can be just to gain a niche in the Australian industry. As I have said, the Australian economy has reached a break point. For that reason, companies which are finding it very hard to retain profitability and day to day trading will be looking at all avenues to maximise their chance for survival. They will be looking at those businesses or companies that, from overseas, are trying to attack them or their industry. When those people who are exporting to Australia see a company or an industry weakened by harsh economic circumstances that is the very time to strike and to take the opportunity of grabbing that part of the Australian market. So Australian industry is getting close to the situation where there will be efforts to knock off industries or businesses and, by dumping commodities into Australia, bring into play the need for anti-dumping legislation. The House is considering those changes today. They are an important aspect of the areas that I have mentioned: minor agricultural, horticultural and manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian industry is worried at the moment, and rightly so. If one looks at total manufacturing output for this year, one sees that the dollar output has actually fallen. One can see from figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that total manufacturing output is starting to decline. More recent figures, figures for this quarter, released in the last couple of days, start to bring into focus the impact of the high interest rate regime. The impact will be serious. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), ought to note that, because he is the Minister partly responsible. The bite will be hard. We are talking about small businesses generally. We are talking about small agricultural and horticultural businesses. Once they start to slide-many of them are high borrowers or borrowers who have tried to improve efficiency by purchasing additional plant-they will go quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> Company profitability of Australian manufacturers over the last 12 months, as I have said, has remained roughly the same, whereas in the wholesale and retail trades profitability has risen significantly. So we have this important, basic activity going on within Australia, important in providing jobs and in providing commodities to join the wholesale-retail chain and eventually to use all the systems of transport and retail or export. We are seeing a closing down of that sector within the economy. It is extremely serious. I draw to the attention of the House the fact that, for instance, over the last six months in the fabricated metal products industry there has been no movement, despite statements from the Treasurer about increased investment. One of the key areas of Australian manufacturing has not moved; it is dead stable. My impression out in the market-place is that the Treasurer can enter into all the polemics he likes, but he will not explain away what is happening on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the ratio of imports to domestic sales over the last 15 or 20 years, one finds that Australia is in the worst position we have ever been in as far as being under attack from foreign-produced goods is concerned. The ratio is horrific. There has been almost a doubling effect. The ratio has shifted dramatically from 1975-76 to the current day. That ratio is meaningless in the terms in which it is presented but in that period it shifted from 0.079 to 0.135. That is a doubling in the shift of the ratio of imports to domestic sales taking place in Australia. That means that Australia is becoming more and more reliant on foreign goods. Ask any housewife; the housewives are telling us all the time. They are walking into the supermarkets and grabbing foreign produced goods off the shelves. Less and less of the total product is coming from within this nation and more and more is being imported. So the Australian industries that are concerned about tariff measures and customs tariff anti-dumping measures are looking at these ratios and are concerned, particularly at a point where they see the economy about to break. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past 12 months in particular, but certainly during the term of the Australian Labor Party in government, there has been a massive change in the ratio of imports to domestic sales. That is of real concern to the average Aussie. We are doing less to sustain ourselves and we are depending more and more on others to fill our local needs. There is no way in which that ratio will change until we do some basic things within Australia. As a stop-gap measure anti-dumping legislation is fine and it is necessary, but the Government has done nothing to try to cope with the basic problems within the Australian economy. In particular, the Government needs to give attention to the relationship between Aussies working on the factory floor. It has done nothing in that area except jam on the brakes in respect of wages by making some manipulative deal with the Australian Council of Trade Unions-a deal which most Australians have been left out of. The Government is hoping that Australians will wear that declining standard of living without protesting. Well, they are starting to protest. There are better answers and more answers if only the Government were prepared to look at the productivity of Australians and attack that area where Australians should be more productive. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures over a long period, and particularly under the Labor Party, are bad. I am not talking about working harder and longer; I am talking about working smarter and better so that our unit cost of production falls and we can give away some of these stupid and psychedelic indulgences that exist in so many industries, whether it be on the waterfront or in manufacturing industries. For example, the Greiner Government investigated what was going on in the railway repair yards in Sydney and found that half the blokes were not there half the time. There is no room in Australian manufacturing industry for managers and employees to continue with such an attitude. Attitudes such as that have really damaged the image of Australia abroad and have affected our capacity to produce from within Australia rather than depending more and more on imports. When one comes to look at the most recent figures on how Australian manufacturing industry is doing, one becomes seriously concerned about fiddling at the margin, but in a useful way I guess, with anti-dumping measures only part of the process. The real problems have not been tackled by the Government, but they will be tackled by an incoming coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the recent outcome of surveys in Victoria. Production has slowed down across the board in all manufacturing industries, according to the September inquiry. Sales have weakened across the board; as one would expect with production slowing down, orders are down and sales have weakened. For instance, in September only 18 per cent of all companies surveyed reported increases in order levels compared with 24 per cent in June. It is starting to come, I say to the Minister, and I think that--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, riveted as I am by this contribution to the debate, I have some difficulty in seeing its relationship to the legislation before us.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, this legislation is really the key point in just where Australian manufacturing industry is. The introduction of this legislation is significant to assist industries that are starting to go to the wall and to give them an opportunity to have an effective appeal against imports that are being dumped. That process is critical for their survival and the Government's legislation is basically in support of Australian manufacturing industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the points that both honourable members have made. I think it would be helpful if the honourable member for Mitchell referred to the Bill. I appreciate that he is making a wide-ranging contribution, but if the honourable member for Mitchell could make reference to the Bill, it would help me follow the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, Mr Deputy Speaker. If I have neglected to do that, I apologise. I feel that this anti-dumping legislation is a critical part of the whole spectrum. Some speakers have objected to this sort of measure as being artificial and part of a protective process, but I think it is vital that we have anti-dumping legislation. We can be knocked off as suckers by any group or nation in the world if it starts to market at a loss within Australia and we have no mechanism to protect Australian industry. No time is more critical than at the moment for the introduction of this legislation. However, it is only part of an armoury that the Government should be using to establish a continuance of employment, productivity and opportunity for Australian manufacturers. While the legislation is a welcome addition to that armoury, more is needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I guess one of the greatest complaints I hear about anti-dumping legislation is that those who try to use the process find that they must wait a million years for a decision, with bureaucratic paper-shuffling, hundreds and thousands of questions to be answered and weeks of delay. The sugar industry, for example, recognises that to gather the information it would need to stop the dumping of foreign sugar in Australia would take 12 weeks, and then the whole thing has to be processed by the body that has been established to look at things that are being dumped. New Zealand, on the other hand, can turn the whole process around in a matter of 10 to 12 days. We take 12 weeks and New Zealand takes 10 to 12 days. That is not good enough. If we are going to have a measure such as this that is designed to assist Australian industry in a difficult time-although it is not a completely appropriate way of assisting Australian industry-it had better work. What manufacturers and the horticultural and agricultural industries are saying is that the Australian Government really does not want anti-dumping legislation and that it is impossible for them to mount a case of dumping. They are saying, `The information that we as producers are required to get means that we have to employ undercover techniques to find out facts about those companies or governments producing information, producing a product'. </PARA>
<PARA> The example I was most recently alerted to was the New Zealand mushroom industry trying to get into Australia. It required a cloak and dagger exercise from the Australian producers to find out what the Australian Government could have found out with a simple request to the New Zealand Government. That does not mean to say that the Australian Government would support anti-dumping claims by Australian manufacturers. It means that the Government would assist Australian producers to establish the facts. It does not mean that the Australian Government is judging the case. </PARA>
<PARA> While this legislation is important, it tends not to be effective in assisting Australian industry. What really would be of assistance to Australian industry is to deal with some of the inherent problems. The Government has walked away from the prospect of harmonious industrial relations between employers and employees; it has not tried to address the level of productive effort and greater satisfaction in the workplace; and it has not tried to address the prospect of higher living standards for Australian workers. All the Government seems to do is say `No, no, no' to any idea that comes up. There is a weird concept that high interest rates will solve all these problems. It is a fact that high interest rates will not solve the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's commitment to establish harmonious relationships in the workplace, to enable people to work more productively, with greater satisfaction and with a prospect of higher living standards going along with increased productivity, is a sensible way to tackle this problem. Otherwise we are faced with a situation in which the brakes will come on with high interest rates, people will lose jobs and businesses will close. There is no alternative. We should not be doing that in Australia at the moment. We should be maintaining our production, provided that it is economic. The way in which to do that is to get down to solving the problems of maintaining harmonious relationships in the work- place. The Government dismisses the great number of ideas that the Opposition has in regard to voluntary agreements, to changes to the Industrial Relations Commission and to imposing limits on industrial activity. All of these are sensible and balanced ideas. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we are debating anti-dumping legislation. It is welcome; but it is ineffective in practice, as I am told by people who have tried to use it. Let us get down to what is really the problem with Australian manufacturing in agricultural industries and deal with better relationships on the shop floor, in the transport systems and on the waterfront. </PARA>

I was interested in the contribution of my colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and listening to what the Government should be doing in this area. I firstly want to point out that, as far as industry policy is concerned, today is a very significant day. We now have a seventh shadow Minister for industry, technology and commerce. This really shows how insincere the Opposition is about a most important area of the economic landscape. I will just run through them. The first shadow Minister for industry and commerce was Senator Peter Rae. On 14 December 1984 he was followed by Senator Fred Chaney. He lasted until--</PARA></TALK.START>

On 8 May 1987 Senator Tony Messner was the shadow Minister. He lasted less than three months. On 14 August 1987 Senator Austin Lewis was the shadow Minister. Then we had the return on 16 September 1988 of Senator Fred Chaney. On 14 June 1989 he was replaced, again by Senator Austin Lewis. On 30 October 1989 the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) became the new shadow Minister for industry, technology and commerce. Whilst I could say much about the honourable member for Bennelong, I think it is conceded on the Opposition side that he has been the powerhouse of ideas and ideology from the Opposition.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One Opposition member has already in this debate reminded us that the Opposition was totally opposed to the setting up of the Anti-Dumping Authority. The Opposition has said that it is not required, it should not be on the landscape and it does not want to see Australian industry protected from overseas companies dumping on the Australian market. I find that disappointing. I find it even more disappointing that the same honourable member suggested that the Opposition was totally correct in not having an anti-dumping authority. If I were a manufacturer in Australia, the stance of the Opposition in not having an anti-dumping authority, having had seven shadow Ministers and in the 1987 election having done a complete backflip on policy, would have me pulling my hair out. I think it is most irresponsible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Bills look at the issue of pricing and the construction of the amount operating in the domestic market. One of the amendments we are dealing with today, following a court case, relates to retaining subsection 5 (9) of the principal Act concerning profit, unless there are strong cases otherwise showing a zero profit in the construction of the price. I strongly support the thrust by the Minister and the Caucus industry committee to have a very strong anti-dumping authority which deals with its cases expeditiously. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed the latitude that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, extended to my colleague the honourable member for Mitchell. He mentioned the issue of high interest rates and the impact that they will have on small business and on manufacturers in particular. I find it ironic that the Opposition has announced a policy which will not only lead to higher interest rates but also absolutely flatten manufacturing industry. The issue of whether or not we have anti-dumping legislation or an anti-dumping authority will become completely irrelevant as industry after industry closes. It is interesting that the Opposition has always said that it will take the pressure off monetary policy by reducing Federal expenditure, yet it would reduce that by only $140m. The important point for manufacturing industry and exporting industry to note is that either the Opposition is being completely hypocritical and there is a further list of cuts that it is not going to announce, which is in the background, or, alternatively, as I have suggested, interest rates will float up higher, even higher than they are today, and will absolutely flatten Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point made by the honourable member for Mitchell was that the Government was not getting at the real issues as far as the economy was concerned. He talked about the issue of greater productivity. It has been said a number of times that Australian productivity grows by about 1.1 per cent per year. When the Opposition talks about giving wages to salary and wage earners based on productivity, that is really a buzz word for holding back wages to 1.1 per cent. The honourable member said that we ought to follow the example of the Greiner Government. Those were not my words; they are the words of the honourable member for Mitchell. What has the Greiner Government done in terms of the workers for whom the honourable member for Mitchell was expressing concern? Mr Greiner has added about $1,000 per year in terms of charges that people pay for water rates, electricity and the other things provided by State governments. The Opposition agrees with the Government that we ought to beat inflation-but, sadly for the Opposition, inflation is nowhere higher than it is in New South Wales. I presume that the honourable member for Mitchell is saying that we should have a much higher inflationary policy, perhaps like the one that the Opposition left us in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make one comment about the Greiner Government, since I was led down that path by the honourable member for Mitchell. It is an absolute scandal in this day of housing shortages-nowhere is that being tested more than in the Sydney market-that the State department finishes with a $200m surplus. It is absolutely outrageous. So that it can be seen that I am not making this up, I quote the remarks of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in his contribution:</PARA>
<PARA> Predatory pricing designed to drive competitors out of business, which was a feature of arguments about monopoly legislation in the United States, is not a common practice, largely because in a relatively open market it cannot work. As long as Australia is open to imports from a range of sources, monetary loss faces any company which sells goods to Australia at beneath the actual cost of producing them . . . Much so-called dumping is little more than the clearing of a glut in the supply of a product on international markets, little different from a retailer's sale of surplus stock at a discounted price. This process is in the long term interests of Australian manufacturers, who compete on international markets. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that Australian consumers should benefit from it. I strongly object to the notion advocated by the honourable member for Curtin that all we need is to have this completely open market in Australia and that, if companies are dumping, Australian consumers will benefit from it. He argues that the loss they make will prevent that from happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the pricing policies of multinational companies, particularly some Japanese companies, are meant to gain market share by selling those goods at a loss, which forces the domestic competition to the wall. They then have a monopoly in that domestic market and can charge relatively what they like. An example can be found in the dominance by some Japanese companies in our whitegoods industry. According to history, that is what those companies have done. The honourable member for Curtin is advocating a very ideologically pure position and one that I was trying to suggest we could imagine being espoused by the honourable member for Bennelong who has newly returned to the front bench of the Opposition. What really worries me about his return is that this is the sort of policy that the Opposition will introduce. </PARA>
<PARA> When I am travelling around and talking to industry leaders and to the workers on the factory floor, I will be saying that Opposition members are quite happy to do without an anti-dumping authority-that is in Hansard-and, indeed, one Opposition member is quite pleased to have goods dumped in Australia no matter what that does to the Australian industry and not have a level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who wants to see the insincerity of the Opposition in terms of its policy development in this area need only look at the number of shadow Ministers for this portfolio since this Government was formed. Senator John Button has been the only Minister, whereas the Opposition has had seven shadow Ministers, two of them having come twice to this portfolio area. Some of them lasted less than a couple of months. That is absolutely outrageous when it is considered that this is the engine-room for employment. What this Government has striven so hard to do is to have a bottom line for unemployment in manufacturing industries, halt the downward curve in disemployment, stabilise employment and push employment upwards. On the other hand, the shadow Ministers-Howard, Lewis, Chaney, Messner and Rae, with two of them having occupied the shadow portfolio twice-have not had a decent policy in this area. If members of the Opposition were ever returned to government they would, as their Economic Action Plan suggests, flatten Australian industry. They believe that the more that is imported from overseas the better off Australia is, and that the one way to overcome the current account problem is to crunch the economy; not put the brakes on a very strong economy, as exists at the moment, but absolutely flatten it. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I support the Bill and support the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), who is at the table, for the work that he and his colleague Senator Button have put into this matter in terms of the earlier establishment of the Anti-Dumping Authority and the amendments that are being considered today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been trying to remember the name of the nineteenth century member of the House of Commons who was known as the chambermaid, because every time he rose to speak he emptied the chamber. I always have this feeling when I am delivering second reading speeches on customs legislation and then sitting through the ensuing debate. That is a pity because the issues involved in customs matters are extremely important and this customs anti-dumping legislation has come out of further discussions with the Anti-Dumping Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to be an appropriate time to pay tribute to the Anti-Dumping Authority, particularly Don Fraser, the presiding member, and Jock Maguire, who works with him. They have done extremely well. There is a broad recognition that the system is working fairly and openly. I could use that great word `transparency', which we use fairly often in this Government. There is a transparency in the whole operation. The Anti-Dumping Authority has done extremely well. </PARA>
<PARA> I take up the point made by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). He criticised the inclusion of profit when constructing a normal value. In fact, he went further and suggested that Australia should not have anti-dumping legislation at all. It occurred to me that the honourable member for Curtin and the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) should really get together some time. Their views are deeply divided and they might like to have a discussion on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> Both sides of the House have always supported anti-dumping measures to counteract unfair trading practice. The Bills before the House today did not arise from a major review of anti-dumping policy. The Government has already dealt with the broader issues, when it responded to the review into anti-dumping measures by Professor Fred Gruen. These Bills are, on the one hand, a response to recommendations by the Anti-Dumping Authority regarding inclusion of profit in constructing a normal value and, on the other hand, technical changes which need to be made on constitutional grounds following the Air Caledonie case. </PARA>
<PARA> Dumping occurs when goods are exported to Australia at a price less than their normal value in the country of export. This normal value is usually just the domestic price of goods in that country, but sometimes such a price is unavailable or unusable and the normal value has to be obtained in some other way. No matter what method is used, the aim should always be to approximate as closely as possible a fair price for the goods in the domestic market of the country of export. In particular, when a normal value is being constructed by adding up the best available estimates of costs to make and sell the goods it is entirely sensible in most cases to allow a margin of profit to be included. In fact, it could be argued that to exclude a profit would make no more sense than excluding the value of direct labour or materials used when constructing the normal value of a product. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously a degree of judgment is involved in determining an appropriate level of profit. However, this is not in itself a sound argument for excluding profit. There are many situations within the private and public sectors in which judgments need to be made. If there is concern that either the Authority or the Australian Customs Service may tend to overstate normal values, steps should be taken to reverse this practice rather than compensate for it by arbitrarily excluding profit altogether. The anti-dumping legislation is structured in such a way that a normal value determined by the marketplace is to be used where available and where it can be relied on. It is only where a market determined price is not available-for example, where the goods in question are not sold on the domestic market in the country of export-that the normal value may need to be constructed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one set of circumstances in which no profit will be allowed with a constructed value; that is, when goods are in fact sold in the country of export but these sales are not in the ordinary course of trade since they have been sold in substantial quantity and over an extended period at a price which does not recover costs and, for that, attention should be given to the proposed new section 269tac (13) of the Customs Act. Had these sales been made at a price which just covered costs, that is, which would return zero profits, the provisions of that subsection would have been escaped. It would therefore make no sense in constructing a normal value, because of the operation of the subsection, to add in any more than a zero rate of profit. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin also noted quite correctly the decline in dumping notices, especially since the commencement of the 1 September 1988 reforms which saw the introduction of the Anti-Dumping Authority and the tightening of the dumping processes. However, the honourable member suggested that the existence of long term dumping notices was of concern. One of the major reforms of the 1988 amendments was to put a three-year maximum time period on the life of dumping notices; that is, notices are taken to have expired, unless sooner revoked or released, three years after the date of the original publication of the dumping notice. If after three years a dumping notice is desired to be continued, a fresh complaint, investigation and so on must occur. The sunset provision in dumping notices continues in this legislation. The only change is the transfer of the provision in section 12b of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 to the Customs Act 1901, section 269tm. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to lead the debate on the Pasture Seed Levy Bill on behalf of the Opposition. I thank the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) for the invitation to do so. As the honourable member for Murray is well aware, the State of South Australia dominates the pasture seed industry in Australia, hence his generous invitation to me, as chairman of the Opposition rural committee, to lead this debate. The cooperation which is common between the coalition parties and between the honourable member for Murray and me should not be allowed to overshadow the cooperation which exists between the Government and the Opposition on this legislation. The Government has enjoyed the confidence and support of the Opposition on all the research and development Bills that have come before the House. Frequently that generous stance on behalf of the Opposition has not been reflected either by the Government or by the press and I think that more should be made of the cooperation that has existed on legislation such as that before us. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will have gathered from my preamble that the Opposition supports the legislation, just as it has supported similar Bills affecting the rural industry and various rural commodities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of all the primary industries affecting Australia, the pasture seed industry has to be the most primary. It is the industry that determines which seeds will be available for farmers to plant. It is the industry that makes available the planting material that characterises Australia's crops, particularly its seed crops. Regardless of our individual theological perspectives, we should all enter this debate with an air of reverence about the legislation. After all, we are talking about the seeds that are an every-day miracle. I have in front of me on my desk-I hope there is nothing improper about this-a sample of some clover seed. It is incredible and beyond our human understanding that every one of these seeds has the capacity, individually, to produce a plant that will itself throw up hundreds more seeds with the capacity to carry on those unique characteristics. The pasture seed industry is all about producing and multiplying the sorts of seeds that Australia's seed growers claim they need. Perhaps the most remarkable thing of all is that it is only a little over 130 years since one Gregor Mendel discovered what we now know about seeds and the capacity to plant and develop seeds to meet particular needs. In that 130 years agriculture in Australia and around the world, and primary industry in general, has been turned around as a result of the work of that geneticist Gregor Mendel. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to depart in any sense from the debate and I do not think that I do so when I say that it does us all good to pause and consider the remarkable life of Gregor Mendel. Mendel made these discoveries in 1862. He was at that time an Austrian monk and botanist. Much of what he discovered as a monk and botanist was a result of his experiences and the observations he made in his father's orchard and garden when he was a boy. What I marvel at when I consider Gregor Mendel is the fact that he failed to get a certificate as a teacher of his day. His lowest marks were in biology and geology, yet he went on to become the father of modern genetics. Frequently success at formal education is no measure of the contribution that is to be made in life. </PARA>
<PARA> Mendel's observations about seeds generally and the ultimate implications to the Australian seed industry were made as he looked at and studied garden peas and systematically listed the changes that occurred in garden peas in the monastery garden. From his observations and experiments, he reached the conclusion that different characteristics in plants-for instance, a capacity to be tall or dwarfish and to be a particular colour when in blossom-could be carried on from generation to generation. He observed that, by cross-breeding, persistent characteristics emerged. In many ways, today's hybrid industry has been built entirely on the foundations laid by that monk only 130 years ago. All of the painstaking selection procedures that he went through have been examined by succeeding generations of botanists and geneticists in order to build our current seed industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, in Australia alone it is calculated that the seed industry will contribute at least $57m per annum to our pastoral industries. This small segment of primary industry earns at least $10m per annum in export earnings. What is incalculable is the real value of all that has been done in genetic improvement in pasture seeds to primary industry in Australia and to the production of food around the world. We can never calculate our indebtedness to Gregor Mendel and to his successors who have applied the laws that he laid down. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is designed largely to make it even more possible for the Australian seed industry to breed more Gregor Mendels. That is a rather convoluted way of saying what I want to say, but the legislation allows the Government and the industry to create a reservoir of funding on which additional input can be made to seed breeding, additional observations can be made and particular selected varieties can be either introduced into Australia or changed to suit Australian conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is supported by all States that are seed producers. South Australia, my home State, dominates the industry. For that reason the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), a fellow South Australian, seeks to participate in the debate, and he himself has been very involved in the seed industry. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Pratt)-Adelaide is now a very urban seat-was also very involved in the seed industry prior to entering Federal Parliament. South Australia can claim to be dominating the industry, but of real significance also is the work being done in Victoria, Western Australia and New South Wales. So significant is the opportunity for us to experiment in various seed cultivars and hybrids that a voluntary contribution scheme already exists in South Australia. But the scheme has been seen to be largely inadequate, and it will be superseded by the legislation before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that pasture seeds in South Australia cover such a widespread and significant variety of production that there would be real administrative difficulty if we tried to apply a levy on all segments of the pasture seed industry. The honourable member for Boothby has expressed to me some of his concerns about the way in which the present levy is being applied, and I respect his point of view. But the Opposition supports the Bill because we believe that it is the first step in putting into place some form of equitable levy scheme in order to have a reservoir on which we can draw for pasture seed experimentation. The levy will apply only to certified seed of certain pasture species and cultivars. It will apply initially to certified seed of clovers, medics and lucernes produced in Australia, and provision is made for certified seed of other pasture seed species and cultivars to be added to the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I am indebted to the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), for pointing out the areas covered by the pasture seed industry that will be levied; in the case of medics at $7.50 a tonne, clovers at $10 a tonne and lucernes at $12.50 a tonne. The honourable member for Murray tells me that there are no plans at present to levy growers of tropical or subtropical pasture seeds, but there is nothing to stop these from being added if the industry requests that that particular course of action be followed. A maximum levy has been set under the legislation of $50 a tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> The growers participating in the Australian pasture seed industry can confidently expect to raise $106,000 in a full year. This will be matched by the Commonwealth, on a dollar for dollar basis, up to a maximum amount which is 0.5 per cent of the value of the gross leviable pasture seeds produced in Australia. Therefore, growers of pasture seeds can confidently expect to have at their disposal a reservoir of funds, probably to the tune of $200,000, to be used to develop further the pasture seed industry. </PARA>
<PARA> These very inadequate plant samples that I have brought into the House came out of the Andrew lawn as I ran over it with the lawnmower yesterday. If it were not for the research and development that has gone on prior to this Bill, and which will be accelerated as a result of this Bill, the pasture seed industry in Australia would probably be little better that those samples taken out of the Andrew lawn. Thankfully the honourable member for Boothby can produce a much more generous sample than this, thanks to the work done in the past. As a result of the legislation before the House, I hope Australia not only will continue its dominance in the pasture seed industry but also will see the acceleration in the industry for which we have to thank Gregor Mendel.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to support the Pasture Seed Levy Bill and the Pasture Seed Levy Collection Bill because the Bills express the wishes of the seed growers of Australia, and I believe governments should respond to the desires of interested parties. It is also a very happy occurrence that the Opposition supports the Bills, and I appreciate the remarks of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I, too, would like to mention Gregor Mendel. That is not surprising, because the honourable member for Wakefield and I went to the same school-the very distinguished Urrbrae agricultural high school, which Ralph Jacobi also attended. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, you can see that it has a list of very distinguished students. Gregor Mendel's contribution is enormous, and he is one of the great scientists of the world whose contribution is not fully recognised. He is truly the father of his field, and we have a lot for which we ought to be grateful to him. Unfortunately, time does not stand still and the work must go on. The Bills are designed to enhance that work. In many areas we need constant research. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bills is to help provide funding and make that ongoing research possible. I believe that the enormity of the research program is such that there will come a time when we will see the levy reaching the $50 a tonne level. I do not think at that stage it will be objected to by the growers, because hopefully they will be seeing value for their money. In many areas we can look at breeding disease resistance in plants. As the world becomes more cautious of chemical herbicides, this attribute of plants will become more important, both economically and environmentally. It is through the work started by Mendel that this genetic achievement and ongoing genetic moderation and adaptation can succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, in the long run, we will also have to include seeds outside the legumes that are currently encompassed. While the legumes are a very important component of the pasture, we will have to look further. In Western Australia a lot of work is being done on salination. While it is undoubtedly true that South Australia leads Australia in the production of pastoral seed, Western Australia leads Australia, indeed the world, in arid land management. I believe that we will have to look in this area in the future for new cultivars. One of particular interest is atriplex nummularia, which abounds in Australia across a wide variety of country. It has the capacity to grow in very saline, salt-affected, areas but unfortunately not all cultivars of the seed are palatable. (Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA> I had just finished saying how pleasing it was to see the cooperation in this House between the parties on this very important Bill and how much the cooperation of the Opposition was appreciated. I am afraid that the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) shattered this fragile alliance for what can only be termed petty political payback. I was talking about atriplex nummularia. The significant thing about this plant is that, although all cultivars are salt resistant, only some are palatable. It is said that the de Kock variety which has been established in South Africa from genetic Australian material is a palatable variety. It is my belief that there are numerous other palatable varieties in Australia, but I think the day will come when people will grow this seed for use in the industry. It will be used much more in the marginal wheat country and there will have to be a palatable variety. People want to know that the cultivar they are buying is actually palatable stock. </PARA>
<PARA> Another seed which will be of signficance is maireana brevifolia, which is one of the bluebush varieties. It is palatable stock and has a very high protein content. Once again it grows in fairly hard conditions and tends to be salt tolerant. It is a variety of seed that the Department of Agriculture in Western Australia is now taking seriously. I am very pleased to see that as it is a species that I have been advocating for many years. This species has a food value approaching lucerne and is grown in South Africa on an irrigated basis. It always surprises me that in many areas South Africa has done much more in the development of our indigenous pasture plants than we have ourselves. One of these days we will have to make sure that these plants are included in some certifying program as they become much more in demand from marginal wheat farmers. They have the capacity to change the economics of wheat farming as we go away from the policy, foolishly advocated and I think bank driven, of wall to wall cropping and go back into rotation. </PARA>
<PARA> Other areas-I will digress a little from the Bill here-concern the development of species that have commercial applications. One of these is the neem tree. The neem tree is a native of India and the African subcontinent. It has the capacity to resist quite a large variety of insects. It does this in such a way that insects do not build up any resistance. The work of geneticists in the future, hopefully funded from sources such as this, will be to develop neem trees which have a high percentage of the particular active constituent that deters insects. We might see solutions of neem being spread on crops, with no environmental or residual effect at all, an insecticide which deters insects and to which they cannot build up any resistance. I think there is a great future in that. This tree will grow readily in large parts of Australia and if we are serious about environmental matters we should be giving a lot of attention to it. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, despite the intervention of the honourable member for Wannon, I reiterate that it is pleasing to see that we do have bipartisan support on this matter. This Bill has the support of industry and it can only take the industry forward. It is a measure which must be beneficial not only to Australian agriculture but also, through our applications, to the world at large. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The pasture seed industry involves the activities and work of a great number of very individualistic entrepreneurs. They are people who are always on the lookout for an improvement in techniques in growing those varieties and, in many cases, an improvement in the harvesting methods which are applied to bring those varieties into the area of pasture seeds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The objective of increasing research and development in Australia is one to which we, in a general sense as a parliamentary institution, give our full support. This support is not always evident in the community, and in many ways Australia is delinquent in many industries in providing sufficient research and development funds and activity. In a general sense this Bill is to be supported because it increases the area of investigation research and improvement which needs to be improved. The obtaining, releasing and growing of new varieties from time to time is an essential rejuvenation of many of our agricultural industries. As the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has pointed out, this industry is basic to so many others and determines the type and quality of crops that will follow the development of the seeds. </PARA>
<PARA> Two areas of development stand out quite clearly: firstly, the need in the last decade or so to meet the threat of the new wave of aphids that swept across southern Australia by developing more specialised plants and seeds to cater for the diversified soil types within this nation; and, secondly, the need to develop, by promoting and advertising, industry awareness of what is available in order to bring together the needs of the final producer of crops with the needs of those who produce the seeds for those crops. However, it must be remembered that this is increasing, although by a smaller amount, the cost of production for growers at a time when cost pressures are as great as they ever were on the agricultural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> This also has to be regarded as a cost on production, not a cost on sales. It will be paid within a certain predetermined time after the seed is released from certification but is not related to the sale of those seeds and, therefore, it must be borne at a predetermined time after production. It will be added to the existing costs of certification, and, whilst they are not overwhelming, they have in the past been a real consideration to growers. If this additional cost had been proposed two or three years ago it may well have met great resistance. It is only in the last session or so that prices for many lines of pasture seeds have significantly increased. Because of that, this measure has now become possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The pasture seed industry is a very diverse industry. It will be the consumer of seeds who will be more easily seen to get a benefit in the immediate sense rather than the producer of seeds. Those who produce seeds do so, as I have said, in a most diverse area. Some producers may be unable to change quickly, if at all, the variety of the seed they produce. The soil becomes saturated with the seed and it may take some years to eradicate it and initiate a new variety in some circumstances and with some varieties. Therefore, some producers are forced to maintain production of an old type of seed. They will take longer to benefit, if at all, from the production of a new type of seed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are others who produce a new type of seed by, perhaps, a private entrepreneurial development. They will still have to pay the levy, even though it may in no way benefit their operation. There are other instances where basic seeds are brought in from, say, Europe. They are produced here on exclusive possession of that seed and they are exported back to Europe. The application of research and development here has no bearing on that production, yet that production will pay the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on to illustrate the diversity of this industry and how the general application of a levy and its application to research and new breeding will not automatically benefit those in the pasture seed industry. Some producers, of course, will never benefit from it. So one has to take an overall viewpoint. The industry in general will have the quality and desirability of its output more evenly matched with the demand. It is in that overall sense that I support this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting, looking back at the varieties which are still mainly grown, to find that they are, in the main, entries from overseas or else selections that have been made at random, often in the field, in Australia. We have so often brought in varieties and grown them here, very much to the benefit of Australian producers but also to export back to the countries-certainly the regions-from which they came, especially in the Mediterranean. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of questions could be asked about the results of this legislation. How will private entrepreneurs, or for that matter government entrepreneurs, in the form of government departments, benefit from this legislation, from this levy, from the promotion or support of individual scientists from the funds which will be collected by this levy? These things are not spelt out in the legislation. I suppose, to be fair to the Minister and his Department, that it is not possible at this stage to define any specific areas of disbursement of the funds, but they are questions which need to be borne in mind by the Minister and his Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Who will own the results of the research, for instance? Will it be a department? If, for instance, the South Australian Department of Agriculture obtains a specific grant for specific research, who will own the results of that research? Will the results from certain specific areas of agriculture department research be put out in royalty, as they now are, I understand? Will it be considered fair by all growers that the fund to which they contribute, which will then be disbursed to result in improved varieties, by rotation provides varieties that they then have to pay royalties to use? These are questions that the Minister will have to take into account. How will promotion be entered into? Will it be one variety against another or will it be a promotion in the sales area, for instance, in the general area of trying to promote the industry as a whole amongst its customers? So a number of basic questions are involved which, as yet, are unanswered. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one plea. I would like to see research carried out in a way which will encompass the current individuals and organisations already in the research area. I suspect that any sensible and sane assessment of where the need lies would look at existing scientists and organisations and say that they should be helped further, in continuity of their work. Some very fine people are working in this field. I will not embarrass them by naming them, but well known people in South Australia, for instance, are involved in producing new varieties and have been a great help to agriculturalists, to pasture seed growers and to the end users. Their work is always unfinished. I would like to think that they will be favoured in any disbursement of grants so that their work will continue-based on merit, of course. I hope that it will not be superseded by, perhaps, new brooms that in the public relations field might be more convincing than the results which stand to the credit of those who are already in the business. </PARA>
<PARA> In South Australia, we have an imaginatively led and very active cooperative organisation in marketing seeds which goes further than marketing. It develops markets by bringing to the South Australian growers the best and latest in the species of pasture types to match together the product in the field with the customer who wants to take those plants to mature crops. I urge the Minister and his Department to continue to support, through this fund, the work of those already in the industry, to settle a few questions which might emerge on the way as to who owns research and to whose ultimate benefit it will be, and to maintain, above all, the support of the industry for this legislation. It is by wise administration only that that will occur. It is a small beginning. I know that we perhaps have spoken longer than we ought to in respect of the actual funds that are involved. They are minuscule, really, in talking of research and development. We are talking about $100,000 to be matched by $100,000. Is that two, three or four salaries? Perhaps it is three salaries in support of research in this field. So we are not talking of altering the world by this relatively small fund. It is by the wisdom of its administration that we will encourage better things in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Pasture Seed Levy Bill and the Pasture Seed Levy Collection Bill provide for the imposition of a levy on pasture seed production in Australia and the mechanism for the collection of the levy. I note that there has been bipartisan support in the House for these Bills. I welcome that. The Bills are constructive and were long planned. Australia is the driest continent on this planet. Consequently, we have a greater need to develop unique and better pasture seed to match our specific climate and its variations throughout the continent, from one State to another, from the coastal regions to the arid centre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government is committed to rural research. Two initiatives need to be mentioned. Rural industries have been encouraged to increase their own share of investment in research, to at least 5 per cent of the gross value of domestic production. The Federal Government is committed to matching, dollar for dollar, to the 5 per cent level and is fully supportive of new schemes such as the pasture seed scheme. A total of $80m expenditure is envisaged to be budgeted for 1989-90. Again, like the Goat Fibre Levy Bill, on which you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I had the privilege of speaking last week, this legislation goes a long way to improving production and improving research. Research and development is backed by the Government, and it is pleasing to see that now almost everyone is aware that, in order for Australia to take its rightful place in the trading world of the twenty-first century, research and development must be of vital importance. Without that ingredient we simply will not match our competitors. No longer is research and development recognised as being important only in secondary industries with the new technologies; it is equally so in agriculture. I think that that is a great step forward. </PARA>
<PARA> Pasture seed annual gross production is roughly 22,000 tonnes and it is valued at about $57m with export earnings of about $10m per annum. I believe that this highlights the importance of these Bills but, more so, demonstrates the potential of earning export dollars. I think the industry needs to be complimented on its planning and foresight and on looking to the future. Many honourable members have often said in this House that for too long there has not been enough forethought and enough planning for the future. These Bills address that to some degree. </PARA>
<PARA> It goes without saying that better quality pasture production and dry land strains will enhance Australia's grazing industry. Coupled with this aspect is the prospect of expanding an export market and export market potential. Many other nations also have dry and arid areas, so it is a twofold attack. I hope that eventually Australia can be the dominant world leader in pasture seed technology, research and development, thus helping to conserve our environment and at the same time to improve our production. As a cost-efficiency, this means better profits for farmers. The other great advantage is that superior seeds will mean a great opportunity to produce more wool, beef or whichever agriculture industry is being addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, all sections of the community should welcome this type of initiative. We can no longer hold with the old adage that in order to expand production we simply cut down more trees and do more broadacre farming. Of course, we have learnt from salination problems and land degradation that we need to plan for the future. Therefore, these Bills and the expansion of research and development in seed production provide a mechanism to increase production but, at the same time, not in the way that it has been done in the past-as I have said, simply by knocking down another tree and saying that we should open up more land. I think that is the way we need to go, because it is also a cost-efficiency measure. </PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction with the Federal Government's tree planting program and land management schemes, I believe that this research and development will be a legacy for future generations. Initially the levy will apply to specified certified seeds of clovers, medics and lucerne. Provision is made for certified seed of other pasture seed species and cultivars to be added at a later date. Because of variations in value between species of seed, the legislation provides for different operative rates of levy for different cultivars. The legislation requires that grower organisations recommend any variations to the levy rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the time and because of the very broad ranging comment that has already been made. I will not go over other provisions in this Bills, except to say that I believe that the Bills will enhance agriculture in the future. I am pleased to see bipartisan support, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, also commented on. I compliment the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and commend the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the Pasture Seed Levy Bill, which fixes the levy, and the Pasture Seed Levy Collection Bill, under which the levy will be collected. The Bills are supported by the Opposition, although many parts of the industry have doubts about their implementation. Large parts of the industry have not even been consulted about how and when the levy should be collected. The imposition of the levy on pasture seed produced in Australia has been requested mainly by the Grains Council of Australia. The legislation covering that council has a subsection which deals with pasture seed producers throughout Australia. Initially, most of the seeds that come under the legislation are the clovers, medics and lucerne. Clover is being levied at $10 a tonne, the medics at $7.50 a tonne and most of the lucernes at $12.50 a tonne. The maximum rate is $50 per tonne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most of these seeds are grown in southern Australia, but I think it is very important to understand that they are used across the whole of Australia in the higher rainfall areas, particularly in association with the introduction of new grass species. For those who do not know, clovers, lucerne and medics are nitrogen producing plants. They fix nitrogen nodules on their roots and add to the nitrogen content of the soil, which enriches the soil and allows the pasture grasses that are planted to continue to produce. Without doing that, the pasture grasses expand all the nitrogen out of the soil and generally, after a period of years, fade away out of existence. The reason for planting them-in other words, to increase the amount of stock that can be grazed-goes as the pasture diminishes, and the native grasses which are not as productive come into the pasture and take over. </PARA>
<PARA> So, it is important that we encourage the development of new clovers, particularly in northern Australia. Clovers have been developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation over many years. It is important for the House to understand that the CSIRO has done a wonderful job over the whole of its existence. The CSIRO was established mainly for primary industry research and not necessarily for the massive research for other industries it does today. The primary industry side of its work is more or less fading away with the lack of funding that the Labor Government provides these days. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that I enjoyed the CSIRO display in the Parliament last week and I congratulate it on its work. I am a little disappointed that the display did not include much on rural industry-in fact, I do not think there was anything on rural industry research; it was all on high technology research. Apparently, that is how we are meant to survive. We are meant to get out of the economic morass we are in through high technology but, of course, we will not; we will get out of the economic mess we are in by developing better pasture strains, producing more wool, grazing more cattle and producing and exporting the products that we in this country are good at producing. </PARA>
<PARA> With the great scare about the environment, the people of the world wish to eat cleaner foods that are not contaminated, and, of course, Australia is one of the largest grazing areas in the world. Our livestock are free range and are not housed through the winter as is the case with livestock in the Northern Hemisphere. Stock in the Northern Hemisphere are fed high concentrates such as crushed grasses and clovers and things that have been grown and treated with chemicals to the disadvantage of those people. I think Australia sits in the box seat of expanding its rural range land production. We lead the world in technology and experimentation in that field. Our experts are asked to go to China, Russia and other countries to help them uplift their production of wool and grassland grazed cattle. The pasture seeds industry is very important. As I said, some parts of it want the levy while others do not. I took the liberty of contacting Mr Keith Blackwood, the secretary of the Seed Industry Association of Australia, which has about 200 members. The Association decided in Launceston back in 1984 that it did not wish to support this kind of levy. It supports a levy on royalties under the Plant Variety Rights Act. The Association believes that the levy should be put on at that stage so that those actually benefiting more from the research actually pay more towards what goes back into the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> These levies are hard to collect, as the previous speaker indicated. The levy is being put on at certification, where the cleanliness and germination rate of the seed is vouched for. There is an awful lot of seed produced that is not classified. Probably the bulk of seed produced in Australia is not certified. The bulk of seed is produced and used by farmers on their own properties. There is an awful lot of seed produced that never gets to classification, therefore the levy will not be paid. We have a tremendous problem in Queensland with parthenium weed, which is spreading throughout the State, through seeds such as buffel seed and purple pigeon seed that have been grown, particularly in the central highlands, and distributed to growers. These introduced species of weeds are spreading further and further south. The initial outbreak was in central Queensland, north of Emerald. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that is suggested and supported by the Association is the formation of Ausseed, the company that has been formed with the seed growers, the Grains Council and the State departments to promote and encourage the export of seeds. With our precarious balance of payments situation of $2 billion a month, anything we can do to encourage any sort of export these days is well worth while. Quite a deal of profit and royalties are being earned. It is the State departments' intention to get some of the profits back to help pay for continuing research on these seeds. It is a pity that the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) has left the chamber because he made a lot of noise about the chemical graslan some months ago. It is important to remember that it can be sprayed on brigalow and other sorts of suckers to help eradicate them in pasture land yet it does not kill the grasses and the medics that are planted amongst the regrowth; they are able to continue to grow. This graslan spray, which has been developed in America, can be sprayed on the trees. The trees slowly die and the grasses get better and better. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is putting up a dollar for every dollar collected. About $106,000 has been collected, which is not a great deal of money, but I guess it is a start. This legislation is part of the Government's user pays concept. It has brought in masses of Bills in the last two or three years under which practically everything that moves gets a levy placed on it. In a sense this is a new form of tax. Whereas previously the established government organisations that were being paid for out of Consolidated Revenue were doing the research-and they have done an awful lot of work-now this industry, along with others such as the goat fibre industry, which we debated last week, is having a levy placed on it to help meet the costs of some of these things. </PARA>
<PARA> I have always been interested in pastures. Last week we saw the bipartisan launch of the land care program. This program will help regain some of the badly eroded areas in Australia. We have many land care organisations. These are voluntary groups in my electorate of Maranoa and in other electorates throughout Australia. It is very important that medics and lucerne are associated with the seeds that are developed and the pastures that need to be planted in these areas so that they can play a part in holding our soil together and we can continue to maintain a level of production that sustains our livelihood and maintains our standard of living. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Pasture Seed Levy Bill. The encouragement of a better pasture strain, the development of new varieties, and research to try to overcome the enormous problems which are being encountered in areas dependent on adequate pasture are very evident in Australia in general, but particularly in some local regions and zones. My interest is in the north coast of New South Wales, where over a number of years now there has been a great concern in primary industry about the need for better pasture strains. I will not traverse all of the detail of this. Suffice it to say that the purpose of the Bill is to introduce a levy, to be collected on certain types of certified seeds at the time of certification, for research to assist the industry. This is obviously a practical approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I commend the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) for his contribution. It is very important that there be a wide recognition of matters of this kind, particularly because of the national recognition of the land care program, which was launched last week in this building. As the honourable member for Maranoa said a moment ago, it is a bipartisan approach to the important issue of the preservation of our soil, of endeavouring to overcome land degradation and the associated problems that result from the diminution of land fertility, the erosion of soil and every aspect of the loss of soil cover. It is in that regard that adequate pasture is of great significance. There is no alternative to growing adequate cover on many of our soils in Australia, but that adequate cover can be achieved only by a commercial approach. There are some circumstances in which it can be encouraged in a non-commercial way. By and large, only through the commercial approach is it possible to ensure that we have an adequate cover of soil by either pasture or other related growth. In some instances to prevent erosion one needs to plant a variety of trees of one kind or another, but for that to be successful again there needs to be cover on the soil in proper relationship to the growth of tree cover. </PARA>
<PARA> It might well be said that this Bill relates more directly to pasture seeds that are used exclusively in the pastoral areas, the agricultural areas and the dairying areas of Australia. But that is not entirely the case because most of the species that are encouraged, developed and certified for use in that way, as you would well know from your own experience, Mr Deputy Speaker, have a direct impact on the poorer soil types, a direct relationship to the encouragement of overcoming the erosion problems that arise in areas that are well beyond the chosen fertile and productive areas of this country. For that reason it is fair to say that the small amount of money that will be raised in the first full year is not an amount that should be regarded as the end of the road. It should really be a goal of the Government to encourage a means to finance an adequate research base. Certainly, I would not see the figure of $106,000 in a full year, raised by growers and matched by the Commonwealth on a dollar for dollar basis of assistance, being anything like what is required. This is one area that ought to have some further support and it should receive that support on the grounds that the Government has committed itself to the land care program, to an environmental program, to the task of reversing the adverse aspects on the environment of the clearing of trees in this country, and to trying to restore a balance, which is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be remembered that Australia is the driest continent on earth. It is beset by enormous problems because of low rainfall. It must be recognised that in most States a determined effort has been made to ensure that there is no over-grazing or loss of ground cover and that there is an encouragement of those things that are vital to give nature its opportunity to ensure a better countryside and a better Australia. For that reason I strongly support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, which deals with the sentencing of Federal prisoners and with the question of how the Federal criminal law should apply to mentally ill and intellectually disabled people. The Bill also deals with the Cash Transaction Reports Act and makes a number of amendments to that Act. That matter falls into a category different from the sentencing matters to which I have referred and the aspects of the application of the Federal criminal law to mentally ill and intellectually disabled people, so I shall leave that matter entirely aside for present purposes. I deal therefore with the major parts of the Bill which apply to the sentencing of Federal prisoners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be noted, of course, that persons who are sent to prison for committing Federal crimes are in fact incarcerated in State prisons, not in Federal prisons. The reason for that is fairly straightforward. The Federal Government has no prisons. Indeed, only a comparatively small number of prisoners throughout Australia are Federal prisoners. In fact, only 517 of over 12,000 persons in prison are there because they have been sentenced to imprisonment for having been convicted of a Federal offence. So we are dealing with a comparatively small but nevertheless significant number of Federal prisoners. The fact that it is a comparatively small section of the prison population is the explanation as to why in the past there has not been a vast rubric of Federal legislation relating to the imprisonment of Federal prisoners. Nevertheless, the day has now come when there is to be a major piece of Federal legislation dealing with the imprisonment of persons who have been convicted of committing Federal crimes, and that is this Bill now before us. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, the prison law that has applied to Federal prisoners has, for the reasons that I have given, been largely State law. However, in his second reading speech, the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) told us that the State law keeps changing and diverging no doubt from State to State, and the consequence is that one of the things that have had to be done is to adjust Federal prisoners' terms of imprisonment to keep them in line with State regimes, that being the objective that has had to be achieved by increasing the use of administrative measures to prevent Federal prisoners from being disadvantaged. The Government has decided-and we support the Government in this-to have a Federal law on sentencing which fits in with State laws so far as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue has been examined by the Australian Law Reform Commission, which has published a report on sentencing. This Bill has apparently been framed in the light of the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission. Those recommendations are said to be in support of the so-called truth in sentencing notion, a notion meaning that, when a court sentences a prisoner to a particular period of imprisonment, the prisoner should serve that period of imprisonment and not some other term of imprisonment. That notion has been encapsulated in the expression `truth in sentencing'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Law Reform Commission either expressed the view itself or attributed its view to other people who had made submissions to it, that the present system is a charade. By that it meant that, when a sentence of imprisonment is imposed and a non-parole period is fixed, and a bit is knocked off here for this particular remission and a bit off there for another remission, whether it be for a royal visit, a warders strike or whatever, any resemblance between the penalty actually imposed and the penalty which the prisoner serves is purely coincidental. There is a general feeling that sentences imposed should as far as possible be the sentences which are in fact served. So the truth in sentencing notion is an attempt to make sentences actually served be those which have been imposed by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also true that there is a general community feeling that quite often prisoners are let out of prison after a much shorter term than the term that they should have served. A recent case which aroused a great deal of interest in Melbourne involved a rapist who was sentenced to quite a few years imprisonment and, what with remissions and one thing and another, was let out on parole after a very short time indeed. I think it was only some months ago. To cap that off, he was given a house by the State public housing authorities and the community started to ask, `Are we really seeing a system now that is of benefit and more attuned to the needs of the prisoner than of the victim?'. There was a great deal of uproar in the community about that matter. Although that is only one example, it is true to say that a widespread view in the community is that the penalty imposed should not necessarily be exactly that which is served but rather that there should be a substantial correlation between the penalty imposed and that which is served. Honourable members will have gathered from what I have said that, in so far as this Bill seeks to enshrine that notion, we support it, although we will move some amendments to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say at the outset that I cannot for the life of me understand why Bills of this sort have to be so long or so complicated. I have put to the House the essence of the Bill. One would have thought that that could be expressed in a comparatively short Bill. But, no, as usual with legislation, this Bill is long and complicated. In general it is sound, but there are some shortcomings when one gets down to the small print and sees exactly what is being prescribed. To some extent we wonder whether the Bill will achieve what the Government holds out as the quite commendable objective of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The first matter of concern arises fairly early in the Bill because it contains a general proposition which is curious in two senses. The first is that there is such a proposition in the Bill at all and the second is the nature of that proposition. In the Bill a direction is given to the court as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a court must first select the least severe type of sentence or order, and, having done that, then pass the least severe sentence, or make the least severe order, of that type, that it is appropriate to pass or make in all the circumstances of the case. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said already, this is a strange exhortation to have in a Bill; Bills do not usually carry that sort of exhortation. Quite apart from that comparatively minor criticism, the substantial criticism is that that seems to us to be the wrong principle to be setting out with respect to punishment. I remind honourable members again that the court is directed-it has no discretion in this matter-first of all to select the least severe type of sentence or order that could be imposed. One would have thought that that would be a fairly easy task for any court because a good behaviour bond is almost certainly the least severe type of order it could impose, and a very short period of imprisonment would certainly be a minor form of sentence. Having classified the types of sentences available, that is, those that are apparently more severe and those that are less severe, the obligation is then imposed on the court to make the least severe order of that type. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the Bill goes on to say that it is not simply the least severe sentence that the court must impose but the least severe sentence that it is appropriate to pass or make in all the circumstances of the case. I suppose that to some extent the fact that those words are there does make the criticism that I am putting somewhat weaker. Nevertheless, in our view the criticism has validity. We believe this is the wrong obligation to impose on the court. So does the Australian Law Reform Commission; it did not recommend the proposition contained in the Bill. It said two things. First of all, it said that there should be exactly the sort of obligation that one would expect there to be on the law and on the courts. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>There must be an appropriate degree of severity in the range of punishments available so that the community can be rationally satisfied that a breach of the criminal law is attended by significant consequences</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Commission is saying that the community wants to know that there is a range of penalties so appropriate that there is a significant consequence if one breaks the law and that some pretty significant burden will be imposed on those who commit crimes. That is the general objective that the Law Reform Commission quite rightly says should be the objective of the law. Its second point is in pretty sharp contrast with what is in the Bill. It recommended:</PARA>
<PARA>the punishment imposed for a particular offence must be just, that is, of a severity appropriate to the offence</PARA>
<PARA>I think we would all agree that punishment should be just. That is a very good starting point, a very sensible principle. The Law Reform Commission went on to say that `just' means a severity appropriate to the offence. One looks at the severity of the offence, the seriousness of the crime, and tries to taper a penalty which is in keeping with the severity of the crime. Let the punishment fit the crime, as the old saying goes. This is a very sound principle indeed. The Law Reform Commission said that the punishment should be of a severity appropriate to the offence. Although it is true that the Bill says that the penalty must be appropriate to pass or make in all of the circumstances of the case, that is not the proposition that the Law Reform Commission put forward. To say that one should impose the least severe penalty seems to us not only a curious proposition, but one which is wrong and one which the Law Reform Commission did not recommend. The public must wonder exactly what has possessed the Government to propose that at the end of the day, after the conviction is recorded and the penalty is imposed, the court is obliged to impose the least severe penalty on a person who has been convicted of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> In our view, the court should be doing what the Law Reform Commission laid down, bearing in mind the obligations that the court has to the community. We recommend an amendment along the lines of the Law Reform Commission's own recommendations. During the committee stage, I will be speaking to this in more detail. Basically, the amendment I shall put forward is that the court should impose a sentence which is of a severity appropriate to the offence. No sounder guiding principle could be laid down for the court than that which is contained in the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Having done that, the Bill then sets out a list of matters that the court must take into account in fixing sentences. We have no quarrel with that course being followed. It is appropriate that the Bill should set out those matters which the Parliament believes the court should take into account before it imposes a sentence. Whether a prisoner has shown any contrition-whether he is contrite or shows all the signs that, given half an opportunity, he will be off again committing the same crime-is an interesting question to occupy the court, and it is clearly one of those matters which the court should take into account. If a court sees that a prisoner is contrite, realises the horrific and anti- social nature of his conduct and promises to make amends in future, that is the sort of thing that a court should take into account in the balance in deciding what penalty should be imposed. If the prisoner has pleaded guilty and saved the court and society a lot of time and money, a discount may be appropriate, as also, for example, in a case where the prisoner has cooperated with the law enforcement agencies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before dinner I was saying that the next matter dealt with in this Bill was an obligation imposed on the court to take into account, when fixing sentences for Federal prisoners, a number of enumerated matters: for example, whether the prisoner has shown any contrition; whether the prisoner has pleaded guilty; whether the prisoner has cooperated with law enforcement agencies; and matters of that sort. In other words, the intention of the Bill is not that the court should be at large to act, but that before it imposes a penalty it should have regard to a number of enumerated circumstances which will enable it to determine the appropriate penalty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, that fits in very much with the general thrust of what I was saying with respect to the main clause in this Bill-namely, the clause that requires the court to impose the least severe sentence-because, as we have said, that is not the correct proposition that should be contained there; rather, the correct proposition should be that the penalty imposed should be of an appropriate severity to match the seriousness of the crime that has been committed. To enable the court to decide the appropriate penalty it is naturally sensible that the court should be directed to a number of circumstances or criteria that will enable it to reach the most sensible decision. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that those character and behavioural matters are matters that the court is obliged to have regard to; and so it should. Our criticism about this clause involves none of that; rather, that the victim is not heard from before the penalty is imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true to say that amongst the matters that the court has to have regard to are, first of all, the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence and, secondly, any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence. But the oversight there is that no machinery is set out in this clause of the Bill, or as far as I know in any other part of the Bill, where the victim can have an audience. Of course, the widely held view in the community these days is that the courts perhaps err on the side of being concerned about the welfare of the prisoner and too often overlook the circumstances of the victim, and the cry often goes up-and often with some basis-`What about the victim?'. We say with respect to this clause that there should be an amendment to require the court to have regard to what the victim says about his or her own circumstances and about the injuries inflicted, because surely they are matters that the court should take into account when fixing the appropriate penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill then goes on to provide that there should be a non-parole period-and we agree with that-and the non-parole period is to be determined by the court. The Bill provides that the court, in general, should fix a non-parole period where the prisoner is sentenced to more than three years imprisonment. It goes on to say that, in exceptional cases, the court may decline to fix a non-parole period. So the court, in an appropriate case-such as one where a life sentence is imposed-is not obliged to fix a non-parole period. </PARA>
<PARA> The general thrust of this part of the Bill is that there should be a non-parole period; in other words, the prisoner is sentenced to a period of imprisonment and the court says, `Until such time expires you are not eligible for parole'. Of course, we support that and we support also the next proposition contained in the Bill, that remissions should not reduce that non-parole period. In other words, when the court fixes a non-parole period it should mean exactly what it says; that is to say, it should be a non-parole period and, during that period, the prisoner should not be eligible for parole. </PARA>
<PARA> We support that and, of course, it is in keeping with the general thrust of the Bill; it is in keeping with the general thrust of the second reading speech of the Attorney- General (Mr Lionel Bowen); and it is in keeping with the general thrust of the significant speech made by the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, a few weeks ago in which he said, `What we are on about is having non-parole periods fixed'. Those non-parole periods should be exactly what they are meant to be-that is, periods during which prisoners are in prison and are not eligible for parole. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the Bill carries that through. But one of the curious things about this Bill-it is by no means a ground for voting against it and I have said that we are supporting it-is that it retains the provision for the release of prisoners on licence. We all know that a licence, to all intents and purposes, is a parole. The Bill provides that where a person is serving a Federal sentence the Attorney-General may grant a licence for that person to be released from prison. As usual, a whole host of clauses in the Bill, many of them couched in quite cumbersome language, then deal with the circumstances under which a licence can be granted. But a licence is very similar to, if not the same as, parole. We go through this quite laudable and commendable procedure in the Bill to establish the proposition that a prisoner is not to be released during the non-parole period. Nevertheless, at the end of that we are then told, `Quite apart from parole, a licence is still on'. I do not know whether the Attorney-General has got so accustomed to these great bundles of papers put before him-I have had some experience of these at one stage where applications are made for the release of prisoners on licence-that he believes it is impossible to do away with, but it calls for some explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to establish-and this is the commendable part of the Bill-a system under which there are to be no deviations from the non-parole period and if a prisoner is not to be released during the non-parole period, I simply invite the Attorney-General to give us an explanation as to why we are then retaining a system in the structure for the sentencing of Federal prisoners under which they will be able to be released before the non-parole period expires. I put it that way because that provision for the release of prisoners on licence, as we are told, applies in the Bill whether or not a non-parole period has been fixed. So it applies to those cases where a non-parole period has been fixed. We say with great respect to this part of the Bill that it requires some clarification although, as I have already said, that is by no means a ground for opposing the Bill and we do not oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to move on to another aspect which is important to the Opposition and which we regard as being a defect in the Bill. We regard it as so important that we will be moving an amendment. The Bill provides that, if the sentence imposed is between three and 10 years, release on parole is to be automatic when the non-parole period is served. So, consistently with the truth in sentencing provision and principle, the non-parole period is fixed and that non-parole period is served. The Bill then says that, in those cases where the penalty is between three and 10 years, the release on parole is automatic. It is not automatic in the case of penalties of 10 years or more, and we do not believe that it should be automatic in any case. We will be moving an amendment to the effect that, in all cases where the non-parole period has expired, the release on parole should be discretionary. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know of any State where the law is that parole is automatic. The effect of the expiration of a non-parole period is that the prisoner is eligible for parole, not that he is to be released on parole. There is nothing automatic at all. He still has to appear before the parole board in whatever State it is and make out his case, and the parole board will consider it on its merits. There is not automation in release on parole, nor should there be. We take the view that it is a blemish on this Bill that, in those cases where it is said that the penalty is three to 10 years, the release on parole is to be automatic. Once again the Law Reform Commission did not recommend that there be any difference in the cases between three and 10 years imprisonment or imprisonment for more than 10 years. It is true that the Law Reform Commission advocated automatic parole, but it did not advocate any distinction between those cases where a prisoner is sentenced to three to 10 years on the one hand, and 10 or more years on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be discovered, while a prisoner is in prison that he is particularly troublesome, and not a suitable person to be released on parole. Indeed, it can be said that one of the ways in which to keep control and order in a prison is to have the inducement of parole at the end of the day. In other words, the prisoner knows, without being told, that at the end of the non-parole period he will be eligible for parole, but it is not automatic, and if he does not behave himself he may not be released on parole. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, it might be established during the course of the prisoner being in prison during the non-parole period that he might be making links with organised crime outside the prison, and is just waiting for his time to expire until he can go back into the world at large and continue with a life of crime. That is not an offence, and it is not a ground for refusing him parole, but it is a circumstance which the Parole Board or, in the Federal case, something which the Attorney-General may, and should, take into account in deciding whether to release that prisoner on parole. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment will be along the lines that there should be no automatic parole but, rather, parole should be in the discretion of the Attorney-General who can weigh up all the circumstances. We believe that is a very important principle. Not only is it an important principle but also it is an important fact that if that principle operates in prisons it is more likely to keep order and control than if the prisoners know that immediately the non-parole period has expired they will be automatically entitled to parole, and that the Attorney-General will have no say in it at all. We believe that to be an important amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> We have no quarrel with the other provisions of the Bill relating to sentencing. Nor do we really have any quarrel with the provisions relating to mental illness. The Bill deals with persons unfit to stand trial and sets out the procedures for establishing this. There is a wide discretion given as to how those people are to be dealt with, ranging from a bond to detention in a hospital or prison. So it goes on. The provisions relating to people of unsound mind or disabled people are exactly what one would expect to find. It is appropriate that those provisions should be in the Bill and we support them. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot say the same, with the same enthusiasm, about the other provisions in the Bill relating to the Cash Transactions Reports Act, because there is a host of amendments to that which have been included in this Bill. We are not opposing them. I know that they have been recommended from some commercial quarters, and there is a case for making those amendments. The comment I just made relates to the bulk of the amendments in the Bill. However, we draw attention to clause 37 which provides a mechanism whereby an acceptable referee can be declared by the Minister in terms of a whole class of persons rather than as individuals. One body, the Australian Federation of Credit Unions, has written to me and drawn attention to the fact that credit unions and others should be consulted by the Attorney-General and other cash dealers before acceptable referees are gazetted. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other criticism I want to make is with respect to this new deluge of amendments that we received this morning. This is becoming a regular habit. It is a regular custom now to bring Bills in and, virtually on the day that the debate takes place, we are given another load of almost indigestible stodge. I do not know how Parliament is expected to understand these. I must register the strongest exception to this way of doing business. It is just not good enough to drop these bundles of amendments on us and expect the Parliament to put a rubber stamp on them. Perhaps I will say a bit more about that at a later opportunity, because my time has expired. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are probably few more emotive areas of law than that of crime and punishment. One only has to read that wonderful book by Dostoevski, Crime and Punishment, to know just how difficult the subject is. I have waded through that book on many occasions and never yet have I got to the end of it. I hope that one day I will have enough patience and time to digest all that Dostoevski says about crime and punishment. The subject is capable of great distortion and the public has great concern about the whole crime and punishment procedure in every State in Australia, as one can find out from reading newspapers in any city.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that is a pity. It is a pity that politicians of all persuasions-and I am not suggesting for a moment that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) is in that class of politicians-have used crime and punishment in emotive terms to evoke a particular view on law, order and punishment in the general populace. That is very easily discernible. I turn to a pamphlet which was distributed in Victoria in October 1987. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In Victoria there is:</PARA>
<PARA> a murder every 3 days</PARA>
<PARA> an armed robbery every 7 hours</PARA>
<PARA> a burglary every 6 minutes</PARA>
<PARA> and 510 rapes a year,</PARA>
<PARA> Don't be the next victim</PARA>
<PARA>These figures were calculated from the 1986-87 Major Crime Index. </PARA>
<PARA>That leaflet was widely distributed during a State campaign. Yet, using exactly the same statistics one could say that a Victorian household can expect a burglary once every 16 years and a car theft once every 42 years, and that a Victorian risks being the subject of a homicide once every 28,623 years and a rape once every 8,250 years. This is where the whole argument sometimes falls into disrepute when people for quite base political purposes bandy about through the media-and, to my regret, the media seem to take the headlines quite happily and usually put them on the front pages without ever checking their validity-wonderful stories about a rapist getting out of gaol after one or two years, or a murderer getting out of gaol after a very short space of time, which become delightful newspaper stories, and there is never any examination of the background of the circumstances which preceded the sentencing by the judge. </PARA>
<PARA> That kind of approach to crime and punishment brings the judicial processes of this nation into disrepute. (Quorum formed) I apologise to my colleagues for the waste of their time and the fact that the Opposition cannot seem to control its numbers or keep its members in the House.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KF4">Mr CLEELAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The genesis of the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is the Australian Law Reform Commission which, quite rightly, recommended to this Parliament and the Government that the Federal Parliament should enact Federal sentencing procedures. One of the concerns I have in the whole emotive area of punishment is that very few people have bothered-and the newspapers rarely accurately report the background which involves the process of a person receiving punishment and sentencing-to go into a court room, to go through the entire trial process of a person through to the conviction stage, have listened to the plea by defence counsel and comments by the prosecutor which are put to the court prior to sentencing and have followed the sentencing process to the time that the judge, or often a magistrate, hands down that sentence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If more people bothered to do that and if the media gave more of the background material which involves the sentencing process on an individual, the public would be better informed as to what sentencing is about. It is not an arbitrary process, as any person who has appeared in a court well knows. It is a very complex and technical area of law. Most legal practitioners who profess to have any jurisprudential skills in court would know that a lot of work and effort is put into the sentencing process. In fact, any barrister worth his salt probably spends more time on the sentencing procedures than he does on the trial processes. That is because prior to sentencing judges require a great deal of information. They are not arbitrary in the way they impose punishment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that when one looks at public opinion and reads newspaper reports one finds that most members of the public believe that people walk in and out of the doors of gaols. They believe somehow that there is a revolving door syndrome-that a person goes in one door and walks out the backdoor on parole, licence or whatever, and hence there is no punishment. There is also a strong view that those who are convicted of crimes of violence serve little or no term of imprisonment. The Australian Institute of Criminology has put a great deal of work into various research programs. I commend to honourable members interested in this matter issue No. 20 of Trends and issues which reveals some of the Institute's research work on prison sentences in Australia. It details in table form the various lengths of imprisonment that people undergo and the nature of the crimes upon which they have been convicted relative to the sentences served. It is very clear that through the States in particular long sentences are imposed and that people get very heavy sentences. </PARA>
<PARA> Associated with the whole sentencing procedure is the fact that it costs us around $40,000 a year to keep a person in gaol. Also associated with that is the fact that gaol is the greatest university of crime. Anyone who knows anything about the system realises that when a young person is placed in gaol he enters a university of unbelievable skills where talents abound. Any research will show that, having been through a prison system, the offender, if he becomes a recidivist, will be a far better criminal the second time around, will be harder to convict the second time around and will be even more difficult to apprehend the second time around. If we put that person through the system for a third, fourth and fifth time, we develop a system where we have very skilled and professional criminals that the police find very hard to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> Any sentencing program requires a great deal of effort to be put into the rehabilitation of the offender. We know that punishment is not an aspect a person thinks of when he commits a crime. We know that that is an irrelevant process in his thoughts before he decides whether to rob a bank or not; it is not a real deterrent. Heavy sentences have never deterred a person committing a crime. Many people argue that if we stretch someone's neck, fill him with electricity or fire guns into his body, somehow we will convince people not to commit serious crimes. Yet the evidence around the world proves that to be a totally fallacious argument. Indeed, in many countries which have the death penalty for drug offences, local drug use is increasing. One could say that the evidence follows that the harsher the penalty the greater the crime rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's approach to this issue has been to follow the recommendations of the report provided to it and to move down the track of getting a consistent approach to sentencing, which basically follows precedents set by judges. After all, judges have had a lot more experience at sentencing than, I think, anyone in this building. Over a number of years judges have developed a whole host of precedents to deal with sentencing. Over the years parliaments have changed and amended, and enacted by way of legislation, certain criteria. However, it seems to me that the best thing we can do as a parliament is ensure a fair degree of discretion in the judiciary. We should not try by way of legislation to lock judges into a tight program whereby we, as parliamentarians, are directing them to follow certain rules and guidelines which would limit the discretion they have now and which they should have. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his support of the Bill. However, should the clause which he seeks to insert in the legislation by way of his amendment No. 2 be accepted, I wonder what weight a judge should place on such evidence. What weight should a judge put on listening to a victim of crime detail the loss, damage or injury suffered? Should a judge say whether a person is emotional? Should a person in the witness box be able to make a plea to a judge to impose a particular sentence? How is a judge to deal with that evidence in terms of the proper weight to be applied in determining sentencing? The Bill as it stands provides that a judge must take into account the nature of the offence and the effect on the victim, including property loss. </PARA>
<PARA> As those who have appeared in many courts are aware, the prosecutor has the proper role, in many areas, of detailing loss. In a full trial where a defence is given, the nature of the evidence and the nature of the loss form part of the entire case, so the judge, or the magistrate, knows all the circumstances of the offence by way of evidence given in the course of the trial. Given the present system, if we impose the Opposition's proposed subsection (2a) by way of legislation without direction to the judge or the magistrate on what weight should be applied, I wonder whether we are imposing a greater control and taking away a wide discretion which judges and magistrates should have. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's proposed subsection (1) provides for, in legislative form, the current position being applied in the sentencing process. It is simply stating, in statutory form, the present position; it is not changing the law in that regard. It also removes the focus of the sentencing decision from all the circumstances of the offences, including the matters set out in subclause (2). It focuses only on the offence itself. I do not think that the amendment has much going for it. It is very undesirable, it confines the discretion of the sentencing court and it does not sit well with the import of the Opposition's amendment No. 2 which requires a sentencing court to take into account the views of anyone affected by the commission of an offence. There seems to be some conflict between clauses 1 and 2, which is not necessarily desirable. The High Court has held, as a basic principle of sentencing, that a sentence of imprisonment should never exceed that which can be justified as appropriate or proportionate to the gravity of the crime, considered in the light of the objective circumstances. That was delivered in 1988 in Veen's case, and is reported in Commonwealth Law Reports at pages 485 and 486. If one were to accept the Opposition's amendment, it would have to be changed yet again to take into account the decision of the High Court. I say that with due respect because I appreciate that, when one is sitting back and reading legislation such as this, one can spend a lot of time fathoming out the realities of it. One is not always possessed of a memory from which High Court decisions can come off the top of the head when looking at legislative words. Honourable members should look carefully at the amendments in the light of the High Court decision, particularly as there is a conflict between amendments 1 and 2 which causes me some concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to hold up the House much longer. When I stood, I was tempted to burst into song. I am familiar with that wonderful Gilbert and Sullivan song, Let the punishment fit the crime, but I thought it might not have been appropriate after dinner; members get tired after their meal and I did not want to upset them. But we ought to note the words of that song, and perhaps through this legislation we will get to the stage where the judiciary, at least in the eyes of the public, will have the punishment fit the crime. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not propose to traverse the arguments which have already been presented on the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), which has the support of the Opposition. I wish to say a few things about deterrence and serious crime, truth in sentencing and the present parlous state of our criminal justice system. The first point I make is that serious crime is a choice, made mostly for profit and sometimes for personal and emotional reasons. Housebreaking is a choice made for profit; the purpose is to get objects of value and the identity of the owner of the house is irrelevant. A rape is a choice of a person for pleasure. Murder is frequently an expiation of hatred, animosity of one kind or another, revenge or feelings of personal guilt. But mainly we are talking about serious crime as a choice made for profit. The calculation which is made is that it is more advantageous to engage in crime than it is to engage in some other form of endeavour, such as working for a living. In short, there are greater net benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This brings us to deterrence. The honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), if I understood him correctly, said that it does not matter how severe the sentence is; that will not have any effect. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JJ4">Mr SPENDER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I did not understand him correctly, certainly he was advancing a proposition very much on the borders of what I have just said. The whole theory of deterrence in criminal law, which is the foundation of the system of sentencing, is that deterrence influences choice, that behaviour is influenced or controlled by consequences, and that if a person knows or believes that a criminal act will end in his being sentenced to a serious term of imprisonment it is likely that he will not engage in that criminal act because the profit is not there and the pain certainly is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The truth of the matter is that we can talk as much as we like about the theory of criminal law and of deterrence, but it must work in practice. If one looks at the figures, it is plain that it does not. I present from the New South Wales Police Department some statistics on housebreaking. Remember those days when we used to believe that crime did not pay? Who believes that these days? Does anyone seriously believe that crime does not pay? Surely not. If people do believe that, they simply do not know how well crime pays. The clean-up figures of the Sydney Police Department for housebreaking in 1987-88 were 5.15 per cent. That means that the odds are 1 in 20 that housebreakers will be caught and 19 out of 20 that they will not be caught. That makes it a worthwhile line of endeavour. The clean-up rate of motor vehicle thefts in New South Wales for 1987-88-theft of vans, bicycles and all forms of motor vehicles-was 4.78 per cent. Again, the thieves have one chance in 20 of being caught and sentenced and 19 chances in 20 of getting away with it. Obviously this is a good form of investment of time and energy. The profits are quick and the cost is likely not to be inflicted on the thief. </PARA>
<PARA> When one gets to crimes such as murder and rape, it is different. If people are going to be murdered, they can be cheered with the thought that it is more likely than not that they know their murderer. Because of that and the fact that more resources are employed against more serious crime, the clean-up rate is higher. Just on 76 per cent of murders were cleared up in 1987-88 in New South Wales. In all forms of rape the figure dropped to around 66 per cent. Overall, if one looks to predatory crime-forget about organised crime, of which we talk so much in this place-the crime that affects the householder, the ordinary person, it is a good and profitable investment, and for that reason the whole system breaks down. Those who are most in fear, as every member of the House knows, are the ordinary householders. I suggest that every member of the House has knocked on the door of a constituent, usually middle-aged or elderly, and found a security screen door. We talk to the constituent and find that that lady never goes out in the evenings and is afraid to go out during the day. That is where the system breaks down. That makes quite futile an interesting debate on truth in sentencing, because truth in sentencing is irrelevant to the citizen unless the system is good enough to influence the actions of those who make the streets unsafe. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a huge area which is untouched: the area of people in fear. I know that much is said these days about white collar crime, organised crime. It is the topic of the day. The truth of the matter is that, for the ordinary citizen, it does not matter a damn. If a bank is robbed of $20m, so what? If every second house in the neighbourhood is robbed in the course of a year, that is something else again. The people who suffer the most are usually the poorest people. We are doing the easy thing here; we are employing resources to pass a Bill which deals with certain matters of sentencing, which in themselves are important. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill says nothing about the grindingly hard work which is necessary if a criminal justice system which has broken down is to be made to work-courts that work speedily, that are adequately staffed, proper resources in the offices of the prosecution, proper resources in the police departments, standards of recruitment that are better than the ones we presently have, higher standards of training and higher status for all people involved in law enforcement. One of the most publicly valuable ways for individuals to spend their lives is making sure that the streets are safe. What are the other things that can be done? Self-help organisations between citizens and police for the purposes of making difficult and unsafe areas safe. In short, we have to think more constructively, more originally, employ more resources and engage in the difficult and unrequited work of making the criminal justice system work. This Parliament can pass Bills which will be regarded as models of criminal justice. It is of no importance at all unless the machinery, from the police station to the courthouse, is working efficiently and quickly and produces a result which the public will see to be just. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the question of truth. As Gilbert and Sullivan said: Let the punishment fit the crime. In fact, that is really what this Bill is largely about-that the punishment should fit the crime; that there should be a just and fair sentence which should take into account factors which objectively are thought to be relevant, and yet the very attempt that the Government has made illustrates how difficult this task is. I will take up two points only: first of all, the Bill provides that in passing the sentence the court must take into account:</PARA>
<PARA> (f) the degree to which the person has shown contrition for the offence;</PARA>
<PARA> (i) by taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) in any other manner;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) if the person has pleaded guilty to the charge in respect of the offence-that fact;</PARA>
<PARA>With some experience in criminal law, I have never known of a case when an accused person who has been found guilty or a person who is pleading guilty has not expressed contrition. It is the easiest thing in the world. Of course the person is contrite-he has been caught and faces the prospect of spending some long time in gaol, and that can be very unpleasant. A person will express any kind of contrition that he can think of for the purpose of making the sentence on him less. But did he have contrition at the time he inflicted whatever it was that he inflicted-when he raped, murdered, gouged, beat up? Of course he did not. I would have thought that that was a very doubtful consideration to take into account; just as I am very doubtful about the provision that one should take into account the fact that a person has pleaded guilty, because the practical effect of that is that lawyers are going to advise clients, in what looks to be a pretty doubtful and hard case, `If you fight it and it goes for a long time, it may go hard for you. If you plead guilty, it will be easier'. The client says, `Look, I am innocent'. The lawyer says, `I can only advise you as to how the system works'. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter specifically that I will take up is an unusual provision which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a person is convicted of one or more federal offences relating to property, money or both, whose total value does not exceed $2,000; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the person has not previously been sentenced to imprisonment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>the court convicting the person must not, unless in the opinion of the court there are exceptional circumstances that warrant it, pass a sentence of imprisonment for that offence or any of those offences. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me put this case to the House regarding theft of firearms. Firearms are used for the purposes of robbery and murder. If a person needs to get hold of them, he sometimes needs to thieve them, and he goes out and thieves three or four firearms with a net value of less than $2,000. One can say, `That is a perfectly natural transaction with no unusual circumstances. I haven't been caught before and I haven't been convicted before'. I should have thought that that was a provision that was best left out so that the court can come to its own conclusion as to what is right and what is wrong and not construct artificial tests as to what is an exceptionable circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just outline a few other matters that I believe are important if we are to make this system work. I believe that, as a general rule, high rate offenders should get longer sentences and low rate offenders, even for the same crime, should get shorter sentences. I think it is essential that prisoners be screened so that the violent, the psychopathic, the recidivists, the rapists are not mixed in with the new, the relatively untouched. I believe that as a general rule prisons should be of small or moderate size. There should be no double bunking, as occurs almost invariably in so many prisons in this country. We know what that leads to. Let us understand it. It leads to anal rape, to acquired immune deficiency syndrome and to murder. Yet this is something which, as a society, we simply pass by. If a person is murdered in Long Bay gaol, it is a matter of notoriety for the press and oblivion for the rest of us because we do not give a damn. We think, `Well, if you are bad enough to be there in the first place, it is too damned bad that you should happen to die because you mixed in the wrong company-that is the company that you chose'. Guards in prison should be adequate and they should have two main purposes: first, to secure the community against those who are inside, which means keeping them there; and, secondly, to secure prisoners against each other. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a great deal from this Government about law reform. I have looked at many of the reports that have come forward as, no doubt, you have, Mr Deputy Speaker, but these are the sorts of issues that are not addressed. These are the sorts of issues that should be addressed if the Government is to take a leading role-as it should, and as it must-in the rehabilitation of our criminal justice system, because it has fallen into contempt, and for good reasons. There are no magic bullets available to us. Over the last two or three decades we have faced an explosion in crime. At the moment we are fiddling on the margin in this House. We have done nothing useful to make the streets safe, certainly in the nearly seven years this Government has been in power. Safe streets will not be had on the cheap; but it is safe streets that the citizens expect, and that is an area in which this Government should play a lead role. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate on the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). It has been helpful in bringing to light some of the issues that bedevil our society. In the first instance, the Bill is aimed at some certainty in sentencing, and nobody disagrees with that. We will move an amendment in respect of the Cash Transaction Reports Act, and I will explain that later. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) has fairly raised a number of matters. He says that there is no automatic release of prisoners. I am advised that in South Australia and in Western Australia there are automatic releases. Prisoners in Australia do not normally appear before parole boards. I think that was one of the things the honourable member was expecting. Federal prisoners number 517. The total number of prisoners in Australia is approximately 12,500. So the emphasis basically has to be in the States because of State criminal activity. Let me make it very clear: It is the States that run the penitentiaries. We do not run any of them. This legislation is to give some certainty to what we are about in respect of Federal offences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable gentleman raised the issue of why there would be an opportunity for a release on licence, as is proposed in this Bill, in exceptional circumstances when there was to be certainty of sentencing on the basis of there being a fixed non-parole period which could not be altered. If one looks at the provision which talks about release on licence, one will notice that it has to be, firstly, as a result of an application being made and, secondly, there must be exceptional circumstances that would entitle the granting of the licence. We acknowledge that it is an exception, but some flexibility is required in certain cases and this would be one of them. For example, the courts repeatedly have held that the recognition of cooperation with law enforcement which occurs after sentencing is one circumstance that ought to be considered, and that is a matter purely for the Executive. In the absence of any release on licence mechanism, such cases could be dealt with only by the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy, and that is a little too cumbersome. That is the reason for this provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) raised the issue of property which might be the subject of an offence and of less than $2,000 in value. He asked why for such an offence there would be no imprisonment. He used the instance of a gun. That would be a State offence, not a Federal offence. We are talking about Federal offences in relation to this issue, which basically would relate to social security fraud or matters of that nature, not the other. </PARA>
<PARA> In fairness to the debate it is appropriate to mention that there are concerns in our society about the increase in crime. This must immediately bring one to the point of asking how we should best deal with it. The biggest penitentiary in Australia is in my electorate. I am not responsible for it, because it is a State matter. But I am well aware of the circumstances that always prevail in the prison environment. Most of these prisons were built in the last century. They provide for incarceration in circumstances that are similar to those at Taronga Park, that is, the zoo in Sydney. It is known that if people are incarcerated for a period, particularly with others of a criminal intent, it is not likely that they will improve. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem for our society-and it is a proper consideration-is that people who commit offences should be punished. Society expects this, yet all the parliaments in Australia and, perhaps, in the world have not yet been able to come up with the answer to the question: Does prison provide the solution? I think society expects prison to be a remedial institution where people can learn and perhaps correct their behaviour. A good psychologist will tell one that if people are reduced to that sort of environment they lose all their self-esteem, reach the bottom of the barrel and become very anti-social. If one considers recidivism, one will notice that most prisoners serve sentences of less than 12 months. If one wants to consider what causes problems for prisoners one might have to go back to the earlier parts of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very significant that when I did a survey 20-odd years ago of prisoners in a penitentiary, some 40 per cent had come under notice by the age of 12 as juvenile delinquents, which is what they were called in those days. I am pleased to say that Canberra has a progressive magistrate, Mr Cahill, who is looking at issues such as this and at cooperation with State authorities, particularly when very young people come under notice. We might be able to think of some better method of looking after them, keeping them at school instead of putting them in institutions. It is important for us to learn these things. </PARA>
<PARA> It is valid that the honourable member for North Sydney has raised the issue, but the issue of whether society will accept different methods of rehabilitation has to be looked at. I think it will. There have been a few experiments in California over a period. They have what are called prisons without walls. When the person is brought along to such an institution, there is an assessment of the person's capacity-whether the person needs some training, whether he has some skills, whether he is interested. A whole group of people take an interest in that person as a human being. They talk about an education program, and the person is put straight back in the work force on condition that he report to the institution each evening. The success rate years ago was 80 per cent. These sorts of things would require a lot of money. Certainly in some cases they would not be applicable. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies will be moving amendments. I say at the outset that I cannot see my way clear to accepting them but we will discuss that in committee. There are amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports (CTR) Act 1988, at page 60 of the Bill. This has come about because in that legislation it was essential to try to verify the bank accounts. We had a provision in that legislation that the verification had better be of some weight because a number of accounts had not been verified. The interesting thing about that legislation was that the banks came to me at the time and said, `You will put us in a lot of difficulty if you ask us to verify existing accounts. We really cannot do it. There are hundreds of thousands of them. But what about if we agree that from here on in we will verify them?'. I said, `Certainly you had better do something and we will take it from there. We ought to do it by way of statutory declaration or something equivalent to that'. They agreed at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for these amendments is that recently the banks have come along and said, `We find that it is still too cumbersome. We cannot meet that sort of stringent requirement. There are problems in that regard'. I will give a summary of the explanation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right; in my view they have not been the subject of any lengthy drafting. That is the point. We were not in session last week. The amendments contained in part 3 of the Bill make important changes to the account verification. These changes stem from discussions with the financial sector, particularly the new entrant banks, that is, those new banks which have entered the retail banking market since deregulation. The present requirements of the CTR Act in relation to account verification are contained in sections 18 to 21 of the CTR Act. Briefly they require that a signatory shall produce a verification statement, including an identification reference from an acceptable referee. The Government amendments will supplement this procedure by enabling a further alternative procedure to be used in place of the identification reference to verify the identity of the signatory to an account with certain cash dealers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The structure of the Government amendments to implement this change are as follows: firstly, provision is made for the designation of certain cash dealers as identifying cash dealers. Cash dealers will be able to apply to the Director of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency for approval as an identifying cash dealer upon giving an undertaking to comply with stringent verification procedures. Secondly, where a person wishes to become a signatory to an account with an identifying cash dealer, a verification statement in relation to an account need not be accompanied by an identification reference under section 21. Where no identification reference is produced, the cash dealer must verify the identity of the signatory by using the new prescribed identification method under subsection 28. Thirdly, the proposed alternative system of account verification, which will require the cash dealer to conduct certain inquiries to verify the signatory's identity, will be detailed in regulations to be made under subsection 28. </PARA>
<PARA> The major difference between the existing requirements of the signatory produced identification reference and the proposed alternative system is that the existing system places responsibility for the verification of identity upon the signatory, whereas the new system will place that responsibility upon the cash dealer. This will introduce a beneficial degree of flexibility in the critical process of account verification, particularly for those cash dealers who do not have an extensive branch network throughout Australia to facilitate access by customers. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now outline the proposed alternative method. The method is based upon the procedures which are presently used by financial institutions in verifying the identity of customers in connection with an application for a line of credit. It is envisaged that the regulations will prescribe 12 or so separate checks to be undertaken by the cash dealer. It is anticipated that the checks will include, for example, the examination of a primary identification document, an electoral roll search and an employer check. Those checks will be directed at verifying the name, address and date of birth of the signatory. The identifying cash dealer will be required to carry out a certain minimum number of checks. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it may occur that anomalies will be detected by this verification process. If the anomaly is such as to give the cash dealer reasonable grounds to suspect that information held by the cash dealer concerning the transaction may be relevant to the investigation of tax evasion or one of the other matters mentioned in paragraph 16 (1) (b) of the Cash Transaction Reports Act-for example, opening or operating an account in a false name-the cash dealer will be obliged to report the anomaly as a suspect transaction under section 16. The verification may, on balance, verify the identity of the signatory, also giving rise to the type of suspicion referred to in section 16. For example, the process may well verify that the signatory is in fact who he or she claims to be, but the circumstances as a whole may also indicate that the person may be evading taxation or engaging in other unlawful activity. In such a case the account would be unblocked, but a suspect transaction report under section 16 would also be lodged with the Cash Transaction Reports Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> Various consequential changes are made to the Cash Transaction Reports Act to enhance the new verification process. The Director of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency will be able to have an authorised officer inspect the cash dealer's records relating to the application of the prescribed verification procedure. The amendments provide that an account will be blocked to withdrawals by an unverified signatory until the verification process is satisfactorily completed, and require an identifying cash dealer to retain any record relating to the carrying out of the prescribed verification procedure for seven years after the account is closed. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally the amendments make it an offence to make a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular and that is capable of misleading an identifying cash dealer in carrying out the prescribed verification procedure. The amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act meet the concerns of many cash dealers about the possible unintended market effects of the existing requirements by offering flexibility both to cash dealers and to the signatories of accounts, while at the same time maintaining or enhancing the integrity of the verification process from the law enforcement perspective. The amendments will not have any significant financial impact upon the Budget outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies said that there should be some consultation regarding acceptable referees. I think he said that credit unions were one of those that could be considered suitable. That can certainly be the case. On 23 October a request was received that they be considered, and there is no reason why they should not be considered. In fact, on the question of gazettal we will certainly consult with those people as to whether they can be accepted as suitable referees. On that basis the letter of 23 October from the Australian Federation of Credit Unions Ltd (AFCUL) is appropriate in this sense. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> AFCUL further requests that the list of suitable referees to be gazetted for CTR account opening include credit unions' senior management and their agents.</PARA>
<PARA>We will give that consideration. At the present time we think that the people who might be suitable are the same sort of people that we now use in the identification of passport applications. I thank honourable members for their contributions and I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum that relates to the amendments that the Government proposes to move. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to place on record the Opposition's strong opposition to the way in which these amendments have been introduced and dropped on us and on members of the Committee without any notice at all. Firstly, it must be said that this is now a regular practice and one that I disapprove of very strongly indeed. There is scarcely a Bill in this area where the situation does not arise when on the day of the debate or shortly before it someone from the office of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) or his Department or the office of the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, comes knocking at my door with another batch of amendments. As I said, this sometimes happens on the day of the debate. We are not given an opportunity to deal with this indigestible stodge, which it usually is, and we receive no explanation of it. There is no notice and no opportunity for us to discuss these matters with the industry concerned, and it is just plain ignorance and arrogance on the part of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure that I speak for all my colleagues when I say that we take very strong objection to this method of doing business.

I do not know on what day the Attorney-General maintains that the amendments were drafted but, unless I have completely lost track of the days because of the wretched pilots strike, it is still Monday and I cannot believe that these amendments were drawn yesterday. The printer's date on the amendments is 26 October, which was last Thursday. I ask why we could not have had the amendments last Thursday or Friday or over the weekend. It is just not good enough. I suppose the most polite way I could put it is that under a different government we would expect a higher standard of conduct from the people responsible. </PARA>

As the honourable gentleman would know-although he has no direct persuasion there-the Senate is adamant that unless legislation is received within a certain time it will not be passed. That is a very worrying concern for the Government as well. There were no deadlines in that place when we were in Opposition and we were able to exercise our authority to guarantee that it did not happen. Maybe the honourable gentleman could use his influence with his colleagues in the Senate to ensure that we do not have the sanction put on us in the House of Representatives that unless certain legislation is put to the Senate within a certain time it will not be dealt with.

<PARA> (1) Clause 6, page 6, omit proposed subsection 16a (1), substitute the following subsection:</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Clause 6, page 7, after proposed subsection 16a (2), insert the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `(2a) Before imposing a sentence or making an order, the court shall invite the victim of the offence and any other person who has suffered injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence to inform the court of his or her personal circumstances and of any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence, and the court shall, in imposing the sentence or making the order, take into account any such information so provided to the court.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I referred to these two amendments during the second reading debate. There is no need for me to go into the proposals in detail. It would be appropriate to start off by repeating the point I made in the second reading debate-that is, that this Bill has a very peculiar provision in it. The first amendment is to section 16a and provides that the court will impose the least severe type of sentence or order in the circumstances. As I said before, it is a strange procedure to have these exhortations contained in the Bill. That being so, it seems doubly strange to us to have one requiring the court to impose the least severe sentence. I had hoped that the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) in his reply would have given an explanation as to why it is there and what it is meant to convey. If it is meant to convey what I assume the plain words mean, it presumably means that if a sentence of one year is open, even although the court in appropriate circumstances might be able to impose a sentence of five years the court is now obliged to impose one year. What about one month or one day? Is that not the least severe sentence? What about a fine or a good behaviour bond?</PARA>
<PARA> Why is this being done? That is the problem we have. It seems a curious proposition to put there. Not only is that so but it is not what the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended. It recommended that there be a provision along the lines of our amendment. It did not have the advantage of our amendment at the time it wrote its report. When we drew the amendment we had the advantage of its report. Our amendment proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>In determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a federal offence, a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate to the offence. </PARA>
<PARA>I just hope it is not the case that the Government is saying that a court is to be obliged to impose the least severe sentence. I hope it is not to be the case that the Government is to vote against an amendment that says that the appropriate penalty is to be imposed. Surely, as the Law Reform Commission said, that is what sentencing is supposed to be all about-to impose a penalty of a degree of seriousness and severity which is appropriate to the crime that has been committed. That is commonsense; it has been endorsed by the Law Reform Commission. It stands out as an obvious proposition that should be contained in this Bill. It is really, with respect, very difficult to see why such an amendment cannot be accepted. I know that the principle these days is to reject all Opposition amendments, but surely there must be cases where it is so obvious that even the Government would be prepared to accept an amendment of this sort. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 2 deals with the matters that the court should take into account when it is imposing a sentence. The Bill lists the matters the court should take into account, such as whether the prisoner has been contrite, whether he has made some effort to reform or apologise, whether he has pleaded guilty or cooperated with the police, whether there has been a lot of damage done or not much damage done. All of those circumstances are listed and they are proper matters to be considered, with which we have no exception at all. But there is not yet in the Bill that degree of concern for the victim that will enable the community to say, `All right, the victim's interests have been taken into account'. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, there is a feeling in at least some sections of the community that the interests of the prisoner are taken care of but the interests of the victim are not. What we say in this amendment is that the court, before it imposes the sentence, should invite the victim of the offence and any other person who has suffered injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence to inform the court of his or her personal circumstances and of any injury, loss or damage suffered. We go on to say that the court must take that into account. We are not saying that it is bound by it. It is not being required to follow it slavishly but it should enable victims to have their twopennyworth. The court should take what they say into account. That likewise is a reasonable proposition and one which we believe the Government should accept. </PARA>
<PARA> We regard these matters as being of sufficient seriousness that we propose to call for divisions if they are not accepted. We want it clarified whether the Government is in favour of having the least severe sentence imposed or whether it is in favour of having a sentence of a severity which is appropriate to the offence. That is a basic benchmark situation. We also want it clarified whether the Government is prepared to enable victims to be given appropriate, moderate and reasonable opportunity of giving their story to the court as to the way in which the particular crime inflicted on them has affected them. I urge the Government to accept both of our amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason why we do not wish to accept amendment No. 1 is that it focuses on the offence itself and does not take into account all the other matters in subsection (2) which relate to the circumstances, the question of contrition, character, antecedents and prospects of rehabilitation. All of those matters have to be considered. The honourable gentleman is anxious that we focus on the offence itself. We think that is undesirable as it confines the discretion of the court and does not take into account all the other factors, which any judge would take into account. Basically, as we make the point, the idea is to talk about rehabilitation apart from punishment so we could not leave it just looking at the offence; we have to look at the circumstances, the accused, whether there has been a plea of guilty and matters of that nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The High Court has held that it is a basic principle of sentencing that the sentence of imprisonment should never exceed that which can be justified as appropriate or proportionate to the gravity of the crime considered in the light of the objective circumstances. That is Veen v. R, 1988, 164 Commonwealth Law Reports 465 at 472, 485, 486, 490, 491 and 496. However, if the honourable gentleman wishes to alter his amendment to include the words `in all the circumstances' so that the amendment would read, `. . . must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances', I think we could accept it. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. (2) requires the sentencing court to first invite the victim and any person to inform the court. This seems to add little to the discretion already vested in the court by clause 16a (2) (d) and (e) which empowers the court to take these matters into account. It could lead to the position that the victim of the offence could be asked to be available for cross-examination and matters of that nature. This would certainly be undesirable. The amendment would remove the appropriate focus of the sentencing process from the requirements of justice for the community as a whole to emphasise unduly the views of the victim and it runs contrary to the views of the Australian Law Reform Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA> Pages 103 and 104 of that report make the point that courts take into account the extent and nature of the harm. The report recommends that this continue to be the case. Information about the impact of the offence on its victims is therefore brought to the court's attention by the prosecution. The victim is a witness, not a party. The question whether victims should, in some or all circumstances, be able to be parties to the proceedings so far as sentencing is concerned was raised in a Commission discussion paper. Little support for this was found in the Commission's consultations. Individual lawyers and groups representing sections of the legal profession overwhelmingly rejected the proposal that victims should be able to be parties to the proceedings. In the Commission's view, sentences are imposed in pursuance of the values of the whole of the community, not to satisfy a particular person. It is in accordance with that recommendation that the Government is unable to accept amendment No. (2). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move the following amendments:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (3) Clause 9, page 16, omit proposed subsection 19al (1). </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Clause 9, page 16, lines 31 to 34, omit ``a federal life sentence or a federal sentence of, or federal sentences aggregating, 10 years or more a non-parole period has been fixed in relation to the person in respect of the sentence or sentences'', substitute ``a federal sentence and a non-parole period has been fixed in relation to the person in respect of the sentence''. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of these amendments is in effect to give a discretion to the Attorney-General as to whether parole is given to a Federal prisoner after his non-parole period has expired. The burden of the Bill is that, in those cases where a prisoner has been given three to 10 years, parole is automatic after the non-parole period has expired. Under the Bill, in those cases where the penalty is 10 years or more, parole is not automatic and it may be rejected by the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> The Law Reform Commission drew no such distinction. My recollection is that it was in favour of automatic parole, but we are not. Indeed, a lot can be said for not having parole automatic. As I said before, the carrot and the stick would operate to a large extent in dealing with prisoners in prison. Obviously there has to be discipline to maintain law and order in prison but, at the same time, it is only fair to hold out to prisoners who are subject to a non-parole period that there is a reasonable prospect of being allowed out on parole if they behave themselves and conduct themselves in such a way that they are appropriate persons for parole at the end of the non-parole period. </PARA>
<PARA> In my remarks in the second reading debate I said I was not aware of any State in which parole was automatic. The Attorney-General said that parole is automatic in South Australia and Western Australia. I apologise and let me rephrase what I was trying to say. In Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania and Queensland, which is a pretty strong combination, parole is not automatic, and no doubt for very good reasons. A case should be made out for parole; it should not be automatic. There is a very valuable inducement to good behaviour to make parole in the discretion of the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> After all, it may turn out while the prisoner is in prison during the non-parole period that it is discovered that he or she is not an appropriate person for parole. It may turn out that a prisoner is forging links with criminals outside the prison or that a prisoner is engaging in conduct in the prison which is not an offence so that the prisoner cannot be charged or convicted while in prison; nevertheless it is conduct such that the parole board would be of the view that the prisoner should not be allowed out on parole. We believe that that is only reasonable and that it will not deny parole to any deserving potential parolee. All potential deserving parolees will be in a good position. They will still qualify for parole if all of the circumstances are such that parole is justified. </PARA>
<PARA> So the amendments impose the same rules as those rules set out in the Bill for parole where the penalty is 10 years or more. It is only in respect of the three to 10-year bracket that the Bill operates in the unsatisfactory way that I have described. It does not operate in that unsatisfactory way where the penalty is 10 years or more. So our amendment seeks to impose the same rules as are presently in the Bill where the penalty is 10 years or more. But we say that it should apply to all terms of imprisonment. In our view it is appropriate and fair in all of the circumstances that the Attorney-General should have this discretion. After all, as the Attorney-General said, there are only 517 Federal prisoners-or that was the number when the second reading speech was written; I do not know whether the number has gone up or down, but it would not have gone up or down by very much and there must be comparatively few who are eligible for parole on any given day. One would not have thought it was very much of a burden for the Attorney-General to exercise his discretion. Many people would take the view that they would rather put their future in the hands of the Attorney-General than in the hands of many others because I am sure he would exercise a discretion fairly and justly having regard to all of the circumstances. We say that the Attorney-General should exercise that discretion; he should have it, as he will by these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot accept the amendments. It wishes to draw the distinction in the Act, namely, that in this case we are talking about sentences of more than three years but less than 10. The other distinction is that, if it is for more than 10 years, there is a discretion. The view taken is that, if we were to bring in again a discretion, it would remove the objectivity of what we are about here, namely, giving some certainty in sentencing. It is for that reason that we have to make it very clear that the judge will take these matters into consideration. We should not get into the difficulty that has been bedevilling State administrations and about which there has been a concern, where people have been released and a further crime committed. In other words, we put the emphasis at the time of the sentence on the fact that all factors are then taken into consideration. Nothing subsequent to that would entitle the Attorney-General to exercise a discretion. If a prisoner were to misbehave and create further offences, they would be State offences and they would be added to the sentence.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just briefly, there is one additional point I would like to put by way of reply. This argument is not really very persuasive because, as we said at the second reading, as well as allowing parole after a non-parole period has expired, the Bill allows Commonwealth prisoners to be released on licence, as is the present practice. As I said before, to all intents and purposes a licence is the same as parole. What we are saying is that the Government is setting up this great performance for release on parole yet at the same time giving an unlimited discretion to the Attorney-General to release prisoners on licence-in other words, to do exactly the same thing for the prisoner as though he were released on parole. What is the point of the Government stifling the parole procedures and at the same time letting the prisoner out on licence?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I may be misreading the Bill; the Attorney-General can explain if I am wrong. But it seems to me that a prisoner could apply to be released on licence, that application be rejected and then a matter of weeks or days later he could be eligible for automatic parole. If the Attorney-General rejects an application for leave on licence, it must be on very good grounds-obviously because the prisoner is such an unsavoury person that he should not be allowed out. But, lo and behold, a few days, weeks or months later, he may be eligible for automatic parole. That is the case. But, even worse, under the catchy heading `Can person be released on parole or licence if earlier parole order or licence revoked?', we have the very short proposed new subsection which states:</PARA>
<PARA>A parole order may be made or a licence granted, even if a previous parole order or licence has been revoked. </PARA>
<PARA>So we could have a case where a prisoner is released on licence and commits some dreadful act while on licence. The Attorney-General then does the right thing and cancels the licence but, lo and behold, the next day he could be eligible for automatic parole. If that is right, that is very silly indeed. It seems that the problem comes from allowing licences to remain when one tries to do a good, decent and sensible thing by fixing up laws relating to release on parole. By keeping the licence provision and not allowing discretionary releases on parole but imposing automatic releases on parole, we may well be creating more problems than we have had so far. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The difficulty that we have in this case is that there will be exceptional circumstances; that is the only position in which a licence would be granted. As the honourable gentleman said, that certainly can be revoked. But there do have to be exceptional circumstances. That is the factor that we need to have in all these issues. It could well be that, after sentence, there is some cooperation with the law enforcement agencies which could well help to bring punishment to other people. It is on that basis that we have that facility. But I make the point that circumstances have to be exceptional. They would have to relate to conduct drawn to the attention of the Attorney-General subsequent to the time of sentencing and not apparent at the time. It is for that reason that we need to have that sort of facility. It does not say that the Attorney-General will be doing something which would bring us into the conflict that the honourable gentleman is entitled to raise, namely, that a licence could be cancelled and the next day somebody released on parole. That is the position. The thing to look at is what were the exceptional circumstances that entitled the licence to be issued in the first place. It will relate to what we would call recognition of cooperation with law enforcement agencies that would assist in bringing other people to account if criminal behaviour were detected.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to say that amendment (10) is unsatisfactory to us. It deals with the verification by cash dealers of, as I understand it, the person putting his signature on the account. Proposed subsection 40b (c) seeks to add new paragraphs (7) and (8). The comment I want to make relates to paragraph (8), which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Subject to subsection (9), where a statement of the kind mentioned in subsection (7) is not accompanied by an identification reference for a signatory to the account concerned, the cash dealer must carry out the prescribed verification procedure for the purpose of identifying the signatory. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, to put it bluntly, the bank will carry out some procedures to see whether the person who has put his signature to this application or transaction is really the person that he says he is. There is then to be a verification procedure; but it is a prescribed verification procedure, not one which is set out in the Bill. I presume that this relates to the comment on the first page of this collection of papers that were dumped on my desk this morning. We find this statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The list will include such checks as an electoral roll check, the examination of a primary identification document, a check with the employer of the signatory (to check name and address and date of birth) and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>We were told earlier that this was to be a prescribed list of around 12 separate checks. So, in other words, there are to be prescribed by regulation around 12 checks to be made by banks on people. The Parliament is not being taken into the confidence of the Government or the banks as to what these checks are; we will have to wait until regulations are prescribed. No doubt they have already been discussed with the banks and the friends of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) have given their okay to it; but the Parliament will not be told about it. For us it is only a prescribed verification procedure. Not only is this not good enough but also it is a good illustration of what I said before: When we get these amendments four or five days after they have been agreed to by the Government and checked out with the industry, but not given to the Parliament until the day of the debate, this is the very thing that happens. We only notice a major defect like that when we are sitting here reading the Bill. So it is not good legislation; it is not a good way to conduct the Parliament. I can assure the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) that, if I thought there was any prospect of having the amendment defeated, I would be calling a division and voting against it, but, as that will not happen, the only thing I can do is to register yet again a complaint about this way of legislating. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have this opportunity to lead for the Opposition in contributing to the debate on the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill 1989 and the Sales Tax Laws (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill 1989. We will not be opposing the Bills but I will be moving a second reading amendment which expresses our reservations about the way the Government has dramatically increased the revenue from the wholesale sales tax by over 200 per cent in the life of this Government, most of which has not been validated by changes that have come before this Parliament; but I will come back to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will deal with the Bills in two parts, focusing first on the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill, and, secondly, dealing with the computer programs Bill and the Sales Tax Bill. The first Bill makes four fundamental changes: firstly, the exemption of certain paper products from sales tax; secondly, the exemption of a range of goods which are exempt from sales tax where those goods are for use by a subcontractor exclusively in carrying out activities on behalf of manufacturers; thirdly, an increase in the small manufacture exemption threshold; and, finally, the correction of an anomaly in relation to flavoured milk-namely, that flavoured milk drinks that contain at least 90 per cent milk will be subject to tax at a concessional rate of 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the second, third and fourth of these changes quite explicitly. In particular, the second and third changes seem to me to be to the considerable benefit of small business and, to some extent, lift the burden of sales tax on small business. Therefore, we strongly support those changes, particularly in an environment where the Treasurer (Mr Keating) seems to have a total ignorance of the plight of small business in present circumstances. The recent decision announced in the Budget to bring forward the payment of corporate tax will have a large and significant effect on small business. </PARA>
<PARA> To be frank, I do not think the Treasurer has any idea as to the difficult situation most small businesses are in today in trying to make ends meet and, in particular, to function on short term interest rates of somewhere between 21 and 24 per cent. The Government has suddenly increased their tax burden by bringing forward the payment of tax into the current financial year. For most small businesses that are heavily dependent on a cash flow, this will simply mean an increase in their borrowings. I was interested to see that the Treasurer estimated that the public sector would save about $400m in public sector debt interest by bringing forward that taxation. That is a cost to the whole corporate sector, domestically, of some $500m-odd if we take a reasonable margin between private borrowing costs and public sector borrowing costs. I urge the Treasurer to reconsider that proposal relating to small business. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, I welcome the second and third changes in this Bill, which are to the benefit of small business. The fourth change, which relates to flavoured milk, arises from an anomaly, and we would also welcome the correction of that anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA> On the first change, the exemption of certain paper products from sales tax, I think it is important to recognise that this is to give effect, I guess, to the Government's stated policy on this matter in its environment statement of July 1989. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will introduce legislation to exempt from wholesale sales tax certain printing and writing paper, tissue and toilet paper and paper bags if they are made out of wholly recycled paper. We will also examine whether it is practicable to extend the exempting of any other recycled paper products. </PARA>
<PARA>The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will give effect to the announcement in the Prime Minister's Environment Statement of 20 July 1989 that certain paper products made wholly of recycled paper are to be exempt from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill itself states that `the following goods, if all the paper in the goods has been manufactured from recycled paper' shall be exempt from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This has resulted in representations to us and, I gather, to a number of other people, including the Treasurer, from Peat Marwick Hungerfords, initially on behalf of the Australian paper mills, I think. Peat Marwick Hungerfords asked whether the particular clause of the Bill I identified really does meet the intentions of the Government's environment policy in relation to recycled paper. It expressed the view that it does not believe it will achieve the Government's intended result of providing exemption for certain goods that are made wholly-I emphasise that-of recycled paper, as there is an inconsistency in the reading of the Bill. The Bill can be read to mean that it will provide an exemption for goods made only partly of recycled paper, not necessarily wholly. The point I raise in this debate is the need for some clarification on the part of the Government as to whether the Bill does meet the requirements of its environment policy and, in particular, whether it relates to certain goods that are made wholly of recycled paper and not otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> Peat Marwick Hungerfords raised two other points. Firstly, it put the view that the Bill will not properly serve the Government's stated environmental motives in relation to substantially recycled pulp, including cotton linter, which will not qualify for exemption; and, secondly, it believes that the Bill is discriminatory on the basis that only selected goods made from recycled paper will qualify for the exemption. I noted in my initial quote from the Government's environment statement that it had undertaken to examine the practicability of extending the exemption to any other recycled paper products and, from my reading of the Peat Marwick Hungerfords correspondence, I guess it would be appropriate that that review look at those other two points I raised. Apart from that, I have no particular problems with the legislation relating to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2). </PARA>
<PARA> The two cognate Bills, which I said I would take together, relate to sales tax exemptions for computer programs. It is important to recognise the background of this legislation. There was a sales tax amendment Bill in 1988 which proposed that a number of changes be made to the sales tax treatment of computer software. In particular, the changes provided that the amendments were for the exemption of sales tax on single user programs, which were defined as customised software, and the taxation of multiple user programs, that is, packaged software, that were to be delivered electronically. However, on 22 December 1988 the Treasurer announced that those proposed amendments were being withdrawn. This came as the result of a substantial amount of pressure from the software industry, which basically argued that the measures in the Bill did not reflect what the industry had been led to believe in the 1988 Budget announcement that the legislation would contain. The industry specifically claimed that it would be difficult to determine accurately what portion of a program was customised or non-customised. </PARA>
<PARA> This gave way to a statement effective from the following day-23 December 1988-that all computer software would be exempt from sales tax but that the inputs to the production of software would remain subject to sales tax. Those inputs included computer hardware, discs, tapes and other materials used in producing software. This legislation has been drafted against that background and, therefore, more accurately reflects the original intention of the Government and seems to satisfy the interests of the computer software industry, which are now reflected in the Bill. It is on that basis that we welcome the changes that are being made in this Bill and the fact that they will give the exemption for software in the manner that was intended and is acceptable to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The other changes in that Bill are fairly minor and relate to a couple of deficiencies in the law and the effectiveness of the law, about which we have no particular comment. However, before leaving this debate I wish to make a few comments of a general nature about the Government's record in relation to wholesale sales tax. As I said at the outset, I do this foreshadowing the fact that I will be moving a second reading amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The key point is to recall the tax summit of 1985 and the thrust of the Treasurer, at that time, to introduce a broad-based consumption tax as an additional tax and as an essential element, as it was seen at that time, in what he was referring to as tax reform in this country. As we look at that situation today we need to recognise that not only were there widespread consumption taxes at that time-in particular, excise taxes on a range of products, the wholesale sales tax itself and, of course, customs duties and other things, which have a consumption tax equivalent-but also that, since then, there has been a veritable explosion in the revenue that is raised from wholesale sales tax in particular. We have also seen the indexation of the excise taxation on those products I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I focus particularly on the wholesale sales tax. During the life of this Government there has been something like a 201 per cent increase in the revenue from wholesale sales tax-well over three times the increase in the rate of inflation over that period and, therefore, a substantial increase in the real tax burden. The wholesale sales tax estimated for the 1989-90 financial year is expected to raise $10 1/2 billion, which is 11 1/2 per cent of total tax revenue. In 1982-83 wholesale sales tax raised about $3.5 billion. That was equivalent to about 8 1/2 per cent of total tax revenue. There has been a phenomenal increase in the more significant of the existing consumption taxes-the wholesale sales tax-of over 200 per cent during the life of this Government. As I said, that is more than three times the increase in the rate of inflation and roughly double the increase in consumer spending during that time. </PARA>
<PARA> It begs the question of how this has been achieved. If one looks at the changes to sales tax that have been announced, either in the Budget or the April and May statements, there is no way in which one can validate that sort of increase. It has been a phenomenal increase in taxation by stealth in a way that has been totally unaccounted for by the Government and in a way that has been ad hoc and anomalous in terms of its structure and effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The system of wholesale sales tax has three main rates: the low, or concessional, rate of 10 per cent; the middle rate of 20 per cent; and the top rate, sometimes called the luxury rate, of 30 per cent. One of the interesting things to recognise about the structure of the tax today is that between 80 per cent and 85 per cent of that tax is raised at the 20 per cent and 30 per cent rates, which is a substantial slug off a fairly narrow tax base for those goods. Most of that-71 per cent of it-comes from the 20 per cent tax rate category. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps more importantly, the way the tax has been increased has been quite regressive in the sense that from 1982-83 to 1989-90 there has been a significant increase in the proportion of revenue raised at the bottom level of the tax-supposed to be the concessional area of the tax-on goods that are necessities or the more important staples of life of average Australians. Nearly 13 per cent of total revenue of the wholesale sales tax is raised from that group compared with 8 1/2 per cent in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some major anomalies and inconsistencies in the structure of the tax, such that goods that appear similar-for example, toys, snack foods and some forms of confection-can fall into all three categories, I am informed, without any justification for the way it is done. Some goods, such as pornographic magazines, $1,000 ball gowns and items of that nature are exempt; whereas basic commodities, such as children's flavoured milk, orange juice and so on, are taxed in at least the 20 per cent category. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's record is pretty dismal from the point of view of taxation by stealth. I am told that he now boasts that he raises more revenue these days from indirect taxes than he would have if he had introduced his broad-based consumption tax in 1985, simply because of the way in which the tax base has been increased by stealth over the period to which I have referred. For that reason I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's economic irresponsibility in increasing sales tax revenue by 200% in an ad hoc and distortionary fashion since it came to power''. </PARA>

<PARA> The part of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 which interests me is that relating to paper recycling. The legislation seeks to exempt certain goods from sales tax if all the paper in the goods is made wholly from recycled paper. I would like to go through the history of paper. It is a very interesting product and I do not think that the world could do without it. Back in the third century BC the Egyptians made writing material from papyrus reed. In 610 paper making started in Japan following the introduction of books made from the mulberry tree by Buddhist monks. Moving on to 1798, a machine was invented in France which made paper in continuous rolls rather than individual sheets. In 1883, Carl Dahl, a German inventor, discovered that adding sodium sulphate to the soda process produced a strong pulp which became known as the kraft process. `Kraft' means strength in German. By the early 1900s kraft had become the world's most widespread pulping process. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the benefits of recycling are quite great. It is a sound conservation measure and it makes sound economic sense. American studies have shown that substituting secondary material for virgin resources in a production process can reduce energy use by between 23 and 74 per cent. It can cut air pollution by up to 74 per cent. It can cut water pollution by up to 35 per cent and water use by up to 58 per cent. All this has come about just by using recycled paper. In Australia the commercial harvest of wood is about 17 million--(Quorum formed). Before the quorum was called I was talking about recycling. We have only to look at the Opposition to see a great recycling effort. We have had Andrew Peacock and now John Howard is back again. Ian Sinclair, the right honourable member for New England, will be back soon. The Opposition continually recycles its members. I think it was Andrew Peacock who spoke about the revolving door. They certainly have one over there. They are in and out of it all the time. Opposition members are the greatest recyclers. Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd, APM Forests Pty Ltd, Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd (ANM) and Smorgon Consolidated Industries have got nothing on Opposition members-they are simply amazing. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to talk about forest resources-I am sure that is what everyone has come into the House to hear about. In Australia the commercial harvest of wood is about 17 million cubic metres; that is a lot of wood. Of this amount, approximately half is used for paper production, and only about five million cubic metres is exported, mainly to Japan in the form of woodchips. The three million cubic metres used in domestic production is derived from native forests and pine plantations in roughly equal amounts. Improved paper management and increased rates of recycling will undoubtedly preserve more forest resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Victoria has one of the fine Labor governments, of which there will be another in Queensland soon. The Victorian Minister for Planning and Environment, Tom Roper, has done a great deal in the area of recycling. He has put forward many suggestions. Victoria has a glut of used newsprint and paper, and the Minister has said that a fund should be established to subsidise the cost of export by the paper recycling industry, to promote research into new industries to find out how and by whom low-grade paper can be used and different methods to lessen newspaper waste, and to make a commitment to use newspapers containing a percentage of recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA> In June, St Paul's School, just outside my electorate in Frankston, wrote to me because it was concerned about the sales tax on recycled paper. I will read some of the letter:</PARA>
<PARA>This week we ordered a sample batch of Australian-made recycled paper. Regretfully it is more expensive than the paper made from new materials. You can imagine our disgust when we discovered that the Australian Government places a tax on this recycled material? . . . Please reassure us that the tax does not exist . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I wrote off straightaway, on behalf of the school, to the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) and got back this fine answer:</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you for your personal representations of 21 June . . . The Prime Minister made a major statement on the environment on 20 July 1989, containing a wide range of measures to protect and enhance the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>Among these was an announcement that the Government would introduce legislation to exempt from sales tax certain printing and writing paper, tissue and toilet paper and paper bags if they are wholly made out of recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I sent back that reply to St Paul's School. In October of this year, the school wrote to me again:</PARA>
<PARA>Following a phone call made to you-</PARA>
<PARA>by a certain person-</PARA>
<PARA>we have written to Mr Hawke suggesting that the price of pulp be increased so that wastepaper will become valuable enough to collect. </PARA>
<PARA>We see the situation as urgent because of the cancellation of collections of paper . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This has happened in Victoria. The firms that are collecting paper have a glut. Because the people of Victoria have been so proficient in collecting it and doing the right thing, they have all this wastepaper and cannot do anything with it, so they are no longer buying it. Some of the recycling firms are just taking it to the tip. This is a disgrace; it should not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will increase the opportunity for people to use recycled paper. Everyone in the Parliament should make a commitment to use it. I use recycled paper in my office. It is very nice quality paper, and if anyone wants some, I will send it to them. It was printed by Norman James, a printer in my electorate, who printed my name and address on the top, and it was supplied by Spicers Paper Ltd. It is called passport; it is acid free, of archival quality, and it is 70 per cent recycled and 30 per cent new fibre. The problem is that the paper comes from the United States of America; it is not made in Australia; it has to be imported. I am doing my bit to help some of the forests of South America, Canada, or wherever the United States gets its paper from. One way in which we can all help is to try to use recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA> One other thing I noticed is that the Age Pension News, a fine paper put out by the Government to inform pensioners of the benefits provided by the Government, says on the back, `First to use recycled paper' and tells us that it is 80 per cent recycled. However, it is not really recycled paper; it is the offcuts from the paper mill. The paper has not been sold to the general public, then collected and bought back and turned into paper. When the huge rolls of paper are being made, there are lots of offcuts, and that paper has been recycled, so there is a little bit of an anomaly. The people who drafted the legislation should look at the word `recycle'. This paper was not recycled; it was taken off the floor of the paper mill. It was recycled in the factory, but it was not sold to the public and brought back in. We should look closely at this to ensure that some operators do not abuse the sales tax privilege that we are giving them. </PARA>
<PARA> APM at Fairfield is one of the largest paper recyclers. It has a demand of about 1,000 tonnes per year. The biggest growth area should not be in paper such as this used in my office, but in envelopes. They are used only once, torn in half and thrown in the rubbish bin. Why do we need pure white paper for envelopes? I have here a sample of just some of the envelopes that arrived in my office today. These could all have been made from recycled paper. We could use thousands of tonnes of recycled paper just in the manufacture of envelopes and products that can be used only once and are thrown away. That is what the industry should be concentrating on. We should compel the envelope manufacturers to buy recycled paper, or give them some incentive. If they have no incentive to buy it, we should put an impost on them to force them to buy recycled paper for products that are used only once and thrown in the rubbish bin. </PARA>
<PARA> The week before last, APM brought into production 100 per cent recycled computer paper. We have all seen the reams of fanfold paper used for computers, and APM is now making 100 per cent recycled paper, which is much cheaper than new, virgin paper. That is an area where we can use the paper in this Parliament. We can create the market for the company and give it some fillip and an incentive to go ahead and produce more. Out of the 1,000 tonnes of recycled paper, government departments have purchased only about 40 tonnes. That is nothing. We should be the ones leading the way. We should buy as much recycled paper as possible. We should create the market and force the companies into using recycled paper that has turned into a glut. </PARA>

The honourable member has made million of dollars. How did he do that-on the stock exchange? We could create a market by asking for a particular product and saying we will use only that. It is simple.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another area of concern is newsprint. One of our biggest manufacturers of newsprint is ANM in Tasmania, which has been ripping the guts out of the forests for years. It has been taking saw-log quality timber and turning it into woodpulp for newspapers. The company does not have to do this. It should be doing what is done in the United States, where some States have a law saying that 40 to 50 per cent of all newspapers must be recycled paper. The company will not do this because it has been getting cheap pulp from Tasmania for years. We should be trying to slow that down, and ensuring that our biggest newsprint users use a certain percentage of recycled paper. That is the way to create a market; it is simple. ANM has been doing it. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of new technology has come into operation in the past five years for deinking and removing ink and contaminates from paper. We should do more of this sort of thing, and the Government can lead the way. We can do it by showing exactly what uses can be made of it. We can put legislation into effect, forcing newspapers to use a certain percentage of recycled paper. Why should we chop up newly grown trees for pulp? This is just sheer waste. There has been open slather in places such as Tasmania. In the United States there is speculation that the Federal Government will introduce a mandatory recycling Bill following the proposed introduction of a controversial Bill by Senator Max Baucus, Chairman of the Hazardous Waste and Toxic Substances Control Sub-committee. This speculation is based on an article which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Lack of new landfill space due to fear of polluting ground water is the motivating factor for legislation. Senator Baucus estimates that the USA generates 12 bn t/y of solid and hazardous waste, 10 per cent of which is recycled and 85 per cent goes to 6,000 municipal landfills. Nearly 2,000 of these will be full in five to seven years and nearly 3,000 in ten years. During the last ten years over 12,000 landfills have closed and fewer than 1,000 new ones opened. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the sort of waste that is generated in the United States. Luckily, Australia does not have that amount of waste and we do not have to dispose of our newsprint in that way. An official report entitled Waste Paper-World Trade and Investment in a Growth Industry was produced in 1989. There is a growth industry; there is a window of opportunity to set up another mill to process waste paper. The report mentions that Australia recovered 605,000 tonnes in 1982 and 686,000 tonnes in 1987. There is a guesstimate that in 1992 it will be 800,000 tonnes. I believe that that figure will be exceeded greatly because of the fact that people are becoming more conscious and concerned about their forests. We can legislate in this House to make sure that newsprint companies use recycled paper and that envelopes and many other products are made out of recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, it is important that we get the word `recycled' right. We do not want shifty companies actually picking up new paper, throwing in a few strands of old paper, saying that it has been recycled and getting the benefits of the tax break that the Government is giving them. I am very pleased that our Government has introduced this well overdue legislation which will make certain that future generations have the opportunity to enjoy large forests in Tasmania. It will ensure that trees are not chopped down, manufactured into paper and used in newspapers which carry stories of scandals, thus making a profit for some overseas investors. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must admit that I sat with some difficulty through the speech that I have just heard from the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth). Some of the so-called facts that he gave us during his contribution were so far off beam that I now intend to take considerably more time than I had intended in order to correct his misstatements to the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) could be described only as a sop to the conservation movement. It is nothing more than an exercise by the present Government to try to curry some favour with the conservation movement because it realises that it is in the lead-up to a Federal election. The substance of this Bill does not add anything to the environmental impact of what it is designed to achieve. I will talk about the sales tax implications a little bit later on, but I want, firstly, to address myself to the matters raised by the honourable member for Dunkley. </PARA>
<PARA> The major part of this Bill is supposedly designed to encourage the recycling of paper products. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) said that the proposal was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his environment statement of 20 July 1989. Clearly, the Government sees this proposal as part of its environmental package as announced by the Prime Minister in July. One can only conclude from that that this Bill is part of the environmental proposals that will be put to the conservation movement and to the Australian electorate and not specifically part of its sales tax proposals. The Minister in his second reading speech further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will ensure that certain paper products are exempt from sales tax, if all the paper in the goods has been manufactured from recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members should just think about that-`if all the paper in the goods has been manufactured from recycled paper'. What goods are wholly manufactured from recycled paper? The Government will give a sales tax exemption to those who produce egg cartons. There will also be a sales tax exemption on household insulation. Do we have household insulation in Parliament House? What else is wholly manufactured from recycled paper? I am darned if I can think of anything. At present 50 per cent of all the paper manufactured in Australia is recycled. This is not new. It is not accurate to say that the Age Pension News can be produced from recycled paper. That is rubbish. If any honourable members have been into a paper manufacturing plant, as I have been because I worked in one for six years, they would know that the off-cuts from the manufacturing process automatically go back into the pulp production and are recycled along with all the new pulp being introduced in the process. To say that the product is being manufactured from recycled paper is absolute rubbish; it does not happen. The 50 per cent of Australian paper being recycled at the moment goes into the ordinary process of pulp production along with the woodchips and all the other component products. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dunkley said, `What about newspapers? Why don't we recycle them?'. We simply do. They do not go back to Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd because of the cost of transport. We have a whole range of charitable organisations which will collect newspapers. I guarantee that there are organisations in the honourable member for Dunkley's electorate, such as the Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul, which collect newspapers for recycling. The reason more recycled paper is not collected and put back into the manufacturing process is the cost of transport to get it from the point of collection back to the point of manufacture. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind my friends on the other side of the House that that brings into question not the capacity or the preparedness of the Australian people to put that paper back into recycling or of the manufacturers to use it, but the cost of transport. I invite my friends on the other side of the House to address their minds to this vexed question of the cost of transport in Australia because that more than sales tax or any other single factor is what is inhibiting the recycling of many of our products, and not just paper. A number of organisations in Tasmania collect not only newsprint but also a whole range of other products which are not saleable because the cost of transport back to the point of manufacture or re-use is greater than the value of the material itself. Therefore, rather than having that material going back into a recycled process, it usually ends up on the tip. Unfortunately that happens around many parts of Australia. I invite my friends on the other side of the House to concentrate their minds on the cost of transport in Australia, rather than giving us some of the spurious arguments that have been spelled out so far in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that in many outlying areas of Australia charitable organisations collecting paper and other types of material would dearly love to earn some dollars by having it directed back into a recycled manufacturing process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to raise a very serious matter brought to my attention by constituents of mine from the Shoalhaven district. These constituents came to me with a strong sense of outrage and annoyance at the behaviour of one of their colleagues who in their view was, to put it bluntly, `ripping the system off'. The charges laid by these people refer to two matters involving one person. Firstly, the charges made by these people relate to money paid by the local Jerringa Aboriginal Land Council to a Ms Delia Lowe. Ms Lowe has become a prominent member of the Aboriginal community, particularly in recent times, speaking on occasions on behalf of members of the Aboriginal community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My constituents claim that a sum of $43,508.44 has been paid to Delia Lowe as salary from the funds of the Land Council without proper authorisation. Claims are also made that, at the annual general meeting of the Jerringa Local Land Council, no audited books were available. At a meeting held a fortnight later, still no books were made available. Despite members at the meeting having called for another meeting to provide a further opportunity for the books to be presented, nothing has happened. Members of the Land Council were becoming increasingly concerned that mismanagement or even fraud may have been taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, my constituents have claimed that Delia Lowe, whilst drawing more than $43,000 salary from the Land Council, was also claiming an unemployment benefit, under another name. They claim that this unemployment benefit was being drawn under the name of Wellington. To substantiate their claims, my constituents have provided copies of pay sheets, and various letters from accounting authorities and members of the Land Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Reading these documents would cause any reasonable person to be very concerned. My constituents have brought these details to me out of frustration that money paid by the Government for the benefit of the Aboriginal community was being used by a small group of people for their own benefit and ultimately to the disadvantage of other Aborigines specifically and indeed taxpayers generally. I raise these matters in the House tonight in light of the seriousness of these well documented claims and ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) to investigate them, so that my constituents can be satisfied that the right thing can be done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight, I wish to support a call for the Criminal Justice Commission to investigate a Mr Stan Lohse, an alderman on the Bundaberg City Council. Mr Lohse has betrayed the trust placed in him by his fellow aldermen, having already been rejected by the people at the council elections. One of the quirks in the Queensland local government elections, once a resignation of an alderman is announced or arranged, is that the council can select anyone it chooses. The resignation in Bundaberg was arranged and Ken Aaron resigned. Lohse had won the jackpot. Not only was he able to get back on the council but also he was able to get back on the town planning committee. This was the same as putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Lohse has a complete inability to keep his private affairs separate from his public affairs. While he was town planning chairman, he voted in committee on a council proposal affecting a site on the corner of Barolin and Woongarra streets in Bundaberg. Lohse and his family are shareholders in the building on behalf of Bundaberg High Rise Developments. The Lohse decision to support his own company saved the company having to spend upwards of $1m in providing an underground car park. </PARA>
<PARA> As town planning chairman, Lohse pushed through a change to the town plan which enabled him, free of charge and without any of the inconveniences associated with rezoning applications, to have at least two pieces of his land rezoned. This meant that Lohse's land abutting the rifle range site changed from `local business' to `special commercial'. As well, a piece of land in Woondoona Street was rezoned from non-urban to `central business B'. At no time did Lohse declare his pecuniary interest in these blocks, in clear defiance of the Local Government Act. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the strategic town plan, the Bundaberg rifle range site was zoned `industrial' with the town planner, Thompson, assuring Commonwealth valuers that any application other than industrial would be most unlikely to succeed. In fact, this was the position put to the Governor-in-Council when the strategic town plan was gazetted by the Queensland Government on 26 November 1988. At around the same time, Thompson and members of the town planning committee were meeting with developers actively seeking a possible rezoning to residential. The developers purchased the site, hoping they might secure a higher usage for the land. That speculation becomes a near certainly when someone like Lohse is working for one. </PARA>
<PARA> On 1 October 1988, Lohse told the Bundaberg News Mail that he had no association with the Presslers, the developers. This is untrue. Lohse and the Presslers are co-backers in Bundaberg High Rise Developments. They have also both been directors of the Wide Bay Capricorn Building Society. It comes as no surprise, then, that Lohse moved the amendment to disregard the strategic town plan and gave his mate a windfall gain. His nearby property, being commercial, will also benefit from having a residential estate nearby. </PARA>
<PARA> On a related issue, in September 1985 all councils were instructed to have a headworks policy. Lohse, as town planning chairman, ignored the request and Bundaberg did not have such a policy until 1989. In the interim, Bundaberg High Rise Developments was constructed free of headworks charges. When independent consultants suggested a policy, it suggested a figure of $2,279 a lot. On 20 March 1989, the town planning committee recommended a charge of $980 a lot. On the same day, council reviewed an application to rezone the rifle range. </PARA>
<PARA> On 20 April 1989, council, in a general meeting, knocked back the headworks charge on a motion moved by Lohse and set a charge of $654. This lesser figure was adopted. The new rifle range development is a proposed 900 allotments. The net saving on this development between the council figure and the Lohse figure is over $280,000. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a clear pattern of dishonesty in dealing with the people of Bundaberg and the Commonwealth. Loshe has misused his position and should be investigated by the Criminal Justice Commission. He is nothing more than a puppeteer, pulling the strings for developers and using the public purse to underwrite it. He is the Dr Strangelove of Bundaberg. He is unfit to continue in his non-elected position as an alderman and has betrayed the people of Bundaberg. Unwittingly, the ratepayers of Bundaberg have subsidised a bunch of land sharks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 August the Treasurer (Mr Keating), in his Budget Speech, announced a draconian measure in relation to the company tax system. I refer to the requirement that companies must pay 85 per cent of their company tax within 15 days of the end of their income year. This is to replace the quarterly payments that apply now. The Government, of course, is desperate to get every tax dollar it can to fund the profligate spending programs it has put in place over the last six years. This move is calculated to rein in another $885m for Government coffers in the first year and to save the Government debt interest payments of about $330m per year. Business will pay for this, of course, and the cost to it will be quite substantial. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table demonstrating this.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This table shows calculations made for a company paying tax on a $10m profit, that is, at 39c in the dollar. That comes to $3.9m. Under the old arrangements, companies would have paid tax on the fifteenth day of August, November and February, with the remainder in May. Under the new arrangements, they must pay 85 per cent by 15 July and the remaining 15 per cent by 15 March. Obviously, the new arrangements are a cost to the company. To maintain the same cash flow as before, the company will now have to borrow money and, if done at the June 1989 bank overdraft rate of 19.75 per cent, the calculations in this table show that the company would have to pay an extra $276,000 in interest. That amounts to a 14.13 per cent increase on its old tax bill of $3.9m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a whole host of related problems for companies caught under these new provisions. For example, it is totally unrealistic for many companies to be able to calculate what their liabilities will be by day 15, bearing in mind that penalties apply if they understate their situation by more than 10 per cent. Cash flow problems will be critical with many companies, too, because of the large lump sum payments required. Indeed, over 50 per cent of them would have to borrow, at least to some extent, to meet that payment. Such borrowings are not tax deductible. A number of companies will be forced out of business because they have already borrowed to the limit. Unemployment will obviously increase as a result. Many companies will cut their investment, too, due to less cash in hand-hardly an action that we need to get the economy out of the abysmal mess it is in at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government may claim that the reduction in the company tax rate from 49 per cent to 39 per cent will more than compensate for this new imposition. Not so. An excellent letter published on 26 October in the Australian Financial Review by T. R. Chambers, the Chief Executive of the Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation of Australia, shows that a company paying $100,000 tax under the old 49 per cent level and borrowing to pay this amount over four quarters, will be penalised 43 per cent on interest payments on its borrowings under the new 39 per cent level with the tax payments brought forward. That sounds quite amazing, but I have had it run through the library computer and those figures are correct. Coincidentally enough, there is also a letter in today's Australian Financial Review from a Hans Kunnen of Chippendale. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>Well over $7 billion is expected to flow out of the cash system in the weeks following mid-July 1990 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I refer also to another excellent letter from a Mrs Marg Davey, Director of Davco Fabrications and Engineering of Ballarat West, Victoria. The letter highlights the difficulties that this disastrous tax will bring to companies if it is implemented. Indeed, the whole range of tax changes to companies is highly punitive, and this 85 per cent requirement in the first 15 days is particularly so. It has been imposed in a completely thoughtless manner and without consultation, in the Treasurer's usual arrogant fashion. If he does not wish to financially bludgeon many struggling companies in Australia out of existence, he would do well to re-examine and revise his original position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the encouraging aspects of my parliamentary work during the past nine years that I have been the member for La Trobe, which includes 6 1/2 years as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, has been the increasing awareness of young Australians of the need to protect and conserve our natural environment. Australia is a continent which contains great natural beauty in its forests, rivers, lakes, mountains and deserts, but during the past 200 years of predominantly European settlement we have degraded and polluted our environment to virtually a crisis point. During 40,000 years of Aboriginal settlement the Aboriginal people lived as one with their land; regretfully, we are still learning how to balance the needs of twentieth century civilisation with the needs of the Australian flora and fauna which, together with our unique geography, have made Australia such an attractive and exciting country in which to live.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Kids for Kakadu was formed by a group of children led by Louisa Vaughan-Willoughby of Croydon, which is close to my electorate. Louisa is a nine-year-old resident of the group which was formed to save the environment of Kakadu National Park after Louisa had seen a television program about a proposed release of radioactive water into the park from the Ranger uranium mine. On Wednesday, 20 September, Louisa and her 13-year-old friend, Miranda Jamieson, presented me with petitions containing the names of 3,362 children who were calling on the Speaker and the House of Representatives to prevent the release of radioactive matter into Kakadu National Park from the Ranger uranium mine as it would cause great danger to Kakadu wildlife and possible human life. I presented the petitions to the Table Office, and the petition was read in the House of Representatives on the day of sitting on Thursday, 26 October. </PARA>
<PARA> It was with pleasure that I was able to assure Louisa and Miranda that a previous request by the Ranger uranium mine to release treated water into the Magela Creek, which flows into the park, had not been approved by the responsible Minister on behalf of the Federal Government. Indeed, the House will be aware that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation tabled a report on the Ranger uranium water management system. In that report the Committee commented:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that there are many areas of the Company's operations which warrant criticism. The Committee agrees with the Northern Land Council and the Northern Territory Environment Centre and others that the number of failures relating to the operation of the water management system is alarming. The Committee cannot accept that a Company which is located within an area of significant environmental value, claims to be as efficient as any operation in the world and claims to be one of the most regulated in the world, should have allowed the number of incidents to have occurred as have been reported in the annual reports of the Office of the supervising Scientist. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also commented:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that ideally the water management system should be based on non-release of contaminants and that this system be maintained until it is shown that releases of contaminated water have to be made. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee finally concluded that it has not been established that release of restricted release zone water to the Magela need be made. I commend Louisa Vaughan-Willoughby on her initiative in organising the petitions. I also take the opportunity in this speech to congratulate the Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) and the Federal Labor Government for their decision to put into Kakadu National Park the entire catchment area of the South Alligator River except for that exploration strip where mining work has been carried out-mainly at Coronation Hill and El Sherana. Hopefully, when the economic and environmental considerations, including Aboriginal rights, are weighed up it will be decided that mining will not take place at the Coronation Hill and El Sherana mine exploration sites, thus ensuring that the whole park will be totally protected for all time from the destructiveness of mining operations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in the House we were informed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that the pilots strike was all over. The Dateline News Digest states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>As the pilots row entered what most people had thought was its 12th week, Prime Minister Bob Hawke today declared it all over. </PARA>
<PARA>This must join that group of statements which the Prime Minister has made in the past and which are now encapsulated in history forever. There was his statement that no child would live in poverty by 1990 and there was the time when he said that he did not really mean to offend all the veterans and pensioners in Australia by collectively calling them `silly old buggers'. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I travelled from Adelaide with my Government colleague the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil). Seat occupancy rate estimates range from 25 per cent by the pilots, to 60 per cent by Government Ministers, to 80 per cent by the airlines. I was certainly excited at the prospect of experiencing my first Hercules flight. I have had several trips in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) planes and as a courtesy I always thank the crew for what they are doing. They are excellent ambassadors in very difficult times. My beef is not really with the Government, nor is it with the pilots or the airlines; but the blame has to be levelled at someone. Our image is being tarnished. I want to focus specifically on the matter of productivity, on attention to detail, and on the question of whether we are fit for the job. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hercules that I was on this morning contained 80 men and women. That plane has done a lot of air time around Australia. There was a delightful crew in khaki jumpsuits, attempting to bring a degree of sanity to a very difficult job-a job that they carry out with a great degree of excellence. The passengers included business men and women, sporting people going home to Melbourne, young lovers eloping and a family group going to Melbourne to catch an international flight home to Rome. They had to put up with the noise, the discomfort and the cramped seating. There was fear on some of the women's faces as the craft was trimmed, as several hundred PSI of hydraulic oil and compressed air was pumped through exposed copper and steel piping to control the craft. Certainly, their fears were allayed by an excellent crew, who set about demonstrating what the plane was doing. It was difficult for business women in straight skirts, for example, to sit with any comfort or dignity. After an hour and a half on the Hercules I now know why our Army personnel are transported on manoeuvres in Hercules planes: it is because when they are discharged from the bowels of the plane they would be angry enough to fight anyone. The Hercules is not the best plane for comfort. </PARA>
<PARA> Several hours later I took my second trip on a prop-jet Hawker de Havilland, a surveillance training plane-again in similar conditions. The passengers included business men and women coming to Canberra. One woman, for example, was coming here to the Australian National University to give lectures. Whoever should take the blame, whether it be the pilots, the Government or the airlines, the fact is that our image in relation to interstate, intrastate and international air travel has become a joke. The Grand Prix starts in Adelaide this weekend. The Adelaide Convention Centre, for example, is losing business due to the airlines dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect on the hospitality industry has been well documented over the past 81 days, and this relates also to taxi drivers and the people who supply food and services. I am very pleased to support the Prime Minister's declaration to Australia that the dispute is all over and that all the planes can get back into service. I do not want any misunderstanding: my beef is not with the RAAF, as it has done a magnificent job. However, our image has certainly suffered as regards transporting men and women around Australia. This has been undertaken in difficult circumstances, and I might add that people have to pay expensive fares. This certainly leaves a lot to be desired, and if the dispute is really over, as the Prime Minister has declared, Australia can start to breathe again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week a group of people came to see me at my Queanbeyan office asking me to support the one world declaration. I was pleased to do that. In fact, it may take two adjournment speeches to say what I would like to say about the one world declaration. These people quite rightly pointed out that the earth, air, ocean, soils and forests on which our lives depend are being seriously degraded and that 800 million people live in absolute poverty. They also pointed out that over-consumption, as well as poverty, can threaten our earth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The people who visited me mentioned how we are targeting aid to developing countries. There is every temptation for a government to export our poverty. It is very easy and very tempting for a country to target aid with the aim of increasing exports-an aim which can be self-defeating if all it does is increase demand in a poor country for our products. We are then exporting poverty, not removing it. Our first aim is to target aid so that it is better directed, so that we do not export our poverty and so that we focus on the actual needs of a country. </PARA>
<PARA> Needs can also be met by our support in international forums. It is quite fitting that the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) is in the House at the moment. With me and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) he attended as a delegate the South Pacific Conference held in Guam, near Micronesia, fairly recently. There the honourable member mentioned the important issue of food and materials to the island nations and to our own nation. I mentioned the issue of drift gill net fishing. I drew the attention of the conference to this devastating practice of one or two nations who harvest fish using nets up to 60 kilometres long and 15 metres deep. This removes from the sea all types of species, some of which are endangered. They are quite indiscriminate in the way they harvest not only fish but also some sea mammals and birdlife which feed on the fish as they gather in the nets. It has been said that up to half the fish and living creatures that get caught in the nets die and fall from the nets and are not harvested. It is not a particularly efficient method of harvesting on a percentage basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Fish have no fences to contain them, so this practice can affect our fishing industry as well. Therefore, we were included in the final motion, which called for a ban on the practice in our South Pacific waters. Worse than the effect on Australia is the way in which the practice affects the subsistence of the many island nations who are our neighbours. It was great to see the nations coming together to call for a ban. The United States, France and the United Kingdom finished up supporting the ban in our South Pacific region. This is a clear message to other countries, particularly Japan and Taiwan, to desist from the drift gill net fishing practice which they have been indulging in. </PARA>
<PARA> The conference also raised other important matters, including the need to restore Australian aid to 0.5 per cent of gross national product by 1992 and to work for a fair international economic system. I believe that we can do that. If we target the aid correctly, then it will be well spent. We need to take that recommendation seriously. Those who came to see me want aid to promote human rights in other countries, including fair and just wages. Many problems in such countries as Brazil, Malaysia and the Philippines are created by people overharvesting such products as timber simply because they do not have a fair and just wage. There is plenty for us to do. We also need to develop a code of conduct for Australian businesses investing in countries where serious human rights abuses occur. We need to develop policies for Australia's representatives in world banking and monetary funds and the Asia Development Bank. We need to give top priority to fighting poverty and to protecting the environment. I hope to cover other important issues in a later speech before this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) for speaking about such important matters and for putting in such a great effort at the South Pacific Conference which I also had the privilege of attending. He particularly referred to a motion relating to the pelagic gill nets that are used. Those nets are referred to as the `wall of death'. As he said, they are 60 kilometres long and 50 feet deep. They unnecessarily destroy an immense amount of sea life, including whales and dolphins. It was horrifying to see the videos. I support what the honourable member said tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This morning and last night some honourable senators and members had the privilege of attending the Fourth National Prayer Breakfast. Last night we had a reception and preliminary meeting of the churches of Canberra. I think the President of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship, the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards), will speak on that matter at a later date. In spite of the pilots strike we had a breakfast this morning which almost 500 people attended. It was a fine meeting. The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) spoke very powerfully and challengingly. It was good to hear him thanked by an honourable senator from the other side, Senator Flo Bjelke-Petersen. She complimented him on his speech. Those of us who had the privilege of being there were very impressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night, a Supreme Court judge, His Honour Mr Justice Amet, spoke very challengingly on the difficulties that are facing the Papua New Guinea Parliament. At lunch time today we were very capably and feelingly addressed by the President of Vanuatu, His Excellency Mr Fred Timakata. The foundation Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Sir Peter Kenilorea, also challenged us. It was quite a moving experience to hear a man of that calibre from a country such as Vanuatu with over 80 islands. The people living on all those islands are brought together. The meeting of the churches, and the support of the churches in those countries, has been a great boon to them. It has certainly helped them with their faith. </PARA>
<PARA> At that meeting a well known specialist physician who is part of the Christian Medical Fellowship, Dr Claire Isbister, gave me the new updated pamphlet that the Christian medical doctors of Australia have put out on the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). It is called `The Medical Facts About AIDS: The Safe Alternative'. It gives a very straight and clear-cut commentary in the form of questions and answers on the very serious situation that confronts this country and other countries regarding AIDS. One of the questions asked is:</PARA>
<PARA>How common is it?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer is:</PARA>
<PARA>Since the first case of fully developed AIDS was reported in Australia in July 1982, 1,451 cases have been diagnosed of which 762 have died. 62.8 per cent of cases have been reported from New South Wales and 21.3 per cent of cases from Victoria. The AIDS manual 1988 predicts that by 1991 there will be 5,000 cases and 3,500 deaths. The United States prediction is that by 1990 the United States will have 270,000 cases with 179,000 deaths. </PARA>
<PARA>It also states in answer to that question:</PARA>
<PARA>As blood testing for antibodies is voluntary in Australia, no figures are available for the actual number of people who have become infected, but experts estimate that there could be up to 90,000. </PARA>
<PARA>I remember hearing a specialist doctor speak on this subject. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) All pharmacists at the Repatriation hospitals are employed in the Australian Public Service Science classification structure. Within this structure the following standards apply covering the rates of pay for pharmacists:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) minimum hourly rate $11.75;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ4">Mr West</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) it is the Government's view that Members of the House of Representatives should have the capacity to communicate with each of their constituents. To achieve this outcome the postage entitlement has been supplemented by the equivalent cost of sending a letter each year, calculated on the bulk mailing rate, to each constituent in an average sized electoral Division.</PARA>
<PARA> Further it is the Government's view that the postage entitlement is more properly seen as an office facility to be determined by the Government, rather than an entitlement related to remuneration to be referred to the Remuneration Tribunal. The postage facility, in common with other office facilities, does not take the form of an allowance or as an addition to the salary of members of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) as I advised all Senators and Members on 26 September 1989, the entitlement may be used only for parliamentary or electorate business which precludes it being used for either party business or commercial purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) funds for the increase in the postal entitlement have been included in Appropriation Bill (No. 1). Interim funds for postage are drawn from appropriations made to my Department by the Supply Bills passed by the Parliament in the last Session, in order to meet the cost of the entitlements of Senators and Members pending the passage of the Appropriation Bills. In line with usual practice, if additional funds are required to meet the cost of Senators' and Members' entitlements, they will be sought from the Advance to the Minister for Finance.</PARA>
