<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Treasurer whether the statement by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support in the House last week that he expected the implicit price deflator to `come in at around 10 per cent, maybe a little below' is a revised Government forecast for inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of what the Minister said. But I am aware of what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said last week when looking at the non-farm product deflator. He failed either to understand or to imply that export prices, which are part and parcel of the implicit price deflator for gross non-farm product, were rising at a rate of 8.9 per cent. He was telling the world-anyone who wanted to listen-that, basically, we had the implicit price deflator in the national accounts at 8.9 per cent and, therefore, inflation was rising. One would have thought that commonsense should have told both him and the honourable member for Wentworth that, given that generally Australians do not consume exports, the more accurate reflection of prices was an expenditure deflator. The non-farm product deflator, of course, was boosted by these higher export prices whereas the private consumption deflator rose by 1.5 per cent to be 7.1 per cent higher than a year earlier. But the broadest price deflator of what people actually spend in the economy-that is, the deflator for gross national expenditure-rose by 0.9 per cent in the quarter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quoting these figures from the national accounts. This rose from 0.9 per cent in the quarter to be 6 per cent higher than a year earlier. So on the broadest deflator, that is the deflator for gross national expenditure, inflation was rising by 6 per cent and, on the private consumption deflator, by 7.1 per cent, which is about where the Government said inflation would be but for the distortion caused by housing prices in the consumer price index (CPI). Interestingly, the private consumption deflator rose by 1.5 per cent in that quarter, the very same quarter when we had a 2.1 per cent rise in the CPI, which only demonstrates yet again that there was a huge distortion because of the measurement of mortgage costs under that methodology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the punch line is that the shadow Treasurer and shadow finance Minister did not understand that the measure of inflation was better provided by a reference to those expenditure and consumption deflators; rather, they chose the implicit price deflator, which includes exports. Apparently they are quite happy to mislead the public that inflation is running at 8.9 per cent when they understand that that increase is a result of the increase in export prices, which are part of the non-farm implicit price deflator. Before honourable members opposite start asking any more questions about the inflation rate they should understand what the measures are.</PARA>

<TITLE>GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE: TRADE NEGOTIATIONS</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="1227" SPEAKER="Courtice Mr B.W." NAMEID="UF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HINKLER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UF4">Mr COURTICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Prime Minister advise the House of the outcome of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) trade negotiations in Geneva over the past few days, particularly as they relate to agriculture?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1227" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I am very pleased to inform the House-I know that it will be of interest to all honourable members, irrespective of their political affiliations-that a major breakthrough in multilateral trade negotiations occurred in Geneva over the weekend. The log jam in negotiations that developed in Montreal in December and the mid-term review has been broken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On agriculture, in essence the GATT parties have accepted all the major elements of the Cairns Group proposal that I tabled in Geneva on behalf of the Cairns Group in October 1987. They are: first, a commitment to long term liberalisation of world agricultural markets to begin in 1991, the year after the conclusion of the GATT talks; second, until that reform process starts, an immediate freeze on farm subsidies and at least the maintenance of market access at existing levels; third and finally, a commitment to reduce farm support and protection levels in 1990-that is, before the long term reform process gets under way.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of those negotiations the basis is laid for Australian farmers to look forward to improved rural returns and a massive change for the better over the debilitating effects that they have suffered from the European Economic Community (EEC)-United States agricultural subsidy war and the unfair trade barriers that have been associated with that situation in those countries and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA> A great deal of credit for this breakthrough goes to the 14 countries that constitute the Cairns Group of fair traders. There is no question-it is accepted now as a fact of international life-that the Cairns Group has acted as a powerful third voice in the GATT agricultural trade negotiations and it has succeeded in breaking the deadlock that has existed between the EEC and the United States over the past several years. It should be a matter of great pride to all Australians that Australia has chaired the Cairns Group from its inception. In that respect I specifically pay tribute to two Ministers: first, the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy). He and his officials have worked tirelessly towards achieving this breakthrough. I can say, from the communications I have received from around the world, that it is quite clear that the personal dealings of Minister Duffy, with other trade Ministers, have been instrumental in securing such a good outcome. We are indebted to the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;His cup floweth over. He has had this breakthrough this weekend and, after the weekend, Essendon is still on top. It is appropriate that, as well as properly paying tribute to Minister Duffy, I-I hope, again, that I speak for the whole House-pay tribute to the former trade Minister, the present Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), whose initiative it was to establish the Cairns Group in the first place. The outcome of this weekend is a tribute to both Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, as you know, and as I think all Australians are aware, the Government has been unrelenting in its pursuit, through all available forums, of a freer and fairer international agricultural trading system. While we need to remain diligent in ensuring that the principles of this last weekend in Geneva are transformed into practice, I believe there is no doubt that we can say, as a result of this weekend's breakthrough, that there is now considerable room for optimism for the future of efficient agricultural producers in general, and most particularly for Australian farmers.</PARA>

<TITLE>HOME LOAN INTEREST RATES</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="1228" SPEAKER="Peacock The Hon A.S." NAMEID="MI4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="KOOYONG">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. I remind him that the latest report on home loan affordability shows that the average Australian home loan repayment increased by $206 a month between December 1987 and December 1988. I ask him: What is his estimate of the impact of the rise in mortgage interest rates since December 1988 on home loan affordability?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1228" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The affordability index is based around a median price, and in the first home owners market home prices are mostly well below the median. To that extent the index is not particularly an indication of the costs in terms of affordability to first home owners; it is at best a guide. The ratio is not a guide to the situation of those with existing home loans because they are not adversely affected by house prices, having already bought a home. These indexes always rise whenever house prices rise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have often said in the House and will repeat, the great problem that new home buyers face is not just the increase in home loan interest rates, which is now of a couple of percentage points, but the fact that the mortgage is so much higher because of higher house prices. The reason we have higher house prices is in the main a lack of housing supply. That is the issue which the Government addressed at the housing conference with the Premiers and this is why the States have the major role to play in adding to the supply of housing. While higher interest rates certainly impose a burden on new home buyers and those changing homes, the greatest burden is applied by the inflation of house prices, the actual size of the mortgage, and that is a consequence of a failure of the States to complement supply.</PARA>
<PARA> On the note of housing prices, I saw today in the Sydney Daily Telegraph a comment by the chief economist of Citibank Ltd, one of the most irresponsible comments in recent times about interest rates for housing. This person was predicting that in the next day or two housing interest rates would go to 18 per cent. I can only say that if the price the community has to pay for having banks put their names before the public is for all these hired economists to make the most outrageous, inflated estimates of interest rates, the more responsible institutions, particularly the Commonwealth Bank and Westpac Banking Corporation, which have given indications of the real impact of current commercial rates on interest rates, have given a much better guide over time than some of the more irresponsible comments such as the one reported today.</PARA>
<PARA> None of this is helped by members of the Opposition, who not only do not have a housing policy but do not even have an economic policy or a fiscal policy. One day they are going to have a larger Budget surplus and the next day less; one day they are asking questions about interest rates and housing affordability, and the next day one of their spokesmen, mainly the shadow finance spokesman, is urging higher interest rates to slow down economic activity. All this means that the community can take no guide from members of the Opposition as to where they stand on fiscal policy, monetary policy or housing. I simply conclude with the point that in 1981, under the then treasurership of Mr Howard, we saw this affordability index rise. What happened then was that we saw 22 per cent interest rates in commercial rates. Current rates have not reached these levels yet, and will not.</PARA>

Do the statistics on road crashes quoted in this advertisement match those of the Federal Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the question raised by the honourable member for McMillan. That particular advertisement displays some of the more scurrilous and irresponsible types of statements that have been made by the AAA and some of its State affiliates. It has based the figures that it has given in that advertisement on some evidence that suggests that about 30 per cent of all road crashes are to some extent attributable to environmental factors, and environmental factors, of course, include the conditions of the roads. But the same type of analysis also suggests that only about 4 per cent of all road crashes are attributable mainly to environmental factors. The AAA has attempted to translate those figures to the suggestion that about one-third of all road fatalities are related to environmental factors. The figures, of course, cannot be compared in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I emphasise as well that the Opposition also has been pursuing questions of this kind. We have had, for example, occasions when Senator Stone has indicated that the amount of funding going to roads should be reduced by $100m. We have had suggestions and estimates from the Opposition's spokesman. I know that one of his State colleagues suggested that he had given an undertaking to increase the level of funding for roads by $600m. I know that the Leader of the Opposition has indicated that the Opposition has no policy. The honourable member for Deakin, when he was the spokesman, said-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Speaker, the fact that those contradictions exist has not been lost on the AAA. Bruce Lunn, the Secretary-General of the Australian Automobile Association, said just a few days ago when referring to criticism by the Opposition:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Such criticism amounted to nothing more than political pointscoring when the Coalition was not prepared to give a commitment on the level of funding it would provide to roads.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>But the time has come for the Opposition to put its money where its mouth is instead of merely jumping on the road funding bandwagon.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the type of response which is being increasingly urged by the community generally. The Government's position is to index the amount of money going into road funding to make sure that the $1.2 billion this year will be maintained in real terms for at least the next three years, the first three years of this program. That makes it perfectly clear that the Federal Government is committed to maintaining the level of funding for roads right across Australia in all categories. We have also guaranteed to maintain the level of funding for local roads. When the honourable member for Deakin was Opposition spokesman in this area he promised to cut out funding for local roads. The present spokesman for the Opposition on transport, the honourable member for Richmond, has not repudiated that threat that was made against 850 local government centres right across Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Treasurer recall the words of the former Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Gellibrand, who told the 1987 Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress that failure to keep Australian wage rises in line with those of our overseas competitors would place us in `dire economic peril'? Is the Treasurer aware that we now have the fastest rate of growth in unit labour costs of any Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country, with the possible exception of Sweden? Is he also aware that we also now have the highest rate of inflation of any major industrialised country? I also ask the Treasurer whether he is aware that the annual growth in unit labour costs in Australia since he became Treasurer has been, on average, 46 per cent faster than for the OECD as a whole?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am also aware that unit labour cost declines are larger in Australia than in any other OECD country. I am also aware that inflation is rising around the world. In the British Budget the forecast is for inflation to peak at 8.6 per cent. Our inflation trajectory is still declining, albeit not as fast as we would like. Why did inflation rise from the 5 per cent this Government succeeded in getting it to, after the previous Government left it at 11 per cent, to the 5.1 per cent it was for the year to March 1985? It rose because of a substantial fall in the Australian dollar. Why did that happen? Honourable members opposite left the place uncompetitive, following a wages explosion in 1980-81 and policy indolence over 25 years; that is why.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fancy honourable members opposite getting up in this Parliament and talking about wages policy, when the Leader of the Opposition presided over a 17 percentage-point increase in wages in 1980-81, which gave us a wages explosion and the deepest recession since the Great Depression. Honourable members opposite, who have no policy change, no other policy, and who have opposed every wage increase since 1983, have the hide now to suggest that, by implication, they have a policy which would not allow that to happen again. If they were in government right now we would have wages running at about 15 per cent, inflation on the way back to double digits and a recession following. Not one bit of conceptual thinking has been done by any honourable member opposite since 1983 after the debacle of  1980-81. They are no better equipped now to run wages than they were in 1981. The fact is that if they cannot run wages they cannot run the Australian economy. Any party which says, `We cannot run wages' is saying to the Australian public, `We cannot run the Australian economy'. We have shown that we are the only party in Australia capable of running wages policy. That means that we are the only party capable of running the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA> Wages growth has run at about 6.5 to 6.75 per cent through the last 12 months, in the face of inordinately high economic activity. That would have burst out into a wages explosion in the hands of a Liberal government. Yet the Opposition's sole policy is that it would pay wage increases related to productivity. If productivity is running even at the current trend rate of 1 1/2 per cent, how would the Opposition believe that the unions and the work force of this country would accept a 1 1/2 per cent wages increase when inflation is running at 7 per cent and the market would be paying something like 12 per cent or 15 per cent? That is simply a prescription for a wage breakout-a wage explosion followed by a recession. No matter what gloss members opposite seek to put on it, in terms of their own indolence since 1983 not one person in the Federal Opposition has come up with a wages structure which will deal with the realities of the Australian labour market. They are no better equipped eight years later to deal with a strong economy and wages policy than they were in 1980-81.</PARA>
<PARA> Having wrecked the economy in 1981 and 1982, the person who presided over the wrecking, the Leader of the Opposition, wants to present himself now as the person who can best wreck it twice. He is saying, `Please elect me; we have a superior policy'. But when we ask, `What is the key policy on running the key determinant of costs in the economy?'-that is wages-his answer is: `Well, we'll pay wage increases related to productivity'. Everyone in Australian business, everyone in the markets, knows that the Opposition does not have a wages policy. What members opposite will see on Wednesday night is a wages policy-like they have seen for six earlier years-which will give us moderate wages growth right through the course of this year through the highest level of economic activity we have seen in eight or nine years.</PARA>
<PARA> The shadow spokesman asks puerile questions on wages policy. I know he has met Bill Kelty in airport terminals; he has told me about the conversations. He tore the shadow Minister to pieces; he made wallpaper out of him when he came up with this appalling prescription for wages policy.</PARA>

That is what Australian business wishes to avoid and that is why it understands the hollowness of the Opposition policy. The next time the Opposition spokesman gets around to international comparisons, he might mention these facts: Australian employment has grown three times faster than in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in general and is now 1.3 million or 20 per cent higher than in 1983, compared to the 650,000 jobs the honourable member's mate here, the Leader of the Opposition, lost in two years coming up to 1983; he might also refer to the profit share which is now higher as a proportion of gross domestic product than the average of the middle 1960s to the early 1970s.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of Professor Gust's comments on the AIDS education strategy. First, these remarks should be seen in the context of the comprehensive review of AIDS policy which is now being undertaken as we develop the AIDS White Paper. I think it is important to quote what Professor Gust said rather than what he was interpreted as saying. Professor Gust was reported in the Australian as having said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Whilst I strongly believe that we should be educating the entire community about risks, I do think it is important that we put priority in our educational messages on those people who are at greatest risk of being infected.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement clearly reflects the AIDS education strategy of this Government, which is based on the advice of the Australian National Council on AIDS. There is one fact about education which I would like to point out to the House and to the community generally and which needs to be recognised if confusion is to be avoided. While there has been a number of general awareness campaigns on AIDS-and I am very pleased with the response to these campaigns-most of the AIDS education campaigns have been directed or targeted at specific groups. It is quite understandable that the community in general has little awareness of these targeted campaigns. For example, many of the extensive education measures directed towards homosexual men have been delivered directly to Australia's gay communities. The majority of Australians do not come into close contact with these communities and do not see the very considerable and effective AIDS education going on there. The same is true of work with prostitutes and of the needle exchange schemes for intravenous drug users. Indeed, the bulk of governmental resources, Commonwealth and State, have been directed at these targeted groups.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can only say in response to the honourable member's question that the General Manager of the Health Insurance Commission has advised me that the Government's decision to change the current reinsurance pool arrangements has the full support of the Health Insurance Commission, which administers Medibank Private. He has described the article in the Melbourne Herald of 31 March, which attempts to suggest otherwise, as `a gross misrepresentation'. I understand that Calvin Miller of the Herald has in his possession a draft discussion paper prepared within the Health Insurance Commission in mid-February 1989. The paper was a rough draft, neither written nor signed by the General Manager of the Commission, nor was this version ever sent to me. The Herald article conveys the impression that the Commission has expressed criticism of the decision announced on 30 March by the Government. That impression is false. The fact is that in February 1989 the Commission's General Manager advised me that the Commission had some concerns about the proposals for reinsurance being developed within my Department. I discussed those proposals with the General Manager in March and had similar consultations with a wide range of sources within the health insurance industry. The Commission's concerns were fully addressed before the announcement of the decision on 30 March, and the General Manager has personally indicated to me the Commission's support for the decision.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Resource surveys carried out in Australia indicate that there are only modest prospects for exploitation of hot dry rock-HDR-geothermal energy, and Australia is not active in this field. However, my Department maintains a watching brief on overseas developments. A number of technical problems remain to be resolved before HDR power plants are commercialised. Present indications from UK research are that it would not be cost-competitive with coal fired power stations in Australia. Currently the best prospects for geothermal-based electricity in Australia are in communities with access to hot artesian bore water which would otherwise depend on high cost electricity provided by diesel generators. With national energy research, development and demonstration program-NERDDP-support totalling some $700,000, an Alice Springs company, Enreco Pty Ltd, has developed heat engine technology ideally suited to Australia's geothermal resources and has installed this technology at Mulka Station in South Australia and is installing a second larger unit at Birdsville.

In the light of the most recent in a series of safety-related incidents involving United Airlines and the growing public concern about safety deficiencies following the deregulation of the airline industry in the United States, can the Minister assure the House that deregulation of airlines in Australia will not prejudice safety standards for airlines operating in and out of Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the honourable member for Stirling and the House that the Government will not be deregulating safety. We have, of course, announced that there will be a cessation of economic regulation of domestic aviation from October 1990, but this does not mean in any way that the Government will withdraw from or lessen the effectiveness of safety regulation. On the contrary, we have taken some steps to try to ensure that our very satisfactory safety record is even further enhanced. A comprehensive review of the safety regulatory framework to streamline and simplify safety requirements and their administration has been commissioned. The first report has been presented and accepted in principle. A further report is expected later this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the United Airlines incidents, I should say that all international airlines conducting services into Australia are from countries which are contracting states of the International Civil Aviation Organisation. Each of these countries has an aviation regulatory authority responsible for ensuring the safety and airworthiness of aircraft registered there. By international agreement, the home country remains responsible for these matters even when the aircraft is overseas. The Australian Civil Aviation Authority therefore does not undertake any checks on international airlines and no other country undertakes checks on Qantas. However, the Australian Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) is involved in the investigation of incidents to foreign aircraft which occur in Australia. In this regard, I should say that that Bureau is investigating the incident involving United Airlines last Saturday in which one of its B747 aircraft was involved in a landing incident at Sydney which allegedly resulted in damage to the undercarriage and a wing. As soon as this BASI investigation has been completed, any action identified as necessary will be taken by the Australian authorities in relation to Australian registered aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member's question seeks an assurance that we will not in any way prejudice safety standards. I can assure the honourable member for Stirling that that is certainly the case. The actions taken by the Government in respect of economic regulation will ensure a more satisfactory domestic aviation industry. There will be no diminution in safety; indeed, that should be further enhanced.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question is not irrelevant to the question previously answered by the Treasurer. Since 1983 there has been quite a remarkable decline in the number of people on unemployment benefit-from 627,000 to 470,000 in May last year and 407,000 in November 1988. In the 12 months to the end of March the number of people on benefit had fallen by 80,000. From time to time comment is made, sometimes by members of the Opposition, on the duration of unemployment benefit. It is sometimes said that, during the period that we have been in government, that duration has increased.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While there is some truth in that assertion I think it is interesting to look at the rate of fall-off of people on the benefit for various durations. For example, over the period November 1986 to November 1988 the decline in the number of people on the benefit was of the order of 23.5 per cent-nearly a quarter. The figure has fallen by 26.4 per cent for those on benefit for under six months duration and by 27.8 per cent for those on benefit for a duration of over six to 12 months. As we go into the longer durations we have a slower rate of decline. For example, for 12 to 24 months the reduction has been 18 per cent and for two years and over the figure has come down 16.3 per cent. While the average may see some increase, in all categories up to five years there has been a significant reduction in the number of people on unemployment benefit, particularly over the past two years. This Government's success in employment is reflected on the other side in the decreasing number of people on unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me mention just one other statistic which I think is relevant. In 1983 a person who was unemployed for more than three months had a one in four chance of remaining unemployed for 12 months or more. Today that figure is down to one in eight and, of course, it is still rising.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. To keep the promise the Treasurer needed zero across the board wage increases, and that was never on. It is now obvious that the Government's wage-tax trade-off will lead to higher inflation in 1990 and possibly even in 1991. His statement to EPAC was therefore downright misleading. There was no way that the Treasurer could get what he needed from the trade union leadership to keep his promise on inflation. This was a crucial failure by the Treasurer. He has now been forced to negotiate a wage-tax agreement which will fuel inflation and therefore provide for increases in tax revenue through bracket creep.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us take a brief look at the wage-tax trade-off from the perspective of average Australian families, which have never had to cope with the difficulties imposed on them as a consequence of the delinquency of a government such as the one today. The Government is offering a tax cut of about $20 a week. This is not even enough to reimburse taxpayers for bracket creep since the tax summit in 1985, but worse is to come next year. Next year the Treasurer will claw back part of the tax cut as he taxes the wage increases granted under the guise of award restructuring. To add insult to injury, at the same time prices will rise during the next 12 months and will probably wipe out the increase in wages next year. Remember, all this will happen with the background of a forecast of inflation in the last Budget by the Treasurer of 4.5 per cent for this year. Even the Treasurer has admitted that award restructuring will not deliver a rise in productivity sufficient to justify the across the board wage increases demanded by the trade union leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has been trying to create the myth-he sought to do so again at Question Time today-that under the Opposition's industrial relations policy wage increases would be limited to about 1.5 per cent per annum. To put it bluntly, this is absolute rubbish. Either he does not understand our policy or, more likely, he is being deliberately misleading. Of course, under Labor's centralised and rigid wage fixing system, the Government and the trade union leadership have delivered productivity increases which have not even averaged one per cent per annum during the last few years. Australia's productivity increases are abysmal. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, we are putting before the Australian people a program which will carry forth the deregulatory element that is required to make Australia competitive. Our policy provides for wages and working conditions to be settled at the industry and enterprise level. In a decentralised system it is in the interests of employees and employers to agree upon working conditions and wages which are productivity-based. Indeed, in those few instances where enterprise level bargaining has in fact occurred recently, in spite of the Government and in spite of the trade union leadership, the productivity increases are reported to be substantial. The bottom line is that the Labor Government and the trade union leadership simply cannot deliver the increases in productivity which are necessary to raise real wages and hence living standards. At the same time, they cannot deliver cuts in taxes which will provide a sustainable increase in real take home pay. </PARA>
<PARA> As we all know, a taxpayer on average weekly earnings with a dependent spouse and two children will be $58 a week worse off in June 1989 than he was when the Hawke Government was elected in March. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fifty-eight dollars a week would be required to be paid-this is the measure of the task-to a person on average weekly earnings with a dependent spouse and two children if we were to return that family to a position of having the same real disposable income as it would have had when the Hawke Government was elected. After the Treasurer's wage-tax deal this family will still be about $50 a week worse off. This does not even take into account the increase in the home loan interest rate. Since December 1988 mortgage interest rates have risen to 16 per cent. This means nearly $100 a week extra for average home loan repayments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I listened carefully to what the Treasurer had to say when he was seeking to argue-I think these were the words he used-that a party without a wages policy is a party with no economic policy at all. We have a wages policy. We not only have a wages policy. We have the only relevant wages policy for the future of this country. In determining who is the one best fitted to make Australia more productive and competitive we cannot continue with the corporate type deals and fixes that go on between the Government and the trade union movement in Canberra. What earthly relationship has the determination of the wage of a man on the factory floor to the tax the Treasurer will take from him? Wages are not determined by some government plotting a tax mechanism. The whole wage-tax deal is irrelevant to what a man ought to get. Rather, one relates what that person ought to get to the job he does. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, possessed with a corporate notion and possessed with a need to have a fix and a deal between itself and the trade union movement, cannot see that the essential drive for the future is labour market deregulation if this country is to become competitive and, in fact, if we are in an overall sense, with a responsible fiscal policy in place, to be tackling inflation. Wage increases that are essentially unrelated to productivity, as are the ones that will be forecast by the Treasurer on Wednesday night, are wage increases that give no justice at all in terms of any real lift in living standards. We will hear the hyperbole and the nonsense that is spoken. But the truth has dawned on the overwhelming majority of Australians, for they no longer accept the word of this man who is the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is detached from the mainstream of the Australian community. I have said it time and again and I will say it again: in any future electoral contest-there clearly will be one in the course of the next few months-one should look at the way that this man campaigns in trying to get everybody's vote. He will not go out on the street; he will not go into the pubs; he will not go into the nursing homes; he will not mix with any people. In fact, when he is travelling he is hiding behind tinted glass so that we cannot see him. Frankly, it is not because he does not want anyone to see him; it is because he does not want to see anyone. The only way he will communicate with the people is by going into the antiseptic atmosphere of a press conference and talking to journalists in hyperbole about the way he sees Australia developing. His ideal notion for the future of this country is the antithesis of ours. He has lost interest in delivering real and substantial increases in living standards. Any person listening to this broadcast knows that people are in an infinitely worse position today than they were before the election of the Hawke Government. They have great fears about the future of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has limited economic policies. It failed to implement effective fiscal reform in its last two Budgets. It has failed to introduce effective micro-economic reform. Those failures have meant an undue reliance on monetary policy and high interest rates. Let me remind the House that the hallmark of the third term of the Hawke Government was to be micro-economic reform. It has been 18 months since that was mooted and we have heard nothing but talk-inquiries and committees. Albeit that micro-economic reform was to be a central feature of the statement on Wednesday night, it cannot even be included then, notwithstanding the receipt of the Inter-State Commission's report on the waterfront that was delivered to the Government last week. The Treasurer of this nation is now backed into a corner. His options are gone. The rhetoric is there, but those levers we heard about that can so oft be pulled by the Government are being pulled in only one way: on monetary policy. Devoid of options, therefore, the Treasurer is left solely with the one-dimensional economic policy of forcing up interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that the wage-tax deal is an outright failure. It has failed because it will not significantly increase living standards and it will not break the back of inflation. One cannot mask, through verbiage, the depression in living standards that the Treasurer's Government has forced on Australians. In short, if we listen to this man, we listen to someone who paints a false picture. He says to the people that the wage-tax deal is an incomes policy of great merit. It is an incomes policy that will fuel inflation and further retard the living standards of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not want the continuation of some one-dimensional program under this Government. What is needed in Australia is a coordinated set of economic programs. That means tighter fiscal policy and an industrial relations system focusing on the industry and enterprise level, with wage increases related to productivity improvements. When we have those two settings in place we can have a steadier monetary policy to reduce inflation gradually. The Government cannot do that, nor can it take the additional measures that are needed within a coordinated set of programs: namely, a real push on deregulation, micro-economic reform and a schedule of privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> All these measures, if implemented, would change the face of the Australian economy. The Opposition has these policies: responsible fiscal policies and wages policies whereby wage increases are related to productivity increases. With those settings in place we need a steady monetary policy to reduce inflation, a push on deregulation, effective micro-economic reform and a whole schedule of bodies to be privatised. These are the programs that would be pursued by the Opposition to bring about not only a competitive Australia but also the increase in living standards that is so sorely required by Australians today. </PARA>
<PARA> Treasurers essentially have two duties. They are there to lift living standards. They are not elected for their own benefit, to swan around the world, to buy antiques, to glory in the praise of their colleagues. They are there to lift living standards, through effective economic programs, and to govern in the better interests of Australia generally by forging a stronger, more competitive Australia. This Treasurer has failed on both counts. We, however, with our more coordinated programs, will turn that around. We will make the effort that is required to make Australia more productive and more competitive. There fore we will be able to deliver sustainable improvements in living standards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After listening to the speech of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), on the matter of public importance which he has put forward today, all I can say is that the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) would be smiling, as he was while that speech was being made, because his stocks are rising due to the lack of substance in the speech we just heard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kooyong said that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) gave press conferences only in relation to how he would campaign for the next Federal election. I do not think the Australian public has any doubts about how the Treasurer is performing in Australia today because his message is coming through loud and clear. The shadow Treasurer, in the last minute of his 15 minute speech, talked a little about fiscal policy. He mentioned wages and productivity and something about steady monetary policy. He mentioned the little word `deregulation' and said only one word on privatisation in 15 minutes. I challenge the shadow Treasurer to hold a press conference on these issues-if he will not debate them in the House-and be questioned in relation to some of these matters so that we can see just what is the position of the Opposition. It is very obvious that, after eight years in opposition, honourable members opposite have still not developed any of those policy positions. </PARA>
<PARA> On fiscal policy there is a division between the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Wentworth. Quite clearly, they cannot decide whether they should be tougher or softer than this Government, or whether they should have high interest rates. The honourable member for Wentworth continually makes long speeches at public functions and puts out long press releases. In all of those press releases, he has always called for higher interest rates and tighter monetary policy, yet the shadow Treasurer makes statements in the House which clearly indicate that he is in direct line with the Treasurer in relation to fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the wording of the matter of public importance. The shadow Treasurer spoke of the impact of high inflation, low productivity, high taxes and high interest rates on Australian living standards. Let us do some comparisons in relation to these matters. The comments about high inflation come from members of a former government who, when the Australian public made the judgment that they were incompetent and threw then out, had inflation running at double digit figures-at 11.5 per cent. As the Treasurer in an answer at Question Time today said, we have had inflation down as low as 5 per cent since coming to government and it is now between 6 per cent or 7 per cent, depending on the figures we look at. That is a marvellous achievement, considering what the Government has had to face up to in the world economic situation and the income of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the policies of the previous Government. The people of Australia need to be aware of them because they have to make a judgment very soon, as the honourable member for Kooyong said. Some time in the next eight or nine months we have to go to the people in an election. Is the Opposition still pushing for fixed exchange rates, or is that no longer the policy? That was the policy in place when honourable members opposite destroyed the economy of Australia. When they were last in power they destroyed manufacturing industry. They closed down industries in every capital city in Australia. They destroyed employment; 180,000 people in the manufacturing metals industry alone were thrown out of work in a very short time. Exports were slack because of that high exchange rate. Our exporting industries could not compete. </PARA>
<PARA> When we were in opposition listening to the so-called economic policies of those opposite, we heard how the resources boom would pull Australia out. We were going to sell so much coal and iron ore on the world market and there would be such a boom and so much money would flow into Australia that we needed to buy imports to balance that flow of money into Australia. The conservatives of this nation, with a direct policy, set about creating the exchange rate in such a way that they destroyed the economy of Australia and brought it to an absolute halt. We have still not heard any different policies from the Opposition in this regard. The Opposition's policies have destroyed much of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the Government's actions since that time and what it has had to do. First, we had to control the inflation rate, which was running at 11 1/2 per cent. But at the same time we had given a commitment that we would get people back to work. This required completely different policies from those which had been followed by the conservatives at that time-policies that they still will not talk about today. Our major initiative was, of course, the floating of the exchange rate. This was a major change in the economic development of this country. We had to reduce government spending and we have been extremely successful. For all the cries from the Opposition benches and from conservatives in this country, those people cannot come forward and argue with any substance that this Government has not been extremely successful in controlling public sector spending, because the evidence is there-it is on the record. Today we are looking at a surplus in excess of $5 billion as against a projected deficit of $9.6 billion when we came to power. The record is there for the Australian people to make their judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the other major factor in inflation-the wages policy, on which the honourable member for Kooyong spoke for 15 seconds. Before this Government came to office, whilst it was doing its homework when in opposition-something which this Opposition is not capable of-it set about discussing the accord with the trade union movement in Australia, that great bulk of people who put together a lot of Australia's wealth. It came up with a proposal which has stood the test of time. That accord was based on the Australian community being prepared to play its part on wage levels in order to put Australia back on its feet. Nobody can point the finger at the trade union movement of this nation and say that over the past five or six years it has not played its part. Those people are now looking forward to Wednesday night for some benefits flowing from their actions over the past four or five years. I do not believe that without the accord any government in Australia could have faced up to the collapse in commodity prices that this nation had to face during the period of this Government. We copped that on top of the problems that we inherited from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord with the trade union movement became extremely central to how not only this Government but also this nation had to perform in order to recover from the inept policies of our predecessors and from a collapse in commodity prices around the world which slashed the Australian economy and the ability of Australians to buy goods overseas. The accord certainly stood up to that. In the meantime, while all this was happening our policies were such that we were able to create 1.3 million new jobs in Australia-more than two-thirds of them being permanent, full time jobs-putting back to work the people of Australia who had lost their jobs under our predecessors and putting into jobs a lot of our young people who needed to get into the work force. We were able to do two things at one time. </PARA>
<PARA> After eight years the Opposition still has no wages policy. Members of the Opposition come into this place and spend 15 seconds talking about wages based on productivity. What about wages based on consultation and on other policies? What about wages based on education for the future and wages as part of the economy, not just part of the profit sector? I believe that this Government has been very successful in those areas and, at the head of that, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer have led the way. To hear the honourable member for Kooyong speaking today one would think that it all happened by chance and that there was something wrong with the structure which is now in place. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), in answer to a question, gave the House the figures for unemployment benefit recipients-down from 627,000 in 1983 to 407,000 in November 1988, and down by 80,000 in the last eight months for which figures have been kept. Once again this is a clear indicator that the position for the great bulk of Australians is better today than it has been for a considerable time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has no policy on tax. It is bringing forward this matter of public importance because, on Wednesday night, the Treasurer will deliver a very comprehensive package in relation to what is going to be the taxation structure of this nation for several years to come. Let us look at what the Opposition had to offer when it was in government. It had personal tax rates running at 60 per cent, and 66 per cent at one stage. The Opposition claims that it wants to have industry and business operating. In pre-Hawke Government time business, companies and people receiving dividends were paying up to 78 per cent tax on their returns. That is another area of reform introduced by this Government. Today Australia has tax imputation and company tax at 39 per cent as part of the ongoing package. With tax imputation there is a real incentive for Australians to get in and create wealth. One cannot create wealth unless the incentive is there. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members hear from the Opposition about incentives. Where was the incentive from the conservative parties when this country had tax rates of 66 per cent, with companies paying tax at that rate plus the tax on dividends which came to a total of 78 per cent? Members of the Opposition have the cheek to come into this House and talk about incentives. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke about the impact of the Government's policies on living standards in Australia. I shall only point to the last five years in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> There are difficulties and the Government has admitted the difficulties. These have come from two sources-first, the ineptitude of the former Government and, secondly, the collapse in commodity prices. It is now two years since commodity prices started to turn around. This country is now starting to earn income. One thing that is overlooked by many in the debates is that a lot of the wealth that has come into Australia over the last couple of years has come in through the export sector, through improved exports of wool, wheat and cotton. A lot of that money comes straight into the hands of the people who export in Australia. They have it in their possession tax free until such time as they make their first taxation payments, which are due on 10 April, today. Tax day is the day for a lot of wool cheques. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a massive amount of money in the system in relation to the income improvement. That income improvement adds to the flow of money in the system, and no-one denies that. It would be irresponsible to add to that to the extent that one would blow inflation right out the window, so there has to be a time lag in relation to the flow of that money through the system. The benefits that will now accrue to the wage and salary earners of Australia are coming about because of their patience in relation to this matter. They have displayed absolute responsibility to the nation. They have played their part. They have not gone out on the open market demanding wage increases, as members of the Opposition have suggested they would. They have not used their muscle power to demand the wages that they could have gained in the so-called free enterprise approach of the Opposition. They have been responsible because of their relationship with this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The responsibility of wage and salary earners is to be rewarded by their share of the wealth that has been generated. It can only be transferred from one generating sector to another by a series of policy processes, which can only be delivered by a Labor government. So when the House hears proposals about living standards in Australia such as it is hearing today from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, it should keep in mind the fact that in the 15 minutes he spoke he never dwelt on the subject. He spent less than one minute on the major issues of important policy. He spent no time whatever telling the Australian people what the intentions of the Opposition are. He had very little of substance to criticise what the Government has done. It will be interesting to hear what the honourable member for Wentworth has to say in contradicting the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, no doubt as soon as he gets to his feet. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House are proud of our Government. We are proud of our record and we are proud of our Treasurer. We look forward on Wednesday night to what can only be another step in the process of reconstruction of this nation and to another step within the accord of the trade union movement with this Government. The Government is part of that accord. The Australian economy will be put on its feet. I am sure that in these circumstances, in the election period that we are approaching, this Government will probably for the first time in history be a Labor government that not only has rectified the economy of Australia-a Labor government did it after the last war and at the depression time-but also is given credit for it by the people of Australia and will be given the opportunity to see that the benefits of reconstructed Australia are spread across all Australians and are not grabbed by one sector as would occur if the conservatives on the Opposition benches today were given the opportunity. I believe in the Australian people's intelligence and I believe that they will sustain a Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity of seconding the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), on this matter of public importance. Today we are dealing with a very important issue:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The impact of high inflation, low productivity, high taxes and high interest rates under the Hawke/ Keating Government on Australian living standards. </PARA>
<PARA>I begin by asking: Where is the Treasurer (Mr Keating)? He is not the slightest bit interested in genuine economic debate. He runs with his tail between his legs from every conceivable opportunity to debate the Opposition on the state of the Australian economy. The response from the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) is a good example of the sort of response we now get in these economic debates in the Parliament-a constant process of disinformation designed to muddy the waters rather than address the issues. Honourable members opposite are not interested in serious debate; they are trying to patch up a political strategy that is falling apart very rapidly. The Budget, as announced, is completely in tatters. Honourable members opposite are trying to hold it together through to the middle of the year or until an early election. All we get is this constant process of disinformation and, of course, the Treasurer runs for cover. He probably looked up, saw that it was not a broadcast day and figured that it was not worth demeaning himself by spending any time in the Parliament addressing any of these fundamentally important issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess that the place to begin is to recognise just how trapped this Treasurer is by his own rhetoric, by his own Department and by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). He is devoid now of any new ideas. As I have said, he is trying to patch up a political strategy. He is relying exclusively on higher and higher interest rates to get him by until the middle of the year. I put it to this Parliament that he is at an absolute loss without his old adviser, Barry Hughes, who left some time ago now and who, on three occasions in the last 12 months, has consistently warned this Treasurer. He warned him just after the Budget when he questioned the forecasts for the current account deficit, inflation and wages growth. Barry Hughes was right. All three of those are dramatically off course. Again earlier this year, when writing for First Boston Australia Ltd, he warned the Treasurer that he was caught `in a balance of payments stranglehold' and he warned us `to expect the unexpected'. Of course, yesterday in a segment on the Face to Face program, where a number of individuals who had previously supported the Treasurer were interviewed and given an opportunity to express their severe reservations about his performance, Barry Hughes warned that the Treasurer's wages strategy was `a high risk strategy from a balance of payments point of view'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are going to go through 1989 with our fingers crossed that something nasty doesn't happen. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for our Treasurer-damned by one of his closest advisers over most of the time since he was in Parliament. Ever since Barry left, the Treasurer has been a total captive of his Department and a total captive of the ACTU. Just look at the way he has been rolled by the ACTU on the central element of this debate, which is the wages-tax trade-off. Back at the time of the Budget, on 23 August last year, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a successful wage tax trade off will secure for Australia an inflation rate of 3-4 per cent in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>All we have seen ever since is inflation heading dramatically in the other direction. The Treasurer went on to say, as is his wont not to exaggerate:</PARA>
<PARA>This will put us back with the rest of the world, an achievement which has eluded us for a generation. </PARA>
<PARA>As the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) said today in the Parliament in the course of asking a question, at present we are among the top countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development area in inflation and unit labour costs. The Treasurer has said that this is an achievement that will put us back where we have not been for a generation. What a joke! This Treasurer has been consistently rolled by the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go back to October last year when the Treasurer was in New York. He was asked about his wages strategy and he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is too early to anticipate what sort of arrangement we may make with the unions on tax and wages. The zero wage outcome is still a possibility. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet today, just a few months later, we are facing the reality of a substantial increase in the size of the wage increase that has been negotiated with the ACTU. Of course, on top of that there is an even bigger tax cut than the Treasurer apparently had in mind back in October. It is important to be clear on that point. Apparently, the Treasurer was speaking about no increase in average weekly earnings-not just award wages; average weekly earnings. At least that is how it was reported the following day on the AM program by Martin Doubell from that New York press conference. Then, on 16 February this year we were told by the Treasurer in a press conference on the January balance of payments outcome:</PARA>
<PARA>It may well be that the ACTU doesn't get what it wants. I think it will be that the ACTU doesn't get what it wants. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that all of us probably took that to mean that the ACTU would get less, but of course it did not. What Paul has actually come out with is an even bigger outcome than was in prospect at that time. He has been rolled consistently by the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me outline some basic facts in this debate which should not be forgotten. The Government's only strategy at present is to rely on high interest rates. Back in November the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was honest enough to tell us why. </PARA>

Basically, what he was saying was that we would have to live with higher interest rates in the run-up to the tax cuts on 1 July if the tax cuts were to be delivered.

The Citibank Ltd economist-that is a responsible international bank-has forecast that home loan interest rates could go to 18 per cent. The next stage of that adjustment could come just a few days after the Treasurer's announcement on Wednesday. That is, home loan interest rates would have gone up from 13 1/2 per cent to 18 per cent under the last 12 months of this Government. To the average Australian that would mean something like $3,600 per year in additional home loan repayments on an average mortgage of $80,000. An increase in interest rates from 13 1/2 per cent to 18 per cent represents about $72 a week to the average Australian. At present it is already $40 a week for the average Australian. We must set that against the size of the foreshadowed tax cut-wage deal that is in prospect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's strategy, basically, is to give with one hand and take back with the other. Indeed, it gives with one hand and takes back with three hands: first, through higher interest rates and, secondly, as the shadow Treasurer mentioned, through bracket creep. In the four years since the Government's so-called tax reform package of 1985, it has collected about 10 billion additional dollars through bracket creep. Yet a tax cut of only about half that magnitude is being given back. The third way the Government will take it back is through the unsustainability of the whole package. The Government will give us a little bit on a particular date, as part of a re-election strategy, but we will then see that frittered away in the next 12 months, for the third time, because of the higher interest rates which will persist. Indeed, interest rates will probably go higher. I make it clear to the honourable member for McMillan that this Government will probably put interest rates quite a lot higher and, as well, we will have the effect of continued inflation and bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has not been prepared on any occasion in the last couple of years to come clean on any aspect of the economic debate. Every time something goes wrong, it is somebody else's fault. In the last few months he has blamed just about everybody-big business, small business, the Australian Statistician, the Reserve Bank, the Opposition, yuppies-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I deprecate the way in which shadow Ministers have attacked the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and, in particular, the remarks of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), when he came waltzing in here like a peacock saying that the Treasurer undertakes public relations by press release and press conference and does not go out and see the ordinary people of Australia. Eight days ago, in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman), not only did the Treasurer have a press conference but also he went to Transfield Pty Ltd, one of the largest employers in the western suburbs of Sydney; he met with senior citizens at the Lalor Park senior citizens club; he did a radio interview on 2WS, a station located in and targeted for people in the western suburbs of Sydney and, I might add, the third highest rating Sydney radio station; and wound up at the Rooty Hill Returned Services League Club. If that is not getting out amongst the people, I do not know what is. Perhaps members of the Opposition thought someone was doing an imitation; I do not know. That is where the Treasurer was eight days ago. I was with him, as was my colleague the honourable member for Greenway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very interesting when the shadow spokesmen start to criticise our policies. Firstly, they criticise the prices and incomes accord. The shadow Treasurer said that wage-tax deals and the increases that flow to workers are somehow wrong or indecent, or that the workers are not entitled to them. What is the history of our accord, our major instrument of wages policy? The men and women of Australia, who had been devastated by the policies of those opposite, who had been thrown into unemployment in increasing numbers, accepted when a Labor Government came to office that those policies were no good, that confrontations between employers and unions were no good, and that there ought to be another way. Through the accord they accepted a wage restraint, which they have done for six years. They have looked for increases in education; for example, the provision of Austudy. The Government has increased retention rates from 36 per cent to 60 per cent. They have looked at increases for pensioners. They have said, `These things are important to us. We might not get the value of the dollar directly, but indirectly we get more dollars'. That has been the success of the accord. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen on Wednesday? Through the Industrial Relations Commission there will be a wage-tax deal. I do not know how many honourable members opposite value our ordinary wage and salary earners. They should talk to any wage earner, who will tell them that he will appreciate a tax cut very much because it is worth more than a salary increase. Through this system we can get continued wage restraint. The accord has also delivered industry plans that have revitalised the steel industry to a point where it cannot keep up with domestic demand. It was the same for the car industry, which was going out backwards because it could not keep up with domestic demand. We implemented a car plan and an industry plan. This is the sort of activity that has gone on on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the policies of members of the Opposition? Have they told this House where they propose their fiscal cuts should come from? They have said to the people of Australia, `The Government is running a $6 billion surplus through cutting expenditure. We are running a zero public sector borrowing requirement but we have to cut expenditure further. Any tax cuts costing $5 billion must be fully funded through expenditure cuts'. Do members of the Opposition have the decency to say in this House where those tax cuts should be made? Do they have the decency to say to the senior citizens, `You are getting too much, and we will cut?'. Are they prepared to tell people who are about to go into hospitals, `We will cut', so that there will be an even more chaotic public health system in New South Wales? Are they prepared to say to the first home owners-there have been 300,000 and more than $1 billion has been provided to assist them in buying their first homes-that they will cut the assistance out? No. They say, `Believe us. We have a responsible fiscal policy. We are going to cut, but we won't tell you where it will be. We don't trust you. We will not tell you. We said that we would tell you last August, but we haven't. We are not going to tell you now that it is April'. When will they tell the people? The reality is that they are just as ill-prepared today as when they were in government. They ran down the economy when they were in charge, creating double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. They have learned nothing; they have no policies in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Treasurer made an attack concerning micro-economic reform. There has been micro-economic reform. In fact, Bills will be introduced into the Parliament this week in the communications area-a significant part of micro-economic reform-and there will be more. One ought to ask: where were the reforms by the members of the Opposition? Did they indulge in any decent micro-economic reform? No. What were their tax reforms when they were in government? Did they reduce personal income tax? Of course they did not. They had the dirtiest, rottenest taxation system we had ever seen. It was completely uncovered by a royal commission and, of course, changes came. This Government introduced those changes. This Government brought down personal income tax, which was never paid by the top end, from 60c to 49c. My colleague the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) has pointed to all the reforms that this Government has put in on the business side in terms of imputation. Members of the Opposition talk about imputation; they have never implemented it. We have removed the double taxation of dividends. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening in investment today? Investment is running into double digit figures. There is a strong investment surge. What that means is that there will be even more jobs down the track. We have created 1.3 million jobs and we will be creating more. It is true that interest rates are high. Is it not despicable and disappointing that members of the Opposition would not walk away from an irresponsible article such as the one in the Sydney Daily Telegraph that terrorises people on unregulated housing mortgage interest rates? The shadow finance Minister, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), repeated the claim that interest rates would go up to 18 per cent within three days after Wednesday; that by next week we would have interest rates of 18 per cent. How outrageous!</PARA>
<PARA> But the economy is moving very strongly. While those opposite had housing starts running at 105,000, we had them running at 160,000. In fact, since we have been in Government, 850,000 houses have been built. The real question is: Was that level of activity in the housing market sustainable, or would it have got out of hand? The truth is that we are using interest rates to moderate that, and they will be eased as soon as possible. No government likes to have interest rates as high as they are. They are not as high as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) used to have them when he was the Treasurer, but they are unacceptably high for us and we cannot wait to see them come down, but we need that moderating influence. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition refer to the myth of productivity increases. It is no myth. They have opposed every wage increase in the last 19 wages cases. They have said to Mr and Mrs Average Australian, `You are earning enough. You are not entitled to any increase, and we have opposed it'. But now they say, `We will give you wage increases based on productivity'. What is productivity? It is measured at 1.1 per cent. They are saying to Mr and Mrs Average Australian in the work force, `You are not going to get the 6 per cent or more that you will get out of this Government; we are only going to give you 1.1 per cent'. Let us presuppose that they can double that productivity level, which I doubt. It would still be 2 per cent. That is outrageous. The Opposition's recipe is one for pushing the workers down. It has no empathy with the workers. It has no empathy with the conditions of Mr and Mrs Average in Australia. It has no responsibility. It has no policies. It is about time the Opposition did the decent thing by Australians and spelt out precisely what its policies are, where it would cut. Let the record be the judge of our performance over the past six years and its seven years in office. I know what the people of Australia will decide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of the National Biological Standards Laboratory, Symonston, ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed work recommended by the Public Works Committee is for the construction of the National Biological Standards Laboratory (NBSL) for the Department of Community Services and Health. The proposal involves the construction of a single complex at Symonston in the Australian Capital Territory to accommodate the facilities and functions of the NBSL, which currently operates out of some 18 separate buildings in nine locations in Canberra and two in Melbourne. Much of the existing accommodation is leased and many of the facilities are in poor condition, inappropriately located, cramped and requiring substantial repairs and maintenance expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The administrative and operational difficulties and cost inefficiencies of these arrangements are significant and the provision of up to date purpose built facilities is essential. The NBSL encompasses three branches of the Therapeutics Division of the Department of Community Services and Health and administers the Government's therapeutic goods program. This seeks to safeguard the Australian community in relation to the quality, safety and effectiveness of therapeutic goods and is achieved through: evaluation of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and therapeutic devices; laboratory analysis of therapeutic goods; inspection of Australian therapeutic goods manufacturers; monitoring the effectiveness of drugs and devices; development of relevant standards; operation of the national therapeutic goods register; provision of specialised advice, training and education; monitoring drug information; and import and export controls. </PARA>
<PARA> Each year some 40 to 50 new prescription drugs are evaluated and approved for marketing, adding to the 18,000 or so medicines and similar number of therapeutic devices on the Australian market. The importance of these activities to the Australian community is evident. In 1986-87 over one-third of manufacturers inspected by NBSL were assessed as having less than acceptable levels of compliance with the codes of good manufacturing practice and approximately 10 per cent of samples analysed failed to comply with specifications. In addition, recalls of unsatisfactory products number about 140 per year. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed works consist of a single laboratory building totalling approximately 17,900 square metres in area, and include the conversion of an existing building for the breeding of laboratory animals. This building was originally opened in 1975 to permit the testing of brucella vaccine, but is no longer required for that purpose. The new laboratory building will be a two-storey structure, in the form of two linear wings linked at the centre by an enclosed common space and is sited to make use of the preparatory siteworks undertaken in 1980-81 for a previous larger proposal. That proposal, which was referred to the Public Works Committee in 1979 and subsequently approved by Parliament, was deferred as a cost cutting measure in 1981 by the former Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The new building will include biological, chemical and engineering laboratories, as well as staff amenities, library, workshops, storage areas and office accommodation for associated administrative and scientific support staff. It will incorporate all the complex services normally associated with laboratories and will include specific features to ensure biological security and the safe disposal of wastes. The estimated cost of the proposal as presented to the Public Works Committee was $51.4m at July 1988 prices and, subject to approval, works will commence shortly with the conversion of the existing brucella building. </PARA>
<PARA> As is the case with almost all major Commonwealth building projects, construction work will be performed by the use of private contracting firms, subcontractors and suppliers. Completion of the works is expected towards the end of 1992. I thank the Committee for its prompt report and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting this motion on behalf of the Opposition I am sure I am correct in pointing out that the staff of the National Biological Standards Laboratory is delighted that this project is moving towards completion. As the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) pointed out, it is a fairly substantial project with an estimated cost of $51.4m at July 1988 prices. But in the context of this project I make the point that where government tender and purchase actions are being taken into consideration-obviously, this project is a very good example of a project where government tenders and purchases take place-it is important that government departments adhere to the Finance Regulations and the Audit Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me point out that under the Finance Regulations there is now a $500 penalty for not adhering to the regulations. What has been happening in the last couple of years is that the finance regulations and the Audit Act have been ignored in projects such as this by government departments. Indeed, between 30 and 40 per cent of all government purchase do not appear in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. This means that all those people who depend on the Gazette for information of government purchases and tenders simply are not getting access to nearly half of those purchase or tender contracts. This is simply sloppy behaviour on the part of the Government and means that in projects such as this--</PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a shell filling facility for St Marys Munitions Filling Factory, New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>The St Marys Munitions Filling Factory is located about 45 kilometres west of Sydney and is one of the three main explosives manufacturing factories operated by the Department of Defence. It is the only facility in Australia capable of filling shells and is used to load shells from 76-millimetre calibre up to five inches with high explosive. The factory site consists of approximately 800 buildings made up of explosives processing buildings, storage magazines, support buildings and engineering services. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed work now before the House is for the construction of a new shell filling facility at the factory. Within this proposed facility, shell cases will be filled with high explosives such as TNT or a mixture of TNT and other explosives. This is a specialist operation involving a casting process in which the explosive is melted, poured into the shell case and allowed to solidify under controlled conditions. The existing shell filling facility at St Marys has been operating on an almost continuous basis since 1958 and, as a result of high usage, general wear and corrosion, the exisiting plant has reached the end of its economic life. In addition, fume, dust and noise levels exceed current regulatory standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The St Marys factory has an excellent safety record and in fact has the highest rating of any Australian Government industrial organisation in the National Safety Council of Australia's five-star safety management system. The proposed new shell filling facility and plant will provide a safer and more efficient working environment for employees. It is anticipated that both labour and maintenance costs will be significantly reduced. The proposed work comprises a new process building which contains shell preparation, fill and probing section and a shell finishing section; associated engineering services and site works; earth mounds for safety protection; and a trade waste treatment system. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost of the proposed shell filling facility as recommended by the Committee is $7.7m at April 1988 prices. This cost updated to March 1989 prices is $8.25m. A process plant estimated to cost approximately $6m will be installed during the construction phase. This plant will meet the current and expected production requirements of the Department of Defence for both medium and large calibre shells. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to the approval of the House to proceed, it is intended that the first tenders will be called in mid-1989. Construction is expected to be completed by mid-1991 and up to 50 people will be employed on site during the peak construction period. I thank the Committee for its consideration and support for this proposal and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

We are going to build a new shell filling facility'.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>In another place a Bill for an Act to provide for voluntary answers to statistical surveys and for all surveys of that nature, save for the census itself, was negatived on a tied vote. A new Bill for an Act to amend the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975 to provide for parliamentary supervision of the collection of information for statistical purposes was then proposed and passed. Of course, it has now been reported to the chamber and I am pleased to have the opportunity of moving that the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to allow for parliamentary scrutiny and, if necessary, rejection of statistical proposals within five sitting days of their tabling in both Houses of Parliament. Under present arrangements, if the Australian Statistician wishes to make a compulsory survey, he is required to table his proposal in both Houses. There is currently no provision to reject or vary the proposals. The Statistician did not table the present household expenditure survey, which is a compulsory one and thus differs in a most significant way from the previous surveys, which were voluntary. One can only surmise that the reason was to keep the increased size, inquisitiveness and expansion of the survey from the view of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The current household expenditure survey has caused great contention and concern in the community. It is no exaggeration to say that there has been harassment of the community, despite denials by the Statistician. The Statistician is asking people to disclose intimate details of a most personal nature of their household income and expenditure, information that could not possibly be of value for determining the consumer price index, average weekly earnings and pension increases. Information such as the size and nature of bank loans, the collateral offered for them, access to bank accounts, access to financial institutions and other such information up to and including production of income tax returns has been sought. So much for having a privacy Bill-that was very much a matter for debate in this chamber in a recent session-to protect tax files and, in many respects, to ensure that tax file numbers served only the purpose for which the legislation intended them. This is being circumvented by the Statistician who now, under the survey arrangements, can ask for one's tax return. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Statistician has become far too aggressive and assertive and has disregarded the parliamentary process. He decided not to table the proposals for household expenditure surveys and yet wanted to compel answers from people on the grounds that the survey was no different from previous ones. This is patently ridiculous and has been admitted by officers from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to be so in the Estimates Committee in another place, because other surveys were voluntary and if this one is compulsory that significant difference is clearly disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will allow for parliamentary scrutiny of the survey proposals and their acceptance or rejection. Acceptance will give the proposals the authority of parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a few minutes left to speak in debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1988-89, so I take the opportunity to make some comments on the proposed Convention for the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activity. This Convention was negotiated by the Antarctic Treaty nations and is now before the respective nations for their approval or rejection. I am hoping-I will give the reasons for this in a short time, only briefly-that our Government will reject the Convention because it contains a number of very fundamental flaws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first aspect of the Convention which gives me concern is the fact that there is only limited liability for damage which might be incurred by a prospective mineral operator. As we all know, natural disasters in the Antarctic are a fairly commonplace event. Icebergs can rip apart an oil derrick that might happen to be there, as they rip apart ships that happen to get in their way. In fact, many other natural disasters occur in the Antarctic, yet the Convention has only limited liability. Most of the Convention's emphasis is on cleaning-up operations and payment for damages done, but there is nothing in it that would cover the kinds of disasters which occurred in the Arctic just recently when millions of litres of oil were released from one of the oil tankers. The oil caused inestimable damage to penguins and other marine animals in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem is the fact that there is the possibility of subsidies and those subsidies could mean that any inefficient operator could mount operations in the Antarctic which could cause great damage. There is the problem of a lack of confidentiality of data. Various mining corporations will not want to give scientific information, whereas at the moment that information is available freely to all. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, if our national interests are superseded by the Convention, we will be unable to prevent any country or operator prospecting in our claim once the management scheme has been approved by the Regulatory Committee. The area would therefore be opened up to mining. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In taking advantage of the broad nature of debate allowed on the Appropriation Bills, I wish to say something about the coalition's view of the economic significance of the small business sector. I do not think that many people would argue with the proposition that both the Liberal and the National parties regard the small business sector as the locomotive of the Australian economy. We recognise that small business generates about 40 per cent of this nation's value added and that it is providing an increasing share of employment in Australia-that currently more than 50 per cent of all jobs in this country are provided by the small business sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also contend that over the next decade or so small business will continue to grow in its importance to the Australian economy. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, small business has enormous advantages of flexibility over its big business counterparts and flexibility in business management will be a fundamental hallmark of a successful business over the next decade or so. That is because the rapid change in technology will require flexibility and because the community's tastes nowadays are changing much more rapidly than they did, for example, in the period immediately following the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> I think small business will also grow significantly in importance because of its capacity to improve productivity beyond levels which are usually achieved in the big business sector. It has been very interesting to look at the way big companies in Italy and Japan have subcontracted work out to small firms because they find that small firms have a greater level of productivity than is possible in a big enterprise. There are many logical reasons for that. Small firms are more personal: people know each other better and consequently there are fewer industrial relations problems in the main. Also, because of the use of technology-for example, computer work stations-people can work in their own homes in order to assist big businesses and therefore are working in a more pleasant, relaxed and personal work environment than would be the case on a large shop floor. Consequently, rates of productivity are very much higher. For those two reasons-flexibility and productivity-the small business sector will continue to grow in importance in this country and will do so perhaps quite dramatically over the next decade or so. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a matter that will not give a great deal of comfort to the Hawke Labor Government. On the other hand, that Government will not need to worry too much over the next decade because it will not be in office. These factors I have mentioned will not sit comfortably with the Australian Labor Party's philosophy or ideology because it fundamentally believes in the concept of the corporate state-to put it colloquially, in doing things at the big end of town. Big business, big government and big unions make up the troika which is very much the hallmark of the way this Government has operated. Consequently, that enormously productive, exciting and vibrant small business sector of our economy is almost ignored in the day to day administrative decisions and policy making processes of the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government will say that it has done two things: it has appointed a Minister for small business in the form of the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones); and it has set up the inquiry by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology into problems facing small business, although this inquiry has actually been set up by the Parliament, not the Government. I would contend that first of all the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) is little more than a token Minister in that portfolio. He is a man whose interests range very widely in the scientific community but he has been passive in his involvement in small business issues. The Government needs to have a small business awareness program within the public sector so that government departments, when formulating advice for Ministers, and Ministers, when making decisions, can take into consideration the implications of those decisions on the small business sector of our economy. The theory of having a Minister for small business is that he or she is able to range widely over government decisions or proposed decisions to ensure that they will not be at the very least inimical to the interests of the small business sector. But that simply has not happened. The reality is that the present Minister, whether he is interested in the portfolio or not, simply does not have the clout in the Government or the resources within his Department to have very much idea of what is going on at all through the vast network of government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that in the years ahead, when we on this side of the House become the Government, we take into consideration the need to ensure that the public sector is fully aware of the needs and the concerns of that productive sector of our economy, the small business sector. The parliamentary inquiry which is currently taking place has had an enormous brief and has travelled all over Australia talking to different small business groups and small businesses themselves. But the fact is that the Committee is monstrously understaffed. It simply does not have the resources to conclude an inquiry which is sufficiently educated or sufficiently well thought through. That is not a reflection on the hardworking members of the Committee; it is simply a statement of fact about the resources that the Parliament has allocated to that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a crying need for this Parliament and for the Government to have a better understanding of the needs and problems of small business. There are groups that work very hard to make sure the Parliament understands the concerns of small business, and I mention in particular the work of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia and the Australian Small Business Association. They have done an enormous amount of work with very limited resources, as they continually point out, to make sure that we in this Parliament understand their concerns. The fact is that we need to have a clearer view at government level than is currently the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the specific concerns that the small business community has and which need to be addressed by the Government if it is try to get this country out of the economic morass that it is currently in. First and foremost, the small business community in this country is concerned about costs. If its cost structure bears no relationship to that of small business or any businesses in other parts of the world, then Australian small business will simply not be able to compete. The record on taxes over the past six years is, in the context of small business, a very sorry one. What can be described as a raft of anti-business taxes has been introduced. The notorious fringe benefits tax, with all the administration involved in adhering to its requirements, has done a great deal of damage to the small business community. It is so often forgotten that that tax has done a lot of damage to the small business community because the vocal voices of business are those of big business, and big business has had less difficulty with that tax than small firms have. It is not just because of the money that has been taken away from those firms by way of the fringe benefits tax; it is also because of the amount of time that must be spent actually administering that fearfully complicated tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The other tax which has discriminated so fiercely against small business is the capital gains tax. People on the other side of the House just do not seem to understand that the one thing small shopkeepers or small deli owners work for on their tiny incomes through the year is the prospect of selling that business at the end of the time they want to own it or at the end of their working lives and receiving some money from that which, in effect, will constitute their retirement package. Why on earth would anyone want to tax the money that those people have been able to accumulate through their own hard work? Why would a government want to tax the goodwill that a business has built up over many years of hard work? Yet that is what the capital gains tax has done. When we come to government we will abolish the capital gains tax and we will also get rid of Labor's fringe benefits tax. We will ensure that only rorts in that area are taxed and that we can cast aside the mass of administration and higher costs that have been imposed on small businesses over the past six years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as though after all these taxes have been introduced small business has received any compensating relief, which is the argument the Treasurer (Mr Keating) tries to put. It must be remembered also that the Government abolished the investment allowance, which was something that did give small business some assistance. The Government reduced the rate of company tax to 39 per cent. That is all very well for the person whose business is incorporated, but the rate of tax is not 39 per cent if one's business is not incorporated. The people who benefited-in so far as it can be argued that they benefited at all from that reduction in company tax-were the big businesses. Small businesses did not get that benefit if they were not incorporated. Big businesses, by their very nature are almost all-but not quite all-incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA> Small businesses pay the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. They pay a whole raft of new taxes on top of that, but they did not get the compensating reduction in company tax which went to the big end of town. That is highly insensitive and it shows once more that the Government is simply out of touch. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the wholesale sales tax. Members of the Labor Party, when they were scurrying about in opposition in 1981-82, promised that a Labor government would extend the period of payment of the wholesale sales tax to ease the cash flow problems of small businesses. Six years on, there is silence; nothing has happened. The Government has not taken any action at all on timing of the payment of sales tax. For our side of the House, that is going to be an extremely important agenda item when we come into power. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the administration of the Australian Taxation Office? Its officers have gone out and harassed small business in this country. The office has worked on the basis that those small businesses it has decided to audit are guilty until they can prove themselves innocent. The Australian Taxation Office has created enormous inconvenience, enormous embarrassment and enormous cost to small business. It is an office which obviously has no sympathy for the real genius of our capitalist system, the heart of which is the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at other aspects of economic management one comes of course to the one tool of economic management being used in recent years, that is, interest rates. The only tool of economic management that has been used for the last year at the very least, if not for longer, is interest rates. For small business they have increased by 33 per cent in the last 12 months. Honourable members should never forget that most small businesses do not have access to equity financing. Big businesses do, but not the small end of town. Small businesses have to go out and borrow money. The average small businesses have an overdraft limit of about $80,000 of working capital. On average they borrow about $60,000 of that $80,000 limit and they are paying today an interest rate of about 20 per cent on that money. Just over a year ago, in March last year, they were paying 15 per cent. The consequence, on the basis of those figures, is that the annual interest bill for those firms is now $12,000 and in March last year it was running at $9,000. That means that the average small business is paying about $250 a month in higher costs because the Government has used only one tool of economic management, that is, driving up interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequence of this is that small businesses are deferring capital expenditure, because loans are the major source of small business investment in capital. It is a shame-in fact, it is more than a shame: I suppose that is an understatement-that the Government has chosen that one instrument of economic policy which so fearfully discriminates against the small business sector. Small business is also being burdened with a mass of red tape. The House has already had a brief debate on Australian Bureau of Statistics surveys, which have compulsorily to be completed by small firms which might have only two or three people working in them. Small businesses have also to cope with a mass of tax forms. I mentioned the fringe benefits tax. A mass of tax forms have to be laboriously filled in. On top of that, State and local government regulations in many States are growing almost exponentially. I cannot see how small businesses will ever succeed if they have to spend as much time as they currently must simply on adhering to all that red tape that is being imposed on them from above, from Canberra and from some of the State parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major concern that I have, on top of the cost structure of small business, is the lack of concern in the Government and perhaps throughout the community for the concentration of market power in the hands of fewer and larger companies. If the Government wants to have in this country an effective capitalist system it has to have a competitive capitalist system. One thing that we on this side of the House will always oppose is the principle of monopoly capitalism. We do not believe in monopolies. We believe in competition. The instrument of competition that the Federal Parliament has created is the Trades Practices Act and its administrative body, the Trade Practices Commission. Yet the Trades Practices Commission has been hopelessly short of resources over the last few years. Between the 1980-81 financial year and the 1987-88 financial year, government outlays increased in real terms by 24 per cent, but outlays for Trade Practices Commission declined in real terms by 7 per cent. That is the priority the Government has given to a competitive marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> More resources need to be provided to the Trade Practices Commission and more thought needs to be given to the operation of the Trade Practices Act to make sure that there are effective relationships in business and effective rules in business that provide for fair and reasonable competition. For example, where business leases are concerned there needs to be fair and reasonable competition so that big companies do not get special deals while small companies have to pay more. There needs to be fair and reasonable franchise arrangements too, which at least at the State level need to be carefully reconsidered. To those of us on this side of the House those are matters of very high priority. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the consequences of the few issues that I have been able to raise in the time available to me-and there are many others I would like to have referred to-one can see that small business has been the big loser from the Hawke Government; and, because it has been the big loser, all Australians have been the big losers. Our exports have been big losers. Our housing policies have been big losers. The ordinary people in the community have seen their living standards decline because small business has not been able to perform effectively enough, so they are big losers as well. According to the latest figures available-which admittedly are not very late-provided by the Attorney-General's Department, bankruptcies are at a seven-year high. In the 1986-87 financial year, they increased by over 27 per cent and would surely have increased over the next financial year by a similar and very alarming proportion. A survey published last week by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the State Bank of New South Wales, taken of 503 companies in New South Wales, many of which were small, showed the most alarming results that I have seen from a survey of that kind for quite some time. The survey showed that there was a decline in export orders among those 503 companies to the lowest level in the five-year history of the survey. </PARA>
<PARA> This country has a balance of payments crisis, if the Government did not know it, and those companies are not able to export. They are not able to export because their cost structure is wrong and because this country does not have an effective competitive capitalist system. And, at the end of the day, we have a government which is arrogantly disregarding small business because it believes so passionately in its old friend the corporate state, including those at the big end of town, part of the mates network, the Alan Bonds and all those special people who mean so much to the Government, the big unions and of course big government itself. That is what the Government is about. When we on this side of the House come to power it will be goodbye to the corporate state. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), on several occasions I heard him echoing one of the Opposition's favourite sayings these days-that the Labor Government has used only one instrument of economic policy, that is, monetary policy, and that if only the Government used the other two major legs of economic policy we would not have all the difficulties that we have today. I suspect that this is another example of the proof of a saying of H. L. Mencken that to every difficult problem there is a simple solution and it is always wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's claims that, if we could simply use fiscal and wages policy as well as monetary policy, all of the economic problems would be solved are plainly ridiculous. We simply have to look at the alternative wages policy which the Opposition is putting forward. I thought that the Opposition's wages policy was a free-for-all. The Opposition has been coming into this Parliament day after day saying that it is wrong for the Government to have a national wages system under which people have to go to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission at the central level and justify the wage increases that they are after. The Opposition has been saying that it was wrong for the Government to intervene in the Overseas Telecommunications Commission and stop the technicians getting payments which we thought were outside the wages system. The Opposition has been saying that it is wrong for the Government to interfere with Qantas Airways Ltd in determining the wages it pays its engineers because the Government believes it is important that there be no wages break-out at this time. The Opposition has been saying that there should be a free-for-all in wages. It is not putting up an alternative leg of economic policy in the wages area, that is for certain. </PARA>
<PARA> What about fiscal policy? What is the Opposition telling us about the third leg, about fiscal policy? I could have sworn that I heard the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) say that, in the coming election campaign, he will not need to detail any further budgetary cuts; that the Opposition's economic policies have been structured in such a way that it will not have to tell us where the cuts will be in the coming election campaign. So what is the difference between the Opposition's fiscal policy and this Government's fiscal policy? We are saying that we have cut as far as we can without hitting those low and middle income earners who are important to our country. Perhaps it is too hard for the Opposition to put forward policies on where it would cut Government expenditure. When the Opposition says that this Government concentrates only on one leg of economic policy-monetary policy-I wonder what its alternative is for wages and fiscal policy? As far as I can tell, it has no alternative policy in the fiscal or monetary area. Let us think back to the Fraser years when the present Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. We did not have tight interest rates as we have today; we had crippling interest rates-interest rates that drove this economy into the worst recession that we have had since the Great Depression. So I wonder how many legs of policy the Leader of the Opposition used when he was the Treasurer back in the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> This afternoon in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1988-89, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1988-89 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1988-89 I wish to cover a number of topics. The first area I wish to cover is the debate in the community about the foreign purchase of Australian land and Australian companies. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that in September 1987 the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced that the Government would introduce a ban on the foreign purchase of established residential real estate. That proposal is something which has my full support and, I would have thought, the support of all members of the Australian Parliament. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware of the massive increase in home prices, especially in Sydney, in most of the capital cities throughout our country in recent years. That has meant that it has become very difficult for young Australians to purchase their first homes. With the appreciation of currencies such as the yen it becomes very attractive for the citizens of some other countries to purchase attractive real estate in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that in 1987 there was a concentration on the sale of very expensive, very valuable real estate sites around Sydney Harbour. But if the Australians at the top end of the market cannot buy very expensive homes around Sydney Harbour they get pushed down a little into the middle area of the market and those who used to be in the middle area get pushed down into a slightly lower area of the real estate market. The final result is that those at the bottom of the market, the battlers who are struggling to get their first homes, are the ones who are pushed aside. They are the ones who cannot afford to buy their homes. That is why I completely support this Government's legislation to implement that ban on the foreign purchase of established Australian residential real estate. </PARA>
<PARA> I am, therefore, disturbed with the Opposition's policy on this legislation. This legislation is now before the House to implement that ban. Let me quote from the contribution by Senator Messner, the Opposition spokesman on these matters in the Senate. In early March in his contribution to the second reading debate on the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill, Senator Messner made the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government was totally politically motivated in setting down this measure. We-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Opposition-</PARA>
<PARA>will be opposing in the committee stage those clauses in the Bill which seek to implement controls over residential real estate. That is consistent with the Liberal and National Parties' position. We have been exposing this issue since this policy was first announced in September 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Treasurer pointed out in this House, I believe in early March, there is a bit of inconsistency within the Opposition parties on Senator Messner's position. There have been many statements by members of the Opposition, usually not in Canberra but back in their electorates, as to their own personal views on this legislation which the Government has introduced to ban the foreign purchase of established residential real estate. It is known that the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) has called for swift measures to alter foreign investment rules to require 51 per cent of Australian ownership. Senator Sheil is on the record as saying that foreign investment should be restricted to joint ventures with local companies. The honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) has stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The current level of investment is a foreign land grab that is a threat to the freedom of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd), an office holder of the Opposition, is on record as calling for Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) thresholds to be made more restrictive. Even the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair) has called for restraint on foreign investment in Australia. Certainly Opposition members, when they are speaking back home in their electorates, are on the record as saying that they think there should be greater restrictions on foreign investment. They do not support Senator Messner's view that they should oppose this legislation on the foreign purchase of real estate. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that the Opposition's official stance these days should be the document called Future Directions which was released with great fanfare just before Christmas last year by the Leader of the Opposition. What does Future Directions have to say about this issue? Future Directions says the following:</PARA>
<PARA> In recent years these restrictions have encouraged a dramatic increase in the proportion of debt in total capital inflows and in turn this has an adverse impact on our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> These controls-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the foreign investment controls-</PARA>
<PARA>should be abolished, except for certain strategic areas such as the media, and with them the Foreign Investment Review Board. They are out of step with the outward looking entrepreneurial spirit we wish to see in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>So there we have the Opposition's official policy on our Government's legislation to try to hold back the amount of foreign investment in Australian residential real estate. </PARA>

They are concerned about who is purchasing their real estate and who is making it more difficult for them to purchase their homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was interested to read the statements by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), the shadow Treasurer and Opposition spokesman in this area. On the Sunday program a few weeks ago he was questioned by Laurie Oakes. The interview was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Laurie Oakes: Would a Coalition government be more or less regulatory where foreign investment is concerned?</PARA>
<PARA>Andrew Peacock: We would be less regulatory. I have no hesitation in saying that and you either believe in a more deregulated society in a greater flow of funds around the world or you don't. Now the Government says one thing and does another and you have seen the sorts of restrictions they impose and they also use the FIRB as a device for other methods. </PARA>
<PARA>Laurie Oakes: You say you would be less regulatory but a lot of Coalition members don't want you to be, isn't that true?</PARA>
<PARA>Andrew Peacock: Well I don't know that a lot of them do. There are some that I know who are great friends of mine. I would take a different view to them. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have it. Even the shadow Treasurer is saying that there is certainly an element in the Opposition which disagrees with his argument that there should be fewer regulatory controls on foreign investment. I am glad to see that some Opposition members support the Government's stance on this issue. I hope that they are able to take a principled position on this when it comes to a vote in this chamber later in the session. I was also interested to read that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's response to this question was that we should have fewer controls on foreign investment in Australia and should argue for a quid pro quo from other countries, demanding that there should be less hindrance on Australian companies wishing to invest in their countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The example that came to my mind was the recent attempts by Elders-IXL to purchase Scottish and Newcastle Brewery in the United Kingdom. The Thatcher Government, on the advice of its foreign investment review body, decided that it was not in the United Kingdom's national interest to have Mr Elliott controlling another brewery in that country. So I suppose what Mr Peacock is saying to us is that he is happy to let more Japanese and British citizens buy land in Australia on condition that Mr Elliott can buy breweries in the United Kingdom. That is not a position that I am prepared to support. I know that my constituents are not prepared to support such an argument. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Perth says, Opposition members like to quote Mrs Thatcher on some things but not when she makes laudatory remarks about this Government's achievements in terms of its economic policy. I would not support, and nor would other Government members support, certain measures taken by the Thatcher Government, such as privatisation. I know that Mrs Thatcher's actions in restricting foreign investment in her country may not be the sorts of policies which the Opposition would endorse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to a particular case which affects my electorate and also the electorate of the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table. It affects the Morisset RSL Country Club, which is in his electorate of Charlton. I know that the Minister has a great deal of interest in the debate that is occurring in our community and I am sure that he will not mind my saying something about the issue, given that the club is very close to the boundary between our electorates. Earlier this year a constituent of mine was contacted by a reporter called Leigh Hatcher, who was then the Channel 7 correspondent in Japan. Mr Hatcher asked my constituent, `Did you know that your local golf course has been advertised for sale in a magazine in Japan?'. That was the first that my constituent, a member of the golf club, knew that his golf club was being put up for sale. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a sorry story, but that Returned Services League (RSL) country club went into liquidation in June 1985. The State Bank, which was the mortgagee, appointed receivers to administer the club and make sure that it tried to get out of its difficult financial position. Late last year the guarantor of that loan, the New South Wales branch of the Returned Services League, decided to sell the land and buildings of the Morisset RSL Golf Club. Unfortunately, it appears that it did not put that to tender. As far as I can tell, only one person had an opportunity to put in a bid for the land. That company, Barwar Holdings, made an offer of $3.5m. Yet if one talks to anyone who has considered the value of the Morisset country golf club and the fact that it already has a development approved for its land, one would say that it is worth easily more than $10m. So the question arises: Why did the New South Wales branch of the RSL not put it up for competitive tender so it could get the highest price possible, therefore ensuring that it paid off its debts and maximised the surplus left over?</PARA>
<PARA> One other complication which I bring to the House's attention is that during the Whitlam years the regional employment development (RED) scheme grant--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow Minister says, by way of interjection, `Wasn't it a good one?'. In those days we had high rates of unemployment. Therefore, the Whitlam Government sought to fund community projects which would result in local people getting employment and improvements in local facilities. Here is an example where the community achieved an improvement: the last nine holes of the golf course were completed which meant that the community went from having a nine-hole golf course to an excellent 18-hole golf course. Now that the golf club has been sold for only $3.5m to Barwar Holdings, one must ask: What has happened to the investment by the people of Australia, through the Commonwealth Government and the RED scheme grant, in those community facilities? I am concerned that the local community of Morisset has not received anything in return from Barwar Holdings or the people who might buy the assets subsequently. Other questions arise, such as how long will the residents of the Morisset area be able to continue to use the facilities at the Morisset golf course? Will they be priced off the course by massive increases in green fees at some later date? What guarantees can be given to the local community that it will be able to continue to use those excellent facilities?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the House's attention to a glossy brochure which has been produced by Raine and Horne and Baillieu Knight Frank which have put up, on behalf of Barwar Holdings, the assets of that golf club-this time for international tender. The brochure contains a beautiful colour photograph of the area and, with several exceptions, the information it contains is quite extensive. The town of Morisset is not mentioned in all the pages of the brochure. I do not know whether it is thought that the town of Morisset has some bad connotations. I know that the Minister at the table and I do not feel that that is the case. By calling the proposal the Newport country club resort at Lake Macquarie, one would almost think that it is on the North Shore of Sydney rather than at Morisset. I am sure that there were reasons for renaming the golf club the Newport country golf club. </PARA>
<PARA> Another minor omission is that in this glossy brochure one can see beautiful Lake Macquarie and the golf course but there are no photographs of the chimney stacks at the local power stations. As I used to work at the Eraring power station I am reasonably certain that I have my bearings correct. But, having looked at the brochure carefully I can find no chimney stacks. I suspect that the photograph has been doctored. I think that someone has painted out the Eraring power station, which is not easy to do, given that it is one of the largest power stations in the Southern Hemisphere. The Vales Point and Munmorah power stations may be just out of the range of the photograph or else they have been touched up as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who used to work in the local power industry believe that it is not inconsistent to have a power station and a golf course in the same area. Often, many of us who used to work at the Eraring power station used to play at Morisset golf course on a Tuesday afternoon after work. I cannot see any reason why people should be embarrassed to say that there is a power station nearby. Perhaps, when one is seeking to get the best price when one goes out to international tender for a golf course, one does not like to highlight the fact that there is a power station nearby. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter which I bring to the House's attention concerns Anzac Day which falls later this month. It has been a bit of a tradition at the RSL clubs in my electorate that games of two-up, which are technically illegal, have been-I have learnt this through rumours-known to be held at several of my local RSL clubs. The profits that are made are always passed on to local veterans' charities, such as Brisbane Water Legacy. Large amounts of money have been made available. I was sad to learn from my State member of Parliament, Harry Moore, that the New South Wales Police have warned local RSL clubs that they risk losing their licences if they allow any two-up games on their premises on Anzac Day. I cannot endorse anyone breaking the law, but one would expect the New South Wales Police to use a bit of commonsense on Anzac Day, the day when traditionally in Australia returned servicemen get together. I hope that the New South Wales Police will reconsider their decision on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is approximately six years since, in our old parliamentary chamber, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), on coming to government with the Treasurer (Mr Keating), called together the unions, leaders of industry and various groups within Australia to try to determine the future economic direction of this country. Six years further down the track, it is rather interesting to look back on those discussions and to see what they have meant for Australia. Each and every one of us must at times sit down and wonder why this lucky country has not progressed further than it has. Maybe we are to blame. Maybe prior to 1983 and the coming of the Government that is now on the treasury bench, we had not accomplished and set the tide for some of the directions that we should follow. Looking further back to the Whitlam days from 1972 to 1975, that surely was a period in the history of Australia when we took the wrong direction in many ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those six years having gone by, let us look at where Australia stands in terms of our standard of living and in comparison with other countries with which we trade. Australia has had a wonderful opportunity and it has squandered that opportunity over the years. I wonder whether we are living up to the expectations of our pioneers when they came here and cleared the country, started industry, built roads and established shipping and all the transport that we have today. One must ask why, with the wonderful natural resources we have in Australia, we turn around and ship them overseas, in most cases for processing? We are buying back some of the products that originated here and should be processed here. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a lucky country in respect of its conditions of work. When we compare our average weekly hours, and our pay and conditions with those of our countries, we surely must ask ourselves: Do we deserve to live in this country? We will certainly get the answer as to why productivity has not increased. As the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), said today during the matter of public importance debate, productivity has barely increased; it has not increased one per cent. We have not been able to take advantage of all the technology that we have been lucky to gain from other more learned parts of the world. We have reached the situation where it does not pay to transport our natural resources from one centre to another; it pays to transport them overseas for processing. We must ask ourselves on many occasions: Why is Australia in such a position? We certainly are a lucky country, but is this luck starting to run out? The Government that is on the treasury bench today is particularly fortunate because in its six years of administration we have seen a series of good world commodity prices. Furthermore, we have had excellent seasons throughout Australia. We have been readily able to obtain markets throughout the world for our primary industries and for the natural resources that I spoke of earlier. Those markets have been there. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been lucky to have overseas investment in Australia. People should not say that we do not need Japanese investment. I support the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), although we would like to see the Japanese investing in manufacturing and not in real estate. But this Government welcomes the Japanese investment in Australia because it is money that is keeping us going. Over the years the Americans, the British and the Germans have invested large amounts of money to help us to develop this country. Sure, reins must be held, and we have continually to study the position to see that no country is taking advantage of a land which belongs to our people. I am sure that a responsible government will do that and the Government, undoubtedly, is looking at that problem at this time. We welcome investment, whether it be by the Japanese, the Asians, the British, the Germans or the Americans, while it can be of advantage to us and can employ people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One can go on and talk about some of the problems that we have to tackle. I do not want to spend all of the short time I have available criticising the Government. However, I say this to it: The direction it took after the conference in 1973 in the old House of which I spoke earlier is not paying off at this time. Sure, there was a benefit. The accord withheld wage increases for a certain period and probably still has a great effect in that regard, but embedded within that agreement is no flexibility and no deregulation of our rigid system of wages and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> We have invested quite a lot of money in China to assist the Chinese. If we go to China or Russia, or any of the socialist countries of the world, we will find that people are paid for productivity. They are paid for the work that they do and the hours that they work but, more importantly, for the quality and the quantity of the product that they turn off their machines. This is the point Australia has to come to. We have reached the stage where the accord has failed. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister know that it has failed. On Wednesday night this week they will try to come up with a solution that will be politically beneficial so far as the next election is concerned in a desperate attempt to get this economy back on track again. Behind them are all the mistakes that they, and maybe we, have made over past years. </PARA>
<PARA> We have let this country go down the drain and we have not pulled it up. This country has failed to work. That is an important fact. We have failed to produce the policies that will give incentive to our people to work and produce. Productivity is the basic issue behind the future of this country. The Japanese have proved that, as have the Americans and other Western countries. These countries have proved, as we have in years gone by, that government can set policies for work but it will never achieve this with a rigid wages policy and rigid working conditions. We all want to see decent conditions of work. While we have that rigidity we have not the flexibility or the incentive to put this country back onto its proper course. </PARA>
<PARA> The backdrop to our economy has been spoken of in this chamber. Let us compare the backdrop of a bad and mounting balance of trade and a growing national debt with our own households. If we spend more than is coming in, where will we finish up? Furthermore, let us look at our consumer price index. In the August Budget the Treasurer said that it would be down to 4.5 per cent at the end of this financial year. It is not; it is nearly twice that figure. This proves again that on economic policy the Government is on the wrong track. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at interest rates today. I do not disagree with the tightening of our monetary or fiscal policy at the moment. It has been brought about by necessity. It has been brought about to stop people spending. But that does not get away from the fact that house purchasers are paying tremendous interest. On my way to Canberra last night a young man from Sydney told me that he was going to borrow $150,000 to buy a semi-detached house. I said to him, `My lad, that is going to cost you $500 or more a week in interest'. He said, `I know. But how else can I afford to buy what I want?'. Fortunately he was on a reasonable salary and was a single man. But there are many who are not in this situation. The backdrop of which I have spoken is there and is not healthy for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, is genuine in his attempts to supply money for roads. I am sure that he would do all he could to get money from the Treasurer and the Cabinet to satisfy the demands for roads in Australia. The fact of the matter is that we should look at where our money is being spent. I spoke a while ago about the poor productivity of Australia. If we go into our communities we will see where a lot of the taxpayers' money is being spent. It is being spent on crisis cottages and refuge places. Through clubs such as Rotary, Lions, Apex and Quota the community is drawing itself together to try to finance these particular projects. Today 5,000,000 Australians are dependent upon social security. Somebody has to supply the money. The average man who works for a council and for the industries of this country must be able not only to purchase his own home and pay the interest rate but also to pay the taxes required to keep this nation going. </PARA>
<PARA> We should look at our Family Courts. We should look at the other problems that we have in an endeavour not only to solve the economic problems that we are talking about but also to get Australian families back on the track again. Australian families as well as our economy have gone down the drain. If we look at the statistics today we will see how many de facto relationships we have in this country. We can compare that with the downward trend in the economy. There is a great relationship. De facto relationships may be the fashion like the way we wear our hair and clothes. Maybe as time progresses things will change. Maybe we will say that it is time that we woke up to ourselves and looked at our economy in a sensible way, put ourselves back to work, got our families back together again and raised our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> I am saying to this House that we have gone down hill. Who will bring us back again? This is the important issue. We should not worry about foreign purchases of golf courses and all the other things that I hear people speak of in this House. These things are infinitesimal in comparison. What matters is getting Australia back into an atmosphere which is conducive to world trade. Surely to goodness we have the potential with our natural resources and entrepreneurial skills to achieve this. We have people, both big and small, who have proved it. They have been able to succeed in the way they would like. Many of our investors have placed their money off-shore. I do not blame them for that. On balance, that may be the thing to do. But it concerns me that the little Australian who wants to start a manufacturing business around the corner or whatever it may be is unable to employ the people necessary to help develop this country of ours. We are not in a position at the present time to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to ask ourselves a lot of questions, particularly during a debate such as the one before the House. We must ask ourselves: Where are we going wrong? I hope that the Treasurer in his statement on Wednesday night of this week will talk not only of taxation concessions but also of some of those positive things that really matter so far as Australia is concerned. I hope something will be said about privatisation. This country has grown up. The little entrepreneurs of whom I speak want to invest in their country. They want to have confidence in putting their money into Australia in the same way as the British have in Britain. Every member of this House should ask himself: Why is it that Britain is back on the rails again? If one were to go to Britain one would find out. Not only does Britain have a better standard of living but also that country is developing itself. In the East End, 8,500 acres have been cleared up. We talk about Darling Harbour in Sydney and the little bit that we do. That old part of London has been completely refurbished. Why is it that Britain can come back? We can take a lesson from some of the things that Margaret Thatcher and her Government have done in England. First of all, her Government has put confidence back into the people. Nobody is putting confidence into the average Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> I went round my electorate at the weekend and I found no confidence in the people I spoke to. Unfortunately, people are misdirected in many respects today. They say, `The Government is not capable of doing the job. What are you people going to do? What are your policies?'. The gallup polls today show that many people are looking beyond the three major political parties. It is time that we all pulled up our socks and realised that people want to think positively and come up with a policy that will get this country back to work. They want us to come up with a policy that will put confidence back into the hearts of our people. That is an important issue. There is nothing wrong with the younger generation of today. It is a matter of giving it the education and confidence to actually do the job. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not want to speak about the issues raised by many honourable members. I wanted to speak of generalities. These are the issues that we must look at. We must look at our principles, our family life, and future initiatives. Somebody criticised that a while ago. I will not criticise it because it is getting back to basics and it is back to basics that we must go. If we continue to get away from the basics that the older generation was taught when it was young, what hope is there for the younger people of Australia today? Let us give them a bit of spirit. Irrespective of the elections that are around the corner, the Government will get more credit from the Australian voter if it does the proper thing than it will get if it does the improper thing, which could well be vote-catching initiatives that are not in the interests of this country. We had better realise it and place ourselves in a situation in which we can all actually contribute more so far as Australia is concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I hope that, true to his word, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) will ensure when the next election comes about that the Opposition will not concentrate on vote-catching initiatives. I must say that I cannot help admiring the honesty with which he made his contribution today and the sincerity with which it was delivered. I suppose it might be a reflection of the age difference between us, but I cannot necessarily agree that the number of de facto relationships in our society now is in direct relationship to our economic malaise. I grew up in a different era, in a time when a popular lyricist, Bob Dylan, made the hit parades with a song called The Times They Are A-changin'. The words were taken from a biblical context, so they were not contemporary; they are a bit older. I seem to remember the song's words going something like this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The first one now will later be last</PARA>
<PARA>The order is rapidly fading</PARA>
<PARA>The slow one now will later be fast</PARA>
<PARA>For the times they are a-changin'</PARA>
<PARA>The times are changing in respect of the way in which relationships develop in society. I do not necessarily see that as a bad thing. I see it as people choosing to live their lives differently. So I dissociate myself from the suggestion made by the honourable member opposite. As I have said, I admire the sincerity with which he made his contribution. We could all heed many of the things he said. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, this Government has made mistakes. Previous governments have made mistakes. What I admire about the present Government is the fact that we have a real approach, a reasoned approach and a philosophical background to our approach. That is important in regard to the way in which government policy is framed. If one looks at the way the Opposition has been operating in the last six years one does not find a philosophical background to, or any sort of direction in, the way it has operated. </PARA>
<PARA> When considering these Appropriation Bills, the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1988-89, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1988-89, and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1988-89-when we talk about appropriations we are talking about government expenditure-we have to consider fiscal policy. Time after time the question is asked in this place, and by the media, `What is the Opposition's position on fiscal policy?'. Opposition members make hairy-chested remarks-`We will do this, we will cut expenditure'-but, when it comes down to it, we do not find any substance. Last week the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), came into this place and talked for the first time in a long time about micro-economic reform. But if one looks at the Opposition's record on deregulation and on tariffs one finds no prescription for reform. The Opposition's latest position on fiscal policy is: `We are hoping to sell off lots of government enterprises and that way we will be able to fund our promises when the next election comes around. But we will not have to make any cuts. There will not have to be any cuts. There will not be any hard decisions. We will not tell you that we are going to cut expenditure in education, health, social security or wherever else'. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Opposition's wages policy? We hear words such as `productivity' and `flexibility' thrown around. The position put by the honourable member for Lyne on productivity is one that I would embrace. Productivity has to be an important component of wages policy. But we do not have any evidence that when the Opposition was in government it dealt with the wages problem in a practical way. In 1981 there was a disastrous wage explosion. It led to economic chaos and massive unemployment. It was up to this Government to solve many of those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear Opposition members talk about monetary policy, and what a terrible thing it is to have high interest rates. They acknowledge that high interest rates are necessary now as a way of moderating demand. Still, the present interest rates do not compare with the interest rates which the Opposition left us. Still, no alternative prescription for interest rates comes from the Opposition. Day after day we wait to hear something from the Opposition but we hear nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of coalition governments-we see it in my own State of Western Australia-is that they are not able to make up their minds. Very often when the national interest is at stake it is the National Party, the agrarian socialists whom we have come to know and love ever since the days of Jack McEwen, which in the end wins on protection or control and it is the Liberal Party which is shown to be important in that equation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to believe that Opposition members are going to do some of the things that they say they are going to do. Perhaps many people in the community would like to know what they are going to do. They would like to believe that if Opposition members did get into government they actually would do the things they say they would do. Today's West Australian states:</PARA>
<PARA> Major enterprises targeted for the sell-off are the two airlines, the Commonwealth Bank, Aussat, Medicare Private and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom and Australia Post would be sold in the first term of a coalition government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition spokesman on business and consumer affairs, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), Leader of the Liberal Party in Queensland, was asked whether the Nationals would have opposed the inclusion of Australia Post and Telecom. He said, `Oh, well. I don't know about that'. That is the sort of response we are used to hearing coming out of Queensland-`Oh, well. We don't know about that. We will solve that one later'. </PARA>
<PARA> Can Opposition members be believed? If we look at the history of the previous coalition Government and at the performance of the coalition in opposition, we find a trail of compromises, or decisions which were not made, as a result of a conflict between the two parties. The Fraser Government, which had control of this place and the upper House, had a record of impotence. Let us consider the statements of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in 1985, the present shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown). In respect of the Fraser Government, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> But we never seemed to have time to talk about where Australia was going; about the failing standard of living of the ordinary Australians; about how we could give them a good and secure future; about how we could encourage new industries in Australia; and how we could get rid of the dead hand of Government, our Government, that was stifling initiative and taxing us into oblivion. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not a criticism from outside; it is an internal criticism of the way the Fraser Government operated. Honourable members may say, `That is a long time ago. How is it relevant now?'. I am suggesting that there has not been a change. We are sitting here waiting-we have been waiting for six years-to hear about the change, the new broom, but there is no evidence of it. </PARA>
<PARA> So let us consider the way things are now. If these people really believe in the market, then let us have it from them. Last year we had the gold tax issue. If one is an economic rationalist and one really believes that there should be equal treatment of all industries, that it is inequitable to tax the profits of one industry and leave the profits of another industry to go free, one has to support the gold tax. What does a former Liberal member, John Hyde-certainly not a fellow traveller of those on this side of the House, but a man whom I admire for the tenacity with which he pursues his beliefs and the consistency he shows-say about the Opposition's approach to the gold tax? He says:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Federal Liberals really believed in what they did-</PARA>
<PARA>he is talking about their opposing the tax-</PARA>
<PARA>there would be much less reason to worry about them. It seems, however, that they opposed the gold tax to gain advantage in the coming Western Australian election, and to spite a leader they will not support but cannot replace. </PARA>
<PARA> Such pettiness and spite merely demonstrate their unfitness to govern. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have criticism of the way the Fraser Government operated, criticism of the fact that it did not have a philosophical or reasoned approach to the way it did things. We find that, in opposition, honourable members opposite continue this trend. We would have hoped that the Opposition would have sorted it out, but it does not seem that that change has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given an example of the shadow Attorney-General's view of how the Fraser Government operated. We have seen a more recent test of how the Opposition operates: the gold tax. More recently it has been said of the wheat issue, `Wheat: the test of Coalition competence'. Again I quote John Hyde, clearly a supporter of the Liberal Party. He commented in the Australian of last weekend:</PARA>
<PARA> Labor's micro-economic reform program includes abolition of the Wheat Board monopoly of the domestic market. It is a measure of the Coalition's difficulties that it looked like dividing on this straightforward issue. If the Liberals cannot get their Coalition partner to support even as much micro-economic reform as Labor is implementing, then the Coalition is not ready to govern. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again we get from a sympathiser with the Opposition the concept that the Opposition is not able to face up to the problems, the concept of the Opposition being divided with, once again, the dead hand of the National Party winning when it comes to micro-economic change and deregulation. One would think that the coalition could easily come to the conclusion that the deregulation of wheat marketing was in the best interests of all Australians, but unfortunately that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Opposition's latest proposal to sell Qantas Airways Ltd. That is a view for which many on this side of the House have some sympathy. The honourable member for Ryan suggested on the weekend that the two airlines be merged before Qantas was sold. The suggestion that there should be deregulation of air travel and civil aviation clearly is supported by this side of the House because the Government moved to remove the two airlines agreement which was for so long a straitjacket on civil aviation in this country. It took the Fraser Government six years to face up to the issue. In May 1981 it finally discussed it and decided, after holding an inquiry, that the two airlines agreement would continue for five more years and that there would be a three-year notice of termination. Effectively, the Fraser Government said it was not sure that it should continue with the policy, but that it would try it out for another eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> The former member for Stirling-I note that the present member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) is in the chair-and the honourable member for Forrest cried crocodile tears about the fact that there should be deregulation of air travel. Fortunately for the coalition, those two members were out of the House when the vote was taken and were paired with members of the then Opposition. So in May 1981, the two airlines agreement legislation was passed, even though many members from Western Australia crossed the House in a show of support for the then Opposition, which was support for Labor's approach. Unfortunately, while crying crocodile tears about the fact that the legislation had been passed, two of the members from Western Australia could not make it to the House to vote. Had they been there, the then Government's legislation would have failed. So I ask whether we can believe what the Opposition is saying. Opposition members have been tested on a number of occasions. They have been asked whether they are serious about the market and about deregulation. They have been asked whether they are serious about their motivation and whether, if they get to government, they can deliver. Time and time again they have failed the test. They have failed even the most recent test in the last weeks. It is right and proper that the people of Australia should ask themselves whether they can trust this mob opposite. If they were successful, could we believe them?</PARA>
<PARA> We find the same difficulty if we consider the Opposition's wages policy. The Opposition has no concepts. We must ask what is its prescription. A few buzz words like `flexibility' are thrown around, but there is no substance to the policy of those opposite. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong, in a most remarkable contribution on the matter of public importance, said, `How you decide what a person should get is easy. A man ought to get what he ought to get'. I presume that means that if someone on the shop floor is not sure what he is worth, he goes to the boss and says, `We'd like 20 per cent, but we're a bit concerned about the condition of Australia-inflation, the current account deficit and productivity-and we understand that productivity is only trending at 1 1/2 per cent, so we will accept 1 1/2 per cent. Inflation might be running at 6 per cent, but in the interests of Australia we'll accept 1 1/2 per cent' and, whizz bang, we will have the sort of wages policy that the Opposition proposes and it will work. But we know that is not what will happen because at the moment we have significant employment and a large number of job opportunities. We have a market which, because of its profit share, can afford to pay 12 per cent or 15 per cent. If collective bargaining is allowed and workers negotiate their own deals, we will have 1982 revisited. We have seen the possibility of wage break-out with the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, Qantas Airways Ltd and other areas. Under the scorched earth philosophy of the Opposition, we would have a huge wage break-out and no way to take the step from the process we have at the moment to productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one on this side of the House suggests that productivity should not be a factor; of course, it should. But it is necessary and important for us to understand that there needs to be some mechanism by which members opposite put in place the wages policy that they propose. We have not seen it; we are still waiting to see it. We hear a few buzz words. We see a policy that is working, that is historically breaking the nexus between the consumer price index and wages growth in this country. We see a philosphy behind it and we see something that works, yet we are supposed to jump into the darkness in the hope that perhaps if we use a couple of these buzz words, there will be a solution. Indeed, it is right and proper that the people of Australia should look at what the Opposition proposes and question it very closely. If the proposal cannot pass their scrutiny, the Opposition will fail. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no suggestion by this side of the House that an employment and wages policy is easy. It is damned hard and has been difficult, but we have a conceptual approach. We have a philosophical background to the way in which we are going; that is something that the Opposition does not have. As long as we are the only party which has that sort of direction and purpose, and as long as the Opposition remains divided and inconsistent and unable to put forward a concrete proposal, I imagine that all Australians will continue to support us rather than the Opposition. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity to speak generally on our economic situation in the context of these Appropriation Bills. They are very relevant because they are an important part in the Government's armoury in dealing with the problems that the nation faces at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Appropriation Bills deal with the additional funding that is required for the maintenance of the provision of services by government. They enable the Government, if it has a determination to do something about the fiscal side of our economy, also to redress in part some of the expenditure patterns adopted by the Government. In other words, there is in the appropriation legislation an opportunity to cut back, as it were, on some areas of government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, as I understand it, we have before us a document that is largely neutral, which indicates very little resolve on the part of the Government to deal with the dilemma that the nation faces at this time. We may see a little more light shed on these matters when the Treasurer (Mr Keating) speaks to the Parliament on Wednesday, but I suspect, in terms of what I read and hear, that the statement that we will hear will have more to do with the Government's short term survival than with realistically addressing the longer term problems that the nation faces. </PARA>
<PARA> If what I hear and read is correct, I am likely as an Australian to be disappointed. If, however, the Government is taking a longer term view-the approach that the Government appeared to be taking before the last election; in other words, that it would make the hard and the necessary decisions for Australia and its future and it wanted to separate out its future in a sense and say, `Look, we don't really care if we survive; if we do what's right for Australia we will be satisfied'-so much the better. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of a debate which is not being broadcast but which will be read by those who look at Hansard, I will try to put on the record some of the matters that are of concern to me as a parliamentarian about the position we are in at this time. I refer honourable members to the `Overview' section of the Economic Round-up, the Treasury document about the Government's performance. We need only look at the short paragraphs, the cryptic phrases which describe quite clearly our position. Under the heading `Balance of Payments', in the page 1 overview, we see that the current account deficit in the month of January was about $1,537m. That was compared with the December period in which it was $924m. In the first seven months of 1988-89, the current account deficit was $9,643m. That was $2,553m higher than the deficit recorded in the same period of 1987-88. Then the document goes on to explain, as much as is possible, that the high level of imports seen in recent months continued during the three months to January 1989. The total value of endogenous imports was 19 per cent higher than in the same period of 1987-88. The total value of exports increased by 2.3 per cent in the same period. </PARA>
<PARA> What worries me is that when we look at the outcome of the balance of payments we find that each month we are falling further and further behind. As I often say to people in my electorate as I talk about these questions-and I do discuss these questions with them-when one falls behind in one's own accounting and individual expenditure pattern and spends more than one earns month after month one knows the likely outcome. Most people understand that if one continues to spend more than one earns there are not many options left. One's first option is to cut back on what one buys-in other words, on consumption. The country can do that. It can cut back on consumption and imports. The Government has a say about some of these things. The way it frames its policies will determine whether people are encouraged to consume. That is what the individual and the nation can do to deal with the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> But the individual has other approaches available, such as borrowing money. As long as a person has reasonable credit and some assets, he or she might be able to go out and pledge those. I do not know how frequently you, Mr Deputy Speaker, go out and pledge your credit or borrow in order to live, to meet school fees, to run a few extra parties at home or whatever; but I imagine that if you were borrowing for consumption you, like me, would feel that that was not a very satisfying way in which to live. In fact, this is what our nation is doing. Part of the way in which we are attempting to balance our economy is by borrowing money. Some people ask: why are we borrowing money from Japan? Why are we going into hock? It does not matter where the money is coming from. The fact is that we are going into hock. It does not matter whether one chooses to borrow money from Westpac or from the ANZ Bank. If it is needed, one goes out and borrows it. The nation borrows it internationally. The problem is that, generally speaking, what we are doing as a nation is going into hock for consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other option left. As I frequently explain to people, one can sell some assets. I do not know how much of one's assets one could sell. Perhaps one could subdivide the garage and sell it to a neighbour. Perhaps one could get rid of some of the furniture. A person who has been living well in the past and has a lot of antiques might be able to sell some of those. In fact, that is what the nation has been doing. It has been selling off the farm, selling off our future. I hear complaints around the electorate. People say, `Is it not dreadful? We have people from Asia investing in Australia'. It does not matter whether those investments come from Asia, the United States of America or Britain: the fact is that a person who sells off his garage for consumption purposes is doing exactly the same as Australia is doing now. </PARA>
<PARA> The deficit that we see each month is being accommodated essentially in two ways at this time: by borrowing from overseas and by bringing overseas capital into Australia. The amounts involved are large. Quite frankly, while we can cut back on our imports as a more satisfactory way of dealing with this matter, if we look at what we export and what we import in terms of our merchandise trade we find that Australia is buying largely the same amount of tradable goods from overseas as it is able to sell in the various categories in which we export-mineral products, agricultural products and the like. That merchandise trade in 1987-88 totalled $40.5 billion and the imports totalled $40,386m, which is roughly comparable. Australia was dropping behind in what we call the invisibles-those items for which we pay other people to carry out certain services. It may be in terms of shipping, insurance or any of those sorts of matters, but the principal payments are in fact to service the debt. They are interest payments on debt. As a nation with a gross foreign indebtedness last December of $120,834m, we have a huge interest bill to meet each year. The fact of the matter is that each year as we continue to go into debt we are compounding our interest obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> These statistics are not pleasant reading. They are signs of the enormous problem that we face as a nation. The statistics that we as members of parliament are provided with by the Parliamentary Library-and I use the merchandise trade figures again-show that over time our position has improved in terms of the export of primary products, mainly agricultural products. The improvement has not been significant in percentage terms but largely in the value of the products sold. We have seen an increase in our exports of primary products from $8 billion worth in 1982 to about $15 billion worth in 1987-88. These consisted of wheat, wool and the like. Of course, that is as a result of the marginal recovery that we have seen in relation to our rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to read an article in Time magazine of 3 April entitled `Rural riches', which talks about the bush economy booming and new industries being created. I thought it was rather good reading for Australia. But, notwithstanding all the improvement in relation to our primary products, the overall situation of merchandise trade has not changed significantly. Our capacity to reduce our foreign debt as a result of the rural riches has been marginal, if any. As a person who contemplates these things, I do not like to think ill of Australia or its future. But if we see a significant downturn in the rural economy in the near future or perhaps in a year or two, the fact is that we will not have used those opportunities resulting from the rural boom to reduce our foreign indebtedness. </PARA>
<PARA> If the country suffers a major drought in the near future, the nation's position will be worse than it was when we suffered a drought in the time of the Fraser Government. Instead of being in a position to weather the storm, we will be much worse off as a consequence. I do not believe that these problems are being seriously addressed by the Treasurer at this time. I do not think his statement on Wednesday night will take the problems into account. If one is going to address these problems, one has to reduce the nation's imports of overseas products. One assumes that the nation's exports are largely maximised, but I will come to that in a moment. If the Treasurer proposes to reduce taxation at this time and intends not to impose a consumer tax, which does not seem to be on the horizon and if wages are to be increased-and the Government is about to agree to a number of arrangements for that, which seems to be the way in which those who are informed about these matters are suggesting that the Government is going to go-the reality is consumption will increase and imports will increase. The Government will be further jeopardising the nation's capacity to reduce its indebtedness. That is the hard reality, but it is what we are likely to see. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that I think there are some other matters that need to be commented on and I shall do it briefly. I noticed that many of my colleagues speaking in this debate addressed some of the micro-economic problems that the nation faces rather than the macro questions on which I have tried to comment. The micro-economic reforms that it is believed are appropriate for Australia are those that will enable the nation to become more efficient, more productive and to increase its exports. That is the other side of the equation. Those micro-economic reforms have been suggested to me by economists whenever I have spoken to them, either here or abroad. They are essentially about adding value to products which we in Australia produce. Nobody suggests that there is any miraculous new industry that we can create overnight. If one is going to look at Australia's strengths, one has to identify the areas in which we do it well and find out how we can do it better-how we can add value to those rural or mined products that we export-how we can add that value ourselves and get a better price for those products. </PARA>
<PARA> The areas are quite clear. Honourable members talk about them frequently. Uranium is one. Wood pulp is another. As the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), who spoke before me in the debate, suggested, wheat products are another. I want to talk about each of those. In the area of uranium we have a Government that has its head in the sand and is not prepared to bite the bullet on that question. We could not only export more uranium; we could carry out processes here which would make it more valuable as an exported product for Australia. On the wood pulp question, Wesley Vale was an important project for Australia not only because of the expenditure it would have involved but also because of the value added wood pulp that would have been exported from Australia. This Government was not prepared to enter into negotiations with the Tasmanian Government about what would be appropriate environmental safeguards until the Tasmanian Government hung out its shingle and said, `We are prepared to buy this project'. Then the Federal Government came in and said, `We are not prepared to be involved in that. We do not think you have gone in hard enough'. This Government wanted to establish its environmental credentials, but it sabotaged an important development project which would have had significant micro-economic benefits for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of wheat, the honourable member for Perth suggested that the Opposition parties lack credentials in that area. The coalition is in favour of deregulation but what we say to the Government is, `Be serious. This is an area where effective micro-economic reform can occur, but it cannot just occur in relation to the matter of the Wheat Board. It has to include the other elements that are important-freight and the question of getting the product through this country's very complex and difficult wharfing systems'. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are matters that the Government needs to address, as well as the way in which wheat is sold domestically, if the system is to see realistic reform. These sorts of micro-economic reforms are important for Australia, but I very much doubt that in the statement we are going to see later this week the Government will have seriously addressed them. I doubt that the Government will show that it has any idea about the way this country can increase the value of its exports or effectively reduce imports. If the statement does not address these problems, this nation's future is seriously at risk. I ask honourable members to look at an article that was published in the Sydney Morning Herald a few weeks ago, written by Maximilian Walsh, a leading economics reporter. The article was headed `The edge of our ruin is now in sight'. I think it is important that all members appreciate the sorts of issues that are canvassed and that article will help them if they wish to be informed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) has demonstrated again how easy it is to govern a country when one is in opposition. It is very simple. I think the honourable member ought to go back to what the Government of which he was a member did, particularly in the period between 1978 and 1981. I ask him to listen not to what I say about that period but to what the Metal Trades Industry Association said about it. It seems that what the honourable member is saying now in opposition does not link up with what actually took place during that period, when firms moved offshore and the former Government was winding down the ability of Australian companies to compete and forcing upon them a moat mentality when it came to exporting. The honourable member spoke about value added now, when this Government has given incentives to Australian industries to produce in this country and to export, having processed their products to the maximum. The honourable member referred also to the country's international debt. I am constantly amazed, for if one looks at the facts and figures one finds that over $60 billion of the money owed by this country was chalked up by private enterprise, not by this Government. The honourable member tends to make out that the reverse is the situation, but the suggestion is totally untrue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dundas mentioned foreign investment. I agree and have concerns about foreign investment where it involves the vertical integration of control of, say, the beef industry. But the coalition parties want to remove the Foreign Investment Review Board. Their policy is to get rid of it. The Government's approach is that that investment ought to be allowed if it is in the national interest, which is a very good rule. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk about another aspect that I believe is important in Australia's future interests, just as the economic issues are, and it has economic overtones. I refer to the growing demand that is developing in this country and in the Australian community generally for the nation's heritage to be protected and preserved. When one starts thinking about the nation's heritage one looks at three areas: first, the natural environment, and those involved in the conservation environmental groups have certainly brought that home to every household. The preservation of Aboriginal history has also been put high on the agenda by the Hawke Labor Government so that the sacred sites and artefacts and any aspect to do with the Aboriginal heritage are protected, and money has been made available from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA> The third aspect is the historic heritage. I think the bicentennial year and the whole lead-up to it spotlighted and highlighted the average Australian's new and, I would hope, continuing and developing interest in his or her own country. It certainly is so in my area. As I walk around my electorate and meet with people I find that more and more of them are saying, `We want to preserve what we have got. We have a history here; let us protect it'. The activities in 1988 involved millions of individuals, tens of thousands of organisations and over 850 local authorities and all other levels of government. In that year the nation spent $100m on bricks and mortar projects-a substantial amount of taxpayers' money, but money that was well spent. It was not only $100m on the bricks and mortar; one could almost double that for the money that was spent during the bicentennial year, but the activities awakened Australians everywhere to the historic heritage around them. It gave Australians a better understanding of the need to protect and preserve this heritage. It created an interest in projects that were not previously recognised-projects of an historic nature. Regrettably, much of this interest was belated. I have had groups, not only in my electorate but all over Queensland, say to me, `We did not realise until it was too late that there was a closing date for applications. We missed out on getting funding for these projects'. The moneys had been spent or allocated before they realised that their project was worth while. </PARA>
<PARA> But regardless of the belatedness of that interest, I am pleased that there is now a very positive and significant post-bicentennial mentality. There is also an emphasis on the historic. I see that it is starting to compete with the interest in our natural heritage that has been engendered by the greenies, those involved in the conservation movement. Right across this country hundreds of projects are now being brought forward as projects worthy of support. All sorts of local museums are springing up. The preservation of homes of famous people is being placed high on the agenda of local communities. Sites of historic events are also being seen as something worth researching, developing and then presenting to the world. The link between tourism and cultural and historical projects is quite exciting as well. We then have the programs commemorating events, people and places to the point where some people are saying that we ought to have a plaques campaign right across the nation so that people know where a certain famous person lived or an event took place. There is increasing interest and that interest is being seen by the demand on the National Estate program and in the activities of organisations such as the National Trust. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Hawke Labor Government has certainly played a magnificent role in creating this interest and in placing a special emphasis on Australiana. It certainly did this during the bicentennial period with the allocation of about $170m. But now I suggest that we need to address this post-bicentennial interest. We need to ensure that money is available for the hundreds of groups across the nation that are starting to say, `Our projects need support'. So there is a need for a more national approach now. Instead of leaving it to the States, to local communities and to local authorities we need a national approach to the preservation and presentation of Australia's historic heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> I want quickly to acknowledge the work that has been done by the Australian Heritage Commission, the role that it plays in the identification, listing, registering and researching of sites and events of the past. I think we all appreciate that the work that has been done by the Australian Heritage Commission has been enhanced by the National Trust, a body which is set up by individual State legislation and works mainly on a State basis but which has a national council. Those bodies combine well, through the independence of the National Trust and the Commission, to ensure that Australians are well aware of what we have and what we ought to keep. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments have acknowledged the need to preserve history. At the State level, museum grants are given to hundreds of small museums in my State. Funds are also forthcoming for national bodies such as the National Trust. But I would suggest that it is important that we have a more up to date, nationwide Federal assistance program that would enhance what I think is probably the most important program at the moment-the National Estate grants program. The Fraser Government spent about $2m on that program, whereas this year we have spent almost $4m. That money is available for capital works programs. In the past it has been distributed through the States, although this will change and I believe that it will be administered through the Australian Heritage Commission. But it is a scheme where the States have to set the priorities and I think that is a pity. But the advantages have been that that money can be made available to State projects, local government projects and non-government projects and, where an approved body is involved, there can be tax exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA> I know also that we have other assistance programs, such as the Commonwealth commemoration programs, that involve the national memorial program, which is Canberra based, and the National Memorials Committee which centres on Parliament House. The only program that is really worth while is the historical events and famous persons program. It sounds great because of the work that has been done with it but this year only $36,000 is available for the whole of the nation. When $20,000 was used in an archaeological research program in Barcaldine for the shearers' camp site it does not leave much if we want to put up a plaque for an historic person's home or to commemorate an historical event. There is a real need to acknowledge the importance of commemorating events and recognising the people who have made the history of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that there are other moneys but I suggest that they are in bits and pieces. Funds are available through the Australian research grants but there are strong restrictions on these grants. The Australian Geographic Society is developing a science program but limited funds are available. The National Museum of Australia is starting to get going but again it does not have access to massive government funds. The Australian biological resources study grants are mainly for the study and research of flora and fauna. As I mentioned before, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has done excellent work in Aboriginal history but that is limited to Aboriginal heritage. The State museum grants are State grants. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge also that there are tax incentives for gifts of art works or gifts of property, but again they are limited. Whilst research moneys are available in tourism there are limitations. In fact, there are limitations on all areas despite the bits and pieces that are available. I add also the Australia Council grants for commemorative art. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the nation there is an urgency to preserve all sorts of projects. One matter that must surely raise the concern of Australians everywhere is the fact that we have never really researched the Eureka Stockade site at Ballarat. Many say that we cannot say exactly where it was but that is why we ought to research it. It ought to be a centre of activity. One could add to that Vinegar Hill in New South Wales, scene of the Irish uprising. It is very interesting history but no-one is quite sure about the location and nothing has really been done about it in substantial terms because the money has not been available. Captain Cook's landing place at Kurnell is another one that could be added. Funding has been raised for the Barcaldine Tree of Knowledge and the Australian Labor Party's interpretative centre. This is important because it is the beginning of the history of the Labor movement. Eventually the Liberal Party of Australia will have its own history to commemorate, as will the National Party of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We can add the homes of the famous, such as Ben Chifley's home at Bathurst. The locals have tried to do something about it but it ought to be a national project. Dame Enid Lyons's home in Tasmania ought to be a national project. D. H. Lawrence's `Whywuark' home at Thirroul in Wollongong ought to be a national project. Donald Bradman's houses at Moss Vale ought to be national projects. Lloyd Rees's home ought to be a national project. </PARA>
<PARA> If we walk away from the famous people we could start talking about our explorers and the pioneer trails. I suggest that there would be great value in setting down the expedition tracks far better than they have been, left to local authorities. In my area Leichhardt went through the township of Moranbah. The locals are trying to raise money to do something about that site. It is important, it is historic but there is no money available and it ought to be part of a national program. I would even suggest that we consider Prime Ministers' homes. In the United States of America, once a person has been a President, his home is set aside and it is part of the American heritage, but not in this country. I believe that the homes of our Prime Ministers from the beginning in 1901 ought to be of national significance. We can add other famous people. </PARA>

<PARA> I come now to my State of Queensland. I remind honourable members of King O'Malley. People in Emu Park are trying to establish a museum to commemorate King O'Malley-a man who went to Emu Park to die and was saved by an Aboriginal person by the name of Coowoonga. He found King O'Malley in a cave and nursed him back to health. We cannot get money for the King O'Malley museum. The Peak Downs homestead will deteriorate to a point where it will never be saved unless we can get money. The Mount Morgan chimney stack, which is rather unique in the goldmining history of this country, is deteriorating to a point where, unless we can get the Army to help us repair it from the top using helicopters or some other significant scaffolding exercise, it will be lost. The Rockhampton Archer Park railway station is the centre of railway history in central Queensland, but the money is simply not available for its preservation. In Biloela we have something more adventurous. People have bought the silo from World Expo 88 and want it to be a centre of grazing, agricultural and mining history. The first coal ever exported from this country came from the Callide-Dawson Valley. Those people need $1m, but it is not available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chinese massacres that took place with the gold exploration of central Queensland may be something that we want to forget, but it is part of our history. It ought to be plaqued in some way-presented, researched and represented. I have mentioned Leichhardt's journey through the central highlands and Moranbah. One could go on and on. Riversleigh, which is some 140 kilometres north of Mount Isa, has the largest, most important fossil bed in this nation. It is of international renown. Yet Professor Mike Archer of the University of New South Wales depends on private enterprise support, private support, some National Estate grants and Australian research grants. That fossil bed has giant rhinoceroses and minute particles of animals and reptiles. All those things should be part of a national plan. I could add to that the need for a national portrait gallery. I note that the old Parliament House is being considered as a possible site for that. There should be a national campaign ofidentification. Regarding plaques, while the Australian Geographic Society has a signs program I believe plaques should be dealt with at a national level. </PARA>
<PARA> I argue for these things because they cannot be put off. Unless we start taking action now, the homes will be lost and the sites destroyed. Therefore, the information will disappear. We need to take a bipartisan approach and say that this cannot be left to local authorities, local interest groups and a local museum group that suddenly desires to research a project and build a museum, as we are trying to do at Emu Park with King O'Malley. We need to expand the funds that are available. I suggest that a massive expansion of the National Estate's grants program is needed. We also need to set up a heritage trust-a trust run by the Australian Heritage Commission or similar body that can attract direct funds from State and Federal governments, private sector support and a tax deductability right for the donors. In other words, we need a massive national pool of money. We need between $30m and $40m a year. At the minimum we need $20m to be able to get on with the preservation, restoration, renovation and protection of these sites. </PARA>
<PARA> When a project comes forward it can be funded on its merit. If it is of national importance it should receive 100 per cent national funding. If it has a State emphasis, it could be funded on a 50 : 50 basis where the States weigh in a dollar for a dollar. If it is on a local regional basis, it could be funded on a 40 : 40 : 20 basis-that is, 40 per cent from the Commonwealth, 40 per cent from the State and 20 per cent from either the local authority or the community. Obviously, it should be assessed properly before funding is available, but the money must be there. We need to adopt a long term program; not a program running for two or three years or the life of one parliament, but a 10-year program reflecting a commitment by both sides of the House that these nationally important projects will be funded and that we will commit ourselves to that funding either legislatively or by a special political commitment. If we do this I believe that will be backed by the people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> More and more people realise the need to preserve the past for the future. There is a need to take advantage of our history-a tourist advantage-because some 17 planes come to Australia from Japan every week. Visitors are not only interested in visiting beaches on the Gold Coast; they want to know what Australia is all about. They want to know something of the Aboriginal history. They want to go to Ayers Rock and they want to see Australia as it was in the past, as it is presented today. I stress the need for a national Australian approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I would urge that as Government and honourable members think through the forthcoming budgetary allocations that we will have this year and in years to come, they need to place the preservation of our country at the top of the agenda. We need to say that unless we do so, these things will be lost. I urge that that national approach be taken, that consultation be held with the States and local authorities and that we embark on an Australiana campaign. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to three matters in this evening's debate which, in accord with precedent set by previous speakers, has been wide ranging in nature. The first is really an extension of a discussion in which I took part on a matter of public importance-the tax file number system-some three or four weeks ago. Last week I had cause in this place to direct a question to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) about the non-fulfilment of the requirements of the legislation. As the House will recall, my original concern surrounded the decision by the Australian Taxation Office to post to Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia in excess of a million letters containing tax file numbers. At that time it became apparent that the Taxation Office had been in grave error and had used information dating back to the early 1980s. As a result of that mass post-out-and the Tax Office admits to this-at least 60,000 letters went to people who were no longer resident at the address to which the letter was posted or who had, sadly, passed away. As a result at least 60,000 tax file numbers are likely to fall into wrong hands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of my raising this matter with the Privacy Commissioner on 17 February, the Privacy Commissioner moved in on the Australian Commissioner of Taxation and had discussions with Mr Boucher about the methods his office was using. Unfortunately, in many ways, the Privacy Commissioner accepted Mr Boucher's word that the extent of the errors would not be repeated and that the Taxation Office had no alternative but to go ahead and complete the post-out to the remaining States in Australia. That post-out took place and, again, it is anticipated that about 60,000 letters have gone to persons who have either shifted from their previous address or passed on since the end of August last year. </PARA>
<PARA> What causes me great concern is that the carelessness has been repeated. Recently in this Parliament I spoke about the jerry builder approach of near enough being good enough. There are reports from the southern States of how tax file numbers have been included in incorrect envelopes, how they have arrived unsealed, how they have arrived for deceased persons and how they have arrived for persons who no longer live at a particular address. What galls me is the fact that the Taxation Commissioner is a pacesetter in Australia-a man who demands of every man and woman in this country that they make no mistake of any kind and, if they do, they will face penalties. I believe that under the present Government the bureaucracy can blunder and err and be treated totally different from ordinary men and women. </PARA>
<PARA> In Question Time last week I mentioned the requirements in the Income Tax Assessment Act. If the Taxation Commissioner judged-he has that right and I do not argue with it-31 March as representing inadequate time to ensure that everybody had their tax file number, there was a provision in section 202c (4) (b) of the Act requiring a proclamation to be made by the Governor-General of this country. That proclamation was to give a lawful standing to an extension beyond 31 March, but what did we get? On the twelfth hour we got a press release from Mr Boucher headed `Do not panic about numbers'. He said that the Taxation Office was stressing the need for a commonsense approach by employers and employees. So he was well aware of what he was doing. He actually issued a press release, but he did not put in place a proclamation. To my knowledge there is still no proclamation. So here we have the Taxation Office, the Commissioner included, acting in an illegal way. What does the Government do? Absolutely nothing. The Treasurer told us the other day:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I am quite certain the Australian Taxation Office will advise me whether in its view an extension is warranted; and, if it is required to be fixed by proclamation, I would consider it. </PARA>
<PARA>A deliberate decision to extend was made, yet the proclamation was not made. I just ask: How can Mr Boucher continue to hunt and haunt every individual in this country and have people living in a state of fear in case they make a mistake, yet be so flippant and careless in his own approach to the law? He was gone from the moment of that big post-out because thousands of letters did not meet the first requirements of the Privacy Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some of them were unsealed, as the honourable member for Deakin reminds us. I believe that people are ringing up the honourable member too to tell him about it. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) told me tonight that a journalist in Adelaide even received a letter with two tax file numbers, one belonging to another person. So she does not need any convincing about the reports of politicians. I am advised that there was a report of it in the Adelaide Sunday Mail on the weekend. I stress that Mr Boucher himself, who is wound up with a determination to crush every taxpayer who wittingly or unwittingly errs, has a staff of thousands but cannot even follow the requirements of law. I dispense with my anger and make an appeal to him on a man to man basis: if he cannot get it right, have mercy on those little people out there who do not have staff at their beck and call, who cannot afford the best accountants in the land to help them weave their way through the Income Tax Assessment Act. I appeal to him if he cannot get it right to be understanding and to be less relentless in the manner in which he treats the honest mistake makers. I am not here as a friend of those who deliberately break the law, but the approach that has been in place in the last couple of years-`I will teach them by a lesson that they will never forget'-is not a reasonable one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have watched Treasurer Keating in this place attack Opposition members for having been critical of senior public servants. One of the realities of life in recent times is that many senior public servants are behaving like politicians. They go around making the speeches that Ministers should be making; they take controversial lines. I submit that any public servant who wants to stick his neck out will get it chopped off. I appeal to the Bouchers of this world: Instead of bleating about being singled out, let them examine the role they have played, and haul off and leave it to the politicians to play the political game. As I said in this place a year or so ago, I was concerned then about the political game that the Taxation Commissioner was playing. I invited him to become a member of this Parliament-if he really had pent-up feelings and frustrations, to get out of that office, cut his salary in half and come here to join the boys and girls who have the responsibility for the political arguments. He is simply an administrator. I ask him to remember that. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Treasurer's criticisms of Opposition members, we are still witnessing the Australian Statistician conducting the household expenditure survey, which was not tabled in this Parliament. It was supposed to be tabled in the first half of last year; it was not. I set about causing difficulties because it was another instance of the bureaucracy not following the law. What distresses me is the lack of courage the Australian Bureau of Statistics has displayed in seeking to avoid admitting that it was wrong. It tabled that survey, which had been under way for three months at the end of September, and refused to admit that it did not comply with the law, and now pretends, because it did table the document halfway through the survey, that it has legitimacy and it even threatens the hundreds of people out there who say, `I won't do it'. Again, we have a case of one law for the people and another law for the bureaucracy. The legislation relating to surveys says that unless a survey is tabled before the Parliament it shall be conducted as a voluntary one, yet the Government condones the continuation of this survey, which is being conducted under the guise of having the force of law. </PARA>
<PARA> My final point is on a different matter. I hold up an object. It is a make-believe suppository. Mr Deputy Speaker, the smile on your face indicates that you knew exactly what I had in my hand. It is larger than a normal suppository. If we open it up we find a letter from the Department of Community Services and Health, the Department of the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), about the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It was sent to every Australian doctor. When doctors opened up this huge package, which would have had printed on it `Postage Paid Australia'-or, alternatively, `Postage paid by the Australian taxpayer'-they found one sheet of paper and something for sticking on a telephone or on the wall to remind them which drugs had been taken off the pharmaceutical benefits list. I have been told that doctors' receptionists and so on have taken them home for their children to use as a pencil case. </PARA>
<PARA> This was all part of a campaign to soften up members of the public to believe that the Government's introduction of a generic system for the provision of drugs was good for them, that it was going to move them along nicely and that they would not suffer any ill effects. I wrote recently to every doctor in my electorate asking, `If you are a prescriber of the drugs that the Government is taking off the pharmaceutical benefits list because the companies have refused to budge on their price, please advise me what you think'. Twenty-two Moreton doctors wrote back indicating that they were prescribers of the drugs of the companies affected. They indicated that thousands of their patients-I use that in the collective sense-would be affected. That means thousands of my Moreton people, particularly the elderly, will be affected by these changes. Of the 22 responding, only one was prepared to state that none of his patients would be, to use the words that the respondents had an opportunity to choose, adversely affected. Five of the doctors wrote back saying that they would wait and see. But 16 of the 22 doctors said that their patients would be adversely affected. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not quite understand why the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) became so rigid in his approach to this. The Government said that as a result of the switch to generic drugs it would save at least $12m. It has probably spent $1m or $2m on the full-page advertisements that appeared in all the newspapers in Australia and on the suppositories that it posted out to doctors. It has probably spent a lot of that saved money already. I make the point that a socialist government, whether it be democratic socialist or straightout socialist-one can take one's pick-really has no right to be telling the medical profession what drugs it will or will not prescribe. If a doctor believes that a certain brand of drug is the best for his patient, all the Government is doing is hurting the patients when the Government proclaims that the doctor will no longer have a choice. The Government was really big-hearted when it said that if people were not prepared to use a generic equivalent they could buy the brand name they were originally using at full price. </PARA>
<PARA> As I am not a medical practitioner, I am in no position to judge, but I would be lacking in responsibility to the people I represent and, indeed, to all Australians if I did not raise this issue in this place. Two-thirds of the doctors in my electorate who prescribe the drugs state that there will be an adverse effect. I have been advised that some of the people were on generic drugs previously and that brands are not exactly the same. Just because they have the same ingredients, it does not mean that they are exactly the same. Some people were taken off the generic drugs and switched over to brand names. As a result of those switchovers the health problem which was dogging them was overcome. The Minister may have an ideological battle with what some company will charge for a drug or is prepared to set as its lowest price, but he should not make the people carry the penalty. That is exactly what the Minister has done. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by making a call tonight to Minister Staples to reassess what he has done, to allow the return of some or all of these drugs as quickly as possible and not to keep them off the market simply on the basis of being bloody-minded and thinking that Big Brother must win because the companies have held their ground. The Government's decision will also affect research in the future. No government has the right to do this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my contribution to this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1988-89, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1988-89 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1988-89 I would like to concentrate on the appropriations for the Department of the Arts, Sport the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT) and, in particular, on those appropriations associated with the sports portfolio. How unusual for me! The issue of sport and its economic impact in this country is an issue which I believe is extremely understated. Successive governments over many years have seen the need to provide incentives for Australians to develop inventions, to develop their positions in the arts, science, business and so on. But there has been a relative lack of desire on the part of governments to involve themselves in sport-that is, with the exception of the last six years, under the Hawke Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Too often sport is seen, to coin a phrase, as a froth and bubble industry, something which people participate in but whose economic benefits are not great. That certainly is not the case. In recent years Commonwealth expenditure on sport and recreation has been about $40m per annum. As I have indicated, there certainly has been a marked increase in sports funding under this Government compared with what it was in the term of our predecessors. However, the figure represents less than one two-thousandth of Commonwealth outlays. There is a need for our Government to review the position and to look at increasing funding for sport, not only at the elite level but also at the participation level. It should also look at funding more facilities right round Australia so that our elite sports men and women and those in the general sporting community can have first class facilities to use to develop their sporting prowess. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of studies are being undertaken, both within DASETT and in the broad sporting community, of the economic impact of sport in Australia. Some preliminary findings of the studies make interesting reading. An economic impact study by DASETT has found that total government support for sport and recreation was about $900m in 1985-86. If we add proportional increases to that figure, it is well over $1 billion in today's terms. The break-up of how that money was raised and spent is interesting. Local government contributed 73.3 per cent of the total sports cake. State and Territory governments contributed 20.6 per cent. The Commonwealth came in at No. 3, a bronze medallist if you will, at 6.1 per cent. The figures reflect the contribution by local and State governments in the provision of facilities. One only has to go into any electorate in Australia to see the work that is being done by local councils in the provision of sporting ovals, football fields, hockey fields, tennis courts and so on to appreciate the investment that local government puts into sport. I recognise that and acknowledge it. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, over a long period we have seen State governments involved in sport. We have seen the development of a range of facilities in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and elsewhere. In all cases, particularly if there has been an Olympic Games or a Commonwealth Games component-pending bidding, perhaps to host the sporting events appropriate to those facilities-or if there has been an event of national significance, the Commonwealth Government has kicked in its fair share to provide an appropriate level of support for the development of those facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, over a long period regional sports facilities have not tended to attract a great deal of support from any level of government. I will give some examples from my own area. The Illawarra region has over a long period produced sporting champions in a variety of fields. One only has to look at the record books to see the rugby league champions. I know the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) is familiar with this fact. There are also the swimming champions, the Australian women hockey players and so on who have come from the Illawarra region. All of those champions have been produced in the relative absence of first class sporting facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take another example, from the field of basketball. We have a team competing in the National Basketball League, the Illawarra Hawks. They presently play in a stadium lovingly referred to as The Snakepit. If nothing else, it has atmosphere. In fact, that is probably the only thing going for it. It is the scourge of other teams visiting the place, not only because of its atmosphere but also because the crowd is so close to the players. The facility existed when I was a mere lad in Wollongong, playing basketball at high school. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a couple of years ago. I will talk in terms of my father. The facility has been there for a long time. Changes have been made to it, but its potential as a fire trap and its ability to cope with the crowd that now wants to see the Hawks playing in the National Basketball League and so on are no secret.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a problem attracting sufficient funds to build an alternative facility which the Hawks can use. In Queensland there is no problem. The facility at Boondall was constructed with the help of State government money. It is being managed by a management organisation and is returning a profit. It is not simply used by the Brisbane Bullets; it is also used for other sporting and entertainment events, the latter being an important component of such facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> There are plans to develop a brand new stadium in Wollongong to meet the needs of the Illawarra Hawks and to serve as an indoor entertainment-sporting venue. The big problem is attracting sufficient capital resources to construct the facility. About $12m to $14m is necessary. The New South Wales Government is not the least bit interested in supporting such a facility in the Illawarra. Yet the Illawarra, which is the second city of New South Wales, which arguably was ravaged by the downturn in economic conditions in the early 1980s more than any other part of Australia, is for some reason not receiving its just recognition or reward in the provision of such facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I might speculate on some of the reasons for this. It may well be that the present Government, in March 1988, did not win a seat in the swing that went against the incumbent Government of Barrie Unsworth and saw him out of office. I might speculate that the Greiner Government thought, `There is no value in putting anything in Wollongong. They are always going to vote Labor'. I might speculate that, therefore, we do not have much of a chance in getting any financial support from the New South Wales Government to help construct this facility. That is a shame, because not only would it be a brand new base for the Illawarra Hawks, enabling 8,000 fans to be seated in relative comfort, but it would also be a regional indoors sports-entertainment centre. </PARA>
<PARA> The centre would have the added benefit of enabling Wollongong to be an attractive venue for some of the major rock and entertainment shows that now come to Sydney. As I understand it, entrepreneurs are looking for a venue other than the Sydney Entertainment Centre to make it just that little bit more economically feasible to bring to Australia the likes of Poison, Michael Jackson or any of the other rock-and-roll people. I have to take my kids to Sydney to see them in action. I would much rather take them half a mile down the road to see them in Wollongong. These entrepreneurs are saying that if there was a second venue in Sydney's western suburbs or in Wollongong it might make it more viable to have those artists stay in Australia longer and give enjoyment to more people. But we cannot seem to get to first base. The State Government does not want to know about it, but more disappointingly the local community does not want to know about it. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking essentially about a steel town that was built on the back of Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd. Unfortunately, the community is not prepared to get in and support the Hawks. The Hawks are having a terrible time getting a major sponsor in the National Basketball League. Two years ago, they finished third; they made the play-offs. Last year they were one game off finishing fifth. This year they could be more competitive if they were able to get a couple of more decent players. Notwithstanding, the Government and the local community have not thrown their full support behind this organisation. That then begs the question: what about the Federal Government's responsibility and role?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate to the honourable member for Gippsland that some few weeks ago now a report tabled in this place canvassed that particular option. I refer to the first report of an inquiry into sport funding and administration by the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, Going for Gold!, which canvassed the need to develop a regional sporting facility program. I am sure that all members of the House are aware that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Graham Richardson, has developed a local community and sporting facilities program under which he has allocated $13m of Commonwealth Government expenditure over the next three years. That is just on $4m a year for the next three years. I am aware that when applications for the first round closed, the Minister had received in excess of $108m worth of applications for the $4m to go around. Most of those were genuine cases from right around Australia-from places such as the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), who is supportive of all sporting organisations in his electorate, just as most members would be. However, we have seen that a limited amount of money is now being made available. I am aware that the Minister is concerned about this fact. He would like to see greater financial resources given to sport. Like his predecessor, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown), he is committed to ensuring that adequate resources are devoted to sport in this country. In the facilities area, that is quite right.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the first instance, they might have all gone to the western suburbs of Sydney because that is where the bulk of the population of Sydney is now moving. We have seen the development of the State Sport Centre and Parramatta Park. I do not mind that; I think that is fine. The western suburbs of Sydney now have two first class sporting venues. Who can deny the fact that Parramatta Park is being used not only by Parramatta in the New South Wales Rugby League competition-it happens to be leading at present-but also for a variety of other things, not the least of which is opera. We saw elephants racing across Parramatta Park. Once again, a community facility is being used for the purpose for which it was designed. I suggest that that typifies the sort of thing we need in Wollongong, Newcastle, Geelong and other regional centres right around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that the Minister takes note of the recommendations in the report called Going for Gold! to which I alluded earlier and which was tabled in the Parliament a couple of weeks ago. I hope that not only does the Minister take cognisance of that report and the recommendations contained therein, but so too do the money Ministers of the Government, because it is high time we saw an interjection of funds into things like sports facilities and other things contained in some of the recommendations of the report. I suggest that tied into that whole question, however, is a relationship that touches on social and economic factors. I believe, as I am sure does the honourable member for Gippsland because he actively participates as a sportsman first thing in the morning before he starts the day, that a healthy lifestyle which involves exercise will lead to lower costs for government. It increases people's fitness levels, which therefore reduces their need to medical care and so on in later life. </PARA>
<PARA> Medical and physical education evidence brought before the committee of inquiry to which I have referred verifies that very thing: people who participate in sport will enjoy life far more than those who do not. They will feel healthier and they will find some time later in life that their health costs will be lower. That has to be good for government, by saving government funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I can only suggest to those people who say that funds should be directed only to areas such as science and the arts and not to sport that there is no difference between the pursuit of excellence in sport and the pursuit of excellence in the arts or the sciences. I see them as similar entities. When we take elite sportsmen and women and provide them with some support mechanism, employment opportunities, resources for training, travel to overseas competitions and the ability to do well in their sports, they provide role models for people in the community to get actively involved in those sports. I do not think that anyone could take exception to the fact that when Pat Cash, for example, won Wimbledon, tennis suddenly boomed again in Australia. It boomed again because of the recognition that an Australian champion was out there playing that sport. That has an economic effect through the sale of racquets, sandshoes, Reeboks at $150 a pair, and all the rest of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may well be that some people take a different view and suggest, as has been considered in a number of places, that rather than encourage people to participate in sport, all this does is turn us into a nation of `Norms', a nation of television watchers who sit in front of the television set. Yesterday afternoon, for example, instead of being one of the enormous crowd at Phillip Island watching Wayne Gardner, the `Wollongong Whiz', winning down there, again winning for Australia, a `Norm' would have watched the event on television. I would hope that second argument is not the one which holds sway with most Australians. I would hope that they believe that participation in sport leads to healthier lifestyles and therefore reduces costs to government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I indicated at the start of my contribution tonight, it is my considered view that the amount of money which is made available by the Commonwealth Government to sport is not adequate. It falls well short of those allocations that are made in a number of other fields in the pursuit of excellence. A number of recommendations were made in the report Going for Gold! to which I have referred on a number of occasions tonight. I hope that the Government sees fit to act on each of those recommendations. There is a need to support our elite athletes and their coaches. There is a need to provide facilities in regional centres as well as in capital cities. There is a need to decentralise Australian Institute of Sport activities to a variety of centres around Australia to encourage talented people in the community. All of that can only be put into effect if adequate financial resources back it up. I am not suggesting that it is totally a government responsibility; the private sector also has a role. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report of an inquiry into sports funding and administration will touch on many of those issues. It will cover such aspects as the contribution of the private sector to sport. One would hope that a balance could be obtained between the Commonwealth Government and the private sector in this regard. However, as I said at the beginning of my contribution, I hope that the Commonwealth contribution to sports funding increases and increases quite markedly in the future. I believe we are encouraging talented people. We are encouraging the broad populace to become involved in sport and in the long term there will be savings to government. </PARA>

<PARA> Unfortunately for many people, tax cuts will not be a simple solution to the problem of cost rises. We have seen an enormous escalation in interest rates and health charges, prices increases across the board and a dramatic widening of the gap between income and living expenses. This can be redressed only if there is a positive change by the Government in its economic direction. The big issue will be the extent to which tax cuts and other decisions to be announced will reduce the gap to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate there are many people on fixed incomes. There are young people who are endeavouring to raise a young family or to buy or build their own home. They all face the same difficulty-the enormous cost escalation which has overtaken the capacity of people to do things that they must do and which are vital for the future of this nation and for the welfare of the ordinary person. Of course, the difficulty for those on fixed incomes, pensioners and those within the bracket very close to the tax exemption level is that they get no benefit from simple tax cuts or wage increases. There has to be consideration of the effects of what has gone wrong since the last Budget in the areas of the inflation rate, interest rates and the whole spectrum of enormous increases in costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last Budget the Treasurer promised a reduced consumer price index (CPI) figure. He said that by June that figure would be down to 4.5 per cent. Yet currently it is almost double that amount and it certainly will be nowhere near the forecast. The result of this is tremendous pressure on costs and tremendous difficulties for people on small incomes who are endeavouring to maintain a standard of living to which they are entitled. Unless there is a firm approach to these problems there is no doubt at all that we will have a continuation of that very unsatisfactory situation in which promises have been made but have not been fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to inflation, I also refer to interest rates, the CPI level and all the basics that are inherent in a Budget or in a substantial statement of the kind that we expect on Wednesday evening in this House-the kind of statement that was made in May last year and the previous May. On each occasion the statement was euphoric about success, what was being achieved and what the results would be. We heard a debate in this House this afternoon in which both sides of the issue were, I think, put fairly strongly, but I must say that the defence by the Government did not measure up to the real issues. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, let us consider what has happened in the matter of the tax take in the seven months following the beginning of this financial year. A report by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) says that the gross pay as you earn (PAYE) collections to the end of February was $2,685m or 17 per cent higher than the collections for the same period last year. Over the same period PAYE refunds were 1.7 per cent higher than for the same period of last year, showing very clearly that the tax take is up and there is no quid pro quo for the people who pay the tax. Collections of non-PAYE tax-in other words, individual taxation-represented $1,666m to the end of February, 7.9 per cent lower than last year. That discloses that incomes were down because of cost increases and because of the difficulty for people in that bracket to produce--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The average family man is caught very badly in the economic structure that this Government has created. Prescribed payments under the new system amounted to $847m, 38 per cent higher than for the same period in the previous year. Despite some reductions in the last Budget, the company tax take was 26.3 per cent higher than for the same period in the previous year. Then we come to a very significant figure-one that is astronomical in proportion. The collection of sales tax in the eight months to the end of February was $6,160m, 24.3 per cent higher than for the corresponding period in 1987-88. So the figures go on, through to customs duty collections and so on. The only reduction is in excise, because of the crude oil price fall, where there is a substantial drop, but that was expected and has previously been debated in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where does all this lead us? It leads us to the startling situation where there is an enormous increase in the tax take. We are now being promised tax cuts that will cost about $5 billion and the figure has been floated of another $1 billion to increase certain benefits for low income earners in the needy section of the community, making a total of $6 billion. But on the other side of the spectrum is the problem that we are not paying our way in productivity and this nation is facing a current account deficit likely to be more than 50 per cent higher than forecast by the Government. The inflation level is almost double the forecast and the level of external debt is dangerously high, causing an enormous increase in interest rates and many other difficulties for business and for the consequences of the productivity of this country and its recognition. </PARA>
<PARA> In the debate earlier today I did not hear any admission on the part of the Government that this country has lost its rating as a place to invest. I did not hear any recognition of some of the figures to which I have just alluded. This has been glossed over and the average person is the victim. If we are to have a wage package that is meaningful, surely the ACTU and the Government must recognise that reward for productivity is the only answer to the real dilemma that is facing this nation. Unless there is a move in that direction there will be a continuation of the problems which confront Australia. I mention one other pertinent figure, that is, that domestic demand is up by 8.2 per cent and the level of exports is down by 4 per cent. That means simply that the trend is the wrong way at both levels. That can only lead to a further deterioration in the balance of payments, a further difficulty in the matter of the value of the dollar, vis-a-vis the interest rate and all the rest of it, and the problems of the productive sector. Primary industry, for example, is carrying more than 50 per cent of the load in terms of the earning of export income and it is being throttled by this Government, rather than encouraged. Those are the dilemmas that the country faces, which are not being recognised. I trust there is at least some modest acknowledgment of this fact when the Treasurer makes his important statement on Wednesday evening. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless this is done and the economy starts to turn the corner and the nation gets around to recognising productivity as the goal and as a consequence of that productivity providing some reward for the people who bring it about, the economy will never get out of the trough that it is in. I say to those on the Government benches that this is a very critical period. It is no use playing politics and offering-as no doubt will occur-some kind of sweetener to the electorate, while the Government fails to address the real problems and fails to acknowledge that the country has a financial dilemma and that it is no use sweeping it under the carpet. The long-term future employment in this country and the long-term considerations of housing and welfare and of the means to enable the needy section of the community to be serviced depend on the structuring of the economy so that it comes out of the trough that it is in. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YI4">Mr IAN ROBINSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was just one of the decisions that had to be reversed. Honourable members heard the Treasurer say as late as today that the difficulty in housing was the fault of the State governments and the high prices being paid. Why did those two things occur? It was because of the changes made in three successive Budgets and two mini-Budgets. If the Government had encouraged housing and the kind of development that could be done if there was a climate in which it was advantageous to invest at practical rates of interest which did not have to be supplemented in some way, and in which funds did not have to be stretched by State governments in supplying welfare housing, and if negative gearing had not been taken away, the housing situation today would be much better than it is. What was said by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) in that respect was absolutely correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), drew attention to the need for more funds for sport in this country. I applaud that, but on the other hand I think the Government should fix the priorities with a little bit of reality. I say to the honourable member for Macarthur that it is all very well to talk about the need for more funds for sport, but let us think of just one of the ingredients. If there is funding of the sort to which he referred, let me remind him that there is not one cent for the disabled in the field of sport in this country. That I believe reflects very badly on the Government and those who have been responsible for administering sport in this country at the Federal level. </PARA>
<PARA> In the final few minutes available to me, I refer to some current issues. As all honourable members know, there have been disastrous floods on the east coast of Australia and when we talk about the appropriation of funds in this House there is a need to recognise some of the priorities that must be met. People who have been affected hope that the Federal Government will not be shrinking away from its responsibility in the matter of what it will cost to restore roads and bridges, to assist badly affected primary producers and to help those whose homes were flooded or who suffered other similar losses as a result of the cyclone and the very heavy flooding that occurred on the east coast in recent days. Too often a headline, a quick announcement and some inference that something is being done are the beginning and the end of recognition of this need. Flood mitigation and many other ongoing requirements should be given priority and that priority should be related to community needs and to productivity, as part and parcel of the good government and proper management of this country. Tragically, that is not a consistent approach on the part of this Government. I deplore the fact that it is so easy for the Government to make a statement that makes it sound as though all is well, but if one goes and looks at what is being achieved, it turns out to be otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I mentioned that primary industry needs to be given support to ensure that productivity is at the highest possible level, with one consideration basic to that. The prosperity of primary industry determines the nation's capacity to earn foreign exchange that is so badly needed by this Government and by every Australian. Every time one hears of disruptions in the beef industry, for example, currently occurring in abattoirs, increasing the nation's difficulty in maintaining contractual arrangements with the Japanese market, it reflects on and unfortunately reduces the nation's capacity for export earnings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Lyne reminds the House, this is at a time of good seasons. There is no room for this sort of thing. I say again that, if there are to be wage advantages, they should be fairly conditional on those who get wage increases and increments sharing the responsibility for productivity and consistency, particularly in the matter of supply to world markets of this country's goods and services. The same can be said, of course, about a range of other industries, of which the sugar industry is but one. Time does not permit me in this debate to traverse all of the aspects. Today the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) welcomed the decisions that had come from international negotiations flowing from the Cairns Round of trade talks. That is all very well. Members of the Opposition applaud that, but let honourable members remember that there is a 25 years' lead time before we achieve real results. That is a very long time in the life of any industry or any participant in that industry and certainly in the life of any individual farmer. In the meantime, the Government should assist primary industry so that it can in the long run take the advantages that the changed trade negotiations will make possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I remind the House that the financial structure of the nation is fundamental to every individual, and the responsibility which devolves upon the Treasurer and the Prime Minister to ensure fairness, equity and reality is very great indeed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought for a moment that we might have been about to hear something definite from the honourable member for Page (Mr Ian Robinson) about the Opposition's position on wages policy or perhaps something definite about expenditure cuts that the Opposition might make in the unlikely event that it should form a government, but that was not to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This evening I join this debate to congratulate the Government on the contribution that it has made to expanding higher education in this country and, in particular, to congratulate the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) on the recent statistics covering enrolments in higher education for this year. These figures were released on Thursday last and they show the highest growth rate in student numbers for 15 years. Full time enrolments this year are up by 24,600, an increase of almost 10 per cent. In addition, part time and external enrolments have increased. The number of students commencing courses has increased by 8.3 per cent to 182,000. The figures also show that more women than ever are now participating in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has now delivered the first instalment of the additional places promised as part of the higher education package announced last year with the introduction of the higher education contribution scheme. Fifty thousand more places are to come over the next three years. The response to these additional places and the enrolment figures should silence the critics of the higher education contribution scheme. We all recall that last year predictions were made that this scheme would discourage potential students and drive enrolments down. Quite clearly, the opposite is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures also call into question the Opposition's higher education policy. As far as I understand it, that policy consists of four elements: first, the abolition of the higher education contribution scheme; secondly, a freeze on the number of government funded places in higher education; thirdly, the imposition of a charge amounting to full fees for any additional places above those frozen; and, finally, a system of competitive entry for the limited number of free places. </PARA>
<PARA> On the evidence, any move to abolish the higher education contribution scheme clearly should be resisted because that scheme has been accepted. Its implementation this year has been reasonably smooth. I have some criticism. I have evidence that some institutions have been failing to make part timers aware of the option of deferred payment but, by and large, the implementation of that scheme has been reasonably smooth. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the Opposition's plan to freeze the number of government funded places, we have no information from the Opposition yet on what the base would be. Would it be the number of government funded places at the time of announcement, in other words, back in 1988; would it be the number now, that is, 451,000; or would it be the number at the time when the Opposition eventually wins office? If it is the last I expect that, by that time, the Opposition front bench will have passed on and, hopefully, we would have a new coalition policy. Certainly the Opposition could not maintain funding at current levels with its current policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal to impose full fees for any additional places faces enormous difficulties. If the experience with Bond University in its first year is any guide at all, there is enormous difficulty in getting any enrolments in full fee paying courses. Bond University, despite an expensive advertising campaign, had great trouble in attracting numbers to those courses. The question of competition for free places means essentially that if students, irrespective of their circumstances, win a free place they pay nothing. Again, if they do not win a free place, irrespective of their financial circumstances, they pay the lot. The lot in these terms means, on average, around $7,000 a year for a tertiary course. Surely it is fairer for everybody to pay a little. Under the higher education contribution scheme they do that when they can afford it-that is, after graduation and not as an up-front payment. In that way all applicants can participate in the system on an equal basis. That is a fairer system and that is certainly the way the Government sees it. On all the evidence, that is the way students and the general population see it as well. </PARA>
<PARA> This evening I would also like to draw some attention to the Government's achievements in the technical and further education (TAFE) sector. While the major contribution for technical and further education rests with the States, nevertheless the Commonwealth provides substantial financial assistance in this field. In 1989 over $325m will be provided to the States for TAFE, subject to resource agreements. This year $180m will be provided in direct grants for improved infrastructure in TAFE, including five new colleges, additions to a further 57 colleges, $6m for child-care centres in TAFE, money for upgrading equipment, the provision of student residences and the building of centres for Aboriginal vocational programs. In addition, $127m will be provided in general recurrent grants, $4.2m will be provided for the advanced English for migrants program and $4.6m will be provided to promote adult literacy and numeracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government, participation in TAFE has grown steadily. Since we came to office an additional 150,000 students have taken their places in vocational courses in TAFE. There has been steady growth in all age groups except the 15 to 19-year-olds, for whom increased school retention has, quite naturally, caused a reduction in TAFE participation. Students in this age group have chosen increasingly to stay on and enjoy the benefits of full secondary eduction, to the point where almost twice as many students are proceeding to year 12 now as there were in the years before we took office. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, in the TAFE, unmet demand is a growing problem. It is difficult to measure unmet demand in TAFE because statistics vary from State to State. But, as an example, in Queensland last year an estimated 49,000 applicants were unable to gain places in TAFE colleges. There is certainly a problem in unmet demand in TAFE in my own electorate and it concerns, in particular, the Penrith College of Technical and Further Education. By way of background, the Penrith TAFE college was established 25 years ago. Last year it had an enrolment of 6,400. As one might expect, its accommodation is getting old. The college is suffering from a shortage of space. It occupies a relatively small site and the space available is not being used to the best effect, to the point where the college needs to lease space elsewhere in Penrith. But it is a very valuable and convenient site; it is only two minutes from the railway station. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time there has been an unstated but quite evident desire by the New South Wales TAFE authorities to sell this site, in spite of a very strong local view that Penrith college should be retained and modernised so as to keep the advantages of the central location close to public transport, which is particularly important for students without their own transport. The advantages are obvious, especially for female students using the college at night. This question of the future of the college arose during the State election campaign last year and the then Labor member for Penrith, Peter Anderson, met with students and with the staff of the college and settled the question very quickly. However, there have been a number of recent developments which are of importance. After the election of the Greiner Government in March last year the rumours persisted that the desire of the New South Wales TAFE authorities was to dispose of the college and to sell the site. Those rumours intensified and became increasingly important in the local community. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of response, in November last year the college committee under its Chairman, Allan Fisher, produced a very important document entitled College Profile and Five Year Plan. It is a very good document that spelt out in some detail the needs of the local community and the role that the Penrith College of TAFE should play in meeting those needs. At the same time, in November last year, the college committee issued an important document entitled Penrith City's College of TAFE-An Investment in the Future. This shorter document gave details of the achievements of the college over the last 25 years: the fact that it had prepared in that time more than 75,000 students for their working lives; the contribution that the college had made to the work skills base; the college's social investments in terms of its work in adult literacy, in training of the deaf, and in its English as a second language classes; and the contribution that the college had made to the programs of other agencies, including the Commonwealth Employment Service, the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, the Department of Social Security, the Department of Community Services and Health, the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services and the Foundation for Disabled. The college has done an excellent job in servicing the needs of all those organisations. For example, for many years the college has conducted cookery and catering classes for the trainees at the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services' establishment at Emu Plains. It has been my pleasure to go along to the graduation dinners where, after a six-week cookery class, the trainees have put on a very nice evening, with some entertainment and a pleasant meal, for local guests. So the college is doing a great job for the local community. </PARA>
<PARA> The document also argued that the efficient and equitable delivery of services depended on the retention of the central site that I mentioned. In the words of the statement, the site represents a commitment of those who work in Penrith; it is convenient for those who work in Penrith; and it provides assistance for those who rely on the nearby public transport systems to get to their classes. The statement was circulated among the local community for endorsement. A number of people in the local community signed it, including people from local industry, the Chamber of Commerce, local banks and building societies, the local council and a whole range of government agencies. Local members of parliament also signed the statement in support of the college. Local State members, including Tony Aquilina, the local member for Mulgoa; Anne Cohen, the Liberal member for Minchinbury; Kevin Rozzoli, the Liberal member for Hawkesbury and Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, signed the statement, as did I. Unfortunately, there was one notable exception and that was the Liberal member for Penrith, Mr Guy Matheson. He declined to sign the statement. Even when pressed to sign it, he refused to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> It was at that stage that the plot began to thicken, because I think that Mr Matheson may have seen the writing on the wall as it was in February this year that the New South Wales Education Minister, Dr Metherell, released a discussion paper entitled Future Options for Penrith College of TAFE. That future options paper consisted of a preamble and eight options for the future of the college. The preamble is an unremarkable piece of work. It details things that locally we all know, such as that there is great population growth in the region and that there is considerable growth in the labour force in the region. The local labour force has more than doubled in the last 15 years. The preamble mentions government priorities which, again, are beyond criticism. The State Government is committed, the document states, to increasing educational opportunities and widening educational choice in the region. The preamble also details the important challenge facing the college. Currently there is a local unmet demand of 5,000-5,000 people who applied last year could not be admitted-plus 25,000 who have been identified as living in the region but who have to travel to colleges in the inner city because the courses that they choose are not available locally. So there is a direct unmet demand of 5,000 plus a potential additional 25,000. Finally, the preamble to the options paper mentions the demand on the three existing TAFE facilities in the outer west. Those existing facilities consist of three small colleges of which Penrith is the largest. </PARA>
<PARA> On reading the preamble of the options paper, one sees that it makes an excellent case for the provision of an expanded and modern college at Penrith. The eight options which follow the preamble are, therefore, a major disappointment. Option 1 is essentially for the status quo with a minor upgrading: it is the no change option. Options 5, 6, 7 and 8 are variations on a common theme and rely on the transfer of courses and students out of Penrith and into other colleges: in other words, they are four options for the disposal of Penrith TAFE. Option 2 is for the redevelopment of the current site by 1994 at a cost of $28m but to accommodate only 600 extra students. Option 3 is for the redevelopment of the current site, plus the adjoining site, at a cost of $46m to accommodate 1,600 extra students by the year 2012. Option 4 is for the disposal of the current site and development of a new college on a new site at a cost of $42m to provide 5,600 extra places by the year 2012. The assumption on which the options are based is that there will be no change over that time in the availability of State and Commonwealth funds and no change in existing State and Commonwealth spending priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The paper offers no background to the costings, so it is difficult to assess their validity. However, I would make three points: first, a simple subtraction of option 2 from option 3 would reveal that, while redevelopment of the existing site is estimated at $28m, the purchase and development of an equivalent area next door is estimated to cost only $18m. The conclusion to which I am drawn is that the $28m for the redevelopment of the college on the existing site is a very much inflated figure. Secondly, the $42m for option 4, which involves the purchase of a new site and the sale of the present and very valuable site, is presumably a net figure-that is, inclusive of the proceeds of the sale of the existing site. That is also probably an inflated figure. Finally, the estimate for the construction periods extending to the year 2012 in options 3 and 4 is also an inflated figure. Therefore, I suggest that the options paper for the future of Penrith College of TAFE is a loaded document. It has been loaded in favour of the disposal of this valuable property by the New South Wales Government in favour of a decision which will disadvantage the local community and, in particular, those students who use public transport to get to courses after working hours. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I offer Dr Metherell another solution. As his own options paper says, 25,000 students from the region travel to inner city colleges because they cannot obtain the courses that they follow locally. I suggest to Dr Metherell that he sell one of those inner city colleges and use the proceeds from the sale to construct a modern, expanded college in Penrith to meet the needs of this important, growing community. There are plenty of parallels in recent experience. One can remember Laurie Brereton, when Minister for Health in New South Wales, spearheading the beds to the west campaign, closing down wards and hospitals in the inner city to open up wards and provide additional beds in hospitals in the outer west where the people are. This Government has followed a similar policy by agreeing to fund the proposed University of Western Sydney in my electorate to bring higher education places close to where the students are and to build up that institution into a great university closer to the centre of population development in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, a movement in TAFE places would achieve a solution to the problem that I have gone through in some detail in the House tonight. It has been done with hospital beds. We are doing it as well with higher education places. I believe that the New South Wales Government should do it with TAFE. It can be done. It should be done by Dr Metherell in New South Wales to benefit those many people in my electorate who travel to inner city colleges at the moment. It is a disgrace that the New South Wales Government should be considering closing down a TAFE college in an area which so desperately needs the provision of extra places. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will move directly to the subject matter of the debate before the House, the Appropriation Bills, which provide for a net additional appropriation of $217.8m. These inevitably raise the central issue of the Government's economic policy. This debate is taking place in the immediate run-up to the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) this Wednesday night on the wage-tax package. A genuine trade-off of tax cuts for a lesser wage rise was a central feature of the Treasurer's last August Budget strategy. But in realistic terms what we will hear about on Wednesday night is the `best' package acceptable to the unions; that is, to the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the union arm of this ALP-ACTU Government-the bribe in short to keep the unions cooperative until after an election to be brought on as soon as possible after the 1 July tax cuts, which are part of the package, come into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we will not hear about is that, in the current state of play-that is, the failure of the Treasurer's economic policy-even the minimum package available in this sense will increase disposable incomes quite significantly and thus, with the Government committed to a high interest rate policy as the sole tool of economic policy, will require interest rates to rise still further. A housing mortgage interest rate of 17 per cent and even 18 per cent, as was suggested by the shadow Minister for finance, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), this afternoon, is already being talked about. That would mean an increase of 4 1/2 percentage points, from 13 1/2 per cent to 18 per cent, in the home mortgage rate over the past 12 months. That would add of the order of $70 a week to the average mortgage of $80,000. All that is in the context of this morning's news that house mortgage repayments are taking 40 per cent of the gross income of the average Sydney household. The cost of mortgage repayments is already up $40 a week. In that sense the average Australian has been hit in advance, so to speak, for tax cuts of the princely order of $20 a week on average. So we will get tax cuts, but interest rates will then be jacked up further by this Government. What is given by the one hand will be taken away by the other, or by several hands at once, as my colleague put it this afternoon, as there follows a renewed impetus to inflation, as tax is clawed back by bracket creep, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I talked a moment ago of this Treasurer's failed economic policies, but it is not just me, as an Opposition member, who has done so. I want to recall to the House some of the headlines of recent weeks. Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald in mid-February made a front-page criticism of the Government's policy with the headline, `Keating has lost control'. Mike Steketee at the same time put it as follows: `Suddenly, Paul Keating, the master strategist, has no new answers, only excuses'. Michael Stutchbury more recently in the Australian Financial Review referred to `The Hawke Government's bungled economic strategy'. In another article just a few weeks back under the heading `What Keating is doing wrong', Ross Gittins further wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating's last [year's] strategy has collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA>`Collapsed' is a very strong word. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> But if he knows his strategy has failed, he isn't admitting it. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very true. We are smothered under a mass of disinformation, as my colleague the shadow Minister put it-or the same thing, not telling it as it is, irresponsibly for low-and by that I mean imminent election-reasons. But not telling it as it is compounds the failure and prejudices a proper attack on the nation's problems. I cite also Professor Barry Hughes, former personal economic adviser to the Treasurer. After an exhaustive analysis of the balance of payments figures for the finance house First Boston Australia Ltd, Hughes concluded that the economic outlook as seen from the perspective of the balance of payments is much worse than the Government has indicated. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> The underlying annualised deficit is probably in the vicinity of $16.75 billion-clearly well beyond the bounds of sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course it is. It amounts to this country going further into hock every day to the tune of $50m-from this time yesterday till now, an extra $50m into hock. That level of profligate living beyond our means and borrowing from foreigners or selling them the farm is just not on. </PARA>
<PARA> The patently failed policies of the Treasurer, for which he bears a heavy responsibility-though in his campaign of disinformation he blames just about everyone or everything but himself-is sufficiently evidenced by two statistics. The first is the massive balance of payments deficit to which I have just referred-$14, $15 or $16 billion for 1988-89 compared with the $9.5 billion laid down in the last August Budget. The Treasurer has not much credibility left. The second statistic is the resurgence of inflation-7 to 8 per cent as measured by the consumer price index and over 9 per cent as measured by the implicit price deflator of the recent national accounts. This is the highest level in the industrialised world just when, as the House will readily appreciate, in order to trade our way out of the balance of payments situation we need a lower price-cost structure than our trading partners, not a higher one, so that our export products will sell better and more profitably and we can compete more effectively with imports. </PARA>
<PARA> The massive balance of payments deficit is in part the result of the evident overheating of the economy-building and construction, motor vehicles and other sectors all going at it too strongly-but that in itself owes much to the political manipulation of interest rates by the Treasurer in the context of the 1987 election and again in the latter part of 1987 through to the New South Wales election in March of 1988. But what has happened? The Government is making no serious effort to cool the situation via fiscal policy; that is, via reducing its own expenditure. That is too hard. I see the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) is in the House. He should not tell me that this cannot be done. I just recall for the House the statement made by his colleague the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh. He referred to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . 200 bloody programs-</PARA>
<PARA>the French is his-</PARA>
<PARA>that can't be justified on social justice, equity or economic efficiency grounds . . . </PARA>
<PARA>which could be cut. I repeat that the Government does nothing in terms of reducing its own spending to cool the situation and, further, it encourages expectations of tax cuts and wage increases. The Government is obliged in that context to fall back on a high interest rate policy-monetary policy-as the sole tool of so-called macro-economic policy. But that fouls it all up. The Hawke Government and the Treasurer go for very high interest rates to slow the economy. The high interest rates, apart from their adverse impact on individuals, damage the economy by pushing up the Australian dollar and making Australian industry less competitive, adversely affecting much needed exports and import-competing Australian production. They also damage the economy by cutting into business investment. In that context I would say that recent optimistic investment figures, especially those relating to expected investment, reflect earlier times of lower interest rates and higher confidence and will come off the boil soon enough in the face of ever higher interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> That is how the Treasurer's policy has fouled up. The impact of it all on Australians is, as the measure the Opposition has put forward indicates, that a family on average weekly earnings would require in the order of $58 a week extra to restore the same level of living that applied in 1983 when this Government came to power. That is the impact on the taxpayer, who is taxed to the eyeballs, one might say, and shafted by these high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this is in the area of so-called macro-economic policy, policy for the economy as a whole, basically managing total demand in the economy. But tied in with it is the Labor Party's failure-its very incapacity, I will come back to that-to address so-called micro-economic policy, that is, needed structural change and increased market efficiency. That is what we are talking about there. In simple terms, one can say that this area of policy is all about the freeing up of supply, supply increasing, increasing productivity and total production. Though it is longer term, this nevertheless is where important emphasis needs to be in all of this. If we have too much demand, the first and immediate response is to reduce total demand-in the so-called macro area. But it is a more constructive, more beneficial and, ultimately, less painful exercise to think in terms of freeing up, increasing supply, increasing productivity, that is, the output per person and therefore total production. That, I repeat, is what so-called micro-economic policy, is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many aspects of policy in this area. I nominate, first, the labour market. There is an urgent need to free up the rigid, inflexible, centralised Australian wages and industrial relations system. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9G4">Dr HARRY EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice the reaction of the honourable member for Calwell. We had an instance of that in this House only last week when we were talking about Qantas Airways Ltd. With the extra rigidity of the much vaunted accord, we had the spectacle of Qantas being unable to recruit and retain engineering staff. Some of these engineers change shock absorbers in a K-Mart store for higher pay, with less stress and responsibility. That is one of a myriad of instances than can be cited. Closely related is the whole issue of unreasonable restrictive work practices. There are the major manifestations of these issues in such contexts as communications, land transport, the waterfront and coastal shipping. Who is not aware of the situation in coastal shipping, where it costs more to ship milk powder from Tasmania to Melbourne than it does to ship it from Tasmania to Taiwan, or it costs as much to ship newsprint from Hobart to Sydney as it does to ship it from Hobart to Tokyo? All of these things impose great additional costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Only last week we had the Inter-State Commission's report on the waterfront identifying a vast array of unreasonable work practices. It proposed changes to arrangements to achieve economy-wide savings of the order of $620m. That translated, on the basis that a dollar of savings usually can result in $2 of extra output, to in excess of $1 billion of extra gross domestic product. That would solve a lot of our problems. But, of course, what happened? Before the report had even seen the public light of day, the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Bill Kelty-it is no longer what Simon says; Bill calls the tune-and the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, Mr Tas Bull, had conferred by telephone, so it was reported, and agreed to reject the package of proposals outright. </PARA>
<PARA> While generally I would prefer to stress the positive aspects of the coalition's industrial relations policy-especially the conclusion of voluntary work agreements for increased productivity and thus higher wages for employees, better profits for employers, and higher output, especially exports, for the nation-if reform in these areas I have mentioned will cost a degree of mayhem in taking on unreasonable union resistance, so be it. That will have to be faced and we will do so, I suggest, with the support of the majority of Australians who want to lift this country out of its present malaise. </PARA>
<PARA> To this list of areas that I have mentioned, I would certainly add privatisation and increased public sector efficiency. Again, when we were discussing Qantas last week we had this matter before us. We heard of the ideological opposition to this from the left wing of the Labor Party. Privatisation is something which is not ideological at all. We are seeking increased efficiency, increased productivity and lower prices for Australian consumers. If those benefits are not to be had, we are not interested. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, we will, of course, see what happens on Wednesday night. But certainly a headline of the Australian Financial Review of 23 March was that the Government was dropping the microreform package that was to be part of this Wednesday's statement. I doubt also that we will see the expenditure cuts which would be essential to validate, to find the economic room for, the tax cuts. The Government, in short, is failing in these vital areas. The problem with this ALP-ACTU Government is the very nature of its major constituencies, namely, the big spending and welfare lobbies, and the trade unions. We can add to that, when it comes to the benefits and efficiencies of privatisation, the implacable ideological opposition of the left wing of the Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The imperative necessity for this nation in order to secure its future is to produce more, but ourselves to consume less, saving more, at all events for a time, and in effect sell the difference overseas. There is no other way of overcoming the balance of payments deficit, and stopping the increase and winding back our frightening overseas debt. When it comes to meeting that imperative necessity, it is uphill for this Labor Government, because of the nature of its constituencies. The present paralysis of policy shows this. I suggest that there is only one recipe for the nation, and that is to change the Government at the upcoming election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sad thing about the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) is that he never says anything original. He always repeats the point that we have heard over and again from the Opposition. Indeed, if we listen to the speeches that have been made on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1988-89 and cognate Bills we hear the same line regurgitated over and again. There is only one thing wrong with that line that the honourable member for Berowra has not recognised, that is, that these policies were put up at the last Federal election and resoundingly rejected by the people. They rejected this nonsense and will reject it again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Berowra may believe that his support has improved now that we are going through some difficult times. But any such support is temporary and the hypocrisy of his position will be exposed to the Australian people as we approach the election. How can the honourable member pretend to support ordinary workers and their families and at the same time oppose, as he did today, any kind of wage increase? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) also earlier today raved on about how the Opposition was really concerned about people's standards of living. Yet it attacked the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Government for arranging a modest increase in wages to help people meet the increased cost of living and sustain their standards of living. Opposition members say that they are the champions of the standards of living, but everything they say is in fact an attack on the standards of living. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Berowra and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition also said that we could solve all our problems by cutting fiscal spending and cutting more programs. To them, I suppose to cut spending is to cut just a few thousand dollars from specific programs. But these programs are programs for people, pensioners and families. They are programs for health, education, welfare, infrastructure and transport. The Opposition is saying, `Look, we can meet the challenges; we can deal with the economic problems through cutting more programs', which is an idiotic idea. What nonsense to suggest that the Government has not been fiscally responsible. Over the last few years the Government, through the Expenditure Review Committee-a tough committee-has cut out whatever fat existed in the Public Service. To cut any more programs at this stage is to cut programs which affect people's standards of living. Let us be very clear that that is what the Opposition is talking about. It would make program cuts which would mean an increase in poverty, inequality and disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> We have these pat formulas produced by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is so poor in his economic thinking that he made a statement to the House the other day during discussion of a matter of public importance that Australia had one of the highest levels of government business enterprises in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). That is how foolish and ignorant he is. He does not even know what he is talking about in the area of economics. To solve Australia's problems the Opposition then puts forward remedies which have been proved to be disastrous in other countries. They have in fact led to an increase in poverty and, most importantly, in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House of what happened in Britain. In the first years of the Thatcher Government, when policies similar to the ones advocated by the honourable member for Berowra, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) were put into place, the total number of people out of work tripled. If there is a single cause of inequality and poverty, it is the creation of un-employment. The Opposition wants to bring in these sorts of nonsense policies which have been shown not to work and which would lead to disastrous consequences in the form of poverty and unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course there are problems with the current account, but is anything constructive ever heard from any member of the Opposition on how to deal with these problems? One never hears anything. All we hear is that we should take the pressure off interest rates and reduce spending. That is the Opposition's formula. As I pointed out in a recent article in the Age, the Opposition was proposing this formula when the Australian dollar was worth US56c. The same formula was prescribed a few weeks ago when the Australian dollar was worth US86c. Never mind all the changes in the Australian economy in the last 2 1/2 years; the Opposition has got the same ideas and the same prescriptions of cutting programs, reducing monetary spending and introducing the old bogey of privatisation. The Opposition still wants to sell off all public enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the Australian economy is going through a difficult adjustment stage. But let us not forget about the positives in the economy. The problem with the economy is, precisely as the honourable member for Berowra said, due to overheating. The Australian economy is not in a recession or a depression; it is growing too fast. It is a management problem. It is a very different problem, as the Treasurer has often said, from the problems facing those economies with massive recession and huge unemployment. The employment levels in the Australian economy are magnificent. In terms of employment and the economy, the achievement by this Government is unmatched anywhere else in the Western world. There is a level of employment creation which has led to 1.33 million jobs in the last six years. That is the significant difference between our approach and the approach of the ultraconservatives on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA> When investment is moving along at very high levels and there is growth in the economy, certain structural problems result. One problem is that consumer spending is high. Another problem is that spending overseas on bringing in plant and equipment for new factories that are being built for new production has an effect on the current account. We should look at those causes, analyse them and see what proportion is due to the investment boom, what proportion is due to consumer spending, and try to tackle the issues. Surely, the honourable member for Berowra is not saying that we should deal with the current account problem by squeezing the economy and not allowing investment to proceed. I hope he is not saying that. We need to ensure that that investment is directed towards manufacturing industry and productive enterprises. That is happening more and more. So we are going through this temporary phase which is having an impact on the current account. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not to say that there is not some problem with consumption; there is. But the problem with consumption has been overexaggerated. Not enough analysis has been done of the composition of the balance of payments problem. Roughly, 50 per cent the problem is due to the huge investment boom in plant and equipment which is coming into Australia to establish factories and new processes of production. We can deal with the investment problem and the consumption problem in a number of ways. What has the Government been trying to do? It has been trying to reduce demand in the economy, and that has meant causing a bit of pain. It has been trying to encourage savings. The Opposition does not come up with any formulas about how to encourage savings. It does not come up with any formulas about how to reduce consumption, especially conspicuous consumption by the rich. In all the debate on these issues, the only constructive formulas put forward, the only ideas generated, on these questions have come from the Labor Party. The Government is looking at the suggestions. A number of suggestions have been put forward as to how to deal with excessive consumption by the rich and with insufficient savings. But what ideas have come from honourable members opposite? None. We have not heard anything from honourable members opposite except the suggestion I talked about initially, to cut more government programs. We have not heard anything from the Opposition about how to deal with the current account problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Berowra had the impertinence to say that the Government is selling off the farm. It is another example of the Opposition's doubletalk. The Opposition opposed the Government's actions to restrict foreigners buying Australian property and real estate. We brought in that measure. The Opposition cannot deny the fact that it opposed that measure which was intended to ensure that investment went into manufacturing and production rather than into real estate and property, which is unproductive. We brought in that measure, but what does the Opposition say? It attacks us and says that controls should not have been brought in. How can the Opposition, on the one hand, object and say that we are selling off the farm and, on the other hand, object to the policy which was brought in by the Treasurer to ensure that there is a limit on the purchase of Australian property by overseas interests? The Opposition cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the conservative parties believe that they will be able to have it both ways. They realise that people have had to bear certain burdens in this difficult time. So they think `We will tell the people that we will improve their standard of living, improve their lot. At the same time we know very well that the policies and programs we have put forward would lead to huge reductions in the standard of living, to increases in poverty and to reductions in the programs for the needy, for the sick, for the people who need educational assistance and for pensioners'. Programs for all of those people would be cut under the fiscal policies the Oppositions is propounding. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. The honourable member for Berowra should stop shaking his head. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. Its policies are doubletalk. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government in this difficult period-I can say this as a member representing an electorate in which there are many poor people-achieved a great deal in the social justice area, with its social justice strategy. Notwithstanding difficult economic circumstances, we managed to bring in a package worth hundreds of millions of dollars providing direct assistance to poor families. One income families with children are now getting assistance to the value of between $70 and $100 a week tax free. What government since Federation has brought in anything like that? This measure is assisting people in my electorate to raise their standard of living-poor people, people who have never had a fair go. The Opposition says `We are going to cut programs'. Will the Opposition cut the family assistance program? Will the Opposition cut the health program? Will it cut the education program?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me talk about education. We have the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) here tonight. The Minister's Austudy program, helping people of disadvantaged backgrounds to remain at school and to go on to tertiary education, has been magnificent. If honourable members want to see the difference it has made they should visit those areas where formerly under the conservatives less than 10 per cent of people managed to get higher education. I was one of the very few people from a working class area who managed to get higher education, to go to university. The Minister is delivering programs that help poor families to keep their children at school and get them into universities and colleges. We are looking at building universities and colleges where those people live-in the western suburbs of Sydney, in certain areas of Melbourne and other such places. The conservatives never did anything like that. We have the social justice programs on the board. Those programs have helped to raise the standard of living of the poorest sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard a number of speakers here today and this evening complain about the arrangement between the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Government. They say that it is shocking, that it will lead to an increase in wages. There is something wrong with moderate wage increases, according to the conservatives. Every time there has been an attempt to increase wages to keep up with inflation, the conservatives have opposed it. Yet they have the hide to say in this Parliament and on television, `We stand for increasing the standard of living'. What rubbish!</PARA>
<PARA> The wages agreement is a historic agreement with the trade union movement, especially as it relates to the disadvantaged. The poorest workers, the workers on the lowest pay, will get a substantial increase. Minimum wages are going to rise. That is one of the most important social reforms one can put into place if one is interested in equality and social justice. Instead of the Opposition attacking the Government's policy and offering nothing of substance in return, it should have applauded the policy and said, `This policy will make Australia a fairer and a better society'. What is the Opposition offering in wages policy? Today in Question Time the Treasurer said, `We remember 1980-81'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) has just spoken of absurdities. He has certainly spoken absurdities in his attempted justification of the Government's policies. It was a load of codswallop, a load of rubbish. At one stage I heard him admit that the Government was going through a difficult adjustment period. He brought himself to make a slight admission of failure. The honourable member for Calwell went on to attack the Opposition's policies and the philosophical thrust of the Opposition, but proved nothing. He has a socialistic hatred of the concept of privatisation and he just attacked it. He did not look at the concept; he did not acknowledge that his Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Treasurer (Mr Keating) are in favour of privatisation and that the Australian Labor Party is crippled and unable to privatise any government corporations because of the bind it is in with its National Conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member did not acknowledge that, as a result of this, those great businesses that are currently government corporations, Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines, need massive injections of capital to operate, to buy new aeroplanes and to purchase new equipment. They are capital starved. They will not get that desperately needed injection of capital from a government that is short of funds. The Government should privatise both Qantas and Australian Airlines by issuing shares to employees and to the public in the capital markets of Australia so that those enterprises can attract the funds they need to expand, grow and be profitable. That is what is needed. Privatisation is about expanding Qantas and Australian Airlines; about creating jobs in those enterprises; and about giving employees a say in the running of the organisations by giving them the opportunity to be owners of shares in the corporations. But the honourable member opposite has a pathological hatred of workers owning a share in business because he comes from the intellectually dead Socialist Left. </PARA>
<PARA> The only exciting political ideas of this decade are those of the Right, because the Left is intellectually dead and bankrupt. It does not know where to go, as the honourable member opposite showed. The Socialist Left has been deserted in part by the Right in its own government, but the Right is crippled by the power of the Socialist Left and by the power of the trade union movement, so the Government is going nowhere. It is indeed the Opposition that has set the intellectual agenda, created the philosophical climate and developed the exciting new policies going in a new direction for Australia in the 1980s. As we move to the 1990s these are the policies that Australia needs: privatisation of government enterprises such as those to which I just referred, deregulation of the Government sector, and freeing up the free enterprise markets so that businesses can operate free of government interference and government restriction. </PARA>
<PARA> The community, business and employees need a flexible industrial relations policy under which small businesses in particular, are not bound by a centralised wage fixing system over which the small business owner and the small business employee have no control. They want to be free to reach their own bargains and make their own deals-their own small business enterprise based agreements concerning wages, terms and conditions of employment, rostered days off and leave. They want to do that free of centralised control-free from a centralised wage-fixing system and centralised deals done by the Government with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). Those are not the types of restrictions that small business wants or needs. </PARA>
<PARA> This side of politics has set the intellectual agenda and has created the climate in Australia for a move to policies that give freedom to individuals to operate at all levels of the economy. The Government is bogged down. It has borrowed some of our ideas-I guess that is a compliment-but it is bogged down in the area of so-called micro-economic reform. It cannot do anything about the waterfront. Last week some figures were released showing that $630m-odd could be saved in the area of exports if there was reformation on the waterfront. But the waterfront unions went along to the ACTU and the ACTU said that there could be no reforms on the waterfront. The waterfront is vital to exports and imports. It goes without saying that exports are our lifeblood in earning overseas income. The added costs of the waterfront are enormous, but we will not see any tackling of this problem by the Government. We have not seen the Government tackle the high cost of shipping on the Australian coast, again an enormous cost to the Australian economy and one which helps make us uncompetitive among other nations in the global trading world. This is a government that can go no further in the field of deregulation because union bosses have put up their hands and said `No'. It is a government that is crippled, tired and worn out; it has just run out of time. </PARA>
<PARA> The one area in which the Government is doing enormous harm is what should be the dynamic area of small business. The small and medium sized business or enterprise in Australia should be the lifeblood of the economy. Small businesses and the people who own and run them, the small entrepreneurs-from the milk bar two or three doors from my office to the small manufacturing business, farming and businesses in rural and regional towns in Australia-are the backbone of this great nation. In the past small business has been a great contributor to employment growth. I read that small business has generated some 70 per cent of the private sector jobs created in the last four years. We will not get growth in the public sector, and we will not get it in the large corporate sector, basically because it is cutting back or rationalising its numbers. The future of this country lies in a dynamic and prosperous small business sector. That is the future of Australia and it is under threat and attack today. </PARA>
<PARA> The major threat to small business today is the enormously high interest rates it is charged by the banks and others from which it has to borrow for its capital requirements and working capital. High interest rates are hurting small business. Throughout the land, small business is the first to feel the effect of and the first to be squeezed by high interest rates. High interest rates are biting into profits; they mean that there will not be investment by small business. It is only through such investment that we will get the job creation so necessary for a dynamic Australia. What this Government is doing to small business is a tragedy. In the 24 March edition of the Business Review Weekly I saw that the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which is inquiring into small business, the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), said that the Committee had pinpointed two main areas for change: in the sales tax regulations and collections and in capital gains tax. That is an interesting admission and I hope that the Committee reports in that way. Its Chairman is reported as saying that the sales tax regulations have resulted in enormous bottlenecks for small business and the capital gains tax has created enormous confusion. I congratulate this Government member on his admission about the effect of sales tax and capital gains tax on the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal first with sales tax. The regulations need to be made simpler and less confusing. At a time of high interest rates it enables us to focus on the real need for reform in the Sales Tax Act when the small business proprietor or owner of an individual enterprise has to pay sales tax within 21 days. In these days of high interest rates, squeezes and debtors not paying on time-in fact going from 30 to 60, 90 or even 120 days to pay-the squeeze for working capital is on the small business which has to go to the bank and borrow at high interest rates. That business has to borrow in order to pay the sales tax which is payable in 21 days when the business will not be paid for 60 or 90 days. In some cases if the debt is $1,000 or $2,000 that small business may have to wait a year because many debtors know that it is not worth that small business going to court to sue for such an amount. It would cost more than the debt was worth to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the situation in which small business is placed. There is a need for urgent reform of the sales tax system, which is grossly unfair, especially in relation to the small business sector. Payment of sales tax within 21 days may have been a reasonable requirement 30, 40 or 50 years ago when everyone paid his debts on time but, as the nature of business and of payment by debtors has changed, sales tax legislation has remained fixed and firm and it definitely needs changing. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area to which the Chairman of the Committee referred in a statement in the Business Review Weekly of 24 March is that of capital gains tax reform. I could not agree more. I refer to a submission by the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, known as COSBOA, and an Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) Budget overview submission. I agree with the point it makes when it calls for `the goodwill gained from the sale of a business to be exempt from capital gains tax if rolled over as start-up or working capital in another business within 12 months, or into a retirement benefit fund'. </PARA>
<PARA> COSBOA is pointing to the plight of small family businesses or family farms where all members of the family work enormously long hours-no 40-hour week for them, no rostered days off, no maternity leave, none of the other benefits that their employees might get. They work their guts out to make a living for the family to benefit Australia and, in doing those long hours late into the night and at weekends, they build up the business and increase its value. In fact, the value of that business in many ways is wages or salaries forgone for them. The time and effort that they have put in on weekends, late at night and after hours have built up the capital of that business because income forgone becomes capital. Then the business is subject to the capital gains tax provisions of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a matter that I raised at the time the capital gains tax legislation was brought in by this Government and it is an anomaly that needs fixing. It is a disincentive squarely facing the small business sector. Clearly, it discriminates against the small business sector and is a disincentive to investment and to people to work hard to build up a business, sell it and pay tax at the top marginal rate on the capital gain on that business. For example, if a person has a franchise on a 7-11 store, local milk bar or small manufacturing business and has worked hard he or she may pay capital gains tax on the goodwill of that business that has been built up over the years. I think that is absolutely outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, interest rates are hurting and squeezing small business today. There is an urgent need that the small business sector get relief by the Government's bringing into place policies that allow a low interest rate regime in Australia. The interest bill saps the entrepreneurial spirit and confidence of small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> In the limited time available I will just refer to suggestions about corporate tax changes. Taxpayer, a publication of the Australian Taxpayers Association, in May last year pointed out the possibility of and the potential for company tax changes that lift taxable incomes with tax rate cuts and offsets only for companies and discriminate against individual taxpayers who run small businesses. In fact, the individuals who are paying tax at the higher rates will be hit by a double whammy. That is why there is an urgent need for tax rates in this country to be reduced to create incentive across the board, especially for those individuals who do not have a corporate structure in running a small business. We need productivity in this country. We are losing productivity-that is, the efficiency with which we produce goods and services. We are falling behind and the Government's centralised approach will make that worse. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that this Government's wage-tax deal will get us nowhere. It will be destroyed by inflation because by June next year the average Australian on average weekly earnings with a dependent spouse and two children will still be at least $50 per week worse off than when the Hawke Government came into power-an indictment of this Government and an indication of its failed policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say I always enjoy listening to the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton). He comes up with some lulus from time to time and, with all due respect to him, I must say his arguments were somewhat convoluted tonight. He gave the perfect example of why there should be a capital gains tax. He told this House that small business people worked long hours and did not take the effort of work value at the time by way of income which would have been taxable. Rather, the income accumulated by the way of capital. Somehow the honourable member then suggests that, if one can achieve this by way of a taxation system, capital therefore should not be treated as income at the time the business is sold. I have never heard a better reason for the imposition of a capital gains tax given in this House. For many people, capital is income. It goes back to the basis of the share market when only a few years ago major institutions had the opportunity to cause a run on a particular share, increase the value of those shares, then sell on the market, make many millions of dollars profit by way of capital gain and pay no tax on it. This afternoon I heard the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) say that the coalition parties, when they come to government, will abolish the capital gains tax. I suggest that it would be wonderful to see them try to do that. Also they would abolish the fringe benefits tax. What about the assets test; will they abolish it as well?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is suggested that the coalition parties, if elected to government, will write off a billion dollars of revenue and at the same time they will cut Commonwealth expenditure and somehow they are going to cut taxes further than we are going to do. If any person with a reasonable degree of intelligence sits back and analyses what members of the Opposition are saying, he will find that they are going to take over a billion dollars from revenue and cut taxes further than the Government proposes to do, which further reduces revenue, and at the same time they will cut the revenue base, and yet somehow Australian families will be better off. That, surely, is the most magical wand that has ever been waved in this place. God help the nation if ever the coalition parties get the chance to put their proposals into practice, because they will not work. </PARA>
<PARA> I have listened to many speeches in the last couple of days when the Appropriation Bill was being debated and have heard a lot of nonsense about small business, for the most part from people who have never been small businessmen-people who never ran a small business. The honourable member for Higgins, I gather, was a corporate lawyer who worked for a large corporate organisation. The honourable member for Mayo, on the other hand, was a public servant. Those honourable members come into this House whingeing about small business, never having conducted one in their life, never having been on the ground. Let me tell them, I have been there and I have done it. I know what I am talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition talk about the predatory practices of government and the regulations of government. When they do, we on this side of the House sit back and smile. Why are there regulations? Why has this Parliament-not just this Government-over the last two decades regulated business and regulated the marketplace? Why have all governments in this country done that? At the moment I am a member of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which is inquiring into insider trading. We have taken evidence from various commercial organisations and business representatives who are calling for further regulation of the securities market. At the same time, members of the Opposition say they are going to get rid of all the regulations, while business in this country-including small business-says to this Parliament clearly, `We want more regulation of the securities market because insider training is rife. It is wrong. The only way to stop it is for this Parliament to pass laws to regulate the industry even further'. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members opposite stop and think about it, the reason that business men are saying that to this Parliament is that they want the playing field level and the market will not level it by itself. The so-called free enterprise system that is so often bandied about this place is a nonsense. It may be written up in all the textbooks. Honourable members can read John Stuart Mill, Adam Smith and all the rest of the economists of the eighteenth century; they can look at the laissez faire system and find the South Seas bubble, of course, and they will find Salomon's case when the companies were first established as a principle and since then every government in the world has passed regulations in an attempt to make the so-called free enterprise system work. That is why we regulate. It is not because anyone on this side of the House or on the other side believes that regulations per se are desirable.</PARA>
<PARA> God help the country should the day ever come when some magical means is found of tearing up all the regulations that this Parliament has passed since 1901 and all the regulations State parliaments have passed, and getting rid of them all. Members of the Opposition know and I know and everyone in this place knows, as the marketplace knows, that there would be chaos and there would be predatory practices. Small business would be decimated by the big players. The securities industry would be full of rogues and criminals. The banks would take over and there would be no marketplace. The economy would be hopeless. That is the reality and that is why parliaments throughout the world regulate. We need to be very careful about how we regulate, but we need to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Trade Practices Act for? It is a regulation. It is to try to make a fair and free marketplace. It is trying to level the playing field for small business and big business. It is trying to make the playing field level for consumers as against corporate practices which are demonstrably wrong, and no-one on the other side of the House would disagree with that. No member of the Opposition says that the Government should get rid of the Trade Practices Act and its regulations which are passed as a result of that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did this Parliament pass the security regulations? It was because neither the Government nor the private sector trusts the predatory practices of the securities industry. Business wants that sort of legislation. Business comes to this Parliament and says, `There are wrong things occurring in the securities industry. Pass laws and regulate it'. So we do it, to try to level the playing field-often not terribly successfully. Why does the Government have company laws? Why increasingly since Salomon's case have countries throughout the world with monotonous regularity passed more and more increasingly complex legislation and regulations to try to level the playing field, to try to make business operate within a fair and competitive environment? That is why this country has company laws and company regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The States have health Acts and health Act regulations enforced by local government and health inspectors. Why do governments pass such laws? It is because, if they do not, they know that there are enough people out there in the free enterprise market, the marketplace, who will sell foodstuffs that will kill, items which can damage and destroy Australian families. Honourable members know that, because it is happening. So we pass health Acts and we pass regulations under the health Acts. No-one complains about that. Why should they? It is done to assist Australian families to survive in a very predatory area. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard a lot about taxation laws in the last couple of days from Opposition spokesmen. Why do we have such complex laws today and why do we have such complex regulations? Why was it necessary to legislate for the fringe benefits tax? Why was it necessary to increase the powers of substantiation? It was because the people out there were rorting the system, because it was not a fair taxation system that the Labor Government inherited. It was a system under which wage earners were paying 80 per cent of total tax revenues in this country, while large corporate raiders were paying no tax. Honourable members tend to forget that, while Labor has been in office, corporate tax revenues have increased by 24 per cent in the last 12 months. The Government is now collecting a fairer proportion of taxes from those people who, if there were not increased taxation laws and regulations, would pay no tax. The current inquiry by a standing committee on the use of tax havens by Australian companies is demonstrating again-if it ever needed to be demonstrated-that the so-called free enterprise people, the so-called market people who want level playing fields, will rort the system if they get the chance. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us face it; the marketplace is not a very nice place to be in. Sometimes I hear honourable members come into this House with whingeing voices. I do not accuse the honourable member for Higgins of that. I have never heard him whinge. But when I hear the tones of the people over the radio they sound very whingeing indeed. As I said, I hear honourable members whingeing and complaining about what this Government is doing to small business, and those members never put their mouth and their money where there principles lie. They are people who have taken the easy path through life. They have never gone out and tried to make a living sitting in an office by themselves, having borrowed money and employed people. When I hear that, I really wonder what the Opposition is up to and I wonder about the capacity of members of the Opposition to understand small business. </PARA>
<PARA> I was not going to talk about those matters. But having listened to some of the speeches I think it is time that we tried to get a rational debate about where we are going as a country. We should not sit back in this place day after day, night after night and hour after hour dealing with the Appropriation Bills listening to nothing other than negativism. I have not heard one positive suggestion from honourable members on the other side of this chamber as to which they are doing since the Appropriation debate started. I have heard a lot of whinges and a lot of complaints. </PARA>
<PARA> We tend to forget that honourable members opposite had 30 years in government. So if they say that we are wrong a lot of that blame can be carried forward from them. Despite the whinges, the complaints and the howls day in and day out, it is impossible to get any debate with them. We cannot even debate tax with them because they will not tell us what their tax policy is-if they have one. We cannot debate the economy with them because they will not tell us what their fiscal policy is-if they have one. We cannot debate deregulation with them because we do not know what they mean when they talk about regulation and we do not know what their policy is-if they have one. </PARA>
<PARA> They come into this chamber day in and day out and we are quite happy and prepared to debate issues with them in a rational way. They have never put a policy or a positive statement on the table about what they would do in those areas. Frankly, I can say, after four years in this place, that it is no wonder that they sit on the Opposition benches. I can say quite frankly to any person who is listening to this speech or who will read it down the track that it frightens the pants off me to think that it is ever possible that some of those people opposite could actually sit on the Treasury benches. Frankly, it really worries me. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past I have had respect for many of the present members of the Opposition when they were in government. I think some Liberal governments have achieved quite wonderful things. In my youth I was a Menzies fan. I must confess that in recent times, having studied that period, I wonder where we went wrong. We must go back to that period and ask why the Government of the day had no policy for the future. Nevertheless, I certainly had respect for the Menzies era. It is very hard when we come into this place and listen to the carping, whingeing people on the other side refusing to put a policy on the table and refusing to debate an issue to have much respect for them and to have any real belief that they have anything that they can offer to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the trade debate. Any person who thinks about it seriously realises that our future lies in Asia. I see people waving the Australian flag; I hear people talking about Future Directions, which is historical, and I hear people talking about the past as they bandy Margaret Thatcher around the place. But the reality is that the British joined the European Economic Community (EEC) and they dumped this country economically. The British dumped us in the trade area and they took the path, which no doubt suits them, and I do not criticise them for that. But that era is over for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Americans are not the least bit interested in Australia as a country unless it suits their own purposes. Anyone in this House who thinks that the Americans will necessarily do this country a favour really has rocks in his head and I say that without criticising the United States. Why should the United States bend over backwards? We are of no great interest to it except as a defence base and a handy ally around the place. If it comes to the economic crunch the Americans will not give two bob for us and they will dump us and look after their own trade interests if it suits their purposes. The Japanese buy from us because we are a suitable and a handy market and we have the resources available. </PARA>
<PARA> Asia is growing at an enormous rate. By the year 2000, Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand will each have seen huge growth, far beyond even average Asian growth rates. The wealthy segment of their populations will be larger than Australia's total population. Many of us have been to Thailand in particular and we know what is happening there. I will relate an incident which occurred at Christmas when I was having lunch with a shareholder of the Bangkok Bank-a very lovely, intelligent lady who was educated at a private school in Sydney. I might add that this bank is entering into joint ventures in Australia. It is interested in investing in Australia and it is interested in joint ventures in Thailand with Australian companies. Over lunch that lady asked me about Australia's apartheid policy. How embarrassing it is for an Australian politician to sit in a foreign country, to be hosted for lunch by an intelligent woman educated at a private school in Australia and to be asked about Australia's apartheid policy. Frankly, the debate last year on Asian immigration has unarguably done this country great harm in an area where, undoubtedly, our future trade and economic interests lie. The tragedy still is that people like Mr Ruxton are being quoted in the Bangkok press, in the English language newspapers. Even when I was there at Christmas Mr Ruxton was reported in the English language Bangkok Post. </PARA>
<PARA> I sometimes find it strange that people live in the past. I can understand why many Australians have very strong views about some Asian countries. I happen to take an interest in the Second World War. Whilst I was too young to participate in it, I would suggest that I know my Second World War history better than most other Australians in my age group. I visited Hellfire Pass and I understand why any person who put time in in the Hellfire Pass and on the Thai-Burma railway would be very unforgiving about what occurred to them for the rest of their lives. I do not blame them, but I did not experience that. I represent a country that has to recreate trade in a world which is distorted and changing. Those people who do not understand that this country has to stand independently on its own two feet and seek new friends around the world and not rely upon our traditional sources of trade unfortunately are living in the past and, regret- tably, will always live in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I firmly believe that, if we are to survive as a nation, it is time that we looked to Asia; it is time that Australian businessmen learnt languages; it is time that Australian business men and women learnt about Asian culture and about the method of doing trade in Asian countries; and it is time that we had representative offices there. Far too many Australian business people flying into countries such as Thailand with a contract in their briefcases walk up to an Asian firm and expect to get a contract signed on the spot and catch an aeroplane back home. They go home wondering why they have not got their contract signed. Sometimes the arrogance of us as a people never ceases to amaze me. It is almost as if we expect the world to bow before us and buy the produce that we have to sell in a world which is increasingly competitive. We will be successful only if we go out and we meet the Asian markets equally with intelligence and with education and they will buy from us; there is no argument about that. Australia is seen as a friendly nation in Asia. Australia is seen as a nation which has a lot to offer in services, in education and in technology and Asian countries want joint ventures with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I had dinner in Melbourne with Dr Arthit, who is the leader of the Community Party of Thailand. He was in Australia desperately looking for joint ventures in education and for assistance in hospital management and in building new hospitals. Businesses in Thailand want Australians to be involved yet we, as a nation, are still not prepared to forget our past, to look to our future and create these new markets. Frankly, it is a worry to me. We do not have time. The EEC increasingly is looking inward. Whatever we manage to achieve in the Uruguay Round in terms of agricultural trade, the reality is that our market to the EEC is very small. We are bit players in markets as large as the EEC and we are bit players in the America market. Those markets look to each other rather than to us. Frankly, the time is running out for this country unless we get off our tails and we actually get out there and become aggressive in those new Asian markets. I implore this Parliament and all members in this House to remember that in future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I do not intend to dwell at too much length on the comments of the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), I must support his comments on the need for future development of Asian-Australian links in terms of our international trade. I was also privileged to be a member of the informal delegation to Thailand that he mentioned and I can confirm some of his comments. In particular I commend his comments regarding the operations of Australian businesses in South East Asia because in many respects Australian business can be its own worst enemy. Dozens of instances could be quoted of Australian businesses going into some Asian markets and literally doing just that. Businesses have gone in with a contract in their briefcase and 24 hours later have left the place wondering why they have not got the business. Until such time as major Australian players are prepared to establish offices in Asian capitals, and until they are prepared to put specialist staff there who learn the customs and business practices of those nations, we can only get the crumbs. If government can do no more than assist to an even greater extent than perhaps it has in the past in being able to provide leadership and direction for Australian businesses to get into some of these ever-expanding markets, the whole situation of government is worth while.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are tremendous opportunities for Australian businesses in South East Asia. There are tremendous opportunities for joint ventures. I add my weight to the plea for Australia to provide an even greater role in terms of education for South East Asian nations. One of the great tragedies in this country is the fact that we do not regard education as an export industry. Although some honourable members might have some doubts about the operation of the Bond University, I sincerely hope that the Bond University, on the Gold Coast, has a capacity to show to the Australian population that we can get into international markets and not only make money out of our tremendous resources but, by the influence of Australian educational institutions, help develop those links, ties and friendships especially with the Asian-Pacific region. While I agree that we must get into the Asian area, we must never forget that Australia has a major responsibility in terms of the South Pacific, particularly the South-West Pacific. We have obligations to ensure that we do all we possibly can for those nations that strategically are so important to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for McEwen might suggest that I am going to start whingeing again, but I thought that tonight I would spend a couple of moments bringing to the attention of the House Australia's new poor. While in the last few days of this debate, there have been many references to high interest rates and the difficulties that young people face in getting a home, I suggest that there is a forgotten generation of Australians. They are people aged between about 25 and 40 with an income of between about $23,000 and $45,000 a year. Those people have been absolutely forgotten by the Government and, I would suggest, to a great extent have been forgotten in this debate over the last few days. It is those people who are having incredible difficulty at the moment in making ends meet and, in many cases, providing shelter for their family. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate of Fadden, which falls on the outskirts of Brisbane, there are some shocking examples of what the interest rate regime is doing to people-married people on a single income and with a couple of children at home. I am sad to say that in some parts of my electorate people are literally closing the doors of their houses, walking away from them and saying, `That's it. No longer can I afford to maintain this roof over the heads of my wife and children'. There are numerous examples of that happening throughout Australia. We must never forget that it is the people who have made the commitment of marriage, the people who have had their children and who are trying to bring them up as best they can that have, to a very great degree, been forgotten by the Government and a great number of honourable members as we debate some of the grave economic problems facing the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to get this housing thing right, there must be even greater cooperation between all levels of government. It is not only a case of bringing up the stock; it is a case of looking at the whole system of home purchase in Australia and at the difficulties facing our young people in particular. One looks at what is being charged for conveyancing these days by some members of the legal profession. We all know that most conveyancing is done in legal offices by 16- and 17-year-old clerks. One looks at the tremendous up-front costs that people are required to pay in terms of State stamp duties and transfer duties in order to get their own homes. Surely there must be a sense of cooperation to ensure that Australians can at least get a decent roof over their heads. </PARA>
<PARA> The housing debate goes on and the emphasis, rightly so, is on the current incredible interest rates. I was shocked to learn today that in my State of Queensland at present 28 per cent of the earnings of a person on the average income is required to meet his home loan repayments. That is a great indictment on the state of the nation. We should be doing everything that we possibly can to try to provide some relief, whether from the Federal Government, State governments or local governments, to make it possible for people to own their own home. It has always been one of the basic tenets of Australian society that it is the right of all people to own their own home. While we languished, I suppose, in the joy of knowing that about 80 per cent of the Australian population had the capacity to own their own home, that percentage is falling fast and will continue to fall fast unless there are some drastic examinations of infrastructural charges and government charges generally. Most importantly, we must provide some economic relief, especially for middle income earners-those people on single incomes with a couple of children and making between $23,000 and $45,000. They are the people who are finding it very difficult to make ends meet. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are the forgotten Australians and that makes me very sad. I was interested to hear the excellent speech made by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) tonight regarding the plight of small business in Australia. My electorate probably contains more small businesses, or has a higher concentration of small businesses, than most other Australian electorates. Principally they fall in the Logan City area, which borders the south of Brisbane. It is now Queensland's second largest city, with a population of 150,000. It is a very new city; it has been in existence for only 10 years. However, it has on its books something like 4,800 small businesses. The worry is that there is now a 15 per cent turnover a year in those businesses. Over the last few years all sorts of government programs have been put up because one of the sad things about Logan City is that it has one of the highest rates of unemployment for young people anywhere in Australia. That unemployment rate has hit a level as high as 25 per cent. A number of schemes have been introduced by government and other agencies to try to overcome that unemployment rate. There was a great deal of interest, and certainly quite an amount of support, last year when it was announced that there would be a joint venture between the Commonwealth Government and the Logan City Chamber of Commerce to introduce an information and technology centre in Logan City. Some politics were played in terms of the physical location of what is now known as the Information Technology Education Centre (ITEC), but there was a spirit of goodwill between the three Federal members who represent Logan City, and we were pleased to see the development get off the ground, despite some of the initial problems in terms of the location and the type of building that was to be provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, that scheme is now in jeopardy. It has been operating for just on six months and it looks like going under. The principal reason for that is Federal Government funding, but there are other reasons too. Small businesses have perhaps not got behind the Logan Chamber of Commerce or the local city council as best they could to make the thing work. At the outset, ITEC in Logan City was told that it would be provided with $200,000 in establishment moneys from the Federal Government to make the project work. At the moment it has a $110,000 shortfall. Nobody is quite sure what has happened to that other $110,000 that was coming from the Federal Government to make the project work. I appeal to the Government tonight to ensure that the commitment that it made up-front to the city council, the Board of ITEC and the Logan Chamber of Commerce, the co-sponsor of this operation, for that extra $110,000 is met immediately. The last thing that I think anybody in that area wants to see is the project going under, but there is a very real chance of that happening if the money is not forthcoming, despite the fact that the Logan Chamber of Commerce says that it will do all it possibly can to keep the thing afloat so it can bring new high technology industries into that very important part of south-east Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members may recall recently receiving correspondence asking for help in raising funds for the Don Mackay Griffith Gatehouse. The money was to be raised by having a run from Sydney to Griffith. The amount to be raised was $100,000. The Don Mackay Griffith Gatehouse is used for the rehabilitation of people who have been on drugs or alcohol, mainly young people. It is a very worthwhile cause that the people of Griffith have taken up in answer to the bad publicity that Griffith has received over the years, which has been earned for it by a very small minority of people. The people of Griffith are determined that they will do something about the drug problem and the rehabilitation of young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The run was launched by Barbara Mackay from Sydney on 29 March. The runners included people such as Wal McCrorie. People may remember that name. He was the first winner of the run from Sydney to Melbourne and he has run in a number of races since then. I thank Ian Whitfield, Steve Nordich, Ian Hutchinson and Tina Campbell for taking part in that run. I also thank a gentleman by the name of Nobbie Young, who was one of the chief organisers, but he had to pull out because of a chest infection. I also thank the supporters who were in the support vehicles for their contribution. Many of those people are members of the Sydney Striders Club. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank those honourable members who answered the letters that were forwarded to them asking for support, although the replies were not many. The money they put forward will play a significant part in rehabilitating young people who have a drug problem. I congratulate Barbara Mackay-most people know Barbara, Don Mackay's widow-who has done a great deal of work. She is a very brave woman and has taken on this crusade in order to care for people who are affected by drugs. She is involved in many other organisations in Griffith and throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Beres Sexton is a very courageous young man and a great friend of mine. He decided to organise the run and did a great job there. The run ended on 2 April, the final day of the Griffith Food and Wine Festival. John Dickie, the organiser of that festival, and Jan Evans were there on that day. I congratulate and thank them for the great part they played in trying to raise funds for the Griffith Gatehouse Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> I offer my congratulations and thanks to the people of the great town of Griffith, and to the people who supported the run and the final day of the festival, on supporting the Don Mackay Griffith Gatehouse. I ask members of the House who may not have replied to the letter and now know what it is all about and would like to contribute, or anyone else, to please help this Foundation because it does great work. I know that Barbara Mackay would be very grateful, as would all the people who really do care for those who have got themselves into all sorts of strife through drugs and alcohol. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Bernie Newson of Cooma, a Vietnam veteran, is totally and permanently disabled due to war caused injuries while on war service in Vietnam. In letters to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) Mr Newson has concentrated on the report of the Royal Commission on the Use and Effects of Chemical Agents on Australian Personnel in Vietnam. He has concentrated on discrepancies he has found in the report and he has asked me to help him and thousands of other veterans in getting that message across.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Newson wants the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to consider American declassified documents that completely contradict the findings of the Royal Commission. Bernie Newson has quoted the declassification numbers so that the Minister can identify them. He has also pointed out that Senator Paul McLean has the documents in his possession. I have been advised that the Minister has not been forwarded the documents. Recently I telephoned Senator McLean and he has agreed to provide the declassified documents so that the points can be examined. </PARA>
<PARA> What worries Mr Newson and the International Independent Agent Orange Network, for which he is research director, is that the Evatt Royal Commission findings were too closed. The Royal Commission left many veterans feeling that they were not fairly dealt with in the report and the scientific and legal evidence was lacking for some of the report's conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that a public affairs conference is being conducted at the Australian National University-a conference entitled `Evatt Revisited-Interpretation of Scientific Evidence'. This will address some of the problems raised by Bernie Newson and his fellow veterans. I also appreciate that Mr Bob Hogg in his examination of the Evatt findings said that it was too early to speak out about the chemical effects on humans with such absolute certainty. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Minister has said that the Government will continue to monitor health trends within the Vietnam veterans' community through the Department of Veterans' Affairs database. He has not ruled out the possibility that agent orange may be shown to be linked to the existing problems of veterans. Having left the door open, the Minister has shown that new material will be properly considered. There is new material on super orange and it is coming forward in the United States of America. This material needs to be on the Minister's desk. </PARA>
<PARA> Our colleague in the Senate, Senator Paul McLean, has the declassified documents I have mentioned. I would like the Minister to peruse them. Senator McLean has kindly offered to make them available. Along with the conference on the Royal Commission and the Minister's own determination to keep the door open for new information, the documents and other new material may prevent far more costly and legally complex actions by an important group in our community which seeks justice. Literally thousands of Vietnam veterans are relying on a fair and equitable solution to their everyday problems. They deserve honour and dignity even if it is 25 years after the event. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last week I had the opportunity to visit two institutions in my electorate. I wish to share those experiences with the House. The first was the diamond jubilee of the Hillcrest Hospital, which is an adjunct of the Royal Adelaide Hospital. It has done a lot in the servicing of psychiatric patients and it is an excellent caring centre. At Hillcrest a strong emphasis is placed on research and this has been fostered in a number of ways. The board of management has offered a number of research fellowships for students in disciplines related to psychiatry and these have been highly successful with almost 10 times as many applicants from all States of Australia as there were fellowships available. It is planned that these be continued to foster research in areas particularly appropriate to the service needs of this hospital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The feature was a delightful chapel service on a mild autumn day in Hillcrest in the northern suburbs of Adelaide and its simplicity was classic in its example. The history and the vision of the Hillcrest Hospital were introduced by Mr Rob Iversen. The first reading was from John, Chapter I, by Mr David Seaton, who is now the chairman of that board. An excellent group of men and women make up and complement the Hillcrest Hospital board. The second reading was by Dr Norman James. His theme was `Out of the darkness and into light'. The address was by Pastor Lloyd John. There was a delightful choral item by a quartet of singers from the Uniting Church Parish of Islington. Their choral work was entitled All in the April Evening and Let There be Peace. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction to the memorial roll was by Mrs Yvette Amer and probably the most emotionally charged address was by Mrs Bette Figg, who unveiled the memorial roll. Just to cap off the day, the unveiling of the plaque took place under some delightful trees in the garden. The memorial roll contains names including James Bell, Charles Bywater, Patrick Gaffney, Edith Gaitskill, Thomas Leahy, Shirley Lofts, Leslie McLeay, Kathleen McMillan, Lee Makk, Peter Mason, Ronald Miller, Cyril Pratt, Stirling Robertson, James Sinclair, Tim Vallance, Joyce Williams, Charles Williamson, Walter Wiltshire, Maxine Woods and Jessie Cavanagh, a delightful lady who nursed and worked hard and long. </PARA>
<PARA> On Saturday morning in Rundle Mall in Adelaide I had the opportunity to declare open Jaycees Week in conjunction with another excellent program that it is involved with, that is, the organ donation and transplantation program that the Australian Kidney Foundation is working on around Australia. Jaycees is a non-political, non-sectarian organisation of men and women aged 18 to 40 years. It initiated the Buy Australia campaign and the clean up campaign which was known as KESAB. It was there promoting its cause and giving away kits which demonstrated the life-giving opportunities that Medic Alert provided. Mr Warwick Prime, a former media commentator in South Australia and Western Australia, is now wearing a second hat, being involved with the Australian Kidney Foundation at Wavell. There I saw living testimony to what organ donation can do. Sue, Brian and Angela were there. Sue had a liver transplant. She was a delightful young lady who, without a liver transplant, would have led a life full of misery which would have led to her death. Angela, another delightful young lady, had renal failure and required a kidney transplant, which enables her still to ride horses. The most gratifying thing was that she gave birth to a child which was healthy. Finally, there was Brian, who had had a heart transplant. He made the very pragmatic statement that as long as he lives his donor is alive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not coming from the honourable member for Adelaide. Evidently he enjoys the killings. There are very strong calls for peace, including ones from within Israel itself. A prominent sign of lack of universal Israeli support for the war is the popular Shalom Achshaw movement, which if my Hebrew is still correct means `peace now', and the growing number of soldiers who refuse to serve in the occupied territories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently, Yesh Gvul, which means `have borders' and which is the organisation of these military refuseniks, announced its fiftieth case since the start of the Intifada. Fifty young Israeli servicemen have so far been gaoled for their refusal to repress the Palestinian people. Many more have similarly refused but have been transferred to other duties instead of being given harsher punishments. I would like to read from a letter sent by one reservist announcing his resignation from the Israeli defence forces:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I am not willing to be part of any army of occupation which uses the same kind of methods as were used, in the past, against the Jewish people-such as the murder of women and children and the beating to death of old men. For reasons of conscience, I declare my complete resignation from this army which-rather than defend the country-serves as an instrument of brutal rule over and oppression of another people . . . </PARA>
<PARA>After repeated refusals to serve, this man, Mr Ephraim Shirman, was imprisoned and started a hunger strike. There have been demonstrations in support of his stand, demanding the right to conscientious objection. It seems incongruous that a country which presents itself as one that respects the principles of human rights should refuse to recognise a person's right to be a conscientious objector. </PARA>
<PARA> In another interesting example, Mr Hillel Bardin, a reserve officer in the West Bank town of Ramallah who was sickened by the needless violence of his job, negotiated with local Palestinian youths to stop breaking up demonstrations and meetings as long as they remained peaceful. </PARA>
<PARA> This prevented violence for some weeks until some Jewish settlers found out. The officer was imprisoned and the conflict was resumed. It is surprising only that more soldiers do not refuse to participate in the crushing of the Intifada. A recent court martial of four soldiers from a brigade known as the Purple Berets revealed that soldiers had been given explicit orders from commanding officers to beat up Palestinians when arresting them. In this instance, these soldiers beat an old man to death. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time that this violence against the oppressed Palestinian people ended. It is up to all peace-loving people to continue to put pressure on the Israeli Government to take the necessary steps towards peace in the region. Specifically, they should urge the Israeli Government to take advantage of the willingness of the Palestine Liberation Organisation to negotiate the settlement of the dispute. Having recently visited the Middle East on a fact finding mission I can assure members that there is a strong yearning for peace on the part of the Palestinians. The responsibility for achieving this peace now rests on the shoulders of Israel's political leaders, and I call on our Government to use all its influence to persuade the Israelis to negotiate under the auspices of the United Nations to end the unlawful occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last month while attending the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference at Budapest in Hungary I took the opportunity with Senator Shirley Walters from Tasmania to visit the Commonwealth War Graves cemetery at Solymar some 14 kilometres to the south of Budapest. I understand the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) also visited these war graves at a later time during the conference. I raise this matter here tonight because these particular war graves would not be very well known to many Australians. I had not heard of them before my visit to Hungary. It was a moving experience to drive out into the open countryside where the war graves are located and to inspect them at first hand. I am delighted to report that they are in excellent condition, with the lawns recently having been returfed, no doubt at some considerable expense, and with everything else looking spick and span.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that many members in this chamber will have inspected war graves in various countries, including some of the famous ones in countries like France. However, to visit this little-known cemetery in that distant part of the world and to see first hand the headstones and graves and surroundings so beautifully kept made me feel very proud. </PARA>
<PARA> There are 208 airmen buried in the cemetery. One hundred and twenty-three come from the Royal Air Force, 37 from the Polish Air Force-because it was fighting with us at the time-21 from the South African Air Force; 13 from the Royal Australian Air Force; six from the Royal Canadian Air Force; and six from the Royal New Zealand Air Force. As well, there were two unidentified airmen and one person from the 1914-18 war, who was a seaman of the Royal Navy. These airmen buried in the cemetery lost their lives during raids over Hungary between April and November 1944. The raids were made from Italian bases on industrial targets in Gyor and Budapest and also on German troop concentrations in other parts of Hungary. The raids were quite successful. The industrial target raids alone knocked out five of the seven big oil refineries in Hungary. </PARA>
<PARA> After the war, attempts were made to trace the graves of the airmen who had died there in Hungary. Advertisements were placed in the national press and in the local press in regions where the aircraft were known to have been shot down. Letters were also written to local authorities. As a result of this, some 58 bodies were recovered. The Hungarian Government purchased the land for the cemetery in October 1946 from a local landowner and gave it to the United Kingdom in July 1947 for a military cemetery. There is a plaque there in the wall of the cemetery with an inscription which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The land on which this Cemetery stands is the gift of the People of Hungary for the perpetual resting place of the airmen who are honoured there. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in 1947 a proper burial took place. Between 1950 and 1954 the original wooden crosses were replaced with proper cement headstones as found in the other Commonwealth war graves around the world. It was a very sobering experience to move round, read the words on the headstone of each grave and see that so-and-so died at age 20, someone else at 21 and someone else at 23. It was almost rare to find someone who died later than the age of 26. These headstones are a perpetual reminder of such a tragic waste of young lives, as the shadow Minister looking after veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), acknowledges. </PARA>
<PARA> Two ceremonies are held each year at these war graves, one on the Hungarian Liberation Day in April and the other, which is a remembrance day service, in November. I was saddened to learn that, though the ambassadors of all the Commonwealth countries attend these ceremonies as well as representatives of the Hungarian Government and the Polish Ambassador, where appropriate, no invitation is extended to the South African Government to send a representative. There are more South African airmen resting in the cemetery than Australians, New Zealanders or Canadians. They fought with the allies and gave their lives to help rid the world of Nazism. They knew nothing of the system of government we so delight in criticising in their country today. It was not until 1948 that its system of government formally began. I will never understand how we can be a partner to such small minded pettiness in denying these fallen heroes a representative from their country to honour them each year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to place on record my total agreement with the previous two speakers. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) has played a very lonely and quite a brave part in his support for the people of Palestine, and the views of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) should also be well and truly heeded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to talk tonight about hypocrisy, which is alive and well in this country and flourishes nowhere as successfully as in the media. The Government of Western Australia has been subjected to constant attacks from the press for what was called Western Australia Inc. It has been suggested that the Government was involved with big business in some way that was detrimental to the people. This is totally absurd. The press itself has never been put under any scrutiny. If one looks at the situation in Western Australia, one sees that these attacks from the media came principally from three sources. The Fairfax Press, which at one time was without peer in Australia and was probably an example to the world in terms of a free press, is certainly an organisation with a noble history. However, I am sad to say that that has apparently changed. The Fairfax Press made constant attacks on the Western Australian Government and the Bond Corporation. When one looks at the situation one realises that Bond was in fact financing litigation against them. They were intent on attacking Bond, feeling that any attack on Bond strengthened their position. The record will show that they eventually settled out of court for some $49m. There was clearly a vested interest there, and this was never recognised by the rest of the media or by many members of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The second arm of the attack was the Murdoch Press. I can find very little to say about the Murdoch Press that is favourable. The Murdoch Press clearly has a vested interest. It has been the aim of Murdoch to get control of what is probably the most profitable newspaper in Australia. I do not think there is any secret that it has harboured the desire for a long time to get hold of the media interests owned by the Bond Corporation. So it too had a vested interest in these continued attacks. </PARA>
<PARA> The third arm was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). I do not know what one can say about the ABC. This organisation, which I used to be particularly proud of, is particularly contemptible. What can be said for the ABC is that, after the very cowardly and ill-informed attack on the Four Corners program, at least the 7.30 Report program tried to make some redress. What motivates the ABC? It cannot be profit; it cannot be hope of gain. It is something even more cowardly: it is its sort of camp dog attitude as it yaps after the besieged seeking to be in it as well-the me-tooism attitude. It is my view that there are elements of the ABC that are dominated by what I would call kindergarten marxism. The Four Corners program is a classic example. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to draw the attention of the House to what else has happened. The Western Australian Government did not lose money in its trading. All its trading arms in fact made substantial profits. They were wound up by a Premier who, I guess, lost his nerve. They have been wound up at a time when no venture capital is available in Western Australia. I hope that some alternative will be put into place. One looks at what happened in Victoria, where large amounts of money were lost, where the national media had hardly a word to say, or at the outrage that has occurred in New South Wales where the Premier, Mr Greiner, has given a $92m handout to the Fairfax organisation. He has rebated $92m of stamp duty owing by that organisation. Anyone who does not believe that one can buy political clout and political partisanship with $92m is living in fairyland. It is a disgraceful and dangerous precedent and one which the whole nation should be well aware of. I certainly hope-and I will be pursuing the matter-that any assistance is docked from the amount of money that the New South Wales Government could and should have recouped from the Fairfax organisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Friday evening I organised a meeting in the township of Norton Summit in my electorate in order for local people to protest to the Civil Aviation Authority about the building of a radar tower at Marble Hill. I regard the decision of the Civil Aviation Authority to go ahead with this project as bone-headed, arrogant and insensitive. I am only sorry that I was unable to get to that meeting. I was delayed by the air traffic controllers in Sydney who were taking industrial action. I actually was not able to get to Adelaide until the next day. But I am grateful to the Mayor of East Torrens, Isobel Bishop, for chairing that meeting in my place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal of the Civil Aviation Authority to build a radar tower in the Adelaide Hills is anathema to the thousands of South Australians who want to preserve the beauty of the Adelaide Hills. The people that made the decision to build this monstrosity live in far-off Canberra. My talks with them reveal they know next to nothing about the Adelaide Hills or its people and that they care even less about the environmental implications of their decision. They already have one of their horrible towers at Summertown. A commonsense solution would have been to remove that tower and replace it with one more appropriate to the needs of the Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation Authority prepared a report on the proposal for me which was totally inadequate. The figures were rubbery and the conclusions vague. We now learn the Civil Aviation Authority has decided to make full use of its legal privileges arrogantly to dismiss my protests, to overrule State planning laws and to give the local council the flick. </PARA>
<PARA> Ever since I can remember I seem to have been waging war against government authorities smashing up the Adelaide Hills with their so-called vital facilities. It does not seem to matter one jot to them that we, the people of the Hills, have our own views about our local environment. Television towers, freeways, communication masts, cable cars, massive and ugly hotel complexes on Mount Lofty summit-up they all go without a care in the world for the views of the local people in the Adelaide Hills. </PARA>
<PARA> I will continue to pursue this arrogant attitude of the Civil Aviation Authority, its decision which was ill-founded, its decision which lacked any consultation whatsoever with local people prior to purchasing the property and going ahead with its decision to build the tower-a decision which holds all those who love the Adelaide Hills in complete contempt. I hope in future other government organisations eschew this sort of path that the Civil Aviation Authority has chosen. It is a new authority with new found independence. In my view, it has made a very poor start. I hope it will learn from this mistake. Perhaps my final plea, as we move to 11 o'clock, is for the Civil Aviation Authority to think yet again and to cancel its stupid decision to desecrate the environment of the Adelaide Hills. </PARA>
