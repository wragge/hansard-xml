<PARA> That the House of Representatives expresses its deep regret at the death on Friday, 21 April 1989, of Mr Frank Lionel O'Keefe, AM, a member of the House of Representatives for the division of Paterson from 1969 to 1984, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to the members of his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Frank O'Keefe was born on 6 October 1912 at Petersham, New South Wales, and grew up in the Rose Bay area of Sydney; but as a young man, having been transferred by his employers to Gunnedah, decided to make that his home. In the decades that followed Frank O'Keefe contributed greatly to the growth and development of Gunnedah. In all, he served in the area of local government for 43 years and was mayor from 1948 to 1949 and from 1953 to 1969. He was also the civil defence controller for 30 years. In 1944 Frank O'Keefe married Alice Doreen Pascoe-Nan-to whom he often, as we know, paid tribute as his constant ally. </PARA>
<PARA> Frank O'Keefe entered Federal Parliament in 1969 representing the seat of Paterson and remained until his retirement in 1984. During his time in the House he was a member of various Commonwealth delegations and he served as a member of several committees. Frank O'Keefe's interests in Parliament were numerous, but regularly centred on the harsh reality of life in the bush. Within his electorate Frank O'Keefe knew the devastation of both floods and droughts. He spoke strongly for those who suffered from these natural disasters. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from his service to both Federal and local government, he had an abiding interest in many sports and participated with flair in swimming, tennis and cricket. Throughout his life Frank O'Keefe gave enthusiastically to the community around him. On behalf of the Government I extend to his family our condolences in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Liberal Party I join the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in expressing our sympathy to the relatives of the late Frank O'Keefe. I knew Frank O'Keefe as a fellow parliamentarian for some 10 years. During that time and after Frank retired from Parliament I saw him often at the Sydney Cricket Ground and at cricket and football fixtures. He had a very deep love not only of his country and his Party but also of the people of Gunnedah whom he served for so long. He had the distinction of being the Mayor of Gunnedah and a member of the Shire Council at the same time as being, first, the State member and subsequently the Federal member. He also had a very deep love of sport and of Australian sporting achievements. One often found Frank O'Keefe present at sporting gatherings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In many ways Frank epitomised the values, the attitudes and the principles of people in the bush in New South Wales. He was the essence of the old Country Party, which subsequently became the National Party in New South Wales. He stood very firmly for its values. All of us in the Liberal Party liked him immensely. We admired the fortitude he displayed at times of illness and setbacks during his life. I know I speak for all members of the Liberal Party who knew and served with Frank O'Keefe in the New South Wales Parliament when he was the member for Upper Hunter and, subsequently, in this national Parliament, when I extend to his family our sympathy in their bereavement and record the quiet, loyal years of service that he gave to his Party and his country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to join in the motion of condolence moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). In so doing, I thank the Prime Minister for the courtesy of allowing me to say something in this House in memory of Frank O'Keefe. Frank O'Keefe, as much as anyone I have ever known, epitomised a giant in a small community. He was one of the leading citizens of a town which he espoused as his own, the town of Gunnedah in north-west New South Wales. In the 1950s Gunnedah was stagnant. Through Frank O'Keefe's initiatives, enthusiasm and effort, it became quite a vigorous community. Indeed, it was through his effort that the Gunnedah abattoir was established, and for a great deal of his life he was chairman of that meatworks, one of the major exporting works in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> His own term of service was quite extraordinary. He served eight years in the New South Wales Legislature, 15 years in the Federal Parliament, 43 years in local government, 18 years as mayor, and seven years as deputy mayor. For 50 years he served Australia. He served it well, he served it with devotion, he served it with application, and he always served it with good humour. In his youth, Frank O'Keefe was a remarkable sport. He was a good cricketer and a good tennis player. He claimed that through sport he gained entry into politics. In his adult years he gave back a great deal to the sports of his youth by becoming an administrator. He was an official in rugby league, cricket and tennis in the north-west; he certainly contributed as much to as he ever gained from sport. </PARA>
<PARA> As to his own community, I think one could best describe him as Mr Gunnedah, for throughout the whole of his life Mr O'Keefe contributed a great deal to that town's development and future, and I know that everyone in that community regarded him very much as one of their own. To Nan, his widow, on behalf of my colleagues, my wife Rosemary and myself, I extend my deepest sympathy. His widow, Nan, has lost a great friend, Gunnedah has lost a great citizen, and Australia has lost a great contributor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join other general members in this motion of condolence. Frank O'Keefe was in the New South Wales Parliament at the same time as I was and, whilst we were on different sides, there was a great bond of friendship between Mr O'Keefe and all members on both sides of the House. He had that natural ability to relate to people. As a matter of interest, he was captain of the cricket side in which we all participated, and he was very generous even if we were not very good at cricket.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr O'Keefe then entered Federal Parliament, and everyone would be aware of his generosity and interest in national matters. Frank O'Keefe made a great contribution to this country. He was a man of the utmost integrity. He was very difficult to beat in politics; even though we used to work against him furiously we could not get the votes to unseat him. He never bore any ill-will; he was a very generous man. Again, I express my condolences to his widow. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Gwydir)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair) in this motion of condolence-in rather unusual circumstances, not yet having made my maiden speech. However, I live in the Gunnedah area, and my family's association with Frank O'Keefe, or `OK' as he was widely known by his friends, goes back to the 1930s when he came to the Gunnedah area from Sydney. My father in particular shared Frank's love of cricket and other members of my family played tennis with him over many years. For my own part, I remember Frank's towering figure from my very early days, but it was not until I became actively involved in National Party politics after leaving university and returning to the bush that I came to know him well. To my way of thinking, it is greatly to his credit that he encouraged me to pursue a political career, despite the fact that I argued the point with him on more than one occasion-but then there was never anything small about Frank O'Keefe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frank O'Keefe certainly encouraged me, and I trace my presence here in this House today back to his urging me to stand for preselection for the old seat of Paterson in 1984 when he decided to retire. History records that the seat of Paterson was abolished in the 1984 redistribution. So ended in one way a chapter of north-west politics that was so dominated by Frank O'Keefe for so many years. But for all that, Frank O'Keefe's contribution will not be readily forgotten, for reasons perhaps well stated by the Reverend David Mulready, who spoke at Frank's memorial in Gunnedah just eight days ago. If I can quote in part those comments, Reverend Mulready said:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr O'Keefe had spent the major part of his life serving others. It was a life of achievement. He received many medals, awards and commendations, including the Order of Australia. Yet, for all his success, Frank was a man who would talk to anyone and listen to anyone. No-one would have known of the extent of his achievements by talking to him. He was a man of great integrity, highly principled, a gentleman and a gentle man. </PARA>
<PARA>Reverend Mulready said that throughout his life Mr O'Keefe had never lost the common touch and that his quality of service ought to be an inspiration to us all. In extending deep sympathies to Nan O'Keefe and her family, I express the hope that they will draw great comfort from the knowledge that the world was a better place for the life and work of Frank O'Keefe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Frank O'Keefe was a champion tennis player, a champion cricket player and a champion bloke. He was respected by all who knew him. He was respected by those on all sides of politics, in local government, in State parliament, and in Federal parliament. The senior member of my staff, Mrs Paula Carlton, worked with Frank O'Keefe for many years. She was a great friend of Frank and his wife Nan. The seat of Paterson has now disappeared, but the seat formerly occupied by Mr O'Keefe comprised a large part of the electorate which is now Hunter. I know that everyone within the Hunter region and the region which Frank served had nothing but admiration for the qualities of the man. My sympathies to Nan and the other members of the O'Keefe family.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YI4">Mr IAN ROBINSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Page)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join those who pay tribute to the late Frank O'Keefe. Frank O'Keefe became a legend in his own time. I first knew him as a Country Party candidate for the State seat of Liverpool Plains in the 1950s. He was unsuccessful in his first bid to enter the State Parliament of New South Wales, but his dominant approach to politics and public life and his incredible energy and zeal resulted in him winning the seat of Liverpool Plains in 1961 with a margin of 50 votes. He came to the New South Wales Parliament, where at that time I was serving as the member for the State seat of Casino. We had much in common. He was interested in the development of abattoirs and it is to his credit that the abattoir at Gunnedah in the north-west of New South Wales was established. He had a vast interest in local government and, whilst serving as a State member, was still the Mayor of Gunnedah.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Beyond that, he had a wealth of experience as a very successful businessman. As well, he had time for sport and time for participation in many public organisations as a Rotarian and as a supporter of the groups in his own community that meant so much to him in furthering local welfare and, in particular, nurturing those things that were so dear to him and to his family. After serving in the New South Wales Parliament until 1969 he retired to contest the seat of Paterson. He followed a very eminent member of the Federal Parliament at that time, Sir Allen Fairhall. Frank again was in the hurly-burly of politics, breaking through and breaking new ground. Subsequent events in the change of boundaries and occurrences in the political scene resulted on one occasion in him returning to Canberra with a margin of 150 votes. His words on that occasion were, `Well, that was a near thing'. But Frank's persistence was such that he overcame that narrow squeak very quickly and had a record majority in a subsequent election. Such was the life and expertise of Frank O'Keefe in politics. </PARA>
<PARA> He was a very familiar figure, particularly in the old Parliament House, because he participated perhaps more than most others in debates. Whenever our Party needed someone to speak on a Bill, one would turn to Frank O'Keefe. Without preparation, he would deliver an oration appropriate to the occasion. I am sure that he was a very valued member to previous Whips who required people to come to the fore at short notice. What one remembers particularly of Frank O'Keefe is that great personality liked by so many, respected by all who knew him. His attributes were such that he deserved and won the admiration of the community in which he lived and the wider community not only here in Canberra but in many other parts of Australia, because of his very close links with the sporting fraternity, particularly with those involved in cricket. Of course, in many ways he was a great sportsman. </PARA>
<PARA> History will record the term and the service of Frank O'Keefe, but only our memory of this unique man will truly recount his great attributes, his friendship and, above all, his high principles as a parliamentarian, public figure and a man of deep conviction. I join those who pay tribute in expressing deep sympathy to his wife, Nan, and the other members of his family. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VF4">Mr COWAN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Lyne)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose that there are people in our political life that we meet and work with that we never forget. Frank O'Keefe was one of my closest friends over the years. Like the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the honourable member for Page (Mr Ian Robinson), I served with him in the New South Wales House for about five years. I sat beside him in the office that we worked in. There were seven of us in the old Richmond Cottage who worked in that one room. Frank also ran a very successful oil and machinery business in the Gunnedah area. He had a sense of humour. Naturally, we never had a secretary or a press officer, and on many occasions he answered our voluminous mail by pen. Frank would be on the phone for most of the day. He would be running a business and the electorate. There were many occasions when his phone rang hot and he would look across to me and say, `Brucie, there is something the matter with my phone'. I would say, `Frank, take it easy. Let me go over and have a look. Give me your number'. I would dial out and he would say, `Thank you very much'. He was intense in his work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was pleased to read the article at the weekend in the Sun-Herald because it quoted many of the organisations that Frank was so closely associated with. Frank also served on the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust. He was an excellent member of Rotary. He attended for 40 years and missed only one weekly meeting of Rotary. That is a wonderful example-something that I am sure that the Rotary movement would be very proud of. He found time to go to Rotary no matter where he was-overseas, in Sydney, Canberra or elsewhere. He was Secretary/Treasurer of sporting groups-useful organisations so far as the community is concerned. He set a great example to many of us and to many of the younger members of the Parliament because he showed that one must be attentive to all people within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I never heard Frank O'Keefe say a detrimental word about any person, and that is why he is so respected by all of us on both sides of the Parliament, both in New South Wales and in the Federal House. I am sure that my predecessor, Mr Lucock, would like to join with me, with his wife Joan, because he was particularly close to Frank over the years that they served in this place together. I convey to Nan and the family not only my own sympathy but also the sympathy of the Lucocks. We will miss him. He was a great man. He was a great example to Australia and he was recognised for that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to pay a tribute to the late Frank O'Keefe. Frank was a particularly close friend of my late father. During the last three years of my father's service in this House, when they had those long nights of sitting, I believe they used to repair to the billiard room. For two old conservatives the game they used to play was Russian pool. Frank was a thorough gentleman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frank was a great help to me when I first entered this House. His love of sports and his knowledge of sports were things that we admired. Frank could never understand how, when the State of Origin match between Queensland and New South Wales was introduced for rugby league, Queensland could have won so convincingly. I remember teasing him during the first game of the State of Origin which he was watching on television. I had spies in Brisbane who had told me the result and I mischievously watched his frustration every time Queensland scored. He was indeed well acknowledged as a great sportsman. He was a very great friend of Alec Bedser. Both in England and in Australia Frank attended many of the test matches and was an authority. </PARA>
<PARA> I rise because he was a particular friend of the family. I admired his graciousness, his kindness and his courtesy. My heart goes out to Nan in this time of bereavement. We have lost a great friend; she has lost a wonderful partner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, I will take about 20 seconds of the House's time. Whilst the four members sitting in this row are not the youngest members of the House, they are the best looking members. The fifth member of this group was Frank O'Keefe, my dear friend, who was one of the most loved men I knew. I was particularly impressed by the generous comments of the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) which indicate, I think, that Frank O'Keefe belonged to us all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Three of us shared an office in the old Parliament House. It occurred to me-and I am sure that it occurred to most of the people sitting here, although not perhaps to our new member-that when we moved up here on the hill things would be a little remote. I assure honourable members that down at the bottom of the hill they were not remote because there were three of us in an office. It was not unusual for Frank to come rushing in and say, `You are wanted on the phone-quick, quick, quick', and when one answered the phone one found it was dial-a-prayer! He was one of those very lovable characters. He and I shared a great moment in Brisbane-that is that place up there in the north. We both saw Ian Botham score 53 runs in 30-odd minutes-remember Ian Botham, Mr Acting Speaker?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. Before I was elected to the Parliament I often used to listen to it on the radio. I suppose I was one of the few people who did. I often used to hear Frank O'Keefe and I would sometimes wonder how he could say those things and have the O'Keefe heritage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I was elected to the Parliament in 1984-at the same time as he left-he said to me, `Ah, you're the young O'Keefe. It is very good to see the name continuing on in the Parliament, but you really are on the wrong side of the House'. That was a measure of him and I want to add that little incident to show the spirit of the late Frank O'Keefe and to convey my condolences to Mrs O'Keefe and the family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, thank you very much for the opportunity of allowing me to associate myself with this condolence motion. I do so because my late father was also a member of the New South Wales Parliament and served with Frank O'Keefe in that chamber. I had the privilege of serving with him in this Federal Parliament. This friendship crosses generations and I have had the opportunity of hearing about Frank from my own family. I know in particular of the friendship between my dad and Frank. In the New South Wales chamber questions are allowed in a more discretionary way, and members used to joust in a friendly way to see who could obtain the largest number of opportunities at Question Time. Frank O'Keefe was frequently the contender for that title along with my late father and in that sense they used to speak about each other frequently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had the opportunity of serving with him in the Federal Parliament for 11 years. I admired him as an individual and the qualities which he brought to bear. I will not elaborate in any greater detail on those qualities, but he was much admired not only by the National Party and those members of the Australian Labor Party who have spoken, but also by members of the Liberal Party of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1974 with Frank O'Keefe I was a member of a parliamentary delegation which visited Sri Lanka. I clearly recall his being taken out into the middle of the oval during a test match and introduced as Frank O'Keefe, the great cricketer from Australia. He received a standing ovation from the thousands of people who were watching. I am not quite sure what he told the officials prior to that, but he was recognised probably more than the rest of the delegation which was led by Senator Reg Bishop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other side of that story is that Tony Luchetti, the then member for Macquarie, a Labor man, had his luggage misplaced by Qantas Airways Ltd. It never did arrive in Singapore, where we commenced our trip. Right throughout our trip Qantas promised Tony Luchetti that his luggage would catch up with him; so he never went out and bought any new luggage. But who dressed Tony Luchetti from his own suitcase? None other than Frank O'Keefe, who was also a large man, a man who would even give one the shirt off his back. Well done, Frank O'Keefe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would briefly like to add a few words to the condolence motion in regard to a much loved member, although my period of service with him here was much shorter than that of most; it was about four years. I, too, had experience of Frank on overseas trips. The first trip in which I took part was under the leadership of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar). Frank was not a man who made cultural adjustments. He was an Australian through and through. I recollect on one occasion that we had been advised as to how we were to disport ourselves when seeing people in Muslim countries. One of the strictest rules was that one kept one's feet firmly planted on the ground, but if one chose to cross one's legs, the sole of one's shoe must point at the ground and not at anyone else. It was deemed to be a very substantial insult if one did so. Frank was a man who was generally at ease. He was a long man who did not always fit into the rooms in which we were placed for meetings. On the occasion when we met the Speaker of one of the Houses of Parliament in the Persian Gulf area, in the course of leaning back, the sole of his shoe pointed directly at the Speaker and he then fell asleep. Being an even more prissy member in those days than I am now, I began to get embarrassed by Frank's situation, so I gave him a nudge. I said, `Frank, the sole of your shoe is pointing directly at the Speaker'. Frank said, `Oh, good thing it didn't go off!' He was a lot quicker than one normally associates with the sort of ruminatory behaviour of bucolic National Party members of this Parliament who sit on the cross benches. He was a genuinely funny man. He was compassionate, friendly, very bipartisan and a very authentic representative of the old Country Party.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Prime Minister to recent media reports that the New Zealand Prime Minister's speech last week at Yale University, in which he called the ANZUS Treaty a `dead letter', had been faxed to the Australian High Commission in Wellington the day before its delivery and that the Minister for Defence had received prior notice of Mr Lange's intended speech. Will the Prime Minister confirm that his Government received advance knowledge of the speech; if so, what actions did the Government take on behalf of Australia to convey its deep concern at the contents of that speech to the New Zealand Government as the third Treaty partner?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1686" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the course of wider consultations, I understand that we were informed in advance by New Zealand that Mr Lange would be making a speech at Yale. The discussions were informal and not based on any proposed text. The possibility that Mr Lange might refer to the withdrawal from the ANZUS Council was referred to as an option rather than a firm proposal. We stressed Australia's continued support for the ANZUS Treaty; our hope for the resumption of its trilateral character and for its maintenance as the basis of the bilateral defence relationship with New Zealand; and our concern that no action be taken to complicate this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Leader of the Opposition has raised the question, I go beyond the immediate point of what relationship, if any, there was with us prior to the delivery of that speech to make quite clear our position on this issue. I have read Mr Lange's speech at Yale University last week in which he, as Prime Minister of New Zealand, described New Zealand's views on defence issues and their strategic setting. Without attempting a comprehensive analysis of the speech that was delivered by the New Zealand Prime Minister, it is perfectly clear to everybody, including, I imagine, the Leader of the Opposition, that this Government takes a quite different view on some important issues addressed in that speech. In particular, let me say unequivocally that this Government sees ship visits as a natural part of our alliance relationship with the United States-an alliance which not only directly enhances Australia's security, including our conventional security, but also forms part of a Western alliance framework underpinning global security.</PARA>
<PARA> The speech of the New Zealand Prime Minister does not address these wider considerations. Our differences with New Zealand on this issue are well known and, of course, they are well known to the Government of New Zealand. The Prime Minister of New Zealand in his speech did not then announce a decision to withdraw from the ANZUS Council but rather, as honourable members will see from reading the speech, raised that as a possibility. Obviously, while ultimately that would be a matter for the Government of New Zealand to decide, it also is an issue which affects the other two parties to the treaty. For that reason, it is one on which it is appropriate for Australia to state a view. I state the view quite clearly: it is our hope that New Zealand will not withdraw from the Council. That would be a further symbolic step by New Zealand away from ANZUS, complicating our bilateral defence cooperation with New Zealand, which is currently based upon ANZUS, and making harder a restoration of trilateral cooperation should New Zealand ever change its policy on ship visits. We believe, as indeed does the United States, that there is a major benefit in defence cooperation between Australia and New Zealand. It is our wish and our intention that that should continue.</PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, I emphasise that as a matter of international law-it is important that this be noted-withdrawal by New Zealand from the Council would not affect the treaty arrangements between Australia and the United States. Moreover, as a matter of our foreign and defence policies, we remain totally committed to that alliance relationship. I should add also, in view of comments and media coverage in recent days, that whatever interests Australia has to pursue with the United States in the trade field and whatever differences we have there-we do have some substantial differences in that area-the close harmony of Australian and American foreign policy and defence interests remains unaffected.</PARA>
<PARA> I think that from the answer I have given it is obvious that we were not aware in advance-although there had been some broad indications, in the terms I have given, of the contents of the speech-that the Prime Minister may be moving to that sort of area. Having said that, we have made quite clear all the way through our fundamental difference with our friends in New Zealand on this issue. Repeating in conclusion, I hope that the Government of New Zealand will not go to this final step of withdrawing from the treaty.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Social Security aware of claims that only age pensioners well enough to work will benefit from the increase in the tax free area announced in the April economic statement? Can the Minister advise the House of the validity of these claims?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1688" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Hawker for that question. I think all honourable members in the House will have an interest in the answer in the sense that, whenever there is change either in social security incomes tests or in the tax treatment of income affecting age pensions, there is invariably some confusion. I think it is important that I clarify the position. Honourable members will be aware that we have carried out an extensive process of consultation. One of the issues that became crystal clear was that pensioners were concerned about the interaction between the income test and the tax treatment of income. Therefore, in response to that concern we decided to make pensions income test free in the area of $40 a week for single pensioners and $70 a week combined for married couples. Income in those areas will be 100 per cent tax free. This radical objective will be obtained in 1989-90 for married couples and 1990-91 for single pensioners. It will boost the after tax income for the vast majority of age pensioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some commentators have claimed that this move will benefit only a limited number of age pensioners who are well enough to secure part time work. Of course, that is quite incorrect. The free area does not simply go to earned income from paid employment; it covers, in fact, all relevant income received by age pensioners, such as interest from investments, superannuation pensions, overseas pensions and rental income as well as earnings from paid employment. Out of 1.3 million age pensioners, 1.15 million report some such income. By 1991 the pension free area will be, as I said, 100 per cent tax free. More than three-quarters of all age pensioners receive private non-pension income less than the free area and therefore will not have to pay income tax from 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of this historic reform more than one million age pensioners will face no tax at all on their interest from investments or on their superannuation pensions or, indeed, on their income from any source. For the vast majority of age pensioners we have made the recent debate about the tax treatment of income from investments absolutely irrelevant. It will be irrelevant to them because we have delivered a more far-reaching reform. We have taken them out of the tax system and made their interest income tax free if their non-pension income in 1990-91 is below the pension free area.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the example of a single age pensioner whose only private non-pension income comes from interest from investments. In 1989-90, these people will be able to receive up to $25 per week and still receive the full pension and pay no tax. In 1990-91, this amount will increase to $40 per week. With a savings bank savings investment account paying 12 per cent per annum interest, such a pensioner can invest up to $10,800 next financial year and $17,300 in 1990-91 without losing any pension or paying any tax. Age pensioners with several thousand dollars in cheque accounts or in a 3.5 per cent passbook account now have a real incentive to maximise their investment income.</PARA>
<PARA> The gains from the Government's April statement tax measures for age pensioners are not restricted to those with private non-pension income below the free areas. In fact, the combined operation of the pensioner tax rebate and the reduction in tax rates means that those pensioners still paying tax will also receive a significant boost in their after tax income. For example, a single pensioner with private non-pension income of $100 per week will pay $6.75 per week less tax in 1989-90 and $11.75 per week less tax in 1990-91 compared to the current situation. Finally, an additional 75,000 age pensioners will not be involved in provisional tax because all those who are recipients of part of the pensioner tax rebate will not be required to file provisional tax returns.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer him to the Treasurer's threat on behalf of the Government to reduce the growth of financial assistance grants to New South Wales because of certain decisions by the New South Wales Government relating to roads and pollution. Does this decision mean that approval or disapproval of the financial policies of State governments has now become a criterion for the allocation of Federal funds? If so, will the Government be totally even-handed and reduce the growth of financial assistance grants to Victoria and Western Australia, in view of the large commitments of taxpayers' funds required in those States to cover losses negligently incurred by the Victorian Economic Development Corporation and Western Australia Inc. respectively?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to the observations by the Treasurer, he was referring to the simple, and I would think obvious, fact that the decisions that were taken by the Commonwealth Government and reflected in the statement handed down in this place by the Treasurer, were decisions which were calculated to be in the interests of the whole of Australia-not just the Commonwealth Government, but all States. Clearly, those decisions reflected the need to have a considerable exercise in restraint on outlays. It is the case that in the period since we have been in office the Commonwealth, through the decisions of this Government, has exercised a considerably greater degree of restraint on its spending than have the States, and this is reflected--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rubbish!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member can carry on and make noises, but he never reflects any understanding. The facts are quite simple and irrefutable, and his noises make no difference to the facts. The facts are that this Government at the Federal level has exercised a considerable degree of restraint, which is shown in the percentages of movement in outlays, and it is also reflected in total in terms of the net contributions that are made by the Commonwealth and the States to the public sector borrowing requirement, where the decisions of the Federal Government in total have more than compensated for the excesses of the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Against that background the decisions that we took in April were calculated, as I say, to show that exercise in spending restraint, which is necessary if the country as a whole, is going to meet the challenge of the unsustainable level of imports associated with the current level of economic activity. In that context it ill behoves people, such as the Premier of New South Wales, who can be quite free and liberal with their comments about the need for restraint by the Commonwealth Government, to have shown no such restraint themselves. When we meet with the States in May-at the Premiers Conference and the Loan Council and in the period leading up to that-obviously we will take account of what we regard as the degrees of fiscal responsibility exhibited by the States.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does Australia continue to seek a total ban on chemical weapons, or will the International Conference on Chemical Weapons, to be held in Australia later this year, divert the negotiations to the much weaker goal of non-proliferation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1689" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for this question, which deals with a matter of quite fundamental importance not only to this country but to the whole world. I can assure the honourable member that a comprehensive global ban on chemical weapons remains Australia's prime objective in this area of disarmament. We are very active participants in the United Nations Committee on Disarmament's negotiations on a chemical weapons convention and we are fully committed to the early conclusion, and entry into force, of an effective convention. The honourable gentleman may know what a prominent role Australia is playing in international efforts against chemical weapons. Indeed, I think it is fair to say that no country is playing a more prominent role in this area than Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me substantiate that claim. Firstly, we are active in convening consultations among 19 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development member states-indeed, that group is known as the Australian group-to develop coordinated export controls over chemical weapons precursors. Secondly, we have been very active in undertaking consultations with governments in the region to prevent the spread of chemical weapons in our neighbourhood. Thirdly, we have been active in building a constructive working dialogue with Australia's own chemical industry.</PARA>
<PARA> It is against that background of consistent effort in this area of trying to move towards the complete obliteration of chemical weapons that Australia will host a major international chemical weapons conference in September this year. The aim of that conference will be to bring together governments and representatives of the international chemical industry to discuss, within such an environment, the role and the responsibility of industry in the international movement to eradicate chemical weapons and, in particular, to discuss the contribution that industry can make towards a comprehensive global ban on chemical weapons. This government-industry conference that we will convene in September is intended to support fully and to make a constructive weapons convention. Obviously, industry will have a crucial role to play if the chemical weapons convention is to be effective. The conference will provide a dialogue between governments and industry on the problem of chemical weapons, the implications for industry of a chemical weapons convention, and the ways in which industry itself can make a contribution to a comprehensive convention.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, Australians should be proud of the obviously prominent and almost pre-eminent role that the Australian Government, on behalf of the people of Australia, is playing in this important area of disarmament. The conference will not be in any way an attempt to establish what could be called a second track alternative to the chemical weapons convention.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure whether the honourable member said `peerless' or `fearless', but I will let that one pass. The Government has a consistent record of micro-economic reform in the primary industries and energy area. I instance the statutory marketing authority reform, the generally more economically sensible assistance arrangements, the research arrangements, the new dairy industry arrangements, the wheat marketing legislation we put into place four or five years ago, the oil taxation reforms, particularly the resource rent taxation regime, et cetera. Generally, the Government has acted in the micro-economic area with respect to tariff cuts. I refer also to what we are doing in the industrial relations area in respect of award restructuring, taxation, transport and, of course, the financial sector deregulation and the floating of the Australian dollar-not that I would expect the Opposition to understand the implications of those two latter items.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These are all measures that honourable members opposite, when in government, either would not or could not take. In my area, there is the Resources Assessment Commission, and, again, wheat marketing, grain transport and sugar assistance matters will be debated in this House this month. There will be future announcements in my portfolio area on drought policy, fisheries management, research and development, the Bureau of Mineral Resources, statutory marketing authority operations, and oil excise. In other words, we are getting on with the job the whole time in the micro-economic reform area in my portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA> I guess we could compare that with the stance of the Opposition and the trauma caused there by even relatively small changes. For example, in relation to wheat we have the spectacle of the Leader of the Opposition finally having a bit of a political win over the National Party of Australia-but with no dedication to any particular principle or conceptual base to any policy direction. While the Leader was trying to get a bit of political credit for this historic event, the first win in his life after failing for five years as Treasurer in the previous Liberal Government, the Nationals went into revenge mode. The Deputy Leader of the National Party let every media person in this building know that he was considering resigning over the issue. Now the Leader of the National Party and the Nationals in general are gunning for the honourable member for O'Connor. So, that is the next one.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that the mention of matters relating to wheat drives honourable members opposite into a sort of frenzy. However, another matter that I could mention is the sugar embargo measure that will go before the Senate next week. Sugar is the most overregulated industry. That will be another test for the Leader of the Opposition. It probably costs the country something like $500m. It is the only industry that has an import embargo. That, again, is supported by the Nationals. It went back to emergency war conditions. That related to the First World War, and it seems that it is a bit soon for them to change. The honourable member for Gippsland supports the oil industry's campaign for access to community petroleum reserves for nothing. In other words, he wants to give away $1.4 billion to the world's richest and biggest company-and it will not have any effect on oil exploration but will have an adverse macro-economic effect through a lower Budget surplus. I must say that the Government is committed to sensible oil taxation, and we will not give away $1.4 billion for nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To give a bit of charitable advice, the Leader of the Opposition can beat the Nationals only by taking them on.

It has already won Groom and it could easily win Fairfax and Richmond. At least the Labor Party will win Dawson and Kennedy from the Nationals.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. The question has an interesting base to it, given the fact that the Leader of the Opposition likes to set himself bogus tests, such as whether he can get a National Party bloke on a Liberal Party ticket, as though that matters a damn to the country, and fails every test when it comes to dealing with the organisation of efficiencies, be they in government industry or in terms of sensible deregulation in some areas of the economy, where it actually matters. That is where it does matter. Yet another example of that is the process by which the National Party and the Liberal Party seem to be attempting to take the seat from the honourable gentleman who asked the question, an activity they will never succeed in. They have spent a substantial amount of time, via the senator he mentioned, attacking the honourable member on totally bogus grounds about developments at the factory in Bendigo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make a couple of points absolutely clear, to answer the nonsense that has been put forward, unrepudiated, by the Opposition in regard to the efficiencies that have been undertaken by this Government at the factory in Bendigo. The first thing I would point out is that the factory will not be swallowed up by the Maribyrnong Ordnance Factory. Claims to that effect have no foundation whatsoever. Under this Government, the Bendigo factory has a strong and secure future. When we took office Bendigo was under-equipped, uncompetitive and heavily subsidised, like all other areas of industry in the Defence portfolio. Bendigo can now face a future with confidence, contrary to what has been said by Senator McGauran, because it has been rendered efficient. At the time we took office defence factories either had to be reformed or closed. What members of the National Party would choose for Bendigo would be a slow death. The Government chooses reform so that we have industries which will grow and jobs which will last.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that in government factories in the defence area where there have been substantial micro-economic reforms there has been a very substantial shift in the numbers of people working. They have come down from about 14,000 to about 8,000. All this dramatic change has been negotiated with the unions around the country. In absolute terms the factories are producing a great deal more than they were before. Net savings to the Defence portfolio to date are somewhere in the realm of $200m to $260m per annum, which is the equivalent of more than 3 per cent real growth in the defence vote, which is the way in which we are able to afford the defence programs we are putting forward in a period of very tight constraint. The only way we can afford defence expenditure in a period of restraint is by taking efficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA> One can pick any point of government activity anywhere and find that, when a government takes a tough decision, puts it through, makes the organisation survive, makes it effective and commercial, one can guarantee it will be subject to nitpicking by the Opposition-in this case, Senator McGauran-along the way. If ever the coalition gets on to this side of the House-and I do not believe it will-any of its reform efforts will collapse precisely because of the same nitpicking. Indeed, Senator McGauran himself said, when queried on the micro-economic reform issues that were confronting the coalition at the time:</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal Party, from time to time, always try and bully the National Party but it never works because our strength comes from our membership . . . and they'll never be able to bully our membership.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the problem in this country. We have an Opposition trying to sell its whole platform now on the basis that it is capable of delivering on micro-economic reform. The Opposition will fail to jump any test it confronts on this.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to recent reports suggesting that nuclear fusion experiments have taken place at room temperature using a relatively simple process? Can he inform the House of any attempts his Department has made to corroborate such reports? What would such a breakthrough mean?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1693" SPEAKER="Jones The Hon B.O." NAMEID="KH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="LALOR" MINISTERIAL="SCIENCE, CUSTOMS AND SMALL BUSINESS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least six groups in Australia at the moment are carrying out experimentation on cold fusion. They include two divisions of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)-the divisions of mineral products and fuel technology-and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. Universities in Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide-particularly, Flinders University-are also carrying out work. At this stage there are still some difficulties with cold fusion and alternative explanations for the appearance of heat and neutrons are possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This follows initial reports of two very interesting experiments in the State of Utah. First was the work of Pons and Fleischmann, which now has a bit of a question mark over it. It is thought that there are alternative chemical explanations for what was reported. More interesting work is being carried out in Utah by a group at the Brigham Young University at Provo led by Dr Steven Jones, who is no relation of mine! His work is perhaps the most interesting because it helps to explain a phenomenon in geomorphology-that the earth is getting hotter in some areas, as shown by volcanic action. It also provides a possible explanation for the phenomenon of continental drift.</PARA>
<PARA> What Jones's people have found with their work on cold fusion is that there appears to be interaction between atoms of deuterium and deuterium. It is thought that deuterium, which occurs naturally in sea water, is sucked in through fissures in the shore, and goes into the magma inside the earth. There is then a cold fusion process. I say `cold fusion' because it is operating at thousands of degrees celsius, not at millions of degrees celsius as is the case with fusion work in laboratories. Then out comes heat, helium and tritium. This accounts for the extraordinary phenomena which occurred a few years ago and were not understood. Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen which occurs as a by-product of hydrogen bomb tests. There have been a number of observations of tritium in the atmosphere in the presence of volcanoes. It was assumed that this was as a result of Soviet nuclear testing and that the tritium was borne on winds from this testing. The alternative explanation is that it was a result of a fusion process.</PARA>
<PARA> One last point needs to be made: I congratulate Australian industry, which has not normally been interested in long term research, for the very generous contribution by the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd laboratories. It has made a down payment of $60,000 towards CSIRO research on cold fusion, with the prospect that if the experimentation looks promising there will be continued support. We have to maintain a certain scientific scepticism; we cannot go overboard about cold fusion because there is still a big question mark over it. However, if this development is correct it makes the splitting of the uranium atom in 1938 pale into insignificance. We cannot afford not to be deeply involved, because the political and socio-economic implications are enormous.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I realise that this issue is causing considerable concern amongst health care workers and the general community. Regrettably, much of this concern arises from misinformation and confusion in the media. I want to put the facts clearly on the record. Media reports have dealt with two separate cases, neither of which relates to known infection of a professional health care worker as a result of occupational exposure to the AIDS virus. I understand that the case which was reported in the Newcastle Herald relates to a needle-stick injury suffered by a nurse which has not been confirmed to have resulted in infection; thus no details have been reported to me, the Department of Community Services and Health or the National Health and Medical Research Council special unit on AIDS epidemiology and clinical research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second case, reported by Professor Basten at the recent doctors summit on AIDS, involves a woman who, in the course of helping to care for a friend suffering from AIDS, received a needle-stick injury and was infected with the virus. The woman was not a health care worker and the incident did not take place in a hospital or health care setting but at the man's place of residence. I do not seek to undermine either the seriousness or the tragic nature of that incident. I think it is a tragic reinforcement of the need for all health workers, volunteers and carers who are helping AIDS patients strictly to adhere to guidelines on infection control and accident prevention. It is important to clarify that there is, as yet, no known case of a professional health care worker in Australia having been infected as a result of occupational exposure. Nevertheless, the risk does exist, and it is of understandable concern to the many people caring for AIDS sufferers with skill, dedication and compassion. Last week's doctors summit on AIDS addressed this issue at some length, during which medical and scientific experts stressed the continuing efficacy of infection control guidelines, developed in consultation with the medical profession, and reached general consensus that there was no basis for, and it would be impracticable to introduce, compulsory testing for all surgical patients. The Australian Medical Association's new policy on testing of patients is to be commended, demonstrating a responsible, commonsense approach based on medical and scientific advice and designed to protect the public health of the whole community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point to be made in all this is that the principles that the Government seeks to achieve are very clear. The idea is to relieve those pensioners of any obligation to pay tax up to the amount that is permissible. This is going to be phased in for different classes of pensioners. It will be extraordinarily surprising if any pensioner between July and August exceeds the threshold. There is a relatively small number of pensioners who are involved in PAYE deductions in any event.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point is that adjustments to these rebates have frequently been made in the Budget context; that is, after the beginning of the taxation or financial year. Of course, the adjustments are very readily made during the course of the year or at the end of the year when the normal arrangements are made. There is no great mystery about this. Everyone is aware of the objective that the Government is trying to achieve. It has to be phased in for the different classes of pensioners. I do not see there being a great mystery in the matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Professor Cass laid down principles in terms of equity which the Government has pursued not only in terms of the outlays side of the Budget but also in terms of revenue measures. If there is a clear illustration of the Government's pursuit of those principles of equity referred to by the honourable member for Chifley, it is in the April statement where a package was put together costing about 4.9 billion, which provides very significant tax relief, very largely for families, and is complemented by the very significant improvements in family allowances and the easing of the various rebates as they affect families. The reforms in terms of family allowances are historic not only in the sense that they establish the new rates of $9 for the first three children and $12 for additional children beyond that level but also in the sense that for the first time in the social security system-indeed, one might argue, in the tax transfer system-we have entrenched indexation of family payments and also indexation of some of the principal rebate areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The gains are undeniable. A middle income family, a single income family, with two adults and two children and on average weekly earnings receives $24 or the equivalent of a wage rise of $41 a week. For a family on $340 a week, or about two-thirds of average weekly earnings, the wage equivalent increase is about 11 per cent. In terms of a commitment to equity, it would be hard to find a collection of measures ever introduced by a government that was more progressive in its impact and delivered more significant improvements for families.</PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes we hear rhetoric from the Opposition about concern for families. I just make one point about the Opposition's record with respect to family allowances: in its period in government the cost to families of not indexing family allowances was $4.4 billion. The Government has not needed the meaningless rhetoric of the Opposition with respect to families. Since October 1986 we have had the guidance of Professor Cass. We have systematically worked our way through the issues and we have achieved, not only on the tax side of the equation but also on improvements in family allowances, a major reform in terms of assistance to families. This Government has no need or requirement for advice. The Government has sought its own advice. It has consulted, it has developed policies, and those policies represent very significant reform in terms of real levels of assistance, particularly for low and middle income families.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is well known that the test of any government's success is whether the living standards of people have risen during its period in office, whether families are more secure during its period in office and whether people have the capacity to purchase their own homes during its period in office. It is well known that this Government has failed, and failed miserably, on all three of those points. The tragedy of that is that its failure is a recipe for the loss of hope, increase in cynicism and social instability amongst, above all, young Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government is on record as a government which has broken two national records. First, never in Australia's history have homes been less affordable than they are today; and, secondly, never in Australia's history-not since Federation-have home loan interest rates been as high as they are today. When one looks at the statistics on home affordability, one can see that they really do tell a terrible story and are an indictment of the Hawke Government. The Housing Industry Association's March quarterly survey, which came out just a few days ago, shows that for yet another quarter home affordability has continued to slide. The article concerning the survey states:</PARA>
<PARA>The most recent fall occurred across nearly all States-</PARA>
<PARA>actually, the only exception was Canberra-</PARA>
<PARA>and reflected the increase in housing interest rates during the March quarter.</PARA>
<PARA>The article made this very telling point:</PARA>
<PARA>Although incomes increased faster than house prices, this improvement was overshadowed by a one per cent increase in housing interest rates to 15.5 per cent by mid-quarter which caused the Housing Affordability Index to decline by 5.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Those figures do not show the effect of yet another half a per cent increase in the home loan interest rates on top of that, taking it to 16 per cent. So even those figures on home affordability are too optimistic because, since those figures were collated, home affordability has declined still further. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the tragedies of these figures is the way in which in a city like Sydney, which has been particularly hard hit, there has been some turning in the marketplace and housing prices have started to decline. Incomes have risen slightly during the past quarter but, even though house prices have declined and incomes have risen, the fact is that the increase in home loan interest rates has far outstripped the positive effects of the fall in house prices, and even in Sydney with those effects home affordability has continued to decline. If one looks at the Real Estate Institute's recent survey, one will see that it comes up with similar sorts of figures. One of the things that it points out-and I think that this is particularly poignant-is the fact that sales to first home buyers-to those young people going out to buy their first home-have declined by some 4 per cent. That is a very sad thing because it shows that the real losers in today's national housing crisis are not older people, the people of middle age who bought their houses during the period of the Menzies Government or the Fraser Government: the real losers in Australia are our young people, the people who should be the enthusiasm for the future of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has created a sort of housing apartheid. One section of the community is especially favoured and especially fortunate because it grew up-if you like, matured-in a period when housing was available to ordinary Australians; while another section of the community-young people who left school in the past five or six years, and are now marrying and moving on with their lives-is excluded from home ownership for the foreseeable future. What we have from this Australian Labor Party (ALP), which preaches piously that it believes in equality, is a divided and unfair society. This has happened above all because of the Government's regressive interest rate strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of a mortgage on an average home for an average family since 1983, when this Government came to office, has increased in real terms by $82 a week. In the past 12 months mortgage costs have increased by $50 a month. That is a tragic indictment of the Government's record. It is a strategy which the Government has been forced to adopt because over six years it has abandoned the alternatives that it could have pursued. For six years the Government could have been reforming labour practices and the labour market, but it has done nothing. For six years the Government could have been reforming the taxation system to encourage saving, rather than keeping the current system which encourages consumption. For six years it could have been doing something to reform the arteries of Australia's export industries, the waterfront and shipping, and in particular coastal shipping. For six years it could have been working at building up our national productivity, yet during that period our national productivity has stabilised or declined. The Government has spent six years trying to rerun the housing policies of the long gone and long forgotten Chifley Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government has been forced to do, having abandoned all of those alternative strategies, is to try to soak up consumption with high interest rates so that our balance of payments position does not continue to deteriorate. The weight of that burden of economic policy falls on the shoulders of young people who want to purchase that family home. They cannot do it because the Government has adopted one strategy and turned its back on many others. It is interesting to see that in the last few weeks the Government has decided, in a flight of political panic, to search around for excuses. This has increasingly become the government of excuses. </PARA>
<PARA> The first excuse that has become increasingly prominent from the Treasurer (Mr Keating), and also, I note, from the Premier of Victoria, is that the housing crisis, the interest rate crisis, is, after all, the fault of the greedy banks. This was the old line that the Chifley Government used in the 1940s. Nobody on this side of the House would argue that the banks were always perfect, that banks never made mistakes, but the fact is that if the Government's allegation that the banks were responsible for the high level of home loan interest rates today were true, over the last year home loan interest rates would have increased substantially faster than 90-day bank bill rates. The statistics show that the reverse is true. In July 1988, 90-day rates were, on average, 13.05 per cent. In that same month, home loan interest rates were 13.5 per cent. Yesterday, 90-day rates were 17.2 per cent and home loan interest rates were 16 per cent. The point is that home loan interest rates today are below 90-day bank bill rates, whereas in July last year it was the other way round. How one can argue that the increase in home loan interest rates is the fault of the banks, when it is the 90-day bank bill rates which have led the charge in the interest rate spiral, defies imagination. It is a political gimmick and it is the oldest political stunt in history to blame any institution one can possibly find for the failure of one's own policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Nowadays we are getting reports in newspapers-discreetly leaked, no doubt, from the Treasurer's office-that an official in the Treasury has written a letter to the banks asking them to explain why they have not honoured a deal that the Government reached with them in 1986. This letter which we read about in all the newspapers has no doubt been leaked to try to direct more blame for the Government's high interest rate strategy towards the banks. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 the banks were paid $120m by the Government on two conditions. The first of those conditions was that the banks would lend at least $6 billion in the 1986-87 financial year and thereafter for the purpose of housing. The banks did that; they exceeded that goal, so the first condition was met by the banks. The second condition that the Government laid down was that there should be more flexible lending packages provided by the banks. Once more the banks have provided those more flexible lending packages, such as low-start or fixed interest loans. The fact that people in the community have not rushed to take up these new options is, I guess, a reflection of the natural conservatism of Australians. I do not criticise people for that. It is also true that the banks have met that condition by providing more flexible lending packages. The information that the Treasurer or the Treasury have leaked to the newspapers chooses not to reveal that the six biggest banks in Australia have all replied to that letter from the Treasury and have pointed out that the conditions laid down by the Government in 1986 have been met. So this first excuse that the banks are responsible for the housing chaos which has hit Australia is totally and demonstrably false. </PARA>
<PARA> The second excuse is the one from the Treasurer, which I note he has recently started to back away from, that the reason for the housing crisis in Australia is that home owners themselves are irresponsible. Do people remember this famous statement by the Treasurer, `The person in a house, on a block of land, with a backyard swimming pool, a rotary hoist and a front yard, is driving up house prices, not governments'? Apparently, the blame falls on the home owners themselves. That excuse was seen to be politically inconvenient, so it has recently been walked away from. What we found in its place was the third great excuse for the housing crisis-that it was all the fault of the States. The States were responsible because they had pushed up housing prices as they did not have proper land supply policies. Let me tell the House that even in Sydney about 50 per cent of the increase in housing costs for mortgagees over the last six years has been due to interest rates alone, and in other States the percentage due to interest rates alone ranged up to 90 per cent. So that argument is not true and the untruth of it was revealed in a paper published yesterday for the National Housing Review, known as Background Paper No. 2. That paper makes the simple point that a comparison of the ownership rates for income units in 1981-82 and 1985-86 shows that the proportion of owner purchasers has declined at every income level for all family types. it points out that this is as a result of rising interest rates. Again, the excuse that it is all the fault of the States is false. The blame lies once more where it will always lie in the minds of the community-here in Canberra, with the Government's monetary and high interest rates policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The excuses of the Government are dishonest and phoney. The public is not accepting them and it never will. The last resort of the Government, as its excuses begin to fall by the wayside, is to cook the books on the consumer price index. When that figure comes out this Thursday, the weight given to housing will have been devalued. We will see a more favourable figure, and a prayer from the Government that home loan interest rates might come down as a result. Of course, people will not be deceived; they will know that the books have been cooked this time. </PARA>
<PARA> What conclusion can we draw when we look at the wreckage of the lives of young people which has been caused by this Government? When they left school they hoped they would be able to emulate their parents and buy a home, and have their lives revolve around that home? What conclusion can we draw from six years under Labor? We can draw the quite clear conclusion that it has taken away from a generation of Australians the aspiration of home ownership, which is at the very foundation of Australian society. Let me tell honourable members on the other side of the House that young potential home buyers will strangle the political life out of the Hawke-Keating Government at the next election with all the enthusiasm of a farmer throttling his Christmas turkey. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge quite readily that it is the role of the Opposition to target issues of community importance. I acknowledge also that at this time the housing interest rate is certainly a community issue. It is an issue of concern to people, whether they are buying their own homes or purchasing a beach house. It is of concern to many people who have no involvement in this issue and who own their own homes. But to see housing interest rates as some simple gauge or measure of this Government's performance in the economic sphere is simply not true. It is a misrepresentation and it is a position of misinformation. Even more, it is not true for the Opposition to stand here and run on the housing interest rates issue. I suggest that it is unpalatable to many people to hear the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) spend most of his time here defending the banks. It is an amazing situation. If the man had any political decency he would have talked about the problems being caused by the banks. I will come back to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us compare this Government's activities over the last five years with the Opposition's activities over the previous five years when it was in government. The comparative measure is always a good one. Let us look at the comparisons in housing. Since 1982-83, when this Government took over, there has been a massive increase in Commonwealth Government assistance for public housing. In fact, it has doubled since 1983. Two hundred and fifteen thousand families are now in public housing compared to 165,000 in the previous five years under the previous Government, to which the honourable member for Mayo attributes allegiance. In the last five years 70,000 householders have been able to get income to be able to purchase their own homes compared to 50,000 in the previous five-year period. We can add another 70,000 dwellings that have been built for rental purposes. The number under the previous Government was 40,000. Statistically there is no comparison. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982-83 there were only 105,000 housing commencements. Last year there were 136,000, and the projection for this year is 168,000. That is a massive increase. They are not our figures; they come from the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry itself. What have we done to help? We introduced the first home owners scheme, a scheme that the honourable member for Mayo, the Liberal Party and the National Party want to abolish. Yet since 1983, 324,000 Australian families have been helped into their own homes by that scheme. It has helped thousands of people in the electorates of most honourable members. The honourable member for Mayo says, `We are going to get rid of it', even though 80 per cent of those who have been helped have been in the low income area, the recipients of low wages. The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Mayo, has put forward a scheme to do away with the first home owners scheme. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2K4">Mr WRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is semantics; nonsense. What is the difference between replacing something and doing away with something? The honourable member has been found out. The first home owners scheme, since its inception in 1983, has meant $1.4 billion to families across this nation. It has helped almost 350,000 families. We can add to this the rental assistance scheme: the $15 a week will increase to $30 a week for low income families and large families by 1990. We can add the short term accommodation program for the homeless and those in crisis. At this moment, 75,000 Australians are being assisted in 1,200 centres across this nation, yet the honourable member for Mayo and the Opposition want to remove that scheme. The sum of $220m will be spent over the next three years on helping tens of thousands of people. Five thousand extra people will be helped immediately by the program that we announced in November last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's record is one of confusion. It is half-baked. Its latest attempt to produce a housing policy centres on a homesure account scheme and housing allowances. As I said, the Opposition proposes to abolish the first home owners scheme. It will abolish rental assistance. What will that mean to the thousands of pensioners and low income families, those in public housing, who will be forced into poverty? More importantly, the Opposition will abolish the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (CSHA). That must anger the Greiners, the Aherns and the Grays as well as the responsible Labor Ministers and Premiers. The Opposition says it will get rid of it. This year it will mean that $700m will come directly from the CSHA as well as $310.5m from the nominated Loan Council funds, plus an additional $103.5m as general purpose grants, and the States can do anything they want with it. If the States use it for housing, they get that money at the rate of 4.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member had the audacity to defend some of the States. About one-sixth of some $400,000 from the Loan Council goes to Queensland at the rate of 4.5 per cent. It is being lent to Queenslanders at the rate of 13.75 per cent. Yet the honourable member has the audacity to say that it is not the States' fault. Surely everybody is contributing in some way to the problems in the housing sector today. Certainly many States are doing just that. Queensland goes a little further. As we give families the family allowance supplement scheme money-for a family with children aged, say, nine and 13 it means over $50 in the hand tax free-the State of Queensland adds that amount to family income. This means an extra $8 to $9 per week, or $450 per year. If we multiply that by the 20,000 families in housing commission homes in Queensland, we will see that the Queensland National Party Government is robbing about $8m a year from those in the lower income bracket. It is money that is used to pay rent. The honourable member for Mayo defends the States. What an outrageous position to take. </PARA>
<PARA> I attended a service club meeting the other night and found that it had some $20,000-odd in an account getting 3.75 per cent. I do not have figures for the last two months but figures for the last five or six months show that the savings accounts in the private banks and in the Commonwealth Bank amount to over $50 billion. For that the banks pay 3.75 per cent to about 8 per cent. They lend it at the rate of 16 to 16 1/2 per cent. The honourable member for Mayo has the audacity, the gall, to defend the banks. No wonder Paul Keating, as the Treasurer of this nation, is saying that the banks ought to come up with some initiatives, some innovative schemes, to do something for the low income families. They have not introduced their low start schemes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mayo has not met a person with a mortgage in his life. He was born with $1m in one pocket and half a million in the other. He would not know what a mortgage is all about. I suggest that if he talks to people in his electorate who have to pay off their homes, he may come into this House or go into his Party meetings with some reasonable policies. If the honourable member were to do that, he would not be defending the banks. He would know that not only are they charging 16 or 16 1/2 per cent; they also have application fees, management fees and hidden charges. When a building society in Queensland increased interest rates recently, and everybody's account had to be adjusted, it charged every client for doing so. Does the honourable member for Mayo defend that? Does he say that that is a proper practice? When the building society raised the interest rate, it charged the clients! It is time the honourable member sat down with people who have been in trouble and came to an understanding of what has been going on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No government in its right mind would keep interest rates at 15 or 16 per cent if there were another way around the problem. The honourable member for Mayo and Opposition members know darned well that we have major national economic problems, which are caused, in the main, by the private sector. Opposition members talk about the massive foreign debt. In December last year it was $121 billion gross, but 61 per cent of that money was owed by the private sector; not by this Government, not by the State governments. The entrepreneurs, whom the honourable member backs, who borrow billions of dollars offshore to take over some Australian companies are causing problems. The yuppies in the honourable member's State who drive around in expensive cars are--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2K4">Mr WRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are plenty in South Australia from what I hear. No doubt they support the honourable member. Our foreign debt is not owed in the main by this Government; it is owed by the private sector. What angers me when we talk about interest rates is why people with mortgages have to carry the burden. People say, `Why can't you introduce tariffs on those very expensive goods? Why can't you put tariffs on the expensive cars such as the Mercedes, the BMWs and so on? Why is it that when you want to dampen the economy you have to put it across the board?' We appreciate that we have to reduce the purchasing power of Australians. We have to stop them from changing their washing machines and buying new cars. We have to reduce imports, and the only way to do that is to reduce the purchasing power of money, or reduce the amount of purchasing power families have got.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a regrettable situation. I would like to think that we can get together, that instead of brawling and playing politics about this issue we can sit down and say, `Okay, we know that the States have a responsibility, that the banks have a responsibility, that the Commonwealth has a responsibility, and that it is time we all started working together.' I would like to think that we could take some of those funds away from the banks. As I have said, this involves between $50 billion and $60 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> A few years ago I floated a scheme that I called the Australia Fund, which could have been used through the Commonwealth Development Bank. If we took 15 per cent or, say, 25 per cent of the amounts of money in the savings banks, we would have some $10 billion to $15 billion to play with. With that sort of money we could consolidate the debts of the primary industry sector. We could make available $2 billion-$2,000m-for housing, and we could double the amount of grants that we give to local authorities by way of loans-and this could all be done at the inflation rate. So, to start with, we should be looking at innovative schemes. I will continue to pursue the scheme that I proposed, because I believe it could work. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Opposition is now looking at bonds or some such scheme. It may well be that we have to come back to a situation where we close off, exempt or protect the housing industry. However, as we all appreciate, the moment that interest rates are brought down demand is created. As demand for houses is created and people enter the housing industry and buy new homes we get a situation such as that which exists in Sydney at the moment, and which I was told about this morning, where a brickie can get $1 for every brick laid. Thus, if he lays 500 bricks a day-which I am told is not too much of a task-he can make $500 a day. What happens is that demand blows out, prices go up and the consumer is caught in a catch 22 situation. If the price for land goes up, because interest rates are lower and people are willing to pay more, or if the prices of houses go up, or if labour costs go up, the cost of the total house unit goes up, and I do not think that the consumer is any better off. </PARA>
<PARA> We face a dilemma. We must come back to contend with the question of the historic profits made by the banks. Let us see what happens this week when the banks announce what moneys they have made. It will probably be the most ever in the history of this nation, and yet the honourable member for Mayo gets up and defends them. We know that the banks are borrowing millions of dollars on the strength of the billions of dollars obtained from ordinary people-including money from the aged, which we call `grey money'. The banks are paying 3.5 per cent or 3.75 per cent and they are re-lending the money at 16 per cent-and yet the honourable member for Mayo sits there and smiles and laughs because he has no concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo wants to introduce a scheme which, I am told, will stop anyone over the age of 25 from getting a loan. These are the nonsense sorts of things that we hear from the honourable member for Mayo. It is mainly because he is totally out of touch. It is time that the banks honoured the agreements that they gave to the Government. It is time that the banks introduced more innovative schemes. It is time that they lowered their interest rates and removed their hidden charges and the application and management fees. It is time the banks did something to assist those ordinary people, those low income families, who are striving to own their own homes. It is time to get rid of the shoddy tricks, as I said before, with building societies putting an extra charge or fee on people, while themselves increasing interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> We all appreciate that the housing industry is a catalyst to the economy, but the people who are buying houses must be protected. We must stop what is going on in the banking industry. If the Opposition had any decency, members opposite would stand up and say, `Let's address the problems in the banking industry to start with'. However, the honourable member for Mayo has defended the banks. </PARA>

We, too, ask why that cannot be done. This is an important factor. I have often raised in the House the matter of finance for roads. There is no more highly taxed person than the Australian motorist. Today, practically half of what a motorist pays for an ordinary vehicle goes to the Commonwealth Treasury. That is what happens. Some $18 of the cost of filling the tank of an ordinary motor car at the bowser goes to the Government. These taxes are tremendous. We have never seen such high taxes. </PARA>

However, the fact is that it is not as easy as the honourable member suggested. If it was, I am sure that the best Treasurer in the world, as he has been described, would try to do something about the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the aim of every Australian to own a home. This is the important thing that the Australian Government must realise. I think that the rate of home ownership in this country is about 70 per cent. We do not want to see that figure decline. However, the values that apply in all capital cities in Australia indicate that home ownership is getting far out of reach of many young Australians. Is this the result of the Government's economic policy? Is this the result of interest rates being forced up so high? They have been forced up to their present level by the Treasurer himself. This is an important point. He has relied on fiscal policy and on nothing else. The financial statement that the Treasurer made recently contained nothing, to our way of thinking, that would increase productivity in this country. Certainly the banks are making a profit, but there are other people making profits today, the like of which we have never seen before-and this is happening under a socialist government. </PARA>
<PARA> I have an article here, written by Mr Ken Davidson for the Age. He mentions the de- regulation of our financial system, and points out that financial deregulation has done the reverse of what it was meant to do. Mr Davidson refers to five points relating to predictions that were made when financial deregulation was announced by the Treasurer. The first was that with free trade in foreign exchange, market forces would correct our imbalance of payments. Has that occurred? The Treasurer also said that exchange rates would be stabilised. Has that happened? In one year, the dollar has gone from 60c to 90c. I am not criticising deregulation; I think it might have been a good thing. However, honourable members opposite brought this in-and they must realise that-and it is having an adverse effect on the monetary funds of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer also said that banks would stop directing their building funds to their richer customers. Did that happen? As the honourable member for Capricornia has said, exactly the opposite situation prevails. Another thing that the Treasurer predicted when talking about financial deregulation was that competition would shave huge bank profits and prevent high interest rates. That is what the Government said at the time of bringing in financial deregulation. Has that occurred? In relation to all those five important issues relating to financial deregulation, the very reverse has actually occurred. I want to make this very clear, because I think it is important. </PARA>
<PARA> We now know that in this country there is more poverty than has ever been the case before. I do not doubt that there is poverty in this country. The honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) and I spoke about our service personnel only the other day. Some service personnel today are complaining that they are on the poverty line-and this relates to people with families living in my electorate. I do not know exactly where the line is, but the people themselves can gauge. If the income of a home is not sufficient to be able to keep a family, and we encourage people to have their own families, there is a problem somewhere along the line. </PARA>
<PARA> People are concerned about the taxes that they are paying today and concerned about the cost of the goods that they are buying in the supermarkets, their motor vehicles, and the furnishings and other items that they must buy. They are concerned to know how they can ever afford to pay a deposit and pay off a home. It is a virtual impossibility. A young fellow said to me the other day, `I want to build a home on 17 acres of land out of town'. I said, `How much do you have to borrow?'. He said, `I have to borrow $70,000'. If one works that out at 15 1/2 per cent one will see what he will be paying. It is certainly over $150 a week in interest alone-well above that. I have the actual figures here but time does not permit me to say the things I want to say about the figures, which spell out this situation so very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> Has the Government not woken up to the fact that if one goes through the suburbs and towns throughout this country today one sees crisis cottages and refuges being set up to care for young people? The Government has forgotten family life and has created a situation in which, because of a drop in income and high costs, people are unable to acquire a home of their own. Once that happens we downgrade family life within the community. The basis of family life today is not the pornography that the Government has allowed to float around this wonderful country of ours, coming through this very city of Canberra. The Government has done nothing about that. The Opposition has drawn attention to it time and again, but the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) says, `Wait until the government is established in the ACT'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is dragging the family unit down. It will not assist families, because of its economic policy, to purchase a home and live the way that the average Australian would like to live. One of the most adverse effects on people being able to acquire a home has been the imposition of the capital gains tax, the very tax that this Prime Minister said would never happen, like the petrol tax promise in 1983 and other promises that he has made. If a capital gains tax is imposed the vendor, whoever he is, whether he is selling land or selling a cottage on the land, is naturally going to find out whether the transaction is subject to capital gains tax and what that tax is. That tax will then be placed on top of the purchase price of that property. This is a natural thing to happen. Opposition members would do it, I would do it and I am sure the members of the Government would do it. The Government has imposed many other taxes I can talk about. I have got a list of them in front of me. The Government is prohibiting people from purchasing property because of the particular taxes that it has imposed. It also reduced by $1,000 the home loan grant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Towards the end of his speech to this House the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) said a lot can be said about the topic before the House. I regret to say the honourable member did not say very much about it. It is a topic chosen by the Opposition; it is the Opposition's choice of words. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The devastating effects of the Hawke Government's policy of forcing home loan interest rates to their highest level in history. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that, if that is the choice of words put by the Opposition, the first thing it has to establish in this debate is what are the devastating effects. I have not heard one piece of evidence yet put by any speaker in this House about the devastating effects. Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary. If Opposition members want to come into this place and have such a debate, we are always ready to accommodate them. They are well aware of that. If they want to use words such as `devastating effects', they have to prove their case. </PARA>
<PARA> They have failed abysmally because the reality is-and the anecdotal evidence is clear-that there are a number of people queuing up to buy homes in Australia today. Only last Friday afternoon I was given the honour of opening a real estate agent's office in the Epping part of my electorate, which is in the northern planning zone of Melbourne. That area currently is having new homes being occupied at the rate of about five a day. There is large ancillary growth occurring in the area as well because of the high housing growth. </PARA>
<PARA> There were a number of bank managers at the opening of the office. I was happy to speak to the estate agents and to the bank managers there. Being interested in the high cost of interest rates and the effect on housing, particularly in the areas which I represent, I asked the agents whether demand had diminished for housing in the area. The agents all told me very clearly that it had not: `No, people are queuing up to buy houses'. Devastating effects are clearly not established there. </PARA>
<PARA> I then spoke to the bank managers. I said, `Housing rates are high. We know that. Are people slowing down? Are they not coming into your banks and are they no longer wanting to borrow money from you? Is that slowing down your customers?'. The bank managers all told me, `No, no'. They said there was plenty of money to lend and plenty of people were coming in to borrow it. That seems to me to be a bit puzzling because we are told in this standard speech by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer)-the millionaire member of the New Right-that there are devastating effects occurring out there. One would have thought that, if it was devastating, people would not be buying housing. There would be no people queuing up to buy new housing; builders would not be going to the bank, happily banking their profits; bricklayers would not be getting a dollar a brick, as the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) said; and there would be a very depressed building industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We are going through a boom in building. We have got almost the highest number of building starts in this country's history. Nevertheless, the honourable member for Mayo insists there are devastating effects. They are his words, his choice. If people are queuing up to buy homes, people are queuing up to borrow money and the builders all have forward orders, where are the devastating effects?</PARA>
<PARA> I thought I would listen to honourable gentlemen opposite today to see what evidence they could produce. We can discount the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan), who rambled long and far between pornography, capital gains tax and roads taxes. Every now and then he mentioned interest rates incidentally to what he was talking about. The honourable member for Mayo has given the speech he gave today three or four times already in this session this year. I do not think he has varied it yet. Maybe next week we will be given yet another opportunity to respond to his fifth speech on the same topic in the same way. </PARA>

Just maybe we will get to a debate in this House where the real cause of interest rates-that is, the economic matrix which this country is undergoing and which gives rise to the monetary policy regime-will be debated by the Opposition. We just may get to the stage where the Opposition will produce its tax policy. It may well come into this House one day and say, `The Opposition, in government, would in fact have this tax regime'. The Opposition may well give us its fiscal policy. It may well come into this House and say, `We can, as a government, reduce interest rates because we, in government, will do the following in fiscal terms. We will sell all of the instrumentalities of government now owned by the Australian people; we will cut all of the following expenditure items'-and the Opposition would list them so the Australian people can clearly understand what it is talking about. Members of the Opposition could then say to this House and to the Australian people, `As a result of our fiscal policy we can reduce interest rates'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition should be fair dinkum about the economic debate-and that is what we are really on about. The honourable member for Mayo does not give a darn about people living in my suburbs. Those people do not affect him at all; they do not vote for him and he would not understand their problems in any event. When one has a silver spoon one just does not understand the problems that these people have. The reality is that it is an economic issue. Members of the Opposition will not debate it. They will not come into this House and debate the economic management of this country on an even basis. They will not give us their policies. If they say, as they do to the media and to the Australian people, that they would be better economic managers because they would use fiscal policy, it seems incumbent upon them to present the policy, and they will not. The other point, quite frankly, is that, yet again, they are not really tackling reality. </PARA>
<PARA> Many articles have been written recently in economic journals and magazines in Australia which give the absolute lie to the New Right claim that Australians' living standards have fallen. The New Right has a vested interest in trying to put forward the image that Australians are suffering in material and economic terms. Members of the New Right-people such as Mr Costello from the Melbourne Bar and Professor Kemp from Melbourne University, who are currently standing for pre-selection for the Liberal Party and will probably throw two fine members of the Liberal Party out of office very shortly-want to run with this line. The so-called middle-class housing crisis is a favourite attack of the New Right, but the reality is totally different. Today, people are buying larger homes. Homes are no longer uncarpeted, as was the first house that I bought.They are on much larger blocks of land, they have landscaped gardens, there are two car spaces in the garage and they have microwave ovens, dryers, dishwashers, new curtains and new furniture. Is it little wonder that mortgages are larger? The first house that I bought was an old timber house with scatter rugs on the floor, a second hand bed--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had a pushbike to get to work on, and I lived on three or four pounds a week. Young couples today want to complain that things are difficult, whilst buying brand new 30-square first homes which are fully carpeted and fully equipped with brand new appliances. They happily approach the banks to borrow up to their necks in consumer credit and house credit; yet they then complain that things are tough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Living standards in this country have never been higher. It is demonstrably so in any statistic one cares to look at. Employment levels are high; wage levels are high. I get very annoyed when people compare poverty in this country with that in other countries. Poverty, to me, is what I see in Third World countries. When I travel the world I look at countries in Asia where kids aged 10 to 11 have left school to work on the streets in order to make a living or else starve. I call that real poverty. When we look at Sudan, Bangladesh and other similar countries, we see what I call real poverty. That cannot be related to this country. No-one here really lives in poverty. There are disadvantaged people in relative terms, but that is not poverty in the real sense of the term. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) has handed me an article from the Australian Financial Review headed `Stop Whingeing: Australia's Living Standards May Never Be Higher'. Every member of the House should read it. It is statistically correct. On any reasonable standard of Australia's economic history measured over the last 20 years Australians are now living better than ever before across-the-board. I say to the Minister that that is the article I was referring to earlier but I was not quite game to read it out. The matter of public importance is a nonsense. The honourable member who proposed it and the members of the Opposition who have spoken on it have failed abysmally to present their case. They have no evidence, nor do they have any notion of what needs to be done to repair the economic damage being done by the balance of trade problems we now face. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the fifty-second general report of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The report I have tabled covers the activities of the twenty-ninth Committee during the period 1 January 1988 to 31 December 1988. Nineteen eighty-eight was an extremely busy year for the Public Works Committee (PWC), which met on 69 occasions, tabled 15 reports and recommended the construction of projects estimated to cost just over $1 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee welcomes a number of legislative amendments introduced during the year which altered the PWC Act in the following ways: to remove ambiguity the definition of the terms `work' and `public work' will now provide that a `work' means an architectural or engineering work and specifically excludes intangible things, movable works and engineering equipment not being integral components of a work; to ensure that works financed by deferred payment or similar arrangements are referable to the Committee; to facilitate consideration of new types of projects and delivery systems, types of works can be declared to be works or public works by regulation. Similarly, types of works can be declared not to be works or public works. From the Committee's viewpoint an attractive feature of this amendment is that it provides for consultation with the Committee prior to regulations being made. The amendments will allow works to be referred to the Committee at an earlier stage than has been possible in the past. This will allow works to be referred where, because of their nature, only limited design work can be completed before Committee consideration is necessary. The Committee is satisfied that the changes will facilitate its operations and activities and wishes to record its appreciation to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) for making officers of his Department available to brief it on the proposed changes. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one matter on which I wish to comment, one which is of considerable concern to the Committee. I refer to the exemption from the Public Works Committee Act in August 1988 of the following Government business enterprises: Australian Postal Commission; Aussat Pty Ltd; Overseas Telecommunications Commission; and the Australian Telecommunications Commission. While the Committee does not deny the right of the Government to make such a decision, it is extremely concerned that there was no opportunity for it to put its case before a decision was made. The Committee made its views known to the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans. It is with some surprise then that I have to inform the House that a similar situation may occur should a proposal to exempt the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Commission be approved by Cabinet without any prior discussion with the Committee. This matter, which has been before the Structural Adjustment Committee, will shortly go before Cabinet, again without any discussion by the Minister with the PWC. This is a matter on which the Committee feels very strongly as it believes that the principle of legislation scrutiny of the Executive is being eroded by such actions. I also doubt whether in fact these authorities are eligible for exemption under the terms of the PWC Act, and the Committee will be seeking a legal opinion from the Attorney-General's Department on the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two speeches in five minutes must be some sort of record for me. This Bill was debated during the last period of sitting, at which time I was to follow the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). I listened to his speech with great interest and I have had the opportunity to study it again in Hansard. Interestingly, the honourable member for Ryan indicated that the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation was one of the companies nominated for privatisation on the Opposition hit list. Naturally, I support the Bill before the House and oppose the amendment moved by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill amends the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Act 1970 in such a way as to convert the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, or SMEC as it is commonly known, into a public company called the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Ltd. It will also remove a variety of statutory controls which inhibit SMEC's commercial operations, thereby making it more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill represents a major step forward in implementing the reform package for the Corporation announced last August by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), and is part of the Hawke Labor Government's comprehensive program to improve the performance of government business enterprises. Without doubt, the Snowy Mountains scheme is the most imaginative and daring project ever initiated by an Australian government. Naturally, it was a Labor government. Full credit for the scheme must go to the Chifley Labor Government and especially to Prime Minister Ben Chifley himself. In a broadcast `Report to the Nation' in May 1949 he declared:</PARA>
<PARA>The Snowy Mountains plan is the greatest single plan in our history. It is a plan for the whole nation, belonging to no one State nor to any group or section. It is a two-sided plan because it provides not only for the provision of vast supplies of new power but also for an immense decentralisation of industry and population. This is a plan for the nation and it needs the nation to back it. </PARA>
<PARA>History shows that, while the conservative Opposition belatedly came to the position of supporting this great work of engineering and imagination, had it been left to it alone it would never have happened. Yet, several years down the track, at a function at the Tumut Pond dam in 1956, the very same person who had in the first instance condemned the Chifley Government's proposal as the work of socialism showed a complete about-face. At this function the Prime Minister of the day, Sir Robert Gordon Menzies, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In a period in which we in Australia are still, I think, handicapped by parochialism, by a slight distrust of big ideas and of big people or of big enterprises . . . this scheme is teaching us and everybody in Australia to think in a big way, to be thankful for big things, to be proud of big enterprises and . . . to be thankful for big men. </PARA>
<PARA>It would seem that Prime Minister Menzies was wrong. Despite the great success of the Snowy scheme, despite its obvious lessons, it would seem that our conservative opponents have learned nothing. Would that the conservatives sitting opposite and those in business, especially in our manufacturing industries, would take these words to heart, then Australia might begin to face the challenge of the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Should anyone require further proof of what I say, I suggest that person make but a cursory examination of the so-called Future Directions policy statement of the Opposition. It will become immediately obvious to the puzzled reader that its title is a complete misnomer-a more correct title would be `Past Directions'. That is indeed the nature of conservatism: to take us galloping into the past in a vain attempt to avoid the challenges of the future. </PARA>
<PARA> While many Australians had discussed the possibility of such a Snowy Mountains scheme off and on for the previous 70 years, had it not been for the energy, vision and drive of the Chifley Labor Government it would have remained a pipe-dream. While the scheme rapidly gained the support of all Australians, it was Prime Minister Chifley and his Labor Government that pushed it ahead in the face of conservative opposition under the leadership of Sir Robert Menzies, who saw it as yet another horrible example of socialism. </PARA>
<PARA> Some things do not change. It is of the very essence of conservatism that its adherents are unable to think big and imaginatively. It is of their very nature that conservatives seek to conserve-that is, to cling desperately to tired old ways and refuse to see the need for change. There is no better example of this in Australia's political history than the Snowy Mountains scheme. As the recently deceased and much admired Nelson Lemmon, Minister for Works and Housing in the Chifley Labor Government, said in his second reading speech of 26 May 1949 on the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Power Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill is not a complex one. It is simple and has the clear and definite purpose to set up an authority with adequate powers to construct the largest public works undertaking ever conceived in this country and one that is pregnant with good for the whole community by making available large blocks of electric power for defence in the event of war, and for industrial activities in times of peace, and large quantities of controlled water for irrigation. This is a work that has been talked of for 70 years. This Government has firmly resolved that words shall be transferred to deeds. The Government faces this task of construction in the knowledge that it will encounter many problems. No doubt at times we shall meet with some disappointments and the work will have many critics. However, those critics in the main will be people who have little faith. This Government has faith in its engineers, its people and the future of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Snowy Mountains scheme was indeed a magnificent project which relied for its success on the work of many outstanding persons. One of the most remarkable was Sir William Hudson, the first Commissioner of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. The story of his getting the job is as typical of the more informal nature of the 1940s as it is of the manner of operation of the Chifley Government. The then Chairman of the Commonwealth Public Service Board, Mr W. E. Dunk, met Nelson Lemmon and gave him an envelope which had been handed to him at a cricket match. The note suggested that the man for the job was Bill Hudson. Some years later, Lemmon described his subsequent interview with Bill Hudson:</PARA>
<PARA>When Hudson walked into my office he was bent on one side and wore a rather crumpled coat. I said: `I don't think you look strong enough for the job.' He said: `I have a sleeping appendix'. I said: `You won't start the Snowy job until you get it out.' The more I talked with him the more impressed I became.</PARA>
<PARA> I took him to Chifley. Ben sat back sucking his pipe and said: `Well, Mr Hudson, tell me about yourself.' Hudson looked embarrassed and said: `I don't like talking about myself.' Ben (Chifley) said: `That's a pretty fair sort of an answer.' He already knew quite a lot. I told Hudson afterwards that the Prime Minister would back him in Cabinet. Hudson got his appendix out two days later. </PARA>
<PARA>He then got the job. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1953 it was estimated that the scheme would cost the equivalent of $800m. It is largely due to Sir William Hudson that it was completed within that limit of expenditure, something which causes me, as Chairman of this Parliament's Public Works Committee, both amazement and delight. The Snowy Mountains scheme relied for its success on many other wonderful persons who worked hard in difficult and dangerous conditions and who, despite this, for years afterwards were objects of derision by other Australians who had been here but a few decades more than they had. Many of these people now live in my electorate of Throsby. I refer, of course, to the many good people and excellent workers who migrated to Australia in the late 1940s and the 1950s. These unsung heroes, who comprised more than two-thirds of the total work force of the Snowy Mountains Authority, have done so much to make Australia the great place it is today. That is something that the conservatives sitting opposite might care to ponder as they seek to stop other people migrating to Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has happened in the intervening years since the scheme was completed. In 1970 the Authority was formed into a corporation specialising in consultancy work based on its vast experience and expertise built up over those years. The corporation was established under the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Act to preserve and capitalise on the professional engineering expertise developed during the construction of the Snowy Mountains scheme and to expand on the aid-related activities of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. A large number of skilled staff had been recruited overseas to construct the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme, but there was a desire to retain their skills in Australia. By creating a statutory authority, the Government hoped to retain these skills and thereby enhance foreign policy objectives, reduce the need to use foreign consultants and provide a means of opening overseas markets to Australian consultants, as well as to provide a source of export income. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to delivering a reasonable return on its capital, SMEC was also required to meet Government expectations in the areas I have just listed. There were a number of constraints on SMEC's activities that were designed to facilitate this. Both its clients and its field of work were limited by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Act 1970. Further, ministerial approval was required for any project which SMEC was to undertake. Nevertheless, it had no problem in delivering a return on its capital and, until 1983, returned a profit and delivered a dividend to the Government totalling $3.3m. Since 1970 SMEC has completed 1,350 projects in 50 countries with a capital value of $4,500m and has earned consulting fees of $294m. It has paid corporate taxes amounting to $11m, as well as $7m in State payroll and land taxes and $1.3m in local government taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation has worked in a wide range of countries and often in remote and inaccessible areas. To do this requires a very special kind of staff, who are committed to their profession and prepared to endure long periods without access to many of the amenities that most of us regard as necessities. The Corporation is fortunate to have such staff with wives and families who are prepared to support them in such difficult circumstances. The Corporation has proved itself as a winner of export awards and has assisted the development of the Australian engineering consulting industry through joint ventures. It has an excellent overseas track record. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation has placed increasing emphasis on working in association with other Australian consulting organisations where its partners can bring complementary skills or resources to specific projects in which it is interested. For instance, the Corporation has entered into an agreement with Pak-Poy and Kneebone Pty Ltd to work together on selected projects in Hong Kong, China and Macau. Such associations can add considerable strength to submissions made against international competition and so measurably increase the prospects of their being awarded to that Australian team. The Corporation also places great importance on strengthening its Australian market share to provide a firm base for its overseas endeavours. In 1989 they have participated in the very fast train project in south-east Australia and the major Tully hydropower project in Queensland. The Corporation is obviously entering a new and very exciting phase of its development. With its strengthened financial structure and the quality and competency of its staff, it is now well placed to continue to grow, prosper and provide a major contribution to Australia's international engineering consulting reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite its outstanding performance, in 1983 SMEC was faced with a downturn in the worldwide engineering consulting market and for the first time returned a loss. Consultants were called in to determine the cause of its problems and to propose solutions. They made an extremely gloomy assessment. The major cause of the downturn in SMEC's fortunes was identified as its inability to adjust quickly to the changing environment. The majority of the work was overseas on infrastructure projects. As a consequence, SMEC suffered greatly when there was a world wide pattern of reduced emphasis on infrastructure development. Reduced aid flows from the oil exporting countries and debt problems of many developing countries led to reductions in overseas development programs. This reduced emphasis led to greater competition amongst existing consulting firms, both Australian and overseas-based companies, resulting in smaller profits on new work for SMEC and a reduced rate of success in bidding. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the constraints on SMEC's development and the commercial practices that the organisation had developed, SMEC was ill-suited to meet market fluctuations. Changes were obviously needed in a number of areas. The Bill now before the House seeks to address these problem areas. In summary, this Bill provides for the conversion of SMEC into a public company under the Companies Act; maintains the corporate identity of SMEC so that all existing contracts, its taxation position and other assets and liabilities are unchanged upon conversion; provides for all staff to continue in employment on their present terms and conditions and preserves all their accrued entitlements; removes the day to day bureaucratic controls over the commercial decision making processes of the Corporation and replaces these with the structures of the requirements of the companies legislation and places SMEC on the same footing in this regard as any other public company. The head office of SMEC will remain based in Cooma and the new company will continue to contribute benefits to the Cooma area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Snowy Mountains scheme has been one of the great success stories of Australia. With the restructuring of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, I have every reason to believe that it will continue to be an ongoing success story, thanks in no small part to the vision and sound economic management of the Hawke Labor Government as it builds on the achievements of the Chifley Labor Government of some 40 years ago. I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), some people might become confused as to the exact nature of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Bill being discussed in the House. Certainly, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) owed its genesis to the magnificent Snowy Mountains scheme but, as the honourable member for Throsby ultimately admitted, it is now a totally separate organisation called SMEC. Theoretically and in law, it has nothing to do with the Snowy Mountains Authority (SMA) today. It has its headquarters in Cooma, but it has had separate enabling legislation since 1970 when the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Act came into being and set up SMEC to carry on its essentially engineering consultancy work both within Australia and overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that the honourable member for Throsby at one stage referred to the inability `to see the need for change'. He was not referring specifically to the Opposition, but I point out to the House at the outset that the Opposition feels very strongly indeed that there is a need to change even further the role, construction and operation of SMEC by providing for it to be privatised in an effective manner and by giving the first option to purchase to the Corporation's employees. We would then see SMEC take off in a constructive way and really perform in the interests of its shareholders and Australia. In that context I support fully the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), which lies on the table of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation, by its very nature, certainly impacts on the entirety of SMEC as it exists today. I am delighted that the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) and my electorate have benefited from some of the work carried out by these engineers. This legislation ranges right across the entity-the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. It is instructive to look at the eighteenth annual report of SMEC and see just how wide-ranging its activities are both in Australia and beyond. It has a number of sensible projects State by State in Australia. As we consider this legislation I highlight one in particular. It is an assignment officially listed for 1987-88 and refers to the work of SMEC in relation to the proposal for a very fast train (VFT) service between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation assisted with detailed investigations and pre-feasibility level alignment studies for the 800-kilometre section between Campbelltown, Goulburn, Canberra, Cooma and Bairnsdale and Dandenong in Victoria as one of the options associated with the very fast train concept. I am just sorry that in that round of studies at that time the Sydney, Goulburn, Northbourne Avenue interchange in the northern part of Canberra, south Yass, east Wagga, Henty, west Albury, Wanga- ratta, Benalla, Melbourne route was not considered. That was the so-called western or inland option. That western or inland option is shorter than the Gippsland option, is on more level terrain than the Gippsland option, involves no tunnelling with compromise to curves and grades for the VFT track and, finally, does not in any way impinge on any national parks. I know that you, Madam Deputy Speaker, will hold this dear to your heart when you view the very fast train, which might ultimately be extended from Sydney to Brisbane. But that is clearly further down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> As we consider the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Bill and the range of activities undertaken by SMEC, I have to praise the standard of its work carried out both in Australia, where it has competitively and successfully tendered against other engineering consultants, and overseas. In terms of overseas projects, it is instructive to see that some 23 countries were involved in assignments in 1987-88. Six of those countries are outside the Asian region in the broadest interpretation. They are Botswana, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Somalia, Egypt and Iran. I am delighted to see that the other 17 countries are closer to home and that the projects are of direct benefit in terms of Australia's aid program. This will ensure that some of our aid dollars will help create jobs not only in the countries we are helping but also in Australia. That is one matter people overlook when they come out with strong attacks of our foreign aid program. It is not a one way street. Australia gave $5m aid to a lignite project in Thailand just near Chiang Mai. Some $30m of export income for Australia was generated as a direct consequence of that original or seeding $5m aid grant. One should not be blinkered about the role of foreign aid. It does need to be tightened up. But that is not the main subject of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I highlight to the House that the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation is continuing to carry out work in countries such as Sri Lanka, India, Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Burma, China, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, Western Samoa, Fiji and Vanuatu. I have had the privilege, to some extent at my own expense, of looking at a number of those projects being carried out by SMEC officers either as mainstream consultants involved with the project or merely as consultants on a subcontracted basis. For example, there is the huge project in Nepal known as the Marsyangdi hydro-electric scheme, just to the west of Kathmandu. I remember the day well because the Royal Nepalese Army sent me a bill for half the helicopter cost associated with travelling from Kathmandu to Marsyangdi, where I met with the Australians working for SMEC on that project.</PARA>
<PARA> I highlight that project for two reasons. It was a battle for SMEC, which injected enormous costs and activity into trying to win through the competitive tendering process to become the major project manager and operator of that vital hydro-electric scheme in the developing country of Nepal. It is a sad truism that not necessarily the best or the cheapest tender will win in every circumstance, including in a country such as Nepal. SMEC must wage battles overseas that are many and varied to win this work essentially for Australian consultants. But when it is won, the performance and high standards that are brought forward are acknowledged by many. It is seen first hand by visiting so many of its projects. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of great regret that there are Australian citizens in Nepal suffering very severe hardship at the moment, as are Nepalese, because of India's decision to close almost all of the trading posts and land access to this tiny land-locked country between India and Tibet. Again, this is not mainstream to this debate before the House, but it is a matter of very real concern. It is a very sensitive matter to the two countries concerned, namely, India and Nepal; on the one hand, huge India, which has the fourth largest army in the world, and, on the other hand, tiny land-locked Nepal, which has a delicate and emerging economy. The Australian Government needs to monitor very closely developments in that dispute because SMEC officers are directly affected by what is going on in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> In indicating the depth of work carried out overseas by SMEC I also refer to some other isolated and difficult hardship posts in countries where SMEC operates, in particular Bhutan and Bangladesh. Again, there are some very dedicated officers working in tremendous hardship in very isolated areas. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution that they make in those circumstances, quite often far above and beyond the call of duty. This contribution is often overlooked by people here in Australia, with our civilised circumstances, our high standard of living and access to just about everything conceivable, particularly in terms of communications-television, radio and so forth. Night after night in countries such as Bhutan and Bangladesh there are SMEC officers with no access to telephone, radio-other than perhaps short wave radio-and television. One might say, `Oh that I should be so lucky as to have no access to television'. Bhutan does not have television, and I hope that it never gets television. Bhutan is a small kingdom which I had the privilege to visit early this year; in fact, I think I was the first Australian member to visit Bhutan. A great deal of sensible collective aid work is being carried out in Bhutan, again involving the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. It is sensible aid-not lavish aid-related to the needs of the Bhutanese which in no way undermines their culture; and, indeed, that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> In the consideration of this legislation I would argue very strongly that the Bill is a step in the right direction to further expand the role of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation in its work both in Australia and overseas. So far as overseas is concerned, I hope that SMEC continues to concentrate particularly on the Asian region. Equally, the aid program of the Australian Government, which is not unrelated to the whole equation, should continue to concentrate on the Asian region and the South West Pacific region as the areas of priority interest for Australia. I urge honourable members who have the opportunity to travel overseas on various study and fact-finding tours not to always go to Europe and North America but to make the effort to see what Australians are doing in countries such as Bhutan, Bangladesh and other more remote Asian countries, which do appreciate visits from Australian members and senators. Members and senators should get out of the capital cities to see the actual work being carried out on various aid projects and help build up relations between those countries and Australia and build up knowledge in relation to those countries and Australia. Of course, the need to build up those relations extends across political, economic and cultural cooperation and needs to be maximised as we look to the competitive 1990s and the realignment of trading blocs around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a period of great difficulty with the operation of SMEC. I think even the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) will concede that a few years back it went through some major problems and also lost out on some tendering which severely dented its workload at the time. There were also problems associated with the superannuation situation applying to SMEC and some quite savage surgery was required to ensure that SMEC survived at all. I believe that this Bill helps to provide a proper basis for the continuation of SMEC and its vital work from its Cooma headquarters. Equally, I believe that that basis would be further enhanced if the Government proceeded to sell the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, primarily to SMEC's own staff to give them the ultimate incentive and motivation of part-ownership in the very entity of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. Certainly, the ability to sell the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation is enhanced by the steps being taken in this Bill. I hope that one of the early acts of a coalition government will be to follow through and privatise the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation so that it can be a beacon of engineering consultancy activity in the future, particularly in the 1990s, both in Australia and in the neighbouring regions of Asia and the South West Pacific. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Previous speakers have mentioned some of the great achievements of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) as an organisation, along with the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) referred to the scheme that was formed by the vision of McKell, Chifley and Nelson Lemmon when experts were brought to Australia from all over the world. Many of them still live in the Cooma-Monaro and Snowy River shires and contribute to community activity as well as being part of a team which still exists. The decision to keep the team together in the form of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation was a wise one. We have seen the benefits even in this region because, close to Canberra, we see the Sutton interchange and other important works on the Federal Highway. We see an organisation which has a high reputation among those who have tried its work, particularly with respect to roads and other areas of construction. In fact, to me it seems to have fewer add-ons in a time when it is often the technique of consultants to add on to their original quotes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> SMEC has a high reputation for both its work and its honesty of presentation, and it has performed some great international work in the areas of hydro-electricity and bridge building. In fact, it has been involved in 1,350 projects in 50 countries, some of them in a flag-carrying role-a role that it has always had, particularly in developing countries where it has done work through the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) and other organisations. SMEC became the victim of people who turned up their nose at government involvement in business-people who claimed that they were being critical of inefficiency and bureaucracy. Inefficiency and bureaucracy predominated only when the Government held the organisation on a short leash, limiting its powers to gain business, limiting its ability to take on new opportunities and doing nothing to foster new marketing techniques. The previous Government even discouraged the participation of SMEC in overseas opportunities. I believe that, if the Hawke Government had not been elected in 1983 and had not remained in government since then, this speech would have been an obituary. However, under successive Ministers-former Minister Hurford, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West), who is at the table, and the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones)-the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation has developed from a responsible and competent team of consultants, engineers and associated staff into a competitive organisation which is prepared to broaden its scope, to ferret out opportunities, and to get out and sell. Frustrated staff have been given a chance to grasp the opportunities they had been told to leave alone and have been given power which was previously kept from them. </PARA>
<PARA> SMEC, which had once turned profits into losses, has once again turned back to a profit-making situation. It is leaner, more versatile, more adventurous and more successful. Still appreciated overseas, it has helped to build up Australia's goodwill and has been an ambassador for our country in nations which will be our customers in the future. SMEC is finding profitable opportunities overseas, and in Australia it is becoming recognised more and more as a reliable firm with some outstanding achievements in our own nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Bill further develops the opportunities for SMEC staff to be able to participate in ownership, with the Government holding most of the control of the organisation. The Bill allows for shares to be issued at a premium, which will be determined by the Minister. If a premium is determined, there will be a transfer from the share capital account to a share premium account to reflect that premium and the number of shares issued will be reduced accordingly. The purpose of this is to allow for the possible future introduction of a staff equity participation scheme. The share premium account will be necessary to enable the repurchase of shares from the staff as they leave the employment of SMEC. The possibility of such a scheme is currently being considered by this Government and will not be introduced without prior consultation and agreement of SMEC staff and unions. In talking to the staff and unions I have found that this opportunity is being welcomed by many of them. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal contrasts with the Opposition's policy to sell off SMEC, which was just described by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). Let there be no doubt that if the Liberal-National Party proposal to sell SMEC is accepted by Parliament-if SMEC is sold off-it will be dispersed. The great team that we have at Cooma will almost certainly be absorbed by the large enterprise which buys it and will be dispersed. This legislation confirms the need for SMEC to improve senior staff involvement in the firm and to have more freedom to operate. It removes a variety of statutory controls which inhibit SMEC's commercial operations. SMEC can investigate, advise on, design, supervise, maintain and operate engineering works both within Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable members for Throsby and Farrer have mentioned the very fast train proposal and SMEC's involvement in doing consultative work for that proposal. I say to the honourable member for Farrer that the Cooma route is definitely the choice because it is quicker, because it would not be competing in the same way with the State railways for freight-although it would be if it went on his suggested route, through Albury-and because it opens new tourist areas between Canberra, Cooma, Orbost and Melbourne. It would also take advantage of new passenger possibilities. I believe that the best route for the very fast train, and the best route for Australia, would be through Cooma and Orbost. I know that I have the support of a colleague of the honourable member for Farrer, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great advances for the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation was the vitality it received through actions taken by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West). I spent many hours talking to Doug Price, who was then the Executive Director, to Cooma community leaders, to David Dreverman, to Jack Boniface and to many other SMEC executives about its operations, and conveying my impressions to the Ministers. I was heavily involved with the Corporation because I knew its demise would take hundreds of people from Cooma. I thank Minister West in particular for the action he took in reforming the SMEC Board, which was certainly part of the impetus towards the present changes within SMEC. I believe that the possibility of staff equity gives hope to the Corporation and to the people of Cooma that the Corporation will remain in Cooma, substantially as it is now. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that the Government's actions have presented us with a viable organisation. This will mean that we are going to have a firm which is absolutely vital to Australia's economy as well as to the economy of the south-east region of New South Wales. It is a step in the Government's efforts to ensure the full commercial viability of SMEC, recognising its unique position as a Government owned consulting engineering firm and its leading involvement as an Australian company in engineering consultancy projects in our region. I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this legislation that will amend the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Act 1970 to convert the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation-SMEC-into a public company. I first qualify my support for the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Bill by saying that the Opposition believes that the Government could have gone further with this Bill and privatised the Corporation fully, and so provide the first option for purchase to the management and staff of the Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As other members have said, the Corporation was established under the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Act 1970 to preserve the professional engineering expertise developed during the construction of the Snowy Mountains scheme. Its functions now include investigating, advising on, designing, supervising, maintaining and operating engineering works both within Australia and overseas. Since 1970 SMEC has completed 1,350 projects in 50 countries, with a capital value of $4,500m, and has earned consulting fees of $294m. As indicated by the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) in his second reading speech, the real assets of the Corporation lie in human capital and its skills base, as a professional organisation marketing its skills in an international area. It has an outstanding international reputation for engineering excellence, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. SMEC was ranked sixty-second in a 1988 world survey of international engineering consulting firms. It is unique in this nation in its contribution to the export of engineering services, both as a winner of export awards and in assisting the development of the Australian engineering consulting industry through joint ventures and in gaining an overseas track record. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard from previous speakers of the involvement of SMEC in the very fast train venture and its involvement in overseas countries. I understand that SMEC is presently involved in over 20 countries, as diverse as those in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. SMEC's head office, as we know, is in Cooma and the new company will continue to contribute benefits to the Cooma region. I recently had an opportunity to visit the head office in Cooma with two of my colleagues, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), after a tour of the Snowy Mountains scheme. One could not help being impressed with the professionalism of this great Australian organisation and the dedication of its staff and management. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the nature of this place that we spend a large part of our time debating negatives and the problems with our society and the economy. So opportunities to talk about one of the positives of this great country, the Snowy Mountains scheme, are rare. I am sure that the majority of Australians today have no real appreciation of the nature and extent of the scheme. I would like to broaden this debate somewhat and talk about the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> This scheme is so valuable for the generation of power and the delivery of water for urban and rural use across Australia. Few engineering projects undertaken by man have matched the construction of the Snowy Mountains scheme for sheer size and audacity. It is without doubt Australia's greatest engineering achievement. Work on the major part of the scheme began in 1949 and continued until 1970. A total of $820m was invested in the Snowy Mountains scheme. It was built on time and within budget. About 100,000 men and women are estimated to have worked on that scheme during its 25 years of construction. More than 30 countries were represented in what was probably Australia's greatest ever multicultural work force. Many of those people who worked on the scheme in those days now reside in my electorate of Mallee, and many of them in farming enterprises. During the 25-year construction phase, more than 10 regional townships and over 100 camps were established, and over 1,600 kilometres of roads and tracks were completed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth reflecting on what this scheme may have cost today to build. We may even ask ourselves whether the activities of some of the minority groups in our community may stop the scheme and even whether there is a will within government today to at least commence construction of that scheme. The scheme took almost 25 years to complete. Its more obvious features are seven power stations, a pumping station and 15 large dams, excluding Blowering. Less obvious are the more than 80 kilometres of aqueducts and 145 kilometres of tunnels, some large enough to take a double-decker bus. The scheme's 15 major dams have a total storage capacity of approximately 7,000 gigalitres. The topography of the Snowy Mountains effectively creates two separate, but interconnected, systems; the Snowy-Murray development, which flows into the Murray River, and the Snowy- Tumut development, which flows inland to the Murrumbidgee. At the heart of the Snowy scheme is Lake Eucumbene, with a capacity nine times the volume of Sydney Harbour. This huge storage collects the waters of the Snowy, Eucumbene, Tumut and Murrumbidgee rivers. These waters, together with those from the Tooma and Geehi rivers, are diverted through trans-mountain tunnels for the generation of hydro-electric power. After release through the power stations, the water flows on to the Murray and Murrumbidgee river systems for irrigation purposes. The whole agricultural wealth of the Murray Valley, and the decentralisation that that brings to this region, are dependent on this scheme. Through regulation of waters in its long term storages, the scheme is designed to provide through a repeat of the then worst recorded drought, which started in 1936, some 85 per cent of the long term average annual flows. An average of 2,360 gigalitres of water is released annually to the two river systems from the storages of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The great advantage of hydro-electricity is its almost immediate availability. It takes just a few minutes from start-up for the scheme's power stations to begin contributions to the south-eastern Australian electricity grid. The scheme's seven power stations have a capacity of 3,740 megawatts. This represents 16.7 per cent of total installed capacity for south-eastern Australia. It is this quality of almost instant power which makes the provision of hydro-electricity so appropriate for morning and afternoon peak usage periods and for the daily response to emergencies on this interconnected system. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of the operation and maintenance of the scheme is met by the electricity authorities of New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. This includes repayment costs associated with the original Federal Government advances of $820m and other later loans raised to make additional capital improvements. It is interesting to note that no charges are made for water released for irrigation. This scheme is an important part of Australia's history and attracts a growing number of tourists each year. During the Australian bicentennial year four power stations and the Jindabyne pumping station were made available to the public for inspection. As well as providing an opportunity to underline the scheme's ongoing role in modern Australia, this move provided a boost for tourism in the Snowy Mountains area.</PARA>
<PARA> The success of the Snowy Mountains scheme, the Authority and its engineering arm should be the stimulus for further developments that will increase the security of water and power to the Australian nation. In conclusion, I wish the Corporation well under its new structure, believing that it will ensure that its high level of skill and professionalism will be enhanced and continue to bring benefits to the economy of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak to a particular aspect of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Bill, but first it needs to be understood that the Bill provides for the establishment of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation as a company by providing for the existing Corporation to be registered as a company incorporated under the Companies Act 1981. In essence, that is what the Bill is about. There are certain implications to be drawn from that. In reading the legislation before us, I am about to draw an implication which is in no way negatived by the specific provisions of the Bill. The implication is that because there is no specific role accorded to the Auditor-General, the new Corporation will no longer be the subject of any review by the Auditor-General in relation to its operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In speaking to this Bill I want to draw attention to the fact that this is the case, and to draw attention to the implications of that decision, particularly in the context of the recent report, report No. 296 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Chapter 8 of the report deals with the Audit Act and the Companies Acts and codes. It draws attention to the fact that, generally speaking, corporations which are owned by the Commonwealth are not subject to the provisions of the Audit Act but rather that for companies directly owned by the Government, where the shares are held by the Commonwealth with the Minister being the representative as a shareholder for voting purposes, the normal provisions of the companies legislation apply. That is, the Companies Code sets out requirements for the appointment of auditors and the form and content of reports to shareholders. The Audit Act generally lays down the matters upon which the Auditor-General is expected to audit where the Commonwealth has an interest. </PARA>
<PARA> In the report which I have drawn to your attention, Madam Deputy Speaker, there is a comparison between the requirements of the Audit Act and the companies legislation. While there are some elements in common, there are a number of matters with which an authority, such as the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, would now no longer have to comply. Madam Deputy Speaker, you look somewhat worried. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I am debating quite clearly the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Bill. I am explaining to the House why it is so important that honourable members be aware that this Bill contains no clause reserving a specific role to the Auditor-General and be aware of the implications of that decision for public accountability. That is what it is all about. It is very clearly the only occasion on which we are able to raise this question in relation to this Authority. The implications for the Parliament of the Auditor-General being excluded are stated in the Public Accounts Committee report, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(a) no requirement of the minister to table in Parliament the instrumentality's annual financial statements and the audit report on the financial statement;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) if government enterprises are incorporated as exempt proprietary companies there may not be any public disclosure of financial information;</PARA>
<PARA>Undoubtedly in this case it would not be an exempt proprietary company-at least on my reading of the Bill. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA>(c) elimination of any vehicle for the auditor to report to Parliament except where the Auditor-General has dual appointment;</PARA>
<PARA>We have no indication in this case that he will have such an appointment. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>(d) Parliament will no longer receive reports on waste, misappropriation, lax management or inefficiency within government enterprises as a matter of course. Even ministers may not receive such information;</PARA>
<PARA>(e) Parliament will be less likely to receive reports on whether Commonwealth bodies have broken their own legislation or other laws;</PARA>
<PARA>If honourable members went on to read the report of the Public Accounts Committee they would see that two more implications are mentioned. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>(f) the Auditor-General bids for a financial statement audit of a government company knowing that he must formally request on the accounts and records audit as well. This extra reporting requirement is not borne by the private sector competitors. Therefore, the Auditor-General bids knowing that his private sector competitors have an instant commercial advantage. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The point here is that if the Auditor-General said, `I'll go into the marketplace and bid against other private sector public auditors' he still would have to audit in accordance with his own Act and, therefore, his costs would be considerably higher than those of any private sector competitors. The final implication in the report is:</PARA>
<PARA>(g) government companies which can recommend on selection of their own auditor are unlikely to appoint the Auditor-General if he tendered. The reason is that the Auditor-General is bound by section 63p to report to the minister and to Parliament on a company's financial statements and accounts and records. As pointed out earlier, no similar requirements exists in the Companies Code. In other words, even if the Auditor-General's tender were the lowest for an audit contract with a government company, it would be unlikely that he would be awarded the contract. In this situation, both efficiency and accountability to Parliament are compromised. </PARA>
<PARA>These are important questions that need to be understood in the context of the legislation before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make one other point which was emphasised by the Public Accounts Committee in relation to this question of government corporations not having to use the Auditor-General. It became very clear during the Public Accounts Committee inquiries that some statutory authorities and some public government-owned companies were seeking to have the Auditor-General excluded so that they could obtain the advice of private sector auditors in relation to a range of other activities on which the Auditor-General ordinarily does not advise. While some of those matters were quite innocent-they could be matters such as the employment of staff, or consulting in relation to management experience-in other cases they could be matters involving taxation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Auditor-General discovered that a government-owned company was looking to arrange its affairs, presumably in the most efficient way for the operation of the Corporation itself, it could be a case of its taking advantage of arrangements which were perfectly legal but which in the eyes of the public were considered to be suspect. In other words, an organisation like the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation could seek to have a subsidiary, or some of its operations, put through some tax haven overseas, with a consequential maximising of profits. However, as we have seen from comment recently in the press, such arrangements are considered to be most suspect in the eyes of the Australian population. The fact is that one of the consequences of the adoption of tax-driven financial strategies by government agencies can lead to legitimate tax minimisation, but in the eyes of the public these strategies are clearly unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> One would expect that the Auditor-General would bring this matter to the attention of the shareholders, the Minister and the Parliament, but, under the corporations legislation, one would have no certainty that a private sector auditor would feel under some particular obligation in the way in which he presents his accounts to bring attention to the accounts being operated in that way. So there is some significance in the fact that this is the first occasion on which the Parliament has considered the establishment of a public company where the role of the Auditor-General has been excluded. I know that previously there have been other cases where the role of the Auditor-General has been excluded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Minister wants to clarify that I will welcome his comments, because certainly on my reading of the Bill there is no provision that indicates that the role of the Auditor-General is retained. Unless it says so positively, that role is governed by the operation of the corporations legislation, the Companies Code. The fact is that at the moment there are some precedents, such as Australian Airlines and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. The Public Accounts Committee was critical of that. The point is that this is the first new case where this is occurring since the Public Accounts Committee presented its Report No. 296. It may be a matter that the Government is prepared to act on at this time, but I simply draw attention to the fact that in relation to this legislation that is the consequence. The comments that I have read are clearly the views of the Public Accounts Committee in relation to its expectations, where the Commonwealth still retains an interest and where the Commonwealth's interest can be quite different from the interests of public shareholders simply owning shares in a registered public company.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Bill which began on 5 April and was then resumed on 13 April. I want to make a few broad observations about this matter. The honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) led the debate on behalf of the Opposition. I think it is fair to day that he had a somewhat shaky idea of what the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) was about because he kept confusing SMEC with the Snowy Mountains Authority. If one reads the Hansard report-and I commend it to all honourable members-one notes that at page 1668 the honourable member uses the term `Snowy Mountains Authority'. I must make it clear that the Snowy Mountains Authority is a completely different body from the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. At this point we are dealing only with the functions of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have observed the Opposition's privatisation policy, which was officially released last week, and SMEC was identified as a candidate for management buy-out in that policy. We believe that SMEC has traded itself out of difficulty. We think it is doing very well. It made a profit of $511,000 for the 1987-88 financial year, a profit is forecast for 1988-89, and a return to dividend payments to the Commonwealth is anticipated. I pay tribute to the Board for turning around the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members know, the Government is to introduce a staff equity scheme to SMEC. The proportion of shares released will be low and will be in the limiting form of redeemable preference shares. The Bill deems SMEC to be a public company. It sets in place the legal framework to implement the Government's reform package for SMEC, as announced last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dundas raised the issue of whether SMEC's accounts would still be subject to audit by the Auditor-General. The honourable member asked who would be responsible for auditing SMEC's accounts if they were not subject to the Auditor-General's audit. When I interpolated by way of interjection I was quite wrong in saying that there was a specific provision in the Bill. The honourable member was perfectly correct in saying that it was not dealt with specifically. I will explain the situation. The normal Companies Code applies; however, on conversion to a public company SMEC has the right to recommend to the Minister-in this case, me-an auditor of its choice, but the appointment of the auditor will be at the discretion of the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may make a recommendation, but that has to be taken into account, and I can assure the honourable member that I have no prejudice against the role of the Auditor-General. However, one qualification needs to be made. A very high proportion of SMEC's work is undertaken overseas; probably the bulk of its work is carried out overseas. The result is that the advice that it needs is not just audit advice but economic and tax advice as well. That is critical to SMEC's operations overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>

So, the only assurance I can give the honourable member is that the decision about the appointment of an auditor will be in the hands of the Minister, not in the hands of the Board. The Board can make a recommendation, but it is for the Minister, and for successive Ministers, to make a determination on that. I do not know that I can really take the matter much further, other than simply to give the honourable member the assurance that I will be looking at the matter quite independently and that I will not just be automatically accepting a recommendation made by the Board. On that basis, I commend the Bill to the House.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the amendments be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>I should make a brief explanation. There are two amendments, one of which was moved by the Government in the Senate. It relates to proposed section 29. The amendment seeks to delete proposed section 29. On the basis of the result of that deletion, the law will be implemented as Commonwealth legislation alone. Proposed section 29 as it stood before deletion would have enabled the States and the Northern Territory to enact mirror legislation. There has been criticism of that from those who are interested in international arbitration on the ground that if it had to be done on that basis there would be no parties coming here from overseas for international arbitration because they would not know which piece of legislation they had to deal with in the respective States. I explained that matter at the last meeting of the Attorneys-General in March. They accepted that situation; in other words, overseas parties considering arbitration would be deterred by having to investigate the State laws. Whilst it may appear straightforward to Australians, overseas parties can understand neither the concept nor its practical effects. The deletion of proposed section 29 will ensure that a single Australian law will govern all international commercial arbitrations conducted in Australia unless the parties themselves choose otherwise. The representation made by Sir Laurence Street, who was very interested in this matter, was that, if we were to leave it as it was, it would kill international arbitration in Australia stone dead. They were his words. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendment is one which was made in the Senate and which the Government accepts. It is a proposal to insert a new section after proposed section 28. It allows the parties to be represented by any person of their choice, including a legal practitioner not admitted in an Australian jurisdiction. Again, this has been the subject of representation by many Australian interests, including the Business Council of Australia, the Confederation of Australian Industry and Sir Laurence Street, who have said that foreign parties want and expect to use their own lawyers. At the time there was some consideration about it. I think it is consistent with the concept of saying that if we are going to invite international disputants to come to Australia they ought to be entitled to have confidence in their own representation. We would hope that, by allowing foreign lawyers to appear in arbitrations conducted under legislation, there would be reciprocal benefits given to Australian lawyers to participate also in arbitration proceedings elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the position at the moment is that both these amendments add strength to the concept of what we are about here, namely, that we are anxious to encourage more arbitration in Australia. We are well qualified to do it, and we have excellent legal personnel and other trained arbiters who can conduct this type of proceeding. We are well catered for, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney, and other centres are likely to be established. It brings an additional aspect to Australia's trade and commerce integrity because it gives the parties which have agreements which require disputants to go to arbitration the opportunity to say, `That facility is also in Australia'. I commend the amendments accordingly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports both of these amendments which have been carried in the Senate and which the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has just told us the Government also supports. There is no real contest between us on these matters. The amendments are twofold. Taking them briefly in the order in which the Attorney-General has taken them, the first relates to the question of State or Territory laws which might touch on international arbitration. The Committee will recall that, when this Bill was before the House of Representatives on 22 November last year, in my remarks I drew attention to a particular clause of the Bill which is now to be removed, that is, clause 29. That clause says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This Part-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, this part of the Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>is not intended to exclude, or limit, the concurrent operation of any law of a State or Territory that, except for unavoidable variations, is in the same terms as the provisions of this Part. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the clause under discussion, clause 29, sought to involve the operation of both State and Territory laws on arbitration as well as the Commonwealth law which we were then passing. </PARA>
<PARA> In my remarks I pointed out that this was a potential problem if the objective was-as, indeed, it was and is-to encourage more international arbitration work to come into Australia. I put the view there that the reason for this problem was that if international entrepreneurs were considering submitting to Australia as the place where their arbitration would take place they may well be deterred by the uncertainty as to what any other State or Territory law on arbitration provided. Not only might they be deterred by that prospect, but they would have no certainty or clarity as to whether any of those State or Territory laws might be amended either after they had submitted to arbitration or perhaps even in the course of the arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, putting all of that together, it was fairly clear that there was some potential for uncertainty and doubt and a possibility that the result of that doubt might be that we would be discouraging international arbitration matters from being submitted to the Australian jurisdiction. If that were the case, it would be very unfortunate because the whole objective of this Bill to implement the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law-UNCITRAL-model law on international arbitration is to attract more arbitration work and the revenue that goes with it to Australia. The Government has accepted the suggestion which I made on that occasion, the suggestion which has been made by Sir Laurence Street, the former Chief Justice of New South Wales, and the suggestion which has been made by other people, the suggestion being that that clause be removed from the Bill. The Government has accepted that amendment made in the Senate. We in the Opposition support that amendment to the Bill. The removal of clause 29 may well contribute to the common objective that we all have, namely, to attract more international arbitration work to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning briefly to the second amendment-the first on the sheet, but the second referred to by the Attorney-General-this will in effect allow foreign lawyers to appear in international arbitration matters conducted within Australia. There has been a concern-again, pointed out by Sir Laurence Street and followed up by Senator Durack and Senator Hill and, indeed, the Australian Democrats in the Senate-that international entrepreneurs who are submitting their dispute to the Australian jurisdiction may well want to bring their own advocates with them, and that if they are not able to do that, once again they may be deterred from submitting to the Australian jurisdiction, the result being an unfortunate one-namely, that we would be discouraging the lucrative international arbitration work that we want to attract to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the suggestion has been made that foreign lawyers-if I could put it that way-or at least legal practitioners admitted outside the Australian jurisdiction, should be allowed to appear in the arbitration proceedings. The suggestion has been made, and it has been embodied in the amendment, that the parties may appear for themselves or they may be represented by another person of the party's choice who may not even be a lawyer. This is what we might call a deregulatory step forward. Often when we talk around this place about deregulation, especially if one is a lawyer, people come back to us and say, `How about a bit of deregulation and flexibility and micro-economic reform or whatever it is called so far as the legal system is concerned?'. For my part I certainly support it. </PARA>
<PARA> I venture to say that the outcome will be that the parties will still be represented by lawyers and not by advocates because, contrary to popular belief, lawyers in these matters are much briefer in their submissions. They take a much shorter time to make their submissions. They are usually much clearer and more concise. If I needed any further evidence of this, I need simply say that the Attorney-General's speech and my own speech are only occupying a little over five minutes in this matter whereas, perhaps not in this House but in other places, non-lawyers would be taking much longer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will see from the honourable member who is about to follow me how long he takes. I venture to say that the parties will end up using legal representatives, whether they be foreign or local. The fact is that, whether they do that or not, there is no obstacle in their way to bringing their own representatives with them when they come to Australia to have their arbitration resolved within the Australian jurisdiction. They can use the locals if they want. I suspect that some of them will use the overseas advocates but will have Australian advocates to advise them in running as to what they should do and how they should conduct themselves. Whether that is so or not really does not matter. The simple point is that this other objection has been removed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We compliment the Government on accepting the amendment that was made in the Senate. We believe that with respect to both of these amendments we are removing potential obstacles to attracting arbitration work of an international nature to Australia. We complimented the Government on introducing this Bill and we compliment it again. We believe that on the rare occasions when the Government deserves credit it should be given it. We certainly give it that credit on this occasion. Now, that the Bill can become an Act, we hope that we will see the result that we all hope for-that is, that there will be a great upsurge in international arbitration work conducted in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the second reading speech on the International Arbitration Amendment Bill we referred to the reputations of Australian arbitrators and the fact that they had earned the respect of both their colleague arbitrators internationally and some international litigants. It was therefore natural for us to support the Government. As the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) has just said, we did so on that occasion with the Bill as it was originally drafted and continued to support it in the introduction of these amendments. I want to address my remarks to amendment No. 1, as circulated. As I pointed out in the second reading debate, there is a considerable market for international arbitrations. Given our background and the reputation to which I have alluded, there is a great opportunity for those practising in that area not only to improve their own opportunities but also to earn a great deal of foreign exchange. That could reasonably be foreseen to happen. Many international arbitrations now are trotted off to London whereas it seems reasonable and sensible to expect that many of those from our region could be and will be referred to the arbitration process in Australia. The Bill itself facilitates Australia playing a leading role in these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment to which I specifically refer seeks to make it clear that lawyers from other jurisdictions may practise and appear before arbitrators in the terms set out in the other provisions of the Bill. It further provides that the parties may represent themselves. It also provides for non-lawyers to be appointed by one of the parties to be an advocate, provided his right to appear before the arbitrators is established once again in accordance with the other provisions of the Bill as it now stands. Just touching on lawyers from other jurisdictions, that means that lawyers practising in another country, or in another State or Territory of Australia, will be able, with the passage of these amendments and the Bill, to appear in an arbitration in a particular State which is not their own, and obviously, if it is in Australia and they are from overseas, in another country. The practitioners from other States are bound by either their legal practitioners' Acts or some variation of them. From going round the States and from the debate in the Senate, it seems that it is not at all clear whether lawyers from other State or Territories in Australia would have been permitted to appear on behalf of one of the parties in an arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack in the Senate brought attention to the paper of Sir Laurence Street, to which the honourable member for Menzies has alluded. That august gentleman recommended an amendment along the lines which are now before us and under discussion. It is curious that the model laws were silent on such matters. That is understandable because I guess those people under the auspices of the United Nations who prepared the model words would not necessarily be familiar with the federal system of Government as it applies in Australia, although one would have thought that federal forms of government were not all that rare around the world and that they may have foreseen that. However, it is strange indeed that they did not make provision for international lawyers to appear in arbitrations in a country not their own. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate, who was handling the measure in the Senate, was not apparently even briefed on Sir Laurence's suggestions or recommendations. At one stage in the debate he suggested that we resort to going back to the State Attorneys-General to get their approval, they having been involved in discussions leading up to the preparation of the Bill in the first place. I do not think, given the time that it has taken, that that was a reasonable alternative. Certainly Senators Hill, Durack, Watson and others pointed that out quite clearly to Senator Tate. It is no credit to Senator Tate or to the Government that they were in a position where they had to contemplate going back to the State and Territory Attorneys-General. </PARA>
<PARA> As for an individual representing himself or herself in arbitration, it seems to me that it is ordinary good sense to include this proposal, although I share the view of the honourable member for Menzies that that will rarely happen. As a practising arbitrator in commercial disputes I know that it was always the lament of the parties that they had to resort to lawyers and legal representation. This view was more than once expressed to me as the person conducting those arbitrations. The truth is that State arbitrations-in fact, all arbitrations including those under this Bill when it becomes an Act-are subject to Acts of Parliament and those which determined the hearings that I conducted were governed by the law of Western Australia. The reason is not-as the honourable member for Menzies says-that lawyers can be briefer or more concise. I assure him that that is not always the case and he knows it very well. I must say, nevertheless, that quite often it was true that a lawyer could get to the core of the matter to facilitate the conduct of a hearing and arrive at a conclusion much quicker than would otherwise be possible. Anyone who represents themselves in those circumstances might, as the old cliche goes, end up having a fool for a client, but that is no reason for legislating to prevent them making fools of themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment is a sensible one. I am a little surprised that it was not picked up in this chamber and that Sir Laurence Street's remarks were not brought to our attention as many other comments were. I suppose they may well have been but we did not understand the import of them. I repeat that I have no trouble in supporting the amendment. I commend the Bill and its intentions and wish it a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not oppose the Bounty (Ships) Bill, but during the committee stage it wishes to put forward an amendment which I will discuss later. Shipbuilding may not be Australia's most fundamental industry, but it is an important industry in this country and I think it is regrettable that it is as small as it is. The 1984-85 financial year figures-the most recent available on the industry-show that the value-added figures for that year totalled $350m and that the industry employed 14,500 people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sadly, since the very well known shipyard at Whyalla in my own State closed some years ago, it has been true that the Australian shipbuilding industry has been unable to build the large trading vessels it once built. Nevertheless, as an industry it is still able to build steel-hulled vessels of up to 10,000 gross construction tonnes, which are vessels of at least some substance. It is also interesting to note when one examines the operation of the industry that it still requires some rationalisation and substantial improvement. When I say rationalisation, I am not saying that I want shipyards to close left, right and centre around Australia; I am saying that the industry needs to improve its level of efficiency. However, it must also be said that there are some very efficient shipbuilders in our country of which we are very proud. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) report of 1988 on ships, boats and other vessels made the point that large steel-based shipyards still retain `many of the work structures and practices of traditional large unionised British yards'. Naturally, that is a concern for honourable members on this side of the House because it reflects on the relative efficiency and therefore the longer term potential of this important industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bounty (Ships) Bill implements a successor to the current bounty scheme for constructional modification of vessels over 150 gross construction tonnes. The new scheme begins on 1 July 1989 and will phase out bounty over six years, so that by 1 July 1995 the industry will operate without bounty assistance at all. In the interim, the scheme will cost $145m over the six-year period, with an initial outlay in 1989-90 of $24m rising to $33m in 1990-91 and declining thereafter. Bounty has been paid to the industry for about 40 years and the current scheme has operated since 1980. Bounty is currently paid at rates of either 15 per cent or 20 per cent, depending on the type of vessel. It is paid for both domestic and export production. To be eligible for bounty, shipbuilders must meet registration criteria as well as what are described as `orderly development' provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The annual cost of the current scheme is about $40m and currently there are about 20 registered shipbuilders compared with more than 30 in 1985. From 1984 to April 1989, 45 shipbuilders received registration and interestingly enough, only 13 firms maintained continual registration during this period. As I have mentioned already, last year the Industries Assistance Commission concluded a report on ships, boats and other vessels. In preparing its report it obviously reviewed the industry with a view to replacing the current bounty scheme which was due to expire. The IAC put forward a large number of recommendations. Included in those recommendations were: the removal of import restrictions; the phasing down of tariffs on boats to 15 per cent by 1992; the continuation of bounty assistance for ship construction and modification for domestic sale; the phasing down from 19 per cent to 15 per cent by 1992 bounty for prescribed vessels and continuing at 15 per cent for other than prescribed vessels, provided the orderly development provisions were terminated, bounty registration criteria were restricted to those necessary for efficient bounty administration and funds for bounty payment were not limited. Those recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission reflected a lot of concern about the operation of the then existing bounty scheme. There were a number of other recommendations by the IAC, such as the continuation of the bounty until 1993, the phasing out of bounty for export sales from 15 per cent and 10 per cent on implementation to zero by July 1991 and the payment of bounty only on completion of vessels. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industries Assistance Commission's objective was to make assistance to the industry as uniform as possible. Therefore, it opposed what is sometimes described as selective criteria. That is a sentiment which we on this side of the House very strongly endorse. It said that if those conditions were not met it would recommend a reversion to uniform tariff assistance rather than the bounty scheme, which was quite an interesting recommendation. In coming forward with this legislation, the Government has not fully accepted all the IAC recommendations. The major difference is that the Government proposes to phase out bounty for all eligible construction and modification, whether for the domestic or export markets, over a six-year period. The Government has agreed to remove import restrictions, the orderly development provisions and the overall cap on available funds. But registration criteria have, if anything, become more restrictive. Advances will continue to be made for work in progress. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that we would put forward an amendment later. I will not use the time of the House now to discuss that at great length, but I allude to it in the context of a very important part of this legislation, clause 17, which deals with registration criteria. The registration criteria included in this legislation replace the prescribed system by regulation in the previous legislation. There are three new or modified registration criteria in this legislation. It is worth reiterating what these are so that when we come to the committee stage and discuss the Opposition's amendment we will have a clear view-I refer particularly to those who are interested in this debate-about the details of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of these criteria is that at least 75 per cent of the activities of the applicants for the bounties will be devoted to the construction or modification of vessels which are bountiable. That is one of the provisions with which we have some concern. The second is that the applicant must at all times employ at least 40 persons in ship modifications or construction. That compares with the existing 20-person minimum requirement under the existing regulation. The third of the criteria is that applicants will have to submit a business plan. Currently, that is not necessary. Existing requirements that builders must be financially sound, have access to waterfront premises-I suppose that is fairly logical if one intends to build ships-and employ one apprentice for every eight tradespersons will continue to operate. The Opposition has no problem with that. If registration is rejected or withdrawn, applicants will be able to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Of course, we are happy with that. I also point out that registration is to last for a period of one year. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed phasing-out of the bounty over six years is an acceptable compromise as far as the Opposition is concerned between those people who called for the removal of assistance altogether and those who wanted the continuation of the bounty at its current rates. Most importantly, though, there is a clear termination date so that everybody in the industry will know precisely where they stand once this legislation has passed through the House, particularly if our amendment is accepted. However, the Government has introduced more restrictive eligibility criteria which arguably offset the advantages of removing the orderly development provision. We are told that these requirements are necessary to ensure that only those shipbuilders with a long term commitment to the industry receive bounty. However, some requirements are, frankly, quite arbitrary. For example-and I have mentioned this already-the requirement that 75 per cent of activities must be devoted to bountiable construction and modification is not only entirely arbitrary but could easily be met by rearranging business structures. A company could set up yet another company simply for the purposes of constructing a ship, and that would very easily meet these requirements, regardless of what the company did during the rest of its operations. So the fact that this provision can be circumvented relatively easily undermines that part of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the Industries Assistance Commission is strongly opposed to these directive criteria. I have mentioned already that it recommended reversion to tariff assistance if the more restrictive requirements were not removed. The Government has discontinued its orderly development requirement, and the Opposition certainly supports that move. But it has strengthened the registration criteria and, as I have mentioned, it has done that by introducing the 75 per cent requirement. The Opposition would not go as far as the Industries Assistance Commission suggests. Instead, during the committee stage, we will move to delete the 75 per cent requirement and make it clear that it is our intention to monitor the effect of the other requirements in this legislation. Let me make it clear that, whilst we would be very optimistic that the Government would recognise the cold, hard logic of our position-and there are few precedents for that over the last six years-the good news is that the Opposition is not, after all, going to oppose the legislation. The general principles are good and the Opposition is basically happy with the Bill's thrust. </PARA>
<PARA> Our objective in moving our amendment for the deletion of the 75 per cent requirement is to ensure that the criteria, which are aimed at reducing industry fragmentation, do not result in a net cost by discouraging potentially efficient producers. Of course, as the rate of bounty phases down, the possible costs and benefits of the registration criteria will diminish. Indeed, once it gets to about 10 per cent, I doubt very much whether the 75 per cent requirement will even be relevant. Only exclusive shipbuilders will be interested at that stage. It is clear that the Government expects the shipbuilding industry to stand on its own feet in six years time. That is the basic philosophy of this legislation, which phases out after six years. The Opposition certainly has no quarrel with that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make a few more points on this theme. To ensure continued growth in the industry with lower assistance, the Opposition believes that the Government must act to improve the general business climate within which that industry has to operate. Prime interest rates at the moment are approaching 19 per cent. That obviously makes it very difficult for shipbuilders to invest in a way they might otherwise do. If the Government did not concentrate its economic strategy almost entirely on forcing up interest rates, it would be easier for shipbuilders to compete for business and to build ships at more competitive rates. The inflation rate at the moment is around 7 1/2 per cent. That is a very high rate of inflation by international standards. Again, that militates against the longer term success of the industry. I also point out that wages growth is running at about 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The absolute level of wages is not the real issue; the real issue is productivity. The nominal unit labour cost performance is the determinant of our international competitiveness. The worrying thing here is that overall our nominal unit labour cost performance is the worst in the industrialised world, that is, amongst Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. That is of enormous concern to members on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that to get out of our current balance of payments crisis, which everyone in this Parliament recognises to be the most fundamental objective of economic policy nowadays, and in turn to wind back our extraordinary level of foreign debt, will not be an easy task. There are no quick fix solutions. There are long term solutions which include, above all, increasing the productivity rate of our overall work force. A lot of factors are involved in improving productivity, including that of the shipbuilding industry. Our objective is not to slash people's wages but to increase wages and make sure that those increases flow from successful enterprises, rather than being forced on enterprises in a manner which at times can lead to their failure. If these basic conditions continue, industry, including the shipbuilding industry, in Australia simply will not be prepared to invest for the long term and will not be able to export. Anybody who is objective about the economic climate in Australia cannot conceivably argue with that proposition. The Australian Labor Party might argue with it for party political purposes. It may want to argue that over the last six years it has done a great deal and that it was just bad luck that our level of productivity happened to decline rather than rise in that period, but I think honourable members opposite know in their hearts that the Opposition is right when it talks about the need to do these things. </PARA>
<PARA> It is sad that, throughout Australian history, the Labor Party, when in government, has never been able to achieve substantial improvements in productivity. The Labor Party is the political extension of the trade union movement. It is proud of that. That is a legitimate purpose. It should be understood that that is what the Labor Party is. It should not be hidden. It should be understood that that is all the Labor Party is. Consequently, it is institutionally difficult for the Labor Party ever to address these fundamental issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Already we have seen the cost to Australia of the Government's strategy and its failure to address these sorts of issues because it is locked into this difficult relationship with the trade union movement. Real exports in the year to the December quarter 1988 actually fell by one per cent. This is at a time when we have a major balance of payments crisis in Australia. In the same period imports increased by more than 20 per cent. I can understand the Government talking about making Australian industry more import competitive and about the need to get Australian industry to export more effectively, but the fact is that after six years the figures I have just mentioned to the House show that the Government is not succeeding in its strategy because it has been sitting on its hands throughout that period. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australian industry is expected to become more competitive and to stand on its own feet, the Government must not prevent it from doing so. All government policies must be aimed at making industry more competitive-not less competitive. That is not the record of this Government over the last six years. I will come back to the amendment that we, on this side of the House, would like to move in the committee stage a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I come back to where I began. We recognise this legislation as useful legislation. It is important to make the point that it is quite strongly supported by the industry. It is certainly supported by the Opposition. Should the Government agree to our amendment, we hope that this legislation will have a speedy passage through the House and the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was extremely pleased that the Opposition saw fit to indicate its broad support for the Bounty (Ships) Bill. It is a sensible proposal and one which deserves that support. Regrettably, once the capacity of the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), to comment on the content of the Bill was exhausted, he slid into the general tirade about the Australian Labor Party being bad and the Liberal Party of Australia being good. This form of debate really is not illuminating or helpful. I want to speak only briefly on this measure. I do so for two reasons. First, I draw attention to one enterprise in my electorate which has benefited from the ships bounty legislation in the past and which will continue to do so in the future. Secondly, I make some observations about industry policy and a framework of encouraging economic growth which ought to apply in my State of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the first point. One of the great success stories of Australian enterprise has been the success of International Catamarans-a shipbuilding firm headed by Bob Clifford and headquartered in Hobart. Recently the firm relocated to Glenorchy. It is at the centre of a major and innovative program of building large catamarans. These metal-hulled aluminium catamarans have been sold both domestically-they can be seen working the Great Barrier Reef, taking tourists out to offshore reefs-and internationally. The firm has developed a reputation and capacity for supplying quality ships of some considerable size. This really is a credit to the Government and its capacity to direct assistance to areas of industry, which then, in turn, lift Australia's traded goods sector and also give our domestic economy a kick along. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob Clifford's International Catamarans has also recently been at the forefront of a proposal to build a super-large catamaran to ply Bass Strait. This proposal is extremely exciting because it represents an opportunity to have a sea link from Melbourne to the north of the State which will enable passengers and vehicles to be transported from the mainland to Tasmania in a relatively short period and at a significant cost saving compared with the airlines. Of course, no airliner could ever transport a vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal is now bedded down. Finance has been made available and the proposal is going ahead. The vessel is under plan and will soon be a reality. This is an exciting proposal. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has already visited the site of International Catamarans. I am sure he was extremely impressed by the efficiency and the skill displayed in the firm's achievements to date. Just on a parochial basis, a local boy such as I has much to be pleased with in terms of the way in which the bounty arrangements apply to assist the shipbuilding industry in Australia. Of course, this is not the only legislation that has touched on assistance to shippers. Recently we had amendments to the Trade Practices Act which should ensure a better and more efficient international shipping sector and, in turn, give a boost to the possibility of redeveloping a shipbuilding industry which could take up some of the capacity for servicing our internationally traded goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals have already been explained to the Parliament, but the substance of them is that vessels weighing between 150 and 10,000 gross construction tonnes will be eligible for bounty, provided firms meet proper registration requirements. The object, of course, is to encourage efficiency and the kinds of firms that can spearhead Australia's efficiency drive in an international market scene. The framework of the Government's response is consistent with the way in which it has sponsored industrial initiatives across many sectors of industry and with what, it would have to be said, is a very hard-headed approach to the way in which it allocates very scarce resources for assistance in meeting the needs of Australian exporters and manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> The relative success of Australia in this area can be well contrasted with the performance of the State Liberal Government in Tasmania. Tasmania is at a crossroads. Whereas the rest of Australia has seen a growth and expansion and there is concern that the economy is overheating, in Tasmania it has barely begun to warm up. In fact, Tasmania's unemployment rate stands at 9.7 per cent, which is 3.1 per cent above the national average; and 20 per cent of our young people cannot find work. Employment continues to fall in contrast to the national trend. In 1988, Tasmania had the lowest growth in building approvals of all States. In 1988, motor vehicle registrations in Tasmania grew by only 3.9 per cent compared with a national rise of 15.9 per cent. Tasmania's population grew by only 470 people or 0.1 per cent, compared with a national increase of 1.7 per cent. The State experienced a net loss of 3,343 people in 1987-88. In the year to September 1988, Tasmania received only 2.18 per cent of national private investment. Clearly, Tasmania is going nowhere with the present Liberal Party Administration. That is to be contrasted--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will return to the thrust of this legislation, which is to sponsor responsible industrial initiatives which should give rise to long term growth-not in artificial jobs but in industry areas which have the prospect of lasting past the time of the subsidy. Of course, that is the important element of this scheme. The bounty scheme is being phased out over a number of years so that it will terminate in 1995 and leave behind a healthy sector of shipbuilders which is able to compete effectively in both the domestic market and the international market. Of course, that is a crucial question and it is appropriate when we are asked by the honourable member for Mayo to draw conclusions about the performance of this Government-as he did in his speech-to contrast it with the performance of other governments within the federal system. In this case the Tasmanian Gray Liberal Government has failed to establish any framework for the assistance of industry in Tasmania. Plainly, the Tasmanian Government has no policy in this area, and plainly it is seeking to avoid the condemnation of the Tasmanian people by transferring blame for the parlous economic situation that Tasmania faces from the Government's own irresponsible policies to whomever it can find to blame.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker. I had imagined that ships are a matter which, by extension, come within this debate. I accept your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I will conclude my remarks by referring to the need to ensure that assistance in this area in properly targeted. The Government has succeeded in this area by making sure that assistance is no longer provided to those small sectors of the industry which previously used the bounty scheme to pad out their employment by way of supplementing and assisting their profit share without making any significant contribution to a viable and productive export sector. The Government has made sure that this is no longer possible by a number of measures in determining who may register for assistance and, in particular, by ensuring that assistance goes to only those firms of sufficient size to produce goods that are internationally tradable. I think the number of employees who are needed before a business becomes eligible for registration is 40. Further, other provisions ensure that small operators who are really only seeking to obtain temporary benefits without being able to trade effectively in ships are not able to take benefits which are really not intended to go in their direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an important proposal and I am glad that it has the support of the Opposition. I know that the management of International Catamarans, in discussions with the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), expressed the view that it would not have been able to trade and grow as it has done had this bounty arrangement not been in place. It has expressed its sincere appreciation for the Government's commitment to the shipbuilding industry, and I am very pleased that on this occasion the Opposition shares the general commitment of the Government in this area, notwithstanding that it is a trifle sensitive to other matters being raised in the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bounty (Ships) Bill. I also welcome the Opposition's assurance that it will not oppose this Bill, although I believe it will move some amendments in the committee stage. The Australian shipbuilding industry today is very different from that of the 1960s and 1970s-an era characterised by industrial unrest, high levels of protection and an emphasis on producing large steel vessels for a shrinking world market. Today's industry is vigorous and healthy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our shipbuilders now work in specialised markets where many are building a reputation as world leaders with their innovative approaches to design and production technology. It is a relatively small but soundly based industry which is well placed to provide steady employment based on a vigorous and highly competitive export trade. Due to greater specialisation, many firms do not build the same range of vessels as they did, say, five years ago. Export demand for vessels, particularly fishing vessels, yachts and ferries, has become increasingly important in contributing to a higher level of throughput for Australian shipbuilders. The success of the industry in making steady progress towards becoming a viable export oriented branch of the Australian manufacturing sector has been characterised by a significant increase in total employment, continuing industry rationalisation, remarkable innovations in both materials and product design, increased capital investment and a particularly high level of industrial harmony. </PARA>
<PARA> An increasing level of innovation is apparent among many of the leading members of the industry. Some are looking at new ways of constructing superstructures using non-metallic composite materials and others are developing novel hull forms aimed at producing greater stability in passenger-carrying catamarans. The use of computerised design aids and numerically controlled cutting and welding equipment is gaining steady acceptance in the industry and holds out the promise of a more efficient and competitive industry. Our fishing vessel operators have introduced many innovative concepts to simplify handling problems and minimise crew numbers. The close links between operators and builders, and the unique combination of their particular skills, are in fact contributing greatly to the industry's remarkable success in the export trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the legislation now before the House, the Bounty (Ships) Bill 1989, is to provide bounty assistance to certain Australian shipbuilders from 1 July 1989 up to but not beyond 30 June 1995. The Bill will continue present assistance to the industry but in such a way that it will be gradually phased out and cut out altogether in mid-1995. To be eligible to receive a bounty, a vessel will need to be between 150 and 10,000 gross construction tonnes and be both self-propelled and navigable. Bounty will be paid on the production of ships regardless of whether they are for export or domestic use. To be eligible to receive bounty, shipbuilders must meet clearly defined registration criteria which are so designed as to channel assistance to those shipbuilders which have the potential to be world competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1984 this Government has targeted for assistance those shipbuilders who have clearly demonstrated their long-term commitment to the industry and their ability to be internationally competitive. For this reason, one of the criteria for bounty assistance is that shipbuilding firms must employ no fewer than 40 employees, as there is strong evidence to indicate that smaller firms simply cannot compete internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is in line with changes in the Hawke Labor Government's policy, as announced in November last year, following consideration of the Industry Assistance Commission (IAC) report Ships, Boats and Other Vessels which was released a few months previously. This report referred to the increasingly healthy state of the Australian shipbuilding industry. The legislation now before the House will provide further stimulus and encouragement to the industry, which by mid-1995 will hopefully be in a position to stand on its own feet without need for further government assistance. Continued assistance over the next few years is considered to be essential so that Australian shipbuilders can continue to build on the significant gains in efficiency and competitiveness they have achieved in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is most heartening to know that the Australian shipbuilding industry has become increasingly competitive in recent years and, in particular, has been able to compete most effectively on the international market. These developments are of course the direct result of changes in Australia's shipbuilding policy which were adopted by the Hawke Labor Government in 1984 when it decided to extend bounty payments to include those ships built for export and, at the same time, to tighten registration regulations for bounty purposes. These decisions, I am happy to inform the House, have led to an export orientation on an unprecedented scale with current export orders amounting to some $300m. This significant turnaround in the Australian shipbuilding industry is well illustrated by the fact that more than 50 per cent of the vessels completed in the first half of this year are destined for export, whereas in the entire 1984-85 financial year only one ship was exported. According to the 1987-88 annual report of the Shipbuilding Consultative Group, exports of Australian ships jumped from $30m in 1986-87 to $50m in 1987-88. This represents an increase of 67 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> What is particularly striking in the IAC report, Ships, Boats and other Vessels, is the strong position of new entrants to the Australian shipbuilding industry since the introduction of registration criteria in 1984. More than 40 firms have been registered since 1984, and at any one time there are normally about 20 active shipbuilding firms. Many of today's success stories come from firms that have entered the industry over the past five years. What is immediately obvious from reading the IAC report and the most recent annual and quarterly reports of the Shipbuilding Consultative Group is that success belongs to those firms which are prepared to try new designs, materials and technology. There is a lesson in this for the entire Australian manufacturing industry. It is obvious that the future does not belong to the faint-hearted and those who rely on doing things in the old ways. There is no room for conservatism in the international marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> All the reports to which I have referred clearly demonstrate that the recent success of the Australian shipbuilding industry has been achieved only by its being prepared-with the active support and encouragement of this Government-to invest heavily in marketing, capital equipment, new technology and training. I am also pleased to note that, despite the significant restructuring developments taking place, the industry continues to experience a high degree of industrial harmony with very few disputes or disruptions. The present industrial restructuring is very much in line with the Hawke Labor Government's industrial relations policy-a modern and effective policy for a modern and efficient industry. These developments, which have industry-wide implications, include the agreement at the Australian Marine Engineering Corporation which involves a reduction in the number of unions from 23 to three and the introduction of a clearly defined career path within each classification. Negotiations covering submarine fabrication are currently taking place between the Australian Submarine Corporation Pty Ltd and three production unions for an agreement along similar lines to the other agreement. A further significant development has been the agreement which paves the way for a reduction in the number of unions at the Carrington Slipways. </PARA>
<PARA> These agreements, when taken in conjunction with the newly introduced classifications of `ship repair tradesman' and `ship repair assistant', represent some of the most comprehensive exercises to date in award restructuring within the Australian manufacturing sector and effectively put the shipbuilding industry at the forefront of such developments. I am here reminded most forcibly of the pioneering work of the maritime unions which, for some years, have been very actively pursuing the path of award restructuring-</PARA>

<PARA>At long last we are looking beyond the myths to the reality of the situation on the Australian waterfront.

What the Opposition wants is not to promote harmonious industrial relations based on mutual respect, skills enhancement and the opening up of career paths; rather, the destruction of the union movement. It would recklessly destroy the hard-won industrial harmony and understanding built up in recent years, a harmony and understanding firmly based on the conviction that unions, management and government should be equal partners in building an efficient, innovative and internationally competitive Australian industrial and manufacturing base. The Bounty (Ships) Bill now before us is designed to promote just that within the Australian shipbuilding industry, and I have much pleasure in commending the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If one goes back to 1983 and recalls the state of the shipbuilding industry and the inadequacies of the previous Government's policy, one will see that in one sense the ships bounty as it then existed was only for domestic purchasing. In other words, ships built for the export market received no bounty, while ships built solely for Australian buyers received a bounty. We saw in the early 1980s the most blatant and destructive action by the then Government in this industry that we had ever seen. The previous Liberal-National Party Government awarded the contract for an oceanographic vessel to North Queensland Engineers and Agents Pty Ltd, when, in fact, the cheapest tenderer was a Newcastle-based shipbuilder, Carrington Slipways Pty Ltd. The confidence of Australian manufacturing industry, and shipbuilders in particular, took a great knock from that decision. Many people in Newcastle will never forget the blatant intrusion and the unfairness of the then Government's decision not to award the contract to the lowest and most competitive tenderer. We hear rhetoric from the other side about competition and fairness, but if one looks at the actions of the previous Government in its seven years in office one will find numerous examples where it did not occur, and shipbuilding was one of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The current Act terminates on 30 June and, without a new Act to replace it, there will be no ships bounty beyond that date. The Bounty (Ships) Bill 1989 provides for a bounty of 15 per cent to apply from 1 July, dropping on 1 July 1991 to 10 per cent, in 1993 to 5 per cent, and phasing out completely in 1995. The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) indicated in his second reading speech that over half the vessels built in the first half of this year were for the export market and that current export orders are in the vicinity of $300m. As the previous speaker the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) pointed out, that is a massive improvement on the pre-1984 figure of zero export work. The domestic and export market will be identical except in regard to New Zealand, to which the bounty will not be applicable after June 1990 under the closer economic relations agreement between Australia and New Zealand. In the 1987-88 financial year exports were up by 67 per cent; the number of shipbuilders was reduced from 25 to 22; yet overall employment increased by 7.5 per cent. If one goes back to the 1984 reports, one will find that there were 91 registered yards involved in shipbuilding. So we have seen a restructuring of the industry. There are fewer yards competing successfully in the export market, yet in recent years employment has grown. </PARA>
<PARA> Carrington Slipways is Australia's premier shipbuilder. It has been at the forefront of these changes. It was the victim of that blatant decision by the previous Government not to award it the contract to build the vessel that it won fair and square. Carrington Slipways is currently involved in building Australia's most complex vessel, the Antarctic research vessel the Aurora Australis. For the information of the House the launch date of that vessel looks like being 19 August, the completion date being 8 December. It is interesting to note that it is the first double-hulled vessel ever built in the Southern Hemisphere. It involves technology that has normally been restricted to Scandinavia and Germany. If there is a future for Antarctic shipping of any form, whether it be fishing, tourist, or supply vessels, the Australian shipbuilding industry for the first time has the capacity to supply it. </PARA>
<PARA> The construction of that vessel has been a fascinating project because it has allowed the development of much more sophistication in the shipbuilding industry. Carrington Slipways has used it as a model to develop a number of fairly significant management packages, including the integrated hull outfitting and painting, the construction work breakdown structure and a highly developed cost schedule and control of information systems. These systems in toto relate to planning, the supply of materials, the manufacturing process itself and costing and scheduling controls. In other words, the overall construction of a vessel, from design through to final launch and completion, is managed and monitored on a day-by-day basis, with management fully in control of what is occurring. That requires much more sophisticated management at both the organisational level and the work force level. Over the years there has been the development, particularly at Carrington Slipways, of a most sophisticated arrangement between the trade unions-the work force-and management. </PARA>
<PARA> The implementation and maintenance of the various systems of which I speak require the active support and involvement of the work force. Carrington Slipways has never had more than three unions represented in its plant, which is why it is so well positioned to be the constructor of the current Anzac ship project. Certainly, there were times in 1981, 1982 and 1983 when many people were talking about the death of Australian shipbuilding. Now we are seeing it as an export industry. I am sure that those on the other side of the House now wish they had had such foresight and initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> This is part of a package of changes within the ship construction and repair industry. The export bounty was the first extension and the ship repair bounty was the second. We are now seeing the integration of the ship bounty provisions into a single Act, rather than being in a patched-up form as was the case previously. I certainly welcome this. I also appreciate very much the efforts of both the Minister at the table, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), and Senator Button, who have both been deeply involved in one of the exciting examples of the micro-economy restructuring process. One can refer to the process in Australia in recent years of redirecting investment into manufacturing, into long-term company equity, via tax imputation, by the use of research and development taxation write-offs to create an environment to change the industrial culture or the manufacturing culture and then, in turn, using a scheme such as a bounty scheme as a top-up. </PARA>
<PARA> Fundamentally, there is very little point in governments making up for the inadequacies of Australian manufacturing in the form of bounty unless we are in fact addressing the root cause. The fact is that bounties will never make us competitive. Often they merely induce further lack of competition or lack of refinement. Unless the investment and manufacturing environment is correct, the bounty does nothing to aid the situation. One has seen this in the past in relation to other industries. The fact is that we must make our industries competitive and provide the appropriate environment, where they are research oriented and technologically advanced and competitive. Bounties cannot be used to make up for the backwardness of the fundamental base of an industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I want to mention two things that concern me at the moment. First, in terms of a recent contract let by the New South Wales Government for Manly ferries, it might perhaps be a coincidence but the winning contractor was again the Queensland firm that I mentioned earlier in my speech. I would like to be reassured by the New South Wales State Government that every endeavour was made to ensure that no State subsidies were involved in that contract and that there was no hidden support from the Queensland National Party Government. It does concern me that States are competing and distorting conditions in the marketplace in a way that does not promote open and fair competition. I would certainly like to be reassured that the State Government of New South Wales did ensure in its tender evaluation processes that that did not occur in this particular case. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter that I want to refer to concerns the question of the extension of the research and development tax write-off. I believe that it is vital that this scheme be extended beyond 1991 and be then followed by a phase-down. The fact is that our industries are becoming more technologically advanced. They are much more research and development oriented. However, it is a slow process to change the manufacturing culture of a country like Australia, with our history of having been so far behind for so many decades in our use of technology in the workplace. The research and development tax write-off does encourage and induce companies to invest in research and development. In line with the phasing out of bounties in various industries, the phasing out of the research and development tax write-off should be synchronised. It concerns me that if those two things are not done in tune and in concert, there is a danger that the bounty phase-downs as they occur will leave industries inadequately positioned technologically-and that will be because they do not have the continuing assistance of that research and development tax write-off. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to pay a personal tribute to both Ministers who have been involved in this matter as it relates to an area that has been so dependent on shipbuilding and the shipping industry, and I refer to the port of Newcastle and the work force of Newcastle. It is with some pride that I can point to this Bill and to the changes that have occurred in shipbuilding over the past six years. It has been a privilege to be a member of a government which has been so creative and productive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is extraordinary to reflect that all the issues relating to industry restructuring in the period from 1975 to 1983 were regarded simply as being too difficult to tackle. Although the previous Government used a very tough kind of rhetoric, when it really came to the crunch members of that Government were not prepared to bring about any significant economic change in the structure of our industries. The tariff regime was left exactly as it was before. There was little sense of an Australian industry. Any changes made were absolutely trivial. It was not until the election of the present Government in 1983 that there was any kind of major attempt to restructure industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note with particular pleasure what the honourable member for Newcastle said, namely, that it is a tribute to the instigators of this change that we now have the first double-hulled ship to be constructed in the Southern Hemisphere being built for the Antarctic Division. Some 10 years ago when there seemed to be no future at all in the shipbuilding industry, that was regarded as an impossible dream. However, we have now achieved it. I think it is very much to the credit of Senator Button, and I will pass on the congratulatory remarks from the honourable member for Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) raised a number of matters related to the relevance of registration criteria.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 17, page 14, lines 1-3, omit subparagraph (6) (d) (ii). </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 17 (6) provides:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister shall not register an applicant for registration unless . . . </PARA>
<PARA>(d) the applicant demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Minister, that during the period to which the application relates . . . </PARA>
<PARA>and then three different criteria are given, but the Opposition is happy with only two of those. The Opposition does not agree with the provision in subparagraph (ii):</PARA>
<PARA>. . . at least 75 per cent of the applicant's activities will be devoted to the construction or modification of vessels of more than 150 but not more than 10,000 gross construction tons;</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment aims to make the legislation a little more economically rational. If the 75 per cent provision-as I shall call it during the debate on the amendment-remains, it will then be a question of the Government and the bureaucrats picking who will be able to build ships more effectively than certain other people. I do not think that that is a matter that either the bureaucracy or the Government is qualified to determine. If my amendment is unsuccessful and the 75 per cent provision remains, the provision can very easily be circumvented. It could be circumvented by a company involved in various other activities, such as ship repair, setting up a company simply for the purposes of constructing a ship, with the company thus established to be 100 per cent involved in shipbuilding, whereas the original parent company would not be. As the legislation stands, I do not think it makes a great deal of sense. I always argue in this chamber that it is important to make sure that the law that we debate and pass through the two Houses of Parliament is rational and makes good sense. Given that this particular provision can be circumvented, I think it runs the risk of leaving us in the position of the law being made an ass, and that is not something that I want to see happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Our objective in moving this amendment goes further than that because we want to ensure that the criteria which are aimed at reducing industry fragmentation do not result in a net cost by discouraging potentially efficient producers. What I am going to do a little later is read from a submission from one shipyard which explains how that can happen. I made the point in the second reading debate that as the rate of bounty phases down, as it is intended to in this legislation, the possible costs and benefits of the registration criteria-and this is one of those three criteria-will diminish. I said then that once it gets to 10 per cent I doubt that the 75 per cent requirement will even be relevant because only exclusive shipbuilders with a bounty of 10 per cent or less would be in a position to go ahead with that sort of construction. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say a couple of other things about this amendment. The first is that, for those in the industry who are concerned that moving the amendment may delay the legislation, that is obviously not the Opposition's intention. Indeed, it is a matter for the Government as to whether this amendment would in any way delay the legislation. Let me say for the record that it is not our intention to delay the legislation. There is no reason in the world why simply moving an amendment would delay that legislation. Having said that, I recognise-and recognise well-the representations we on this side of the chamber have received. I do not doubt that the Government will refer to this, so I had better refer to it first myself. I refer particularly to a representation from the Australian Shipbuilders Association-in particular, from Mr Farrell, who is the Chairman of that Association. Mr Farrell saw Senator Chaney about our amendment and I have had a letter from Mr Farrell as well. He has made it clear that his Association voted by a majority against the proposition that we as an opposition were putting forward. I respect the views of the Association, but I still think that our view that this amendment should proceed is the correct view. I think that we would end up with better legislation which allowed the industry itself to work out its future rather than what could broadly be described as bureaucratic machinery setting down criteria for how the industry should work and what sorts of companies should be helped or should not be helped. </PARA>
<PARA> I have made a few points about the way this particular provision could be circumvented and I have made the point that it will become redundant, in my view, once the bounty reduces to something like 10 per cent. There is an element of superfluity about the particular provision within the legislation. I also said earlier that I would read from a submission we have received from a very well known and successful shipbuilder-Kailis Australian Shipyards of Western Australia. In its submission in support of our amendment the company states that there are very substantial advantages in what it calls a combined shipyard. Let me quote from that particular submission:</PARA>
<PARA>The strategy of combining shipbuilding with substantial ship repair facilities and other marine related activities has significant advantages in the synergy between the two operations. These are:</PARA>
<PARA>(i) Vessel Technology</PARA>
<PARA> By retaining a significant repair facility a ship-builder has a wide exposure to the latest technology being used in existing fleets and vessels. This is especially important in Australia because as comparatively few new vessels are being constructed for the local market and advances tend to be incorporated in existing vessels. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me say that that is a very rational and important view the Government should take account of when considering the amendment we are moving. The submission goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>(ii) Technology Transfer</PARA>
<PARA> Clients in undeveloped and developing countries increasingly require ongoing repair/refit assistance and look to that assistance as being provided as part of the overall sale package. The retention of a very substantial refit/repair capacity enables a yard to provide this high level support without interfering with its shipbuilding activities. </PARA>
<PARA>The third point it makes relates to economic downturn and skills retention. Honourable members can rest assured that, with the present economic policies of the Government, we are heading very fast for a very big economic downturn in Australia. The particular point that is made here is one that needs to be carefully considered in the current climate. The submission continues:</PARA>
<PARA>(iii) Economic Downturn-Skills Retention</PARA>
<PARA> Ship repair and other marine work tends to be more stable than new vessel construction. A substantial ship repair/marine business assists in the retention of staff during gaps in the order book or periods of low activity. This contributes greatly to the job-security of highly trained staff and the training of apprentices. Generally the enterprise is in a better financial position and able to quickly respond to changes in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the three points that have been made there by Kailis Shipyards in Western Australia are very strong points. Those are points that have been made in support of the amendment that the Opposition is moving. I hope the Government will take into consideration the arguments that we have made in support of the amendment in the context of positive benefits that would flow from it. I hope it will consider the arguments we have put in the context of the existing provision being perhaps superfluous because it can easily be circumvented and because as the bounty reduces it will become irrelevant in any case. I hope the government will take into consideration the sheer logic of the change we are proposing because the Government's legislation is working towards industry based solutions rather than bureaucratic and government determined solutions to the future of the industry. It is this particular provision which holds up that resolution of the future of the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with some interest and concern to the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), as I always do. I think his concern is completely ill-founded. He says it is a bureaucratic solution to a problem where there ought to be industry based solutions. We recognise that there are a whole number of areas which, over the years, we have targeted for assistance. How appropriate it is that he should be sitting next to a distinguished scion of the National Party of Australia, whose members are great believers in targeted assistance. National Party members imbibe the idea of targeted assistance with their mother's milk and believe in it very deeply. I know the honourable member for Mayo does not believe in it in quite the same way. It is a well recognised principle that one can have targeted assistance. Frankly, the intention of targeting is to say, `At this point we are interested in specifying that the assistance, limited though it is, goes to people who are serious performers, the people who have a serious prospect of being internationally competitive'. We want a world competitive industry. We have not an unlimited amount of time to do it in. If there is a limited amount of assistance, one makes sure that it goes to the serious players in the game.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation provides that 75 per cent of activity has to be devoted to the construction or modification of vessels between 150 and 10,000 gross construction tonnes. Of course, I concede that a figure like that is arbitrary. Why 75 per cent rather than 70, 80, 82 1/2 or something like that? What it means is that it has to be substantial. Should we use the words `substantially committed' or something like that? The figure of 75 per cent is just one which seems to suggest a strong commitment, an overwhelming commitment. That is really all that is involved in it. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member mentioned the case of Kailis Australian Shipyards. There is no doubt that Kailis has produced some very worthwhile ships and has had a good reputation, but the point is that Kailis is not currently active in shipbuilding. Its registration lapsed on 1 January 1989 due to an inability of this yard to remain competitive. In the past it was able to carry on its activities because it received cross-subsidisation, in effect, from other areas of its activity-that is, from its fishing empire. We are looking at targeted assistance; we are looking at an industry-based solution. The honourable member for Mayo was very candid in pointing out that the view that he put forward was not a view that was accepted by a majority of members of the Australian Shipbuilders Association. The honourable member is absolutely correct. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also argued that the 75 per cent criterion was easy to get around by rearranging an applicant's business structure. If a large organisation `playing', as the honourable member might describe it, at shipbuilding restructures so that it becomes fully aware of the true cost of shipbuilding and then says, `All right, we are rearranging our affairs to such an extent that we are getting out of hotels and getting into shipbuilding', that is all right. If that organisation makes a calculated commercial decision and says, `We think this is where the profitability is; we think this is where we have a prospect', then let it do that. That is not the result of a bureaucratic process. It is the result of a calculated decision to say, `Yes, we think we have a chance; it would be even better if we had a degree of government assistance, but we think we have a chance. We are prepared to be serious participants and we are prepared to devote 75 per cent of our efforts to that area'. That seems to be an absolutely rational commercial judgment. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) does not disagree with that, does he? His silence is eloquent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a matter of walking away from the aims. It is a matter of saying, `Yes, this suits the intention of our corporation as well'. It also has to be said that it was the part-time shipbuilders using transfer pricing internally which almost destroyed the industry during the 1980-84 period before the criteria, which were well thought through, created the present healthy group of manufacturers. Leaving politics aside for a moment-which is very difficult to do-I do not think there would be anybody in the House, whatever corner he or she came from, who would disagree that the shipbuilding industry is in a much healthier state than it was five or 10 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, regarding the discouraging of potential producers, during the past five years only 13 out of 45 registrants have been continuously registered. That means 32 firms have entered, and in some cases left, the industry. It is not a closed shop; we have new players coming in. Sometimes they find the competition is too hard, so they get out. I think the concentration of effort, the targeting of effort, to the people who are essentially devoted to put at least 75 per cent of their effort in the category referred to in clause 6 (d) (ii) is manifestly justified. Many of today's most successful producers have entered the industry since 1985. Oceanfast, Runmere, Austel Ships, and the Sea Management Corporation have all come in since 1985. All are examples of businesses which have entered since 1985, under both the registration criteria and the orderly development provision. All are full time builders producing for the export market. They are precisely the people who will benefit from this provision. I do not think the case is soundly made that potential producers will be discouraged. All the companies I have mentioned would have met and surpassed the 75 per cent rule. All of them are 100 per cent shipbuilders. I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish very briefly to pick up a couple of points made by the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones). I rather enjoy discussing some of these issues with him in the House. It brings a little more relevance to some of the debates than is quite often the case. The Minister made the point at the beginning of his remarks that he wants serious players in the industry. No-one would argue with the proposition. There are other criteria involved for obtaining the bounty relating to, for example, employees and so on which guarantee that that remains the case. But how would the Government ever know who the serious players were? If the Government says it wants particular kinds of people in the industry, how will it know that there are not other people who would have been extremely successful in the industry, but who are excluded because of these criteria? How does it know that it is not excluding from shipbuilding people who may have turned out to be extraordinarily successful and profitable shipbuilders?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point I wish to make relates more specifically to the fact that the Minister never took up the point I made which came from the Kailis submission, unless it was during one of my fleeting moments of lost concentration. I do not think he took up the point about the various advantages that Kailis put forward of having a combined yard. I do think the three specific points that I read from its submission were very important. If the Minister has the time I would appreciate his responding to that. I am convinced by the three points that Kailis put forward. It does not seem to be entirely rational that the Government should be excluding any combined yards simply because 75 per cent of their operation is not exclusively shipbuilding, but 65, 55 or 45 per cent may be. They may have an entirely viable operation producing extremely good ships and, during upturns and downturns of the economy, having the continuity of work through repairs and maintenance of ships which keeps them in business. It seems a bit silly, given that the Government obviously intends to help the shipbuilding industry, not hinder it, that it should have a provision which actually excludes that kind of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Minister made the point about the circumvention of the legislation. Since the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) was sitting here he took the point that it was unlikely that someone would move from hotels to ships, but if he did that was fair enough provided he just built ships. I am sure I speak for the honourable member for Gippsland when I say that his family would not think of moving from hotels to ships. I do not know why I think that, but I have a feeling that that is the case. </PARA>

We are not talking about some business that might move from hotels to ships. We are really getting back to the sort of structure I was talking about in the context of the Kailis submission. We are talking about people who may have a combined yard structure and who decide to excise from the corporate structure the part which is involved in the building of ships in order to ensure that they gain access to the bounty. I think that would be a very simple operation. To use the extravagant example of somebody going from hotels to shipbuilding, or from some sort of tourist operation in the north of Queensland showing people around a river or looking at crocodiles to shipbuilding, is not a real world example. A real world example is starting with a combined yard structure, excising a part of that business which is associated specifically with shipbuilding, and then obtaining the bounty. It seems to me that the Minister does not really answer the propositions we have put forward. I think you, Madam Deputy Chairman, would be the first to agree that that is a very good reason for the Government to change its position now and decide to support our amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then the honourable member should visit some of them. If we look at the history of shipbuilding from the wooden vessels of the past when ship repair and shipbuilding were interrelated, we find that the technology was similar, the work force was similar and they tended to work in mixed yards, whether it was in Scandinavia, Europe, America or Australia. I am trying to recall whether at the moment in Australia there is one continuing significant shipbuilder-ship repairer in a mixed yard. I do not believe there is. North Queensland Engineers and Agents Pty Ltd, Australian Shipbuilding Industries, Carrington Slipways Pty Ltd and Williamstown fundamentally are all shipbuilders. One could argue that Cockatoo dockyards does a bit of both occasionally, but only in accordance with government contracts. The reason for this is quite straightforward: nowadays, the technology is very different. In fact, the idea of having mixed yards to pick up what is happening in new fleet work is almost ludicrous. It is an expensive way of doing one's homework.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What complicates the issue much more seriously is that both works are available for bounty. So, how does one decide the split between the overheads of a company-its land and major equipment which are applicable to shipbuilding bounty-and repair bounty in a mixed yard? It becomes a very difficult matter to unravel. Quite frankly, the costs of maintaining floating or graving docks, which are a fundamental part of ship repair, would become overheads which most shipbuilders would not want to know about. Certainly, the shift in the past few hundred years has been towards separation rather than integration. The work force mix is entirely different. Painters and dockers are not used much in shipbuilding work any more, whereas once they were used all the time. Certainly, they still have a major role in ship repairs, but the technology, the equipment and skills are different, as is the management style, because of the major construction management skills required. One does not require computer aided design or computer assisted management systems for ship repair, although they might be required for modifications. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that this bounty allows for things such as complete engine replacement. The conversion of gas engines to diesel and vice versa is covered by this Bill. So major ship repair jobs are included in the Bill as ship modifications. When one talks about a mixed yard, the Bill allows that kind of mix, because that in itself is a major engineering work, as is building a ship. There is a lot of commonality; it is chronological. However, one cannot say that ship repair is a natural extension. It may be for timber boats or old, simple steel boats built 20 years ago. The fact is that the world has moved a long way forward. I suggest that the honourable member for Mayo should do a lot more surveying of ship repair and shipbuilding establishments in Australia. He will find that the reason why the shipbuilders associations have carried this resolution is very simple: fundamentally, they are all shipbuilders and do not see themselves as ship repairers. Nowadays, very few shipbuilders deal with that class of vessel. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo should also pay attention to how the bounty is apportioned in regard to management, rent, investments and other necessary requirements, as shipbuilding and ship repair work is being done in the same yard at the same time, with the same work force. If the honourable member thinks that to leave this provision in would be a bureaucratic nightmare, I can assure him that taking it out would create a much more difficult bureaucratic nightmare. </PARA>

<PARA> The three criteria set out in the proposed section are, firstly, physical access. We say that the assistance is targeted. In a sense, some areas are excluded. I would say that, for practical purposes, Alice Springs and Bendigo are excluded; they are just not in it. There might be somebody in Alice Springs who is potentially a terrific shipbuilder but he will not get a guernsey because he does not have access. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Patents Amendment Bill was introduced into the House on 3 June 1988. It has since been withdrawn and reintroduced to allow for significant amendment and redrafting in light of industry criticism, some of which, I hasten to add, has still not been met. During the debate I will address the amendments and explore their significance to the industry. As it stands, the Bill has two related objectives. The first is to abolish patent extensions which were obtainable through the judicial process and to retain a fixed 16-year patent term. Secondly, the Bill makes an exception, of sorts, for the pharmaceutical industry in that it introduces new administrative procedures for a four-year patent extension for pharmaceutical products beyond the fixed 16-year period which generally applies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's action in relation to patents was in response to the 1984 report by the Industrial Property Advisory Committee (IPAC) entitled Patents, Innovation and Competition in Australia. The Government's action in relation to the application of patent life to the pharmaceutical industry was in response to a government package for the pharmaceutical products industry announced on 13 September 1987 by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett). </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the abolition of the opportunity for an extension period for patents beyond the 16-year period, the Government had claimed to be seeking to enhance the usefulness of the patent system for Australian industry. It has based its actions on the IPAC report, as mentioned previously. That report was the first review of the Australian patent system from a supposedly economic perspective, acting as it did from an initiative of an earlier coalition government. Indeed, it was the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee), then the member for Balaclava, as Minister for Productivity, who ordered the review in 1979. It was the intention of the report to provide recommendations that would adapt the patent system in such a way as to effectively stimulate Australia's technological development. It was hoped that such a review would sponsor greater innovation on the part of Australian industry as well as the conditions in which there would be an enhanced opportunity for exports. How these changes were to arise from the patent system is a complex matter, and there is still a great deal of uncertainty as to whether or in what form a patent system is conducive to indigenous research and development. While the IPAC report represents a commendable effort in relation to the complexity of the area in which it worked, certain broad questions of the applicability of the report to Australian circumstances remain unanswered. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders whether the process of indigenous or domestic innovation is really helped or hindered by the patent system in its current form. Patents are a form of regulated monopoly. The apparent purpose of this monopoly is to encourage invention and innovation by ensuring adequate returns to the designer or manufacturer. Such returns might not be forthcoming if a patented product had been subject to imitation; that is, without patents it is argued that there would not be any incentive to enter into research and strive for innovation. Yet care has to be taken with such a process. While research and innovation undoubtedly benefit the community, the continuation of a monopolous situation could impact negatively upon consumers: a non-competitive environment can result in artificially high prices. It is still necessary to ask whether the patent system, in spite of the changes presented here in this Bill, actually results in any substantial developments in respect of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this concern because 90 per cent of patents offered in this country are for overseas manufacturers, and 95 per cent of those are for foreign pharmaceutical companies. I do not pretend to know the answer to this problem. But I do think that we are well overdue for a close study of the patent system in order to discover exactly in what way it influences our processes of innovation and research. Certainly, once our manufacturing sector is re-equipped, restructured and more competitive, we might well see it wishing to exploit patents for itself. But I am still concerned as to whether the continuation of the present system is actually an impediment to the creation of a competitive manufacturing sector in the first place, and whether the consumer actually benefits from a system which limits the amount of import competition which can take place. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a cause and effect problem here, to which a more aggressive inquiry could well turn its collective mind. The need to ask more penetrating questions on the patent system was suggested by the author of the dissenting report to the IPAC report, upon which the Government has based its recommendations. Professor D. M. Lamberton, who is professor of economic history at the University of Queensland, suggested in his dissenting statement that the net social value of the patent system for Australia is questionable, given the Australian economy exports very little by way of manufactured goods and has few manufacturing oriented innovations for sale. To this end, Professor Lamberton called for a patent term of 10 years, which he believed would free up import competition while being of sufficient duration to offset the concerns of overseas manufacturers. Admittedly difficult though it is to walk a narrow path between international conventions, incentive for innovation and consumer interest, a more questioning approach could have resulted in a more effective policy choice. I say this with the Canadian experience in mind.</PARA>
<PARA> Up until 1986, the Canadian Government utilised a system of compulsory licensing. Under this system, unless a patent owner chose to manufacture the product in the country in which it held a patent within a fixed time, it was required to allow a local manufacturer to produce it. While hardly winning friends, the Canadian experience did ensure a high degree of technological transfer. Even though the compulsory licensing system has been dropped and manufactured goods now receive 10 years of protection, manufacturers must still provide for a set amount of research and development in Canada, thereby guaranteeing a base for technological transfer. Whilst I do not call for such a system, I suggest that there are quite possibly more energetic and inventive ways of ensuring that our domestic manufacturing sector derives greater benefits from the patent system than it currently does. For the time being, though, we are left with the more restrictive analysis of the patent system carried out five years ago. The Government has accepted the bulk of the 46 recommendations in principle, though it has chosen to implement only recommendation 11, which says that the procedures for the granting of extensions of the terms of standard patents be eliminated altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation from the IPAC report is given effect through clause 5 of the current Bill which repeals and substitutes part IX of the Patents Act 1952. This clause will terminate all grants for extensions, excluding pharmaceuticals, beyond the initial 16-year patent grant. It will, therefore, also end the uncertainty which surrounded the patent system previously and gives competitors an opportunity to carry out some strategic planning in respect of entering the market. Yet, as part of a larger package of reforms, the Government has found it fitting to exempt the pharmaceutical industry, at least those pharmaceuticals for human consumption, from these provisions. Pharmaceuticals for human use are singled out in an effort by the Government to compensate the industry for the time eroded from its effective patent life by the regulatory delays. For the most part, these regulatory delays result from the necessity of pharmaceuticals to undergo extensive testing prior to obtaining their initial marketing approval. As compensation for these delays, the Government is implementing, by way of the Bill, new procedures which will enable pharmaceutical companies to apply for a four-year patent extension at the conclusion of their current 16-year patent term. </PARA>
<PARA> It is argued that the introduction of such a system is a clear improvement over the current system, which is, by any standards, admittedly unwieldy, in that applications for extensions are granted on the basis of judicial action in which a pharmaceutical company must justify its claim for extension on the basis of lost remuneration. Quite obviously, this is a time consuming and costly procedure, especially as the courts would be adjudicating on an open-ended concept like `sufficient remuneration'. Litigation often involved international accountants and millions of dollars. The Bill will bring an end to the uncertainty over patent life which so troubled competitors as well as providing some much needed administrative streamlining for the pharmaceutical industry. </PARA>
<PARA> While not objecting to the intent of the exercise, I wonder why other areas of manufacturing do not enjoy the same treatment though they too suffer from erosion of their effective patent life owing to regulatory delays. Telecommunications equipment is a pertinent example. It is also a concern that the Government, though it accepted that in principle it should consider agricultural chemicals and veterinary pharmaceuticals in the same manner as pharmaceuticals for human use, has not acted on its intention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill currently before the House was a long time coming. It made a premature appearance in June 1988. It was then whipped off the agenda owing to the pharmaceutical industry's and the Law Council of Australia's criticisms. It has only recently appeared, though again with many false starts. The redrafted Bill now appears with a supplementary explanatory memorandum and a supplementary list of amendments designed to overcome the deficiencies of the original Bill. I acknowledge to the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) and to honourable members that the area of patents is an extraordinarily complex and difficult one. Indeed, the Patents Act is comparable to the Income Tax Assessment Act in size and complexity. Nonetheless, I believe that the handling of the Bill before the House warrants the condemnation of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the Patents Amendment Bill 1988 was originally introduced on 3 June 1988 and was then left on the table to allow consultation with interested parties. The Bill was relisted for debate in the House of Representatives on 2 March. However, the Opposition was not given a copy of the amendments. Subsequent inquiries to the office of the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Button, who has principal charge of the legislation, revealed that the Bill had been listed without his approval. Indeed, the amendments had not been approved by the Minister by 2 March this year. It was agreed verbally between the Opposition and the Government that the debate obviously could not proceed on 2 March. However, the Bill was not removed from the legislative program. Senator Chaney, being Senator Button's opposite number, wrote on 22 February to seek clarification of the situation. Regrettably, a verbal response was received from Senator Button's office on 27 February to the effect that the Bill would not proceed until further notice. </PARA>
<PARA> The saga continues and the plot thickens. The Bill was relisted for debate on Thursday, 13 April, but no amendments had been received by the Opposition by Thursday, 8 April, which the Government would know is a cut-off date for shadow ministry submissions. Indeed, these amendments were not made available until 11 April. The late availability of the Government's amendments appears to be due to a mix-up between the offices of Senator Button and the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business. Senator Button's office claimed that the Patents Office had been requested to supply the Opposition with a copy of the amendments as early as 5 April. However, the amendments were delayed by the office of the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business until the following week. </PARA>
<PARA> It is simply not good enough. Legislation that is difficult and complex in any event is introduced several months later. We are told that it is relisted for debate, but the 20 amendments are not brought forward for the Opposition to consider in time prior to the debate. That is simply no way for the Government to conduct the business of this House. It means that the Opposition and, indeed, the industries affected by this crucial legislation have been on the back foot for some time. The Minister, in his summing up in this debate, must attend to the matters raised by the Opposition as a matter of grave concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now return to the redrafted Bill which is before the House for debate this evening. Under the old Bill, the industry found the definition of `pharmaceutical substance' too restrictive. The definition of `pharmaceutical substance' under the original Bill was:</PARA>
<PARA>A substance (including a mixture or compound of substances) for therapeutic use the application, or one of the applications, of which involves a chemical interaction, or physico-chemical interaction, with a human physiological system . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 3 of the new Bill widens the definitions so that a chemical substance also includes:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . action on an infectious agent, or on a toxin or other poison, within a human body. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of the redefinition has been to enable anti-biotics, anti-virals and anti-toxins, whose mode of action is on a poison in the body rather than on the physiology itself, to fall under the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Bill also rectifies another deficiency of the earlier draft in relation to the role of the Secretary to the Department of Community Services and Health in granting extension eligibility certificates. Before an extension is granted a patentee must obtain an eligibility certificate from the Secretary. Fearing that a conflict of interests might arise with the Secretary to a Department who by virtue of his or her position in the health care community might seek to promote cheaper generic drugs, the Bill has tempered the Secretary's role in the extension process. The Secretary's role in the extension process, as defined in amendment No. 1 of the supplementary amendments, is now less interpretative than in the earlier draft and, as such, gives the pharmaceutical industry some ground for greater comfort. Moreover, prior criticism of the discretionary power given to the Minister and/or to the Secretary to oppose applications for extension without having to give adequate grounds for doing so has also been exorcised from the revised Bill currently before the House. I refer honourable members to clause 5 and proposed section 94 in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Confusion with the wording of the original Bill also arose from its failure to include explicitly both imported and domestically manufactured substances as suitable for obtaining a marketing approval certificate. The new amendments now override that technical implication, to the relief of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturers. The early Bill was also deficient in that it was unclear as to the scope of the patent extension; that is, marketing approvals are very specific and pharmaceutical companies were very concerned that they might not, under the original wording of the Bill, be able to seek an extension of all substances falling under their single patent extension. Supplementary amendments Nos 7 and 8 do limit confusion on this front. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem was that in the initial Bill marketing approvals, which are necessary for extension applications, were set in such narrow terms that companies feared that their patent could easily be infringed by a rival company which could seek to market a similar substance with only variations in colour or size of tablet. The amendments to clause 5 and proposed section 91 of the principal Act-I restate, the principal Act-further specify the coverage of the marketing approval so as to decrease the opportunities for infringement. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet another alteration to the original Bill concerns the decrease in the application period for an extension. Under the original Bill a period of not less than 21 months was required before the expiry of a patent was required for application for an extension of pharmaceutical patent. After consultation with the Law Council and the industry, which sought a six-month period only, the Government has compromised at a 12-month requirement for notification of an intention to seek application for extension. The Government seems to feel that the administrative streamlining I have described earlier will provide it with the opportunity to cut its response time to applications by 12 months. Relatedly, although the application time is reduced, competing companies still have adequate time to lodge protests against extension applications. Clause 11 (3) and (4) provide for acceptance of protests up to three months after the lodgment of the advertisement in the official journal, and a further three months after that to state grounds for the protest. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments 18 and 19, which apply to clause 5-section 96 of the Act-affect the so-called springboarding arrangements. Under the initial Bill it was feared by the industry that rival companies might be in a position to infringe against the patentee over the course of the last two years of a four-year extension. The Bill does give permission for a rival company, which might be seeking to produce a generic drug, to exploit the fixed extension period by undertaking certain activities in the last two years of the patent extension period so that they can enter the market as soon as the patent extension period ends. The current supplementary amendments ensure that these activities do not amount to compromising the patentee. No clearly commercial activities approaching marketing or distribution are permitted. </PARA>
<PARA> The central problems with the Bill relate to the transitional arrangements, and it is here that I wish to foreshadow amendments to be moved by the Opposition in the Senate. The amendments will be designed to counter continuing community concerns in this respect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of most concern is the opportunity the Bill provides for abuse of the transitional arrangements. Non-pharmaceutical patentees have forfeited their right to apply for extension under the old provisions unless proceedings were pending on 3 June 1988, or unless proceedings commenced after this date are finalised before the Bill is proclaimed. The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business asked why we are not moving these amendments here in the House of Representatives. I point out that if the Minister had got his act together from the very start, we might have had the time to consider some of the immense complexities and the varied issues that arise out of them. The simple fact is that we have enormous concerns with the transitional arrangements, as has the whole industry. However, the Minister simply has not allowed us the time to draft amendments in a form that will satisfy the concerns of many of the people affected. The Minister has shot himself in the foot by asking why these amendments are not before this House. The amendments are not before this House because, although this legislation has been listed for debate since 2 March, up until 13 April the Minister's office was not releasing the amendments to the Opposition. So it is absolutely disgraceful and arrant nonsense for the Minister to suggest that the Opposition could be in a position to produce such amendments in this chamber. By the time the legislation appears before the Senate we most certainly will be able to put before the Government amendments which will improve the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No doubt the Government believes that the existing cut-off date-the date of the Bill's introduction being 3 June 1988-is justifiable, given that it had signalled its intention to accept the Industrial Property Advisory Committee recommendations. Perhaps it also feared a rush of speculative applications had it given notice of a formal deadline. But these are cynical justifications. The cut-off date should be, in all fairness to the industry, the date at which the Bill receives royal assent. This would not lead to a rush of speculative applications as the court proceedings which would still apply would be too costly to carry out for anyone other than a bona fide applicant. In addition, there is also considerable continuing concern that that provision in the Bill which allows for objections to be posted against pharmaceutical patentee applicants whose patent expired two years before 3 June 1988 is open to abuse. The intent behind enabling patentees whose patent expires on the edges of the introduction of the Bill to seek extension is clear enough, but the provision to leave such applicants open to objections is a substantial source of concern to the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the legislation an interested party can object to a pharmaceutical patentee by using the new extension procedures. That is, there is a potential for vexatious objectors to abuse the procedures in the pursuit of commercial advantage. Under the old system, vexatious objectors were deterred by the costly court proceedings they were required to undertake in order to put their case. Under the new arrangements, the temptation to object is open-ended in that no grounds for objection are spelled out in the Bill and court proceedings are no longer necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is supported by the Opposition, but we continue to be concerned about the transitional arrangements. Furthermore, we deplore the handling of the Bill. It has left the Opposition and the industry that is affected by the Bill at something of a disadvantage. The Minister needs to explain to the House-better still, justify to the House-the inept handling of this legislation, or so much of the ineptness as occurred within his control. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find myself slightly confused by the date cycles mentioned by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). The honourable member said that the Patents Amendment Bill had been listed for debate since 2 March, and then he referred to a letter dated 27 February. So it seems that the criticism of the legislation not being withdrawn on 2 March was made a week earlier. I find it very hard to understand why Senators Button and Chaney were talking futuristically in that context. However, I believe that the honourable member was quite genuine when he said that he does not quite know the answer. It is a complex problem, a difficult issue, and the honourable member is not quite sure of the answer-or of his amendments, mind you. At least the Government is getting on with trying to take some action and do something about the complexities in our patent system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Back in 1986-87, a number of Government members, in liaison with Ministers and industry, also attempted to understand this issue better. We were confronted with a variety of propositions and proposals which included cross-licensing and a shortening of the patent process. These were amongst the various views put forward. The final decision taken by the Government was announced in September 1987 and I do not doubt that it had the support of the vast majority-in fact virtually unanimous support-of Government members. Some action was needed because the previous extension provisions were complex, slow and expensive. They were also uncertain and allowed patentees and others, through the use of the protracted legal process, to effectively extend patent life without actually doing so. Extensions were granted for up to five or 10 years, which in fact made them the longest patents available anywhere in the world. At the same time, we were looking at an environment in Australia and overseas where our balance of trade was obviously unhealthy-and that is still the case. In respect of Australian research, we saw our best research being applied overseas, and there are some wonderful examples of that in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw the overseas experience in the United States of America where generic products were taking up more than 50 per cent of the new prescription market, and in the United Kingdom it was 30 per cent. However, in Australia it was less than 5 per cent. I hear pharmacists and industry saying, `But you have the lowest priced pharmaceuticals in the world'. That is correct, but for brand names only. In other words, a brand name available in Australia, the US and the UK sells at a lower price in Australia. The fact is that the same product or medication is available in the USA as a generic product at a vastly lower price again. So, in fact, the idea of us having the world's lowest priced pharmaceuticals applies only because we have a virtually zero generic market. So we are talking solely about trade names and patented products, whereas the other Western economies have a much higher volume of generic products. In the USA and the UK the major companies that have patents also market their own trade brands or their own generic brands as well. In other words, the idea that manufacturers of generic products are somehow second-class companies or have second-class facilities is blatantly false, because the major drug companies do in fact supply the generic market in the same way as the major food companies in Australia supply the generic food market. All the other generic markets tend to be supplied by the major manufacturers. There is no worldwide first-and second-class manufacturing system. The generic and trade brand markets tend to be supplied significantly by the same manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> Also introduced at that stage in Australia was the 150 per cent tax write-off for research and development. This meant that for the first time there was a potential bias towards research and development at the application level-not at the theoretical level-within the production environment. We had also just been through a fairly major overhaul of the drug evaluation procedures. If one looked at the Australian pharmaceutical industry and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, one saw that the drug evaluation procedures needed some reformation. It was in that context that the Government's policy of industry generation, when applied to pharmaceuticals, brought forward three fundamental issues. We lacked a generic product in the Australian system. The overseas companies that basically hold the patents were not prepared to supply the generic product to Australia: they were prepared to supply only their brand name product, long after the patents had expired. In effect, the three-pronged approach was this: the extension of patent life; the introduction of generics into the pharmaceutical system, or perhaps the extension of generics to a more normal level in Western terms; and a higher price for Australian products. </PARA>
<PARA> The synchronisation of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and industry policy is a difficult, complex process-perhaps almost as complex as patents. Perhaps that is why the shadow Minister is having such difficulty. I believe the joint announcement by Senator Button and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) in September 1987 marked a great milestone in Australian industry terms. Historically we as a country had attempted to suppress the price of the pharmaceutical system through our dominance in the marketplace, and at the same time wondered why we had no creative research application and why we were not producing pharmaceuticals. Quite clearly, the two objectives were in total conflict. What was achieved by those two Ministers was a common policy across both services to allow prices to increase to accommodate and take account of the Australian research that would be involved and the higher costs of production in the shorter term. At the same time we sought from the suppliers a lower price for out-of-patent products. That policy has now been applied and we are seeing the results. Perhaps the confusion voiced by the Opposition has to some degree been echoed by pharmacists in recent months. When we ask them about the implications of some of these issues, we hear similar things to what we heard tonight from the honourable member for Gippsland. </PARA>
<PARA> Twenty-five manufacturers are now supplying their products at generic prices. Nine companies have withdrawn in regard to 12 products, and they have now asked if they can reconsider their decision. Those products are now being supplied by bio-equivalent tested drugs which are now in use. It is worth pointing out that whilst the same drugs were not available as generic drugs on the Australian prescription market, they have been in use by Australian hospitals for many years. So patients in hospitals were kept on the same medication but a generic drug from a different supplier was used, rather than a trade brand. It was almost certainly a different colour and possibly a different shape and size, but the therapeutic effect was identical. We have heard no complaints from hospitals, patients or patients' doctors in recent years as to the lack of effectiveness of the Australian generic supply. </PARA>
<PARA> We also saw an announcement in February by the Ministers involved, Senator Button and the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), regarding Glaxo Australia Pty Ltd winning approval for the first time for a higher price for its products in the Australian market. That agreement will mean more than $70m to Glaxo over that five-year period. In other words, the Government is saying that if we want to develop good products in Australia, we must put our money where our mouths are by recognising the costs involved. If we are going to feed off other countries' research and development, we expect to feed off it cheaper. That has been the attitude and the position of previous governments. We are saying that while that attitude may have been cheap on the surface, it has been expensive in the expatriation of Australian research and personnel and the addiction of our economy to an import requirement. The fact is that this country does have a capacity in the pharmaceutical field. Perhaps it is not huge; after all, we are only a modest nation, but we do have a capacity. Much of our present research, not just in pharmaceuticals but in associated fields, is exciting. There is a potential not only for import competition but also for export. </PARA>
<PARA> Like most honourable members, I support the comment by the honourable member for Gippsland that this is a complex issue. It is certainly not easy for a government to tackle patents legislation without recognising that it is walking into difficult territory. When this legislation was introduced last year many concerns were brought forward. The Government has been sufficiently mature and responsible to recognise that and to respond to it. This Government has certainly been marked during its six years by its preparedness to listen to industry, to commentators and to those who perhaps have specialised knowledge. We are not afraid of amending legislation if shortcomings are brought for-ward within the appropriate time. But the diatribe we heard earlier, in terms of some aspects of the Bill, certainly strays far from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a complex issue. I believe the Bill before the House will be effective, particularly in the generation of Australian pharmaceutical manufacturing. It recognises that we have research skills. We need the application environment. We will never develop any pharmaceutical industry while we expect to pay the world's cheapest price for brand or patented products. We expect to pay the worlds's cheapest price for generic products, but as long as we pay the world's cheapest price for patented products, not too many patents will be manufactured in Australia. The idea of compulsory licensing raised by the honourable member for Gippsland falls down because of its compulsory nature. The fact is that unless the prices we are prepared to pay take into account the costs involved in developing and manufacturing a new pharmaceutical products or delivery system, such a system will not happen in Australia; rather it will happen in a marketplace where costs can be recouped. On the one hand we are prepared to pay the higher prices, but on the other hand we expect that when a product has a patent life and the recouping of research costs has finished to all intents and purposes, its price should be significantly reduced. If the patentee does not wish to do so, others should. The best of both worlds are achieved by the two-year springboard process to allow alternative manufacturers access to the patent in those last two years. In other words, the normal one to two-year delay at patent expiration is covered by springboarding. I have no doubt that the vast majority of the people we spoke to in 1986-87 in the industry and in research supported what finally came forward. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make two pleas. I plead first with the pharmacists of Australia to support Australian jobs in the pharmaceutical industry and to support Australian manufacturing and research by recognising what the Government is attempting to achieve, and is achieving, through this package of measures of which the Patents Amendment Bill is one part. The second plea I make is the one I made earlier this evening, which is to the Government, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Cabinet in terms of the extension of the research and development tax write-off. It must be extended beyond 1991 for these processes to be fully effective. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Patents Amendment Bill raises some very serious questions about the value and integrity of government granted patents which could have detrimental effects on Australian research and the development of that research by a particular industry. This legislation will deal only with patents relating to pharmaceuticals. Because of the need for Department of Community Services and Health approval and the use of that Department's expertise to investigate patent applications for pharmaceuticals, the mechanisms for dealing with the patents in this industry are the subject of separate legislation. As a general proposition, intellectual property rights involve one of the most difficult areas of law. It is, therefore, all the more a responsibility of government when legislating to consider these matters with the utmost care and to conduct detailed discussions with interested parties before making changes which might affect the property rights of some of the most productive and innovative people in the country. The Government has failed in that obligation with this legislation. It has exacerbated that failure by introducing, without notice as it were, 20 amendments, many of which go to the heart of the already complex legislation. By that means the Opposition is denied the opportunity to fully debate these measures and to consider the amendments to the amending legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation seriously undermines the prior rights of holders of patents by removing rights to extension of a patent granted when a patent was taken out. Its effects are retrospective in that context. The Patents Amendment Bill represents yet another example of the Labor Government seeking to have proposed legislation take effect before it has been considered by Parliament. Labor, under the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), shows complete disregard for parliamentary democracy when it effectively legislates by press release or public announcement prior to the decisions of our legislature, this Parliament. Patents are designed to recognise the rights of the creators of new ideas to the results of their thoughts. Inevitably, any patent legislation represents a compromise between just compensation for those creative efforts and the desire for people and businesses to make use of the knowledge and ideas of others. Traditionally, patents have been granted for a certain period to allow the originator of an idea to gain a return for his or her efforts through the sale of his or her rights or through direct production of the product patented. Such rights should be as inviolate as any rights to property once they have been clearly defined. </PARA>
<PARA> If government were to arbitrarily alter people's rights attaching to the ownership of real property previously acquired, such as land, to reduce the rights in the future, those owners of land would be legitimately outraged. Rights to intellectual property should be treated just as seriously. In this legislation they are not. Presently, people are granted patent rights over 16 years with an entitlement to a possible extension of that term if the circumstances of taking advantage of those rights warrant such an extension. It is those rights to an extension that were a part of the original grant of letters of patent and which this legislation will remove or alter to the detriment of some owners of patent rights over pharmaceutical products. </PARA>
<PARA> I doubt that the Government is doing this with any malice. However, it illustrates a complete disregard for the legitimate claims of patent holders in the light of the Government's designs for patent reform. Reforms might be perfectly reasonable if established in a manner which recognises the pre-existing rights of some people. However, the brushing aside of those rights throws into doubt the entire package of changes. If we can dispose of that basic entitlement by legislating retrospectively, the entire legislation must come under suspicion. The transition from old to new procedures creates problems in a lot of legislation, but this is no excuse for the unholy haste with which the Government wants to see its model imposed on patent holders virtually overnight. </PARA>
<PARA> These criticisms of the Patents Amendment Bill have been made by the Law Council of Australia, on behalf of practitioners in the intellectual property area, and in defence of important legal principles. The transitionary features in this legislation take account of some of the earlier criticisms of the Law Council, but they ignore its most fundamental criticisms. Let me quote some comments made by the Law Council which the Minister blithely dismisses. The Council states:</PARA>
<PARA>There are strong arguments for preservation of the rights of current applicants for patents and patentees. They make their applications under the current Act which provided for extensions. Their side of the bargain was that they would get a sixteen year term and have rights to apply for and obtain an extension through the courts for up to ten years in appropriate circumstances. There is a strong question over the equity and justice of, on the one hand, accepting their publication of their technology and, on the other hand, taking away access to the rights upon which publication of that data was invited. It would therefore be just and equitable to abolish extensions for patents only where the applications for the grant of letter patent are after a certain date following enactment of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>That puts it in a nutshell, as concisely as could reasonably be expected. In other words, the Government had made an arbitrary decision which ignores and overrides the rights of some. There is no attempt to justify this action in the second reading speech of the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones)-and the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) knows that only too well-although the Law Council had raised its concerns about this matter well before the legislation came before the House. The only rationale for the changes is a reference to the majority report of the Industrial Property Advisory Committee entitled Patents, Innovation and Competition in Australia. According to the report, which was accepted by the Government:</PARA>
<PARA>There was no evidence that the social benefits of the extension procedure outweighed its social costs, particularly those arising from the uncertainty faced by competitors who are unsure when rights in patented inventions will terminate. </PARA>
<PARA>Ironically, the major reason the report is concerned at the high social costs of the patent system is that Australia has a heavily protected economy which is highly dependent on foreign investment and imported technologies. That is what the report says. Therefore, the reasoning is that Australia does not benefit much from international patent protection for its few products which are traded internationally. That is strange logic. According to the report, the cost-benefit analysis of the value of patents would have to be changed if Australian industry were more competitive, innovative and likely to secure a large volume of exports. If those things applied, this legislation would not be before us in its present form. The Government has accepted the report and, presumably, it has acted upon it. It should be noted that the judicial procedure for the extension of patent rights recognises those competing interests, referred to in the report, through its adversary procedures which oblige the patent holder to justify any extension, and allow representation for competitors, and allow competitors to mount their arguments in a court. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends to abolish the right to an extension for the holders of rights of patent. This could affect significantly the returns of the originators of those ideas which are the subject of a patent. However, there is a world of difference between announcing a policy for the future to change the conditions of new grants of patent and the approach of the Government, which simply abolishes those rights for people unfortunate enough not to have exercised such rights already. Pharmaceuticals and some other intellectual products present particular problems-which the Government has acknowledged-because of the long regulatory procedures which reduce the time during which a person or firm can benefit from a patent. </PARA>
<PARA> The length of these procedures is in itself a scandal and it has denied Australians access to proven technology for a number of years beyond the time necessary for purely safety and health reasons. The Government is willing to give standard extensions of four years to allow for regulatory delays in benefiting from the patent. Court proceedings for an extension are to be replaced by administrative approval, in the first instance, by the Commissioner of Patents. There is a contradiction between the Minister's professed concern for competition in the production of patented ideas and the new procedures for extension, which do not allow for opposition to extension through judicial procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that the benefits conferred on the holders of patents need not be all that great. It is up to the patent holder, and the entrepreneurial ability of those who exploit the patent, to make the most of the protection which a patent can give for a certain time. In the event, most patents do not even last the full seven years open in relation to them. The development of new technology and an inability to get products to the stage of profitable production mean that many patents are not renewed annually. </PARA>
<PARA> In return for the disclosure of the idea or design to be patented, the patentee gains the right to take legal action against those who breach the rights of a patentee. The enforcement of patents is a legal question which, as we all know, can involve very difficult problems. It costs the patent holder to protect his or her rights through the courts. This is not a burden on the taxpayer; nor are the existing rights to extension, which this Bill will remove. </PARA>
<PARA> A major feature of these changes is that they are retrospective in their effects. The Labor Party-a party beholden to envy about wealth acquired in the past-either has failed to grasp the dangers of retrospectivity or has endorsed retrospective legislation with open arms. Perhaps we might consider the evil of retrospective legislation before demonstrating how that aspect creeps into this legislation. There are a number of principles on which legislation from the Executive arm of government must be based. The display of documents about the Bill of Rights of 1689, presently on show in the public areas of this building, illustrates how some of those limits on the Executive emerged. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement that people should be able to know what the law is, so that they can conduct their affairs within the bounds of the law, has equally ancient origins. Of course, people cannot ensure that they act within the law if the existing law can be changed at whim by actions of a future government to make today's Act illegal and/or bring about loss, damage or penalty. When a retrospective law does not outlaw or prohibit certain conduct but affects it in some other way so as to alter the consequences of people's actions, people will do things which they might not otherwise have done if they had the knowledge of what the law was going to be. They get no chance to modify their behaviour before they find that they are in breach of the law or subject to penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> When retrospective law can influence decisions on the market, people lose all incentive to take action which might secure long-term benefit to themselves or the country. Retrospectivity reduces people's horizons to immediate benefits to be enjoyed before governments can take those benefits away. The Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, has wholeheartedly endorsed the use of retrospectivity to protect the public revenue from the consequences of the sloppy laws which this Government has foisted on Australian businesses and on individual taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh argues that the threat of retrospective laws will be a disincentive for people to act in ways which may be outlawed in the future. What Senator Walsh does not seem to realise is that such retrospectivity acts as a disincentive for all actions, whether beneficial or not-whether beneficial to this country, to our productivity, to our balance of payments, which, Lord knows, is sick enough, or to the individual himself. One cannot count on the benevolence of government in the future, particularly when the record of this Labor Government is so inconsistent on matters of regulation, investment, taxation and the rights of longstanding professional privilege. </PARA>
<PARA> Retrospective law infringes the most basic rights of people against government and stifles any healthy inclination to take risks and to engage in entrepreneurial activities. This legislation does not consciously evoke retrospectivity, but since it deals with rights which take effect over time and changes those rights it will be retrospective, unless it allows all existing rights to be upheld. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation does not respect existing patent rights. It will terminate the right for an extension of a pharmaceutical patent, and that will be from the date when this Bill was introduced into the House. To eliminate that retrospectivity all existing holders of patents granted before this Bill becomes law should have the opportunity to exercise the right to obtain judicially approved extensions which they received with the initial grant of patent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, has dismissed this legitimate procedure in relation to the introduction of the legislation because it would delay the complete implementation of these reforms for as long as 16 years. Senator Button's reformist zeal and impatience will see the rights of, admittedly, a fairly small group of innovators ignored by a procedure which is unnecessary and which might well have unforeseen consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet again, we have before us an example of the legislative incompetence of the Hawke-Keating Government, which without any attempt to justify its actions will bulldoze through the House a sloppy Bill which takes the lazy route of retrospectivity-where proper consultation and a bit of thought could have produced a more acceptable procedure. We know what will happen: as sure as night follows day, in three or four weeks time we will have to consider amendments that have come to this House from the Senate. As sure as night follows day, we will have to further consider this legislation-just as was the case with other legislation today. This will also occur with the Government's tax amendment Bill, although Lord knows when that will be introduced. That Bill has been sitting around for five or six months now. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot legislate; it gets itself into an unholy mess. Part of the problem involves this technique of legislation by press release, of announcing an intention, and saying that the proposed legislation is to apply from the date of that announcement. However, the Government cannot then get its act together, get the legislation into this place and passed in a timely way. That is why we are getting all these amendments from the Senate, As I have said before, thank God for the Senate. If it were not for the Senate, the legislative mess that we have witnessed tonight would be repeated day after day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been outlined by previous speakers, this Patents Amendment Bill will repeal the present complex judicial procedure for the extension of the normal 16-year term of a patent and replace it with a simpler administrative procedure. The new procedure will enable four-year extension, but only for patents for pharmaceuticals which are for human use and which are subject to the marketing approval of the Department of Community Services and Health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The present judicial procedure is available for all patents, whether they relate to pharmaceuticals or other things. An extension of up to five years, or 10 years in exceptional cases, can be granted by a court on the ground that the patentee has been inadequately remunerated by the patent. But this proof through the courts has always been long and complex and, by its long and complex nature, a costly procedure. The court's decision might not be handed down for several years, leaving anyone in a state of uncertainty about the status of the patents. </PARA>
<PARA> I join my colleague the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) in speaking particularly to those changes that are being made as a result of this legislation to the use of pharmaceuticals by humans. The honourable member for Newcastle referred to a working group of members of the Government Caucus who, in 1986 and 1987, looked, in particular, into a report of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) on pharmaceutical products. The interesting thing about the nature of this working group's work was that it saw people from different policy interests from those of Government backbenchers in sitting down and talking matters through with Ministers. Of course, when one looks at the pharmaceuticals industry one must recognise the way in which it has been well and truly controlled by the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). The pharmaceutical benefits scheme is administered by the Department of Community Services and Health, whereas the industry portfolios have direct consideration for industry development. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the pharmaceutical industry in Australia we will note that it is dominated by overseas companies. Many of the operations that are here might be considered as simply branch office manufacturing operations. It also has to be recognised that Australia has a very high level and a very high quality of research in the pharmaceutical area. It was with those sorts of interests in mind that the Government set about trying to come to grips with the best ways in which, arising from the IAC report, we could best do things that might be of assistance to the industry but, in particular, not damage the interests of the consumers and the public health interests of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that it is important to reflect on what the IAC had to say about the nature of this industry compared to other industries and the way in which it handled its inquiry. The IAC was primarily interested in tariffs and direct financial assistance to industry. It noted that the form of government intervention in the pharmaceutical industry, because of its basis on the consumer and social policy objectives, was quite different from that in other industries. I think that that is even reflected now in this legislation in the way in which we are going to handle patents for pharmaceutical substances. That is important. The IAC report said:</PARA>
<PARA>Because Government actions in this industry are primarily motivated by concern for consumers, proposals for change must take account of this continuing concern. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the proposals that were announced in September 1987 had that concern as their basis. But it should also be recognised, as outlined in the joint media release of that time, that:</PARA>
<PARA>The objective was to create an environment which would encourage a significant increase in research and development performance by the industry together with increased investment, production and export performance, and strengthened employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>The media release went on to say that the three most important elements of the strategy were:</PARA>
<PARA>to replace the then Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Bureau with an independent Authority;</PARA>
<PARA>to require the Authority to take into account the level of an individual company's Australian pharmaceutical activity when setting or making recommendations on prices; and</PARA>
<PARA>to provide for extensions to patent life on pharmaceuticals for human use. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that third point is now being addressed in this legislation. Honourable members should be aware that the Parliament has received the first annual report of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority. That indicates the work the Authority has done in its infancy and the way that it has worked up the requirements it was set in place to look at. We then have to look at the way the Government set out in the pricing arena guidelines which this Authority had to take into account. The major difference between the guidelines that were used by the previous Bureau and those of the new Authority was the so-called factor (f), well known in the pharmaceutical industry. Factor (f) is one of the requirements that the Authority had to take into account when setting prices. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> the level of activity being undertaken by the company in Australia including new investment, production and research and development where the activity is directed towards international competitiveness. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is important because it is characteristic of the way that this Government has set out across a number of industries to try to encourage that international competitiveness, being able to have locally based industries in a position where they are able to compete for export markets or for import replacement markets. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a scenario in the background of where we are at present. Some companies have already taken the opportunity that has been presented to them by those pricing guidelines. We should again refer to Glaxo Australia Pty Ltd. Glaxo Australia will receive approximately $74m because of the increased pricing arrangements. It is expected to invest $55m in new production facilities and $33m in research and development. At the end point it is expected to increase its exports to a total of $352m over a five-year period. That is the first but it is not expected to be the last. Merck Sharp and Dohme (Australia) Pty Ltd has indicated that it has an ability to increase its exports from $9m in 1987 to $61m in 1992. Already we can see some movement and some improvement in the performance of some of the major players in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the pharmaceutical industry we should perhaps reflect on its importance in the overall nature of things. It is an industry that employs well over 7,000 people. There is a local investment in the order of $800m. Annual value added is in the order of $500m. It is not an industry which is not worthy of consideration and support. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme on some occasions has been seen as perhaps a bit of a bugbear by that industry. The PBS, as it is more commonly known, has been very successful in being able to keep the price of drugs to government to a minimum. When we compare our prices with overseas prices the PBS has been very successful. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HH4">Mr JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been very much a captive market in that the major player is the government through the pricing arrangements. The honourable member for Gippsland, by way of interjection in his normal display of hobbledehoy type behaviour, asks: `What about the chemists?'. I was going to get to the chemists later, but perhaps we should look at some aspects of the performance of pharmacists in the way that they have used different initiatives that have come about, especially in the generic area, to try to get consumers to come on side with other considerations that are important to them, considerations of remuneration. I want to mention the current generic furore. It is quite unfair that consumers are being subjected to this type of misinformation about what is actually happening in the generic area when the real reason for that is that pharmacists at a different level and in a different arena have some gripes with the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one looks at the way in which generics are used overseas one really wonders why we are in this present debate. Generic drugs are out of patent drugs but are of similar bio-equivalence. That is important. If we look at the situation overseas we see that in the United Kingdom generics account for some 30 per cent of prescription drugs dispensed. In the United States, where substitution is encouraged and consumer awareness is high, generic drugs account for more than 50 per cent of all new prescriptions dispensed. Yet outside the hospital situation, the generic market in Australia is less than 5 per cent of the total market. It is important to remember that many patients would not perhaps realise that because of the way drugs are tendered for by hospitals, those hospitals are into the generic market. It is important to keep that in perspective when we have these discussions about what information should be given out to different people. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to the document that the Consumer Health Forum of Australia recently released entitled Towards a National Medicinal Drug Policy. It makes interesting reading for anybody who has some interest in pharmaceuticals and prescriptive drugs. In a section about generic prescribing, that document cites work that indicates that studies of antibiotics prescribed in family practices in the United States showed that of the top five antibiotics, 86 per cent were prescribed generically. I cannot understand why in the present debate there are some fear and smear campaigns about generic drugs when the overseas situation indicates that they are widely used. When we are looking at a client base that is open to suggestion, it is important to remember that pharmacists need to be fair. Already the Government has recognised the need to embark upon a consumer education program to ensure that people do not have this misapprehension about the use of generic drugs. We have seen the Opposition's resurrected Waste Watch Committee criticising some of the uses that have been made of different public relations gimmicks that abound in the pharmaceutical industry. Because we, as a government, use them to ensure that our message gets across we are being criticised. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the legislation before us, I think it is important to recognise the opportunities that are being given to those companies that are holders of the patents, those companies that are now being given the opportunity to use them for an additional four years. This is a compromise; it allows those companies that wish to embark upon generic manufacture to enter that field. They are allowed one year to set themselves up without going into the marketing of the drugs. That again is creating another employment opportunity for people in the industry. It is important that we see this as part of an overall package and that for the sake of discussion we do not just isolate different aspects of it and come up with criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> I have noted that both the honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) have spoken about the timetable of the legislation and the amendments. I note that the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) challenged the honourable member for Gippsland to produce the amendments in this place. The way in which the honourable member for Curtin criticised the Government for not giving enough lead time was a bit unfair, considering that we, in this place, are not presented with the definitive amendments that are to be put forward by the coalition in the Senate. I think that is a very strange aspect of the way in which the Opposition has treated this matter. All the evidence is that because of the length of time that has been allowed the different industry groups have had plenty of time to consult with the Government on this. I think that is important. The time has been used to get complete consultation on the different aspects and fine tuning of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-This has been a very interesting debate and I thank honourable members for their contributions. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) called for a new inquiry into the patent system. He questioned whether a patent system was in Australia's interests and suggested that we could learn from Canada. Canada has recently amended its patent law to remove at least some, perhaps many, of the features which seem to attract the honourable member. Moreover, serious international consideration is being given in the current Uruguay Round of multinational trade negotiations to trade related aspects of intellectual property. It is clear that the outcome of the Uruguay Round is likely to be a requirement for stronger patent systems of the 20-year model, rather than the weaker ones that-and I hope I am not misrepresenting the honourable member's views-the honourable member thought might benefit Australia. Perhaps he was suggesting that we should not have a system. If so, this would certainly put Australia in a unique position among developed countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that there is a great deal of controversy about the importance of the patent system. There is a wide diversity of opinion. Some say that patents are virtually irrelevant and that it is a technological advantage that confers economic advantage, not the possession of a piece of paper. Some would argue that if Boeing abandoned every patent it holds on a 747 no company would be in a position to create a 747 look-alike. Despite the Chakrabarty case very few developments in biotechnology have been patented. In other words, it is not the possession of a piece of paper that says companies have a right; it is the possession of the individuals and the technological capacity to do it. At the other extreme some authorities see the patent procedures as absolutely critical, central not only to development but also to creativity and invention and that longer terms are essential. The Law Council of Australia wants a 20-year term. This interesting diversity of opinion was actually reflected in a very clear-cut way by the response of the Opposition tonight. I am sorry the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) was not here because his view would have been interesting as well. We had two views put forward. Perhaps if he had been here we would have had three views put. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gippsland wanted an aggressive inquiry designed to keep out the nasty foreigners from Australian patents. He did not have much thought for Australian exporters who need the patents abroad to assist their marketing position. The honourable member for Curtin wanted everybody's patent rights bolstered indefinitely into the future. No doubt the aggressive inquiry to be led by the Opposition would both diminish and bolster patent rights at the same time. Like the ouroboros its head would end up eating its own tail and it might be very surprised at the taste. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gippsland invited me to comment on the Government's handling of the Patents Amendment Bill. He gave a string of dates which, as the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) pointed out, seemed to be confused and confusing. There was perhaps more than a touch of clairvoyance, but not as to the Opposition's foreshadowed amendments which we are yet to see. It is correct that this Bill was first introduced on 3 June 1988. It lay on the table, which allowed it to be looked at in a fair and equitable basis by all whose interests could be affected. It was exactly the same procedure that we took with the recent Customs legislation. I think that most people are happy with the outcome, particularly pharmaceutical manufacturers, the patent attorneys, lawyers and other people in the patent system, quite apart from the consumers. But the honourable member for Gippsland wanted to know why it had all taken so long. It certainly took many months before views were finally put forward by all the interest groups. It really was not until December that we had the final considered views. That gave a basis for the development of the amendments which it seems the Opposition supports and which we will deal with in a few minutes. The Opposition wants further amendments and I will return to those in a moment. With respect to the Government's handling of the Bill I wish to say that we have taken account of the representations made, even if we have not accepted them all. There seems to have been some confusion about the release of the new amendments and the associated explanatory memorandum. If the honourable member for Gippsland were to check, he might find that the papers were available from the Bills and Papers Office at least a couple of days before he seemed to have obtained them for his office. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gippsland questioned the efficiency of the patent system in stimulating innovation. He referred to Professor Don Lamberton's dissenting statement appended to the report of the Industrial Property Advisory Committee (IPAC) which reviewed the Australian patent system. He suggested a 10-year patent without the possibility of extension. I am a great admirer of Don Lamberton. I put him on the committee and I think he is an innovative thinker. He is not the only economist to take that view but, as far as patents are concerned, he is not in the majority, either. Economists have been arguing about the effects of the patent system for at least a century. Lamberton's arguments are not new and neither are those of the honourable member. </PARA>
<PARA> In a long report which took two years to produce, Professor Lamberton and his co-authors examined the social costs and benefits of the patent system and concluded that the result was ultimately a matter `for judgment'. The report went on to assert that the costs exceeded the benefits, but other economists have come up with other conclusions. The inconclusive debate among economists is one of the reasons why IPAC's report is very valuable. As I said in my tabling statement when announcing the Government's response to the report-which was quite some time ago-its emphasis is on the possible. The report is constructive rather than revolutionary. Economists and others may continue with inconclusive arguments, but the Government wanted to make constructive changes to improve the system. We thought that the IPAC report was a valuable basis for this. There is no doubt that Australian industry wants a strong patent system. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill relates to only one of IPAC's recommendations. Many of the remainder of the Government's responses to the report will be dealt with in a redrafted Patents Act. The drafting of that legislation has had to take its place in the queue along with other legislation which has a higher priority. The Government wanted to proceed with the patent term issue because of its importance as an element of its policy package to encourage the development of the pharmaceutical products industry in Australia. Several of IPAC's recommendations have already been implemented administratively. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also questioned the omission from the scope of the Bill of other products which are subject to marketing regulation, such as telecommunications equipment and agricultural and veterinary chemicals. Pharmaceuticals alone are subject to both Commonwealth regulation of marketing and special pricing arrangements under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin showed touching concern for people who want to keep using the current judicial extension procedure, at least until some time in the future. He said the absence of this would stifle entrepreneurial activity by patentees. He said that the 3 June 1988 cut-off date for the old procedure was retrospective. This is a puzzling assertion. The Government's response to IPAC's report was announced in November 1986. Our policy on patent term for pharmaceuticals was announced in September 1987. The Bill to implement this policy was introduced in June 1988. That is not what I understand by the term `retrospectivity'. Entrepreneurs who had an eye to the main chance, read the literature or were aware from their own organisations of what was happening, would find it very difficult suddenly to say, `We were walloped on the back of the head. This retrospective legislation came out and we had no idea what was going on'. If entrepreneurs had had any kind of regard for what the Government was doing from November 1986, they would have had a very clear idea of precisely what was happening. That is not anyone's idea of what is meant by retrospectivity. One has to ask what these entrepreneurs were doing between November 1986 and June 1988. What were they doing between September 1987 and June 1988?</PARA>
<PARA> It is even more puzzling that the honourable member sees this as government by press release. If I did not like the honourable member for Curtin so much I might say I deeply resent it, but I do not think that I can quite bring myself to say that. I have never been a great advocate of government by press release and I am not very keen on the idea of putting out a press release and then saying, `We are committed; we cannot make ourselves look bad and we have to bring in legislation to fit in with the press release'. The introduction marked the Government's legislative intentions in relation to a policy announced a long time before hand. The opportunity to seek an extension under the present judicial procedures is not a right. The honourable member for Curtin spoke as if patenting is a kind of natural right, like the right to breathe. It is not; it is a very artificial right created by statute. It provides a right whereas, in nature, that right would not occur. It is the same with copyright and other similar matters. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no guarantee in the legislation that the opportunity will go on forever-and I do not think that there should be any such guarantee. Anyone who wanted to take advantage of the opportunity, who was really serious about it, could have done so and could have initiated action between November 1986 and June 1988. So the 3 June cut-off date simply rules out speculative applications. However, people with a serious concern about the matter would have done something between 1986 and 1988. To prolong the cut-off into the future would provide a major benefit for lawyers who could argue the pros and cons of the present complex criteria ad nauseam in long court cases, but I do not believe that this would be in the public interest and I do not think it would be in the interests of the industry. I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate and wish the Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA>There are 20 amendments which have been circulated. Some of them are quite small and simply incorporate changes in numbering and some minor technical changes. Essentially, the drift of the amendments is to clarify and simplify the procedures contained in the Bill by which extensions of patent term for pharmaceutical substances will be obtained. In particular, the amendments will ensure that the patent extension will cover all patents pharmaceuticals which receive marketing approval from the Department of Community Services and Health, whether or not they are imported or have previously been approved, in some other form or formulation, including antibiotics, anti-virals and anti-toxins. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will enable the patentee to enable an extension for all pharmaceutical substances claimed on a particular patent, provided that marketing approval is obtained for one of those substances, notwithstanding that the marketing approval granted may be restricted to a particular product or formulation containing the substance. I think the amendments simplify the legislation and make it a good deal clearer. The Government desires to make the legislation workable and will look with interest at the amendments to be moved by the Opposition in the other place. I look forward to the support of the Opposition for these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend to the House the following extract from an informed and intuitive editorial in the Brisbane Sunday Mail on 30 April. I am delighted to see the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) in the House this evening. The editorial is titled `Where are the sentries?' and comments on the parlous state of our Defence Force. In my view, it is an accurate assessment of the present sorry state of affairs. I quote from the article:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Australia, as we keep reminding ourselves, is a fortunate nation indeed. It is a place not only difficult to attack-in the conventional way, through armed incursion or invasion-but an unlikely target in all but the worst circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the conventional wisdom, a wisdom that has been so entrenched in our defence policy for so long that we have come to believe in it as the rock upon which all our defence can be securely mounted: we are a castle, surrounded by a very big moat. </PARA>
<PARA> And so we are, within limited parameters. The limits consist of geography (the only constant in the equation, but no less subject to revision through technology or politics); contemporary absence of an enemy power with reason or will to invest time, effort and lives in an Australian adventure; and our own unwillingness to man the parapets. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the last of those elements which is the most crucial key. It is also the one on which we are failing dismally. </PARA>
<PARA> The brain-and-brawn drain from the Defence Force-all three arms-is substantial and increasing. Servicemen and women, whose position is by no means as privileged as some outsiders believe and as some politicians like to pretend, are leaving in droves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government talks up defence. But it winds it down in budget debate, and now plans to bring the service community further into the web of Mr Keating's expanding tax base. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor, in short, is a principal cause behind the absence of sentries on the parapets, Mr Beazley's good offices notwithstanding. We have first-class personnel, keen minds, some good equipment: but, frankly, not enough of all three commodities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Navy, despite the submarines and the PR hype, is a coastal patrol and protection force. Where is the striking power? Where is its air defence out of range of land-based fighters?</PARA>
<PARA> The Army is making a good fist of its newly-defined role of continental defence, as Exercise Kangaroo 89 should demonstrate in the north in August. But its field force is compromised by the need to man new tasks on the Iran-Iraq border and in Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Air Force has powerful weapons in the Orion squadrons, the F-111 squadrons, and the new F/A-18 fighter squadrons. But it is short of pilots, skilled people for whom the civil airlines provide careers with benefits they cannot hope to obtain in the RAAF. Pilots, not planes, are the crucial asset in any air force. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence, as a department and as a concept, has been outmanoeuvred by the federal public service, which is more concerned with featherbedding itself and its philosophical allies than with providing Australia with proper protection.</PARA>
<PARA>I look forward to positive responses from the two responsible Ministers later this month on the commendably bipartisan recommendations of last year's joint committee report on personnel wastage in the Defence Force. We need more than a Minister who was recently rolled in Cabinet and who is desperately trying to stretch out the lowest allocation of gross domestic product to defence in 40 years. We need more than open skies without adequate surveillance or response. We need more than an increasingly brown water Navy. We need more than a ground force that would have difficulty deploying and sustaining more than a battalion group in any realistic contingency situation. A credible defence effort, in particular its personnel ramifications, cannot and must not be pushed into the too hard basket. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak tonight on an issue which is very close to my heart. Before I do so, I put it against a background in this session of Parliament where we have had continuous attacks from the Opposition, both in this House and in the other House, on the Aboriginal people of Australia, who are a very proud race. I feel that what we have heard in this House has given the impression to the world at large that something is radically wrong with the Aboriginal people and communities of Australia. I want to set the record straight as much as I can in this small regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to praise the Aboriginal Islander Dance Theatre and the person responsible for its creation, Carole Johnson. This dance troupe mixes modern styles with a tradition of tribal dance. It had its genesis in 1972 when Carole Johnson, a graduate of New York's famous Juliard School of Music, visited Australia to perform at the Adelaide Arts Festival. Whilst in Australia, she was approached by some Aboriginal dancers asking if she could assist them with their careers. She agreed to conduct some dance workshops in Redfern. The workshops had an immediate impact, because Aboriginals were able to see dance as a vehicle for social comment and as a way of changing social images and attitudes. There is a real need for that in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975 she returned to settle in Australia where she helped to found the Aboriginal Islander Dance Theatre. It was Australia's first Aboriginal dance company. The school was set up in a rundown church hall in Glebe. There were no showers, the dressing room was a renovated closet, and the rehearsal hall was so small that the dancers practised, when weather permitted, in a nearby park. The school trains 35 Aboriginal students at any one time. They come from all parts of the continent and include students from the Torres Strait. In a five-year diploma course, the students cover not only traditional tribal dance but also tap, jazz and afro. They are sent regularly to outback tribal communities to learn Aboriginal dance first-hand and to gain experience of life in remote communities. </PARA>
<PARA> The troupe has toured Australia receiving enthusiastic reviews. It has also gained international recognition and has toured successfully in West Germany, Finland, Canada and the United States. These dancers have had a positive role in changing white perceptions of Aboriginals where they have performed. As Carole Johnson states in a recent article in the Christian Science Monitor:</PARA>
<PARA>Black Australians get a generally bad press and their culture has never been taught much in schools. But just seeing these young Aboriginals performing at a high standard to world acclaim makes white Australians re-examine their attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to say that another result of the troupe is a new form of dance, which is Aboriginal traditional dance and modern techniques. It is an exciting dance form. I urge honourable members on both sides of the House to see this company when they have the opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity of speaking in the adjournment debate tonight, largely because the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) is at the table. I have a matter I would very much like him to take on board. It is of peculiar reference to my district and is a matter which I have noted is already starting to occasion the interest of some in the media. It concerns the disposal, as I understand it, by the Department of Defence of 100-odd tanks. I understand that tenders were called for the disposal of those tanks fairly recently. To date, we do not know what decision the Government has made in relation to them, but there are rumours abroad that the Government's decision will be that all the tanks should be disposed of as a job lot for scrap. Whilst that might well be the best approach from the point of view of obtaining immediate financial benefit for government, I understand that there have been a number of expressions of interest in relation to a number of the tanks by particular museums and other organisations that have, in the past, used mounted or motorised methods of engagement and tanks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One organisation that operates within my district is the First 15th Royal New South Wales Lancers. It has a museum associated with its barracks in Parramatta. As part of that museum it has a number of motorised vehicles that the Lancers have used at various times. Of course, they also used the tanks. One factor is that they have a tank which has largely been gutted, which is largely irrelevant for display purposes, but which they cannot arrange to swap for a decent one. It would probably be every bit as good for scrap in terms of what a scrap merchant might get out of it; but the difficulty they have is that, notwithstanding inquiries I have made from time to time, nobody seems to want to talk to them about how the First 15th Royal New South Wales Lancers can be granted one of these tanks for their museum without their having to deal with a scrap merchant, who might well want to try to extort some $20,000 or $30,000 from them, to acquire a vehicle that would otherwise be scrapped. </PARA>
<PARA> I find the Government's inability to communicate on this matter disappointing. The fob-off I receive-I regard it as a fob-off when I am told that the matter is still being considered and when there are rumours abounding that one tenderer is likely to obtain all of the vehicles-is most unsatisfactory. I hope that the Minister, as evidence of his interest in these matters and particularly the widespread interest that I know exists amongst the large number of volunteers who have been part of the First 15th Royal New South Wales Lancers in the past and those who presently support the regiment as part of our Reserve, will take this matter up. If he is not directly responsible for it, I hope that he will be able to intercede with the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). </PARA>
<PARA> From the interest that I have ascertained exists, if the Government is mindful of making a decision in the next few days or weeks that it will dispose of all of these tanks as a job lot, I can assure him that it will be on its head. There is a good deal of interest in this matter. I understand that a large number of people and organisations have expressed similar interest to that of the Lancers. Without being altogether judgmental about these matters, I must say that the First 15th Royal New South Wales Lancers, having a very satisfactory museum with all the other examples of vehicles that they have used and with a mounted detachment which they present from time to time, certainly need a tank to complete their museum. I certainly hope that the Government will respond to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recently had the pleasure of opening the fourth annual Jamberoo Valley folk festival. This gave me pleasure on a number of counts. The most obvious ones were that, firstly, I happen to be a resident of the Jamberoo Valley and, secondly, I am the patron of the Illawarra Folk Club, the organisation that staged the festival. Apart from these personal considerations, the most impressive features were the large numbers of people who attended the two-day festival and the quality of the number of artists who performed there. Over the weekend several thousand people descended on our village of Jamberoo, the normal population of which is 400. Some stayed the weekend, while some came just for specific events. The local community of Jamberoo entered into the spirit of the weekend, with the parents and citizens association, the youth hall committee and local artists and potters contributing. The artists included John Williamson, Bandy Bill and Co from Inverell, a visiting scottish group, Rua, Aboriginal singer-songwriter Kevin Carmody, Gary Shearston, John Dengate, John Broomhall and many performers from both the Illawarra and the rest of New South Wales and Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point to be made about folk festivals is that, unlike other types of musical events such as opera, rock or country, they are multi-faceted. Whereas these strands of our culture tend to be monodirectional-and I do not decry them in any way-their prime function is to entertain and display the expertise of the performers. On the other hand, as well as entertainment, folk festivals are about preserving our culture, about examining our past, about commenting on our present, and about recording a heritage that may not be based on monotonous mindlessness that one frequently picks up on commercial electronic media. This festival was no different in that it had workshops examining the language-`Keep the language alive and unique' was the cry of John Dengate and his workshop-Margaret Walters and Margaret Bradford looked at the roll of colonial women in song, Kevin Carmody looked at Aboriginal songwriting, Denis Kevans used verse to record contemporary social and political fables and Michael O'Sullivan taught us that anyone could be a songwriter. There were also the yarn spinners, the colonial dancers, the musicians, the songwriters, the instrument makers, the activities for the kids, the concerts and the Morris and Irish dancers and, most importantly, the audiences. </PARA>
<PARA> That so many people attended the festival was a credit to the organisers. It also showed that a large number of members of the public enjoy the cultural exchanges, the thought provoking songs and music that has not been siphoned through an electronic desk to the extent that the human being who creates the sound becomes secondary to the technology that blasts it out. People came despite the fact that folk music and life is largely ignored by the commercial media, whose rigid programming and reliance on computer printouts of rating surveys have left us with a monotonous and mindless uniformity that ignores the rich living culture that is being developed in Australia. I have been saddened to see the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) program That's Australia moved from a prime Saturday night slot to a late Wednesday night slot. It has been the only folk program on television for the last 15 years. I am heartened, however, by the success of Ian Macnamara's Australia All Over on Sunday morning, on which I heard you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Those of us with electorates outside the metropolitan area would be aware of the immense following this program has attracted. </PARA>
<PARA> While on the subject of the ABC, I congratulate our local radio station 2WN and its progressive and committed manager, Allen Clark. The success of Jamberoo was due in no small part to the promotion of folk music-particularly local folk music-by radio 2WN. I would add that 2WN under Allen Clark has fostered not only folk music but all local musical, cultural, social and political activities. It has become a true local station. Despite its limited resources, it is, I believe, a model for others to follow. Largely due to Allen's exertions, the festival was broadcast live on Friday night to all regional stations in New South Wales-a feat of programming and technology, the complexity of which few of us lay persons can comprehend. I have had many complimentary comments from members of this House about the program. They had received favourable comments from their constituents who had heard the live broadcasts. David Mulholland, from Radio National's On the wallaby track', made use of the ABC's outside broadcasting van during the weekend. He has recorded many of the events for future airplay on that excellent program. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole festival was conducted without large scale financial assistance from any government agency or private sponsor. There was no bowing to the political whims of commercial sponsors; nor was the festival subject to the bureaucratic scrutiny that is a requirement of government assistance. To conclude, I would like to say that I am proud to have such an event flourishing in the heartland of my electorate. It is a reminder that not all Australians are slaves to the imported culture--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before raising the issue that I want to talk about tonight, I point out to the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) that, while the Australian Broadcasting Corporation does some things very well, it is unfortunate that many people in the country-I receive many complaints about this-can no longer hear Parliament on the radio. Despite various undertakings by the Government over a number of months, still nothing is being done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I want to speak about recognition of an event that occurred some time ago. In the Vietnam war nearly 500 Australians gave their lives, but until recently those people had never been given any recognition and those who returned had never been given the reception that we have given to other people who served their country overseas. However, the Vietnam veterans served their country with as much distinction as any Australians in any theatre of war. It is pleasing, I guess in one way, that at long last some recognition is being given to these veterans. On 21 April I had the great pleasure to attend the first screening of a film in Portland. That film, The Long Road Home, produced in Portland, depicts not only some aspects of the Vietnam war but, more importantly, the reaction of those who served, both before they went to the war and since their return. It was a very moving experience which made one realise that the people who went to that war did so in good faith because they believed they were serving their country. They were not looking for any reward, but I am sure they were not expecting to find most Australians turning their backs on them when they returned. It was a very bitter pill for them to swallow and one that they found very difficult to adjust to when they returned. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very touched by this film, but it was also very interesting to see the reaction of the people in the film because they were also present at the screening. They were the ones who returned, albeit with some scars-both external and internal. The four men in particular who were interviewed in the film were Jim Murrell, Dave Cleary, Daryl McCombe and Selwyn Williams. Each one told his story and gave a very moving and realistic expression of how he was affected and how he had managed to readjust. In many ways, anyone who saw that film could not help feeling ashamed at the way that we have treated those servicemen since their return from that war. </PARA>
<PARA> This film, The Long Road Home, produced by Peter Corbett, is the right length for television but, regrettably, to date Australian television stations have shown little interest. However, it is being shown at the Cannes Film Festival this month and, hopefully, the film will gain the recognition that I believe it more than justly deserves because it captures the attitude of those real people who have come back and found what it is like to try to readjust. They happened to be called up and sent overseas to serve their country in a war in which they did not want to be involved but, nonetheless, they were prepared to do their duty. Naturally enough, the disappointment must have been immense when they returned home to find that Australia no longer wanted to know them. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the time has come for recognition. To date, I believe that the Government's efforts have been fairly miserable. I was pleased to note that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has announced that the Government will put forward $200,000 for a memorial. It has been planned to erect a memorial in Canberra for the Vietnam servicemen, particularly the 500 who gave their lives. The memorial will cost considerably more than $200,000, so I call on the Government to be a little bit more generous in belatedly recognising that these Australians served their country with as much distinction, valour and commitment as any Australian who has served overseas. I believe that their cause certainly deserves due recognition in a proper memorial in Canberra. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members will be interested to know that this week Canberra is the venue for a major sporting event-that is, the annual meeting of the Ladies Golf Union. About 500 female golfers from throughout Australia-but mostly from the State of New South Wales-have come to Canberra to enjoy not only the golf courses but also the scenery and the lifestyle which Canberra offers. As I have pointed out, this is an annual event which each year usually attracts tremendous support from women golfers throughout Australia. The event has been played in Canberra over a number of decades. Throughout that period the women have had access to the four Canberra golf courses throughout the week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, this year we have run into a little bit of a problem. Apparently, the male golfers of the Canberra district have taken some umbrage at the courses being invaded on Wednesday by their female counterparts-I know that Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons), who is at the table, is absolutely outraged at this, and rightly so-and have refused to give way and allow their female counterparts the use of the four Canberra golf courses on that day. I know that this has caused great concern. In fact, a deputation of female golfers bailed up the Government Whip, the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham), who is no mean golfer himself, and demanded that the case be put quite clearly that they are being discriminated against. They say that they are only asking for the use of the courses for only one week and that it is not fair that the establishment-the male golfers of Canberra-should deny them this privilege. I am delighted that a number of the female golfers are in the gallery tonight to demonstrate their concern about this occurrence. </PARA>
<PARA> The tournament involves both singles and fours competitions. Last night I had the good fortune to see some of the trophies which will be handed out. I imagine that the competition will be extremely keen because the trophies are worth winning and extremely valuable. No doubt the competition will be incredibly fierce. Unfortunately, the competition will be somewhat curtailed as a result of Wednesday being deleted from the program. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, I have no doubt that the remainder of the program for the Ladies Golf Union will be a success. It is unfortunate that we have had this problem in relation to Wednesday. I have no doubt that under the good guidance of the honourable member for McMillan, and the few other notable golfers that we have in Government ranks, the whole tournament will be successful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Dobell interjects that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has been known to play the odd game of golf. I know that the Prime Minister would not begrudge giving up one day's golf so that women golfers throughout Australia can enjoy the facilities in Canberra. I hope that the golf establishment in Canberra will not make this an annual occurrence and that when the Ladies Golf Union comes back to Canberra next year the whole week will be dedicated to this most worthwhile tournament.</PARA></TALK.START>
