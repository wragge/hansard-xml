<PARA> That the House of Representatives expresses its deep regret at the death on Monday, 9 October 1989 of Sir Alan Shallcross Hulme, KBE, member of the House of Representatives for the division of Petrie from 1949 to 1961, and from 1963 to 1972, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Alan Hulme was born on 14 February 1907 at Mosman, New South Wales. He was one of the founders of the Liberal Party and entered Parliament in 1949, representing the division of Petrie. Apart from the period from 1961 to 1963, he remained the member for Petrie until his retirement in 1972. He served under five Prime Ministers. He was Minister for Supply from 1958 to 1961, and Postmaster-General from 1963 to 1972. He was Vice-President of the Executive Council from 1966 to 1972, and the Minister administering the Department of the Vice-President of the Executive Council from March to May of 1971. </PARA>
<PARA> During his time in the House, Sir Alan served on numerous parliamentary committees and was Chairman of the Commonwealth Immigration Planning Council from 1956 to 1958. He served his Party with distinction, and was President of the Liberal Party in Queensland from 1946 to 1949 and from 1962 to 1963. Alan Hulme was appointed Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in January 1971. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated, Sir Alan held many ministerial offices over a long period of time. He served in the office of Postmaster-General with distinction. I followed him in that office, following the election in 1972, and I can vouch for the fact that he administered that portfolio with a great deal of enthusiasm and understanding of the changes in technology that were taking place. In other words, Sir Alan served this nation with distinction. On behalf of the Government, I extend to his family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen) for his remarks. The Opposition joins with him in supporting this motion of condolence. I, along with the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), served in ministries with Sir Alan Hulme. I liked him and I respected him. I do not say that lightly. He was one of those human beings possessed of very sound judgment and, if I may say so, searing commonsense. Some who worked in the then Australian Broadcasting Commission might doubt that, because from time to time he would launch into a foray on them, alleging a lack of balance and threatening the withdrawal of funds. I assure those who work for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that, in the same way as members of parliament are denounced for such remarks these days, so too was Alan when he, as Postmaster-General, would vent his feelings towards the public broadcaster from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir Alan was absolutely dedicated to my Party. I noticed in the obituaries that some called him the peacemaker. From time to time in parties that is required, and he was called on frequently to play that role. He was, as the Acting Prime Minister says, President of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party from 1946-the year after its actual formal formation. The division was gathered together in late 1944 and was constituted in 1945, and he became President in 1946. When he was defeated in the 1961 election-a result that I shared with him-he went back and became President again in 1962 and 1963, returning after the December 1963 election. </PARA>
<PARA> As Postmaster-General he headed what was then the largest department of the Commonwealth. He had been Minister for Supply and, as I recall it, Supply was the second largest department. The Acting Prime Minister spoke of his capacity as an administrator. There is no doubt that that capacity was very sound. He was not a man who wanted to allow events to pass him by. He was the one who announced the future introduction of FM broadcasting and of colour television. I recall that he was involved in identifying the need for health warnings in cigarette advertising on television and radio. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from those sorts of elements, whilst in this chamber he was a seemingly droll man, I found him a man of engaging personality. I was one of the younger members in the Parliament and a younger Minister; Alan was constantly in touch with us for yarns and chats, furthering the esprit de corps in the Party. He was, unquestionably, at root a force for good in a political party as a diligent Minister and a very great party man. There is no doubt that many of us who worked with him gleaned a great deal from him. Whilst his quiet and sometimes-especially in one on one conversations-sparkling personality did not always reveal itself in this chamber, occasionally it would come to the surface. </PARA>
<PARA> It was hard not to like Alan Hulme and respect him for all the work he was doing outside his portfolio in terms of the Party itself. In short, I liked and I respected him. He was a sound Minister, an effective politician and, frankly, a first rate bloke. I convey our sympathy to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the National Party of Australia I join the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) in paying tribute to the late Sir Alan Shallcross Hulme. As has been mentioned by previous speakers, Sir Alan was one of the founders of the Liberal Party. He came from a grazing family and entered the Federal Parliament as the member for Petrie in 1949, the time of the election of the first successful Menzies Government. He successfully held that seat for eight elections until 1969.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Leader of the Opposition has mentioned, Sir Alan held a number of ministerial positions, including that of Postmaster-General. His parliamentary service was one of dedication. He was a great believer in the need to develop our resources. In his maiden speech in this place, Sir Alan told members that the undeveloped resources of a State were the undeveloped resources of the whole of Australia. He also told the House:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I believe also that good government should lay sound foundations for the future, both political and economic, so that posterity will inherit something of which it will be proud. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir Alan has left a legacy of which his family, friends and colleagues and, in particular, the Liberal Party and this nation, can certainly be proud. His loyal and dedicated service continued under five Prime Ministers-Sir Robert Menzies, Mr Harold Holt, Sir John McEwen, Sir John Gorton, and Sir William McMahon. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the landmark decisions to take place under his ministerial direction are still in evidence in Australia today. They include the decision in 1970 to introduce colour television. He laid the groundwork for the introduction of an Australian-owned satellite system, again in 1970. He was involved in the decision in 1972 to allow the introduction of FM radio, and the decision, again in 1972, to impose health warnings on cigarette advertising. In every case the decisions have had a major impact on the Australia we enjoy today. It is obvious that Sir Alan had a clear vision for the next generation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having known Sir Alan Hulme's family since I was about five years of age, I feel very much a part of today's proceedings. I take this opportunity to express formally my condolences to his family and to recognise the fact that from the Government side of the House the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cross) and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) made the effort and took the time to be present at Sir Alan Hulme's funeral, as well as a number of Queensland members from this side of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir Alan could probably be best remembered as a thoroughly decent man. If the Ministry were a cricket team, he would always have been included in the team and high in the batting order. I thought it was most fitting that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen), who followed Sir Alan as Postmaster-General in this chamber led today's condolences. In many ways there is a great similarity between both people-except that Sir Alan was much wiser philosophically and politically. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other side, I observe that, as a result of Sir Alan having passed through this Parliament, this place is richer for his having been here. Australia truly lost one of its great sons a few days ago. I am quite sure that those in this place who remember him will remember him in the way that he has been described by all speakers that preceded me. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New England)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join in the words of sentiment regarding the late Sir Alan Hulme. I join in sending my condolences to his family. Sir Alan was a tremendous member of the successive Cabinets of which he was a part. He came with the approach of an accountant and, consequently, he was as concerned about the proprieties of government as he was about the policies of government. I remember one particular campaign that he waged was to try to ensure that there should be some correction of the imbalance between the funding of States and the funding of the Commonwealth. He felt that the States should have a share in being able to achieve a growth tax. On many occasions within Cabinet, he sought to try to correct what he saw as the consequences of the Federal Government having perhaps the prime say in the raising of money and leaving the States often in a position of disadvantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Above all, Sir Alan was known and respected for his role as Postmaster-General. He was Mr Postmaster-General. He not only epitomised the complex nature of the responsibilities of that portfolio, but also brought to bear in his exercise of the diverse responsibilities that were part of that former gigantic empire a measure of human understanding. As the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt), has said, he was responsible for putting in place many of the earlier steps towards the change in communications, which perhaps have become more dramatic in recent years. FM radio was certainly a product of Sir Alan's initiative, as were the first steps towards Aussat, the Australian satellite. Many of the changes towards a more efficient operation within Australia Post began essentially in the days when Alan Hulme was Postmaster-General. He was a great bloke, a good friend in Cabinet and always a person who was admired and respected by those who worked with him. </PARA>
<PARA> My only complaint about Alan was that when he decided to go on to the land, instead of raising Herefords, as I would have preferred, he decided to cross them with Brahmans. Many of us remember the intensive debates after the Cabinet discussions about raising Brahfords and what he thought about them. I join in extending my condolences to the Hulme family. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr MOORE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Ryan)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join in the motion proposed by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen). Sir Alan Hulme was a very great Queensland Liberal. I first met him when I became a member of the Executive of the Liberal Party in the mid-1960s. He came across as a very dour individual. In fact, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) said, he was a person of very considerable wit and charm. He was a person who really believed in what he was doing and had a very strong Methodist sense of right and wrong in his approach to all matters. He was very much, in my early days, the strong man of the Liberal Party in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is probably worth recalling that when Sir Alan came to Queensland from New South Wales before World War II, he was one of the founding members of what was the Queensland People's Party (QPP), which is long forgotten now. That particular party was a group backed by a lot of prominent Queenslanders of the time, such as John Chandler, Bruce Pie, Winston Noble, Charles Porter, Sir Leon Trout and Tom Hiley, people who all went on to play very prominent parts in the development of Queensland in the post-war period. </PARA>
<PARA> Alan occupied the position of President of the QPP prior to the 1949 election. The then Federal President of the Liberal Party, Lord Casey, came to Brisbane to try to persuade this other Party to join the Liberal Party of Australia. In typical Queensland fashion, when Lord Casey attempted to address the Queensland People's Party convention, he was told to go away, that members of the Party would make up their own minds. A very spirited, heated debate took place while Lord Casey was at Lennons Hotel nursing a bottle of whisky, awaiting the outcome. Nothing has really changed in Queensland politics with the passage of time. As a consequence, Alan backed the merger with the Liberal Party of Australia. As a result, in the 1949 election the combined Liberal-Country Party won 15 of the 18 Queensland seats, which pushed the Menzies Government into power. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say a couple of things about Alan's relationship with Queensland. As the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) said, Alan believed in Commonwealth-State relations. It was one of his hallmarks. He was always talking to State members about their responsibilities, including fund raising. He genuinely believed in federalism in a very real sense. After his defeat, the time that he spent after being elected President of the Party for the second time was equally noteworthy because of the sense of discipline that he attempted to instil in some Party members of the State Parliament. Those who know Gordon Chalk and Tom Hiley and the story behind the construction of the Mount Isa railway line will attest to that point. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Alan and Lady Hulme were very prominent in and committed to public life. I extend my sympathy and the sympathy of members of the Queensland Liberal Party to his two sons, Robert and Graham, and to his daughter Frances, and their families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to join the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt) in paying tribute to the late Sir Alan Hulme. I was closely associated with him during the period from 1963 to 1972 and it was a privilege to serve under him as an Assistant Minister for part of that time. He was a man of great dedication. Words cannot adequately describe his ability in the administrative field. He expected the Public Service to be accountable for its actions and when there was any doubt in that regard he certainly had an impact. We miss men of that kind in government today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> His years of endeavour did much to strengthen the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its associated instrumentalities. He was known during that period as Postmaster-General. He ensured that the service was developed to an extent that has made possible the excellent telecommunications network that we have in Australia today. Sir Alan recognised the views put to him by those with technical ability. He also had a very sound financial mind which I am sure did much to create in Australia the kind of service which is unique in the world. After all, Australia is a large continent and we are served in that particular area in a way that is unequalled. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one monument to Sir Alan Hulme in Canberra that is worth mentioning. The construction of the tower on Black Mountain was very hotly debated, particularly in Cabinet. I see that a couple of honourable members who recall that are nodding. Sir Alan won the day and the Black Mountain Tower was constructed. I think it did much to enhance the development of this city and to bring a recognition of modern technology to Canberra and to the environs of this national capital. Of course, there were many occasions when Alan had the task of dealing with industrial relations. He did that with distinction and in a way that gained very great rewards for himself as well as for the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Alan Hulme came into the House of Representatives in 1949, a turning point in Australian politics. Except for a short period, he served until 1972. Much could be written and said about him. Students of politics could learn much today if they studied the contributions made by Sir Alan Hulme as recorded in the annals of Hansard and in many other places. I join with those who have spoken already to say that Sir Alan Hulme's consistent attitude was a great attribute. He had a great respect for his family and for people who worked around him and he had a great and never diminishing admiration for what was achieved in Australia during the time that he served in this House. I extend my sympathy and that of my wife to his family. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3G4">Mr DOBIE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Cook)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to add a tribute to Sir Alan Hulme. His political career has been well documented today but I would like to add some additional aspects of his political life. I was privileged to meet Sir Alan for the first time when he was President of the Liberal Party in Queensland, where he was a familiar figure, particularly whenever Robert Menzies came to hold one of his now famous political meetings in the Brisbane City Hall. Those meetings were great political events not only for his supporters but also for his opponents. It was fitting that Alan Hulme chaired these meetings. As has been stated, he subsequently served in Parliament under five Prime Ministers. I remind the House that at the time he was President of the Party, the only three non-Labor members of the Senate came from Queensland. They were Sir Neil O'Sullivan, Dame Annabelle Rankin and, from the Country Party, Sir Walter Cooper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There were great challenges then. If I might be permitted to say so in this obituary, the challenge came from the fact that Queensland in those days knew a gerrymandering of electorates that has not been equalled since by subsequent governments in Queensland or even with Mr Playford's boundaries in South Australia. Sir Alan Hulme, with his dedication to the Liberal cause in Queensland, knew all too well the tricks of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland in those days. In a 1964 newspaper article, one of the doyens of the Press Gallery of those times, E. H. Cox, said that Alan Shallcross Hulme was one of the Prime Minister's closest confidantes in Parliament and that his loyalty to Sir Robert Menzies was the byword of the Parliament of those times. Loyalty meant a great deal to Alan Hulme and he was a great example of this political virtue. </PARA>
<PARA> My next contact with Sir Alan was when he came to campaign for me in 1966 to help me win the seat of Hughes. He was always a stickler for detail and in the proprieties of life. As part of his visit to my area he arranged to officially open the new Sutherland post office. Imagine my chagrin when he did not even mention my name at the opening ceremony. When talking to me later he said that as a candidate I had no status and that he was opening the post office as the Postmaster-General, not as someone helping a local candidate to get elected. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3G4">Mr DOBIE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear someone say, `Pretty dumb'. This brings me to my next point. I tell that story because it reflects Sir Alan Hulme's strict regard for the role of all who take public office and the need to differentiate between politicking and assuming proper levels of bipartisan responsibility. That need has been almost entirely overlooked in recent years in this Parliament. When sitting in Parliament with Sir Alan for six years between 1966 and 1972, I found him to be a man of great assistance and help to new members and a source of great wisdom to those who sought his opinion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Subsequently, it was my valued experience to sit on two Cabinet sub-committees with him during the time of the McMahon Government. His quiet, incisive mind was evident and it was obvious to me that his reputation for having made a great contribution as a Minister and Cabinet Minister was well founded. It is interesting, historically in this House, to realise that he entered the Ministry in 1958 upon the resignation of Sir Howard Beale, father of the present honourable member for Deakin. It should also be pointed out that when Sir William McMahon was voted in as Leader of the Party, it is sometimes forgotten that Sir Alan Hulme nominated for deputy leadership of the Party. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1972, Alan Hulme and I left Parliament together. He had the great distinction and honour of resigning voluntarily. Mine was not quite so voluntary. But it was because of that that my association with Alan Hulme reached a new level of friendship and association. I would tell the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) that Sir Alan Hulme's former interest in cattle changed, as a result of which he was then interested in droughtmaster cattle. It was as a result of his interest in that and his closeness to where I lived on my defeat-a few miles away-that I came to know what a fine man he could be. </PARA>
<PARA> When it came to politics, he was not without humour. He was not without wit. However, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) said, we did not see it very often in this place but it was evident in other places. Let me just say that in Queensland he raised the image of public service to great heights. His sense of duty and his sense of responsibility were evident to all who came into contact with him. Above all, as his son Robert was to say of his father, he was a strong family man. It was a great sadness to him that Lady Hulme should have predeceased him by six years. As his son Robert said, politically, he was always loyal to his leader. Sir Alan Hulme's passing removes another of the great Menzies men from our midst. We must all be grateful for him and his public duty over a long period. </PARA>
<PARA> My sympathy goes out to his daughter, Mrs Frances Wall, and his two sons, Mr Graham Hulme and Mr Robert Hulme. Their father was a grand man of whom they should all be very proud indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter of privilege. I refer to proposal No. 9 tabled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in both Houses of Parliament last May. This proposal was tabled in accordance with section 6 (3) of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975. The tabling of the proposal meant that the Statistician could invoke his compulsory powers in relation to the 1989-90 national health survey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that tabling document, the Parliament was advised: In addition to this proposal, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has developed, in consultation with the persons and agencies referred to above, a separate proposal for the collection from women respondents to the National Health Survey aged 18 to 64 years of information on a range of women's health issues. These women will then be advised that there is no obligation to participate. The information will be collected using a self-completion questionnaire to be returned in a sealed envelope. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABS was indicating to the Parliament that it intended to clearly differentiate items relating to women's health which had the potential, in its own words, to be `sensitive or embarrassing' from the main body of the national health survey. These issues of women's health are such things as a pap smear, hysterectomy, oral contraceptive usage, breast examinations or intra-uterine device (IUD). A thorough examination of the national health survey questionnaires and the relevant interviewer instruction manual has revealed that a large number of items--</PARA>

<PARA>This motion is a matter of urgency. As members of this Parliament and most Australians are beginning to realise, Australia is on the brink of an economic crisis. This week will confirm that our fundamental economic position is deteriorating just at a time when the world is becoming more concerned about excessive levels of debt and the capacity of nations to pay. Australia desperately needs strong economic leadership. We need a Treasurer who knows what he is doing, who can identify what needs to be done and who can act quickly and decisively to put things right. Yet in the weekend television performances of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and again last night at the Metal Trades Industry Association dinner, we observed a tragic figure. We observed a man who has blundered in battle through his carelessness and a poor strategy and who now realises that he faces defeat. We observed a man who has fired his best shots and who realises that his policy arsenal is empty. We observed a man who believes that he has earned the right to govern through hard work and daring but who finds the past misjudgments now leave him condemned. We observed a man losing support, even among his supporters in his own Party, as they see his weaknesses starkly revealed. Finally, we observed a man who is left to moan and mutter cliches and to curse his foes because he realises that he cannot deliver new policy initiatives. We observed a lonely, tortured, humiliated figure. </PARA>
<PARA> With his empire crumbling around him-with only about four months to go-the Treasurer last weekend simply told the Australian people that the Government will `reserve the right to put a proposal about how it sees Australia in the next three years'. I repeat: `reserve the right to put a proposal'. He has no policies. This is the man who has demanded detailed policies from the Opposition over a period of weeks. This is the man whose demands have been met by the most detailed set of economic policies ever put down in the history of this country. Yet he refuses to disclose his own hand. He refuses to tell us how he would get us out of the mess he has created. That simply is not good enough. The Australian public deserves to know, and it needs to know, what his policies are. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Treasurer has an absolutely abysmal track record when it comes to economic forecasting. The Australian people are now becoming concerned that this man is a loose cannon on our economic debt. The fact is that he has lost all his economic credibility. His forecasts are continuously astray. In the life of this Government he has achieved his inflation forecast only once. Last year's current account outcome was nearly double his forecast. But, of course, he proudly proclaims, `Don't hold me accountable for those forecasts; look at the Budget outcomes over which we have some control'. If this is so and if we look at his Budget outcomes, we could refer him to the fact that, although the aggregate number came out okay last year, there were some substantial errors and variations in individual programs. He should be held totally accountable for those. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the Forward Estimates for 1989-90 released in the last Budget, one sees a variation between November 1988 and the Budget: a massive hole of $1.8 billion in the Treasurer's figures. This is simply because of his ignorance, his inability to forecast. Predominantly $1.6 billion was accounted for by errors in forecasting that underlie those Budget figures-a $1.8 billion hole. How is the Australian population to have any confidence in this man's ability to forecast the Australian economy? What does he say? He says that he reserves the right to put down his policies. He has no policies in any of the areas to which he has referred. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the Treasurer likes to make a big issue of his fiscal policy performance. He says that he is tough, but the fact is that he has been easing fiscal policy over the last 18 months. Last night he said that he would not hesitate to increase the surplus next year. He has just reduced it by $5 billion this year by those unfunded tax cuts and he is already hinting at the possibility of further tax cuts next year. He says that there is no scope for further expenditure restraint. Yet his own document, which claims to have costed our proposals, identified that about 20 per cent of those who are long term unemployed should not get benefits. Why does the Government continue to fund them if that is the case? There is plenty of scope for cutting government expenditure, as we have demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, since the Budget the Treasurer has increased expenditure by more than $500m. Nothing has gone through the Parliament about this. There has been a substantial blow-out in expenditure. He has given a couple of hundred million dollars to his mates in the airlines; $200m to $250m to the big four banks just to hold down some mortgage rates; $60m to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd in that notable marginal seat of Wills; an undisclosed amount to Australian Airlines in support of its payouts in the current pilots dispute; and $150m to the waterside workers-and the next morning Tas Bull told us that there were no guarantees of productivity improvement. That is $500m or $600m out the door and totally unaccounted for. </PARA>
<PARA> He also suggests tax cuts. How will he pay for them if he will not cut expenditure? He will rely on bracket creep. He will not give bracket creep back. He has no concept of tax relief for families. Indeed, last night he hinted that the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) may not support it. The interesting question is: Does Bill Kelty oppose rebates for child-care? Does Bill Kelty oppose tax rebates for children? Let us see whether the ACTU opposes those initiatives. The Treasurer similarly has no proposal for tax reform. He has no concept of a simpler, flatter, two-tier tax system, which is fundamentally essential for getting incentive and increasing productivity in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night the Treasurer boasted he was upping the ante on fiscal policy-so much for doing that! As I said the other day, ours is bigger than yours. He set the criteria for the size of fiscal policy; he talks about outlays to gross domestic product (GDP). Our outlays to GDP are lower than the Government's. Our outlays to GDP are 22.5 per cent, the lowest level for 25 years. We also have the lowest tax burden in six years, the largest surplus and the largest public sector borrowing requirement on record-$6 billion in current markets in favourable terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer also has no concept of monetary policy. He does not believe in an independent Reserve Bank; he believes in total dominance of the Reserve Bank. He does not believe in medium term economic management through the Reserve Bank; he believes in day to day crisis management bent around his particular desires for an election. He does not understand monetary policy, how to use it and how to run it. He prefers to do deals. He prefers to prevent the Reserve Bank from performing the tasks that are required for it to achieve its charter. He has absolutely no answer on inflation. He cannot lower inflation; we can. He cannot lower interest rates; we can. He cannot cut government expenditure; we can. He cannot hand back bracket creep; we can. He cannot fund tax cuts; we can. He cannot privatise; he cannot clean up the waterfront; he cannot inject foreign competition into coastal shipping; he cannot boost production and productivity; and he cannot reverse the decline in living standards. We can and we will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer, poor man, is totally confused. On television at the weekend he hinted at tax cuts. Last night he said we would increase the surplus, but there was no suggestion of more expenditure cuts, having ruled them out previously, or of whether he will do it by again increasing the tax grab and live up to his nickname of Bracket Creep.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is important and what the Australian people want is answers from this Government. They want to know what the tax policy of the Government will be; what its rates will be going into the next election; and what assistance the Government will provide for families. They also want to know what happened to that famous promise made in 1987 of micro-economic reform. Mr Speaker, remember the slogan of 1987: `Let's see it through'. Let us see it through. Where is the policy? What will the Government deliver? It should put it on the table now. We would really like to see it and so would the Australian people. Increasingly before the next election they will ask the Government what its policy is. The reality is that unless the Government puts something on the table it will be tossed out without question. Honourable members opposite should at least give themselves the opportunity to provide some sort of competition at the next election instead of being slaughtered, as they would be at present. The Government should tell us what it will do about privatisation. While it is doing that, it can tell us how it will solve the airline dispute which has now been going for 11 weeks. The Prime Minister said that he did not deserve to be Prime Minister of this country if he could not solve the dispute. He has not solved it. The best estimate is that it will not be solved until Easter of next year. </PARA>
<PARA> How can an election be called with no aviation industry in this country? Has the back bench thought about that? How are members going to campaign when there are no aircraft flying in this country? The marginal seat holders in north Queensland had better ring up now and find out what their superannuation payouts are, because they will be tossed out totally and absolutely. What about the waterfront? What is the Government going to do about the waterfront? What conversation has the Government had with Tas Bull? How is it going to deliver? What value is the Australian taxpayer going to get for that $150m?</PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to coastal shipping, has any government member thought about the issues? The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) obviously has not. What about the Treasurer and the back bench committee? What is their policy on coastal shipping? When it comes to resource development, the Minister is the ultimate failure. He is totally wiped out. What an irrational and irresponsible decision this Government made about Coronation Hill. It did that because sheer panic had set in. The Government does anything to buy a vote. Government members will take any decision that they possibly can to gather together some coalition of support because they know that mainstream Australia has rejected them. Then they do a deal with the Prime Minister so that the Minister can come into this House and pretend to be outraged by the decision and get rapped over the knuckles with a feather duster. So much for principle and so much for credibility!</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is a laughing stock in the industry. He knows the damage that he has allowed to be done to the Australian economy. How is the Minister going to cover our foreign debt situation when he will not allow the development of our resources?</PARA>

The Liberal Party believes that its policy will cover it in some sort of glory. The Government has waited for 2 1/2 years for the Liberals to bring down their tax policy, but it contains not one specification of rates. We still do not know whether the rate will be 39 per cent or what the bottom rate will be. Nothing has been said. All we have is the Liberals trying to do their usual thing of trying to buy votes for an election. This is what has happened in their conservatism. Last time it was the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) with $7.8 billion worth of bribes. This time they have had the decency to cut that in half, down to $3 billion worth of bribes. Then they had the hide to say that their fiscal policy will be 22 per cent of outlays. We end up with this enormous level of government spending, amounting to 30.7 per cent of gross domestic product. We have finally rebuilt the building; made it a proper building.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Cut it and spend it! It is unbelievable. That is their solution. The real lulu in this whole document, the key line, is the third last paragraph on page 22 which says that by reducing inflation and shifting the weight of monetary policy they will lower interest rates-that is, we will have lower inflation but in the company of lower interest rates. This would be a world first. They are actually going to have lower inflation without the help of interest rates, because interest rates will be lower too. They will get inflation lower by having enterprise bargaining. Nobody-no economist, no economic institute, not the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and not the International Monetary Fund-would regard that statement seriously. People regard it as a joke. This Party is an alternative Government and professes some capacity, but it comes along and puts this piece of rubbish, this absolute piece of nonsense, in its policy. It is going to deregulate the labour market, and all of a sudden there is going to be a great leap down in wages. Growth will go on, but wages will leap down. It is unbelievable, trite nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We heard what members of the Metal Trades Industry Association said to the Liberal Party last night. They do not want any toe to toe contest; they want a mature industrial structure, an arbitration commission presiding over gradual change that can be afforded. We heard what those people in the real world had to say to all of those opposite-they dumped on them. I know they are all whingeing about the reception they got last night. They went to an industry group which dumped on them, and they cried like stuck pigs all night because they thought it was a Labor audience. They were pathetic. They faced an industry group, and what happened? It wiped the floor with them. </PARA>
<PARA> When we really get down to it, what happened is that the Liberal Party produced its policy, having sat there for months going over it, and what did the Department of Finance say? There is an $800m error in it. The two departments administering these programs-the Department of Social Security, which is delivering them, and the Department of Finance, which is monitoring them-have gone through it and have said there is an $800m error. We all know that in reality it is about $1,000m or $1,100m. In other words, those opposite got into the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) because they had a 19 per cent error in the policy, but Stone and the honourable member for Wentworth have come up with a 31 per cent error. They could not even get it as right as last time. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, yesterday, we found what their real policy is on child-care. They will knock off the fee relief. They will reduce the fee relief by the value of the rebate; in other words, they give $20 on the one hand and take it back on the other. They will take away the growth in government centres and throw the whole lot to the private economy. In other words, all the mothers out there ought to know that child-care will be handled by private business and that they will be charged about $100 a week. The Opposition says it can afford to give them $11.70. So they will be charged $100 a week and they will be given $11.70. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members do not have a ghost of a show. They say that there is a debt crisis. Imagine that lot managing a crisis! They cannot even manage themselves in this place. Here they are talking about debt and the current account crisis, but when they get their big chance to do something about it, what do they say? They say that they will have a weaker fiscal policy, a non-wage policy, a cave-in-as with the pilots-with enterprise bargaining. Basically, they will screw interest rates up to 25 or 27 per cent to cut the heart out of inflation. In the end, they will be the same dismal, thoughtless old crowd that they were in 1980-81. They are back to the same policies that they had in 1980-81. If they get in, they will lift interest rates, destroy business and try to destroy inflation. They do not have a ghost of a show. This document is not a policy; it is a sham. It is a joke. It has no macro-economic structure. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) is laughing. If the Prime Ministership were ever lifted on him he would quake in his boots. He wants what he has always wanted in life-a near victory. His best result is to nearly win. He loves to nearly win. Winning carries responsibility, and he shies off responsibility like Dracula from a wooden stake. He would run from any real responsibility. The proposition is a joke and the Government will be opposing it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We did not fund it; it is funded from the Budget surplus. That is the type of idiotic remark that we expect to hear from the honourable member for Wentworth as well as the honourable member for O'Connor. They talk about unfunded tax cuts. Those cuts are demonstrably funded from the Budget surplus. The fact is that the tax cuts represent $20 to $30 a week. That should be compared to the proposition put by the Opposition totalling $2.7 billion which cannot be funded by cuts in government spending. That has been demonstrated convincingly by the Department of Finance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As well, the Government has increased and indexed family allowances. Members of the Opposition front bench have refused to confirm that they would maintain the indexation of family allowances. They will not maintain the commitment to index family allowances. We have increased the dependent spouse rebate and indexed it. On top of that, we have introduced the family allowance supplement which pays a family with three children and an income of $16,000 or $17,000 about $5,000 a year, tax free. Opposition members have the temerity to talk about a family policy! What about all the families they placed in the unemployment queues in 1981 and 1982? Who were they? Do Opposition members think they were Martians?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow Treasurer was then the principal adviser on economic policy. That is a reasonably relevant point, I would have thought. The previous Government lifted unemployment to 650,000. So 650,000 breadwinners and their families were placed in poverty. Yet Opposition members set themselves up as the great protectors of families. What lien do they have over this area of policy? They have never done anything about it. We are the only government that has ever offered a decent income support scheme for families by way of a family allowance supplement and by increasing and indexing the family allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>

Let me just give an example. For a single income family with two children on 100 per cent of average weekly earnings the tax cuts and benefits under Labor are $24.30 a week. For the same family under the coalition they would be $5.05. At 150 per cent of average weekly earnings the figures are $28.35 under us and $5.05 under the coalition. For a two-income family with one child on 100 per cent of average weekly earnings the benefit under Labor is $18.55. Under the coalition's proposition it would be $15.15.

The Leader of the Opposition walked away from his inflation adjustment proposal without even having the decency to put a line in his policy about it. He completely chickened out and walked away from the commitment like he walked away from the gold tax commitment and the fringe benefits tax commitment. Given those things, what is this commitment worth? What is this $5 worth? When would these people ever see that $5? The Opposition would just say, `We have decided that fiscal policy needs to be this or that. We are sorry, that has got to go by the wayside'-just like inflation adjustment went by the wayside. The Opposition stands for nothing. Its promises are easily broken and have no standing in public terms, as has been demonstrated. Given that the Government is paying such an enormous benefit to families, the Opposition's gall in saying that it has a family policy is just sick.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IJ4">Mr SNOWDON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Social Security. Since 1982-83, direct expenditure on family assistance has doubled to $3.5 billion.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand that the Opposition may not want to refer to a figure-the figure of $3.5 billion-because that figure, mentioned in the question, refers to a doubling of expenditure in relation to families which has occurred under this Government. One can understand also that one would not want, from the Opposition, to hear comparisons. What we have is a comparison between a policy, which I will try to explain to the Opposition, and a statement of intention and, on the basis of history, it is a rather uncertain intention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To go to the question of policy, as I understand it, the Opposition purports to want to help families. The Government's assistance to families is based on policies. We believe that there ought to be assistance to families in terms of the social security system and we believe that that assistance ought to meet objectives of equity, firstly, to the lowest-income families and then, generally speaking, families ought to be assisted. We believe as a matter of policy that, on the whole, that assistance ought to be directed regularly to the carer. We believe, as a matter of policy, that that payment ought to be maintained in terms of its real value. We think, as a matter of policy, that those payments to families, at least at the very high levels of income, ought to be income tested. We think, as a matter of policy, that those payments ought to be tax-free. Furthermore, we believe that those payments to families ought to be augmented in certain cases of particular need to ensure that low income families receive additional assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> That policy has been spelled out-not as a vague matter or intention but in some detail-in terms of a number of decisions. About two million Australian families, or about 3.8 million children, regularly receive assistance by virtue of family allowances. About 500,000 families, with 1.2 million children, are having that assistance augmented because they are low income families that need additional assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the crux of the matter. The difference between the policy as it has been spelled out by the Government and what we have seen by way of intention from the Opposition centres upon indexation. If there is one difference between what the Government has done-apart from the fact that the payment is fair, is equitable and is paid to the mother regularly-and what the Opposition has suggested, it is that it is indexed and will maintain its real value. Over and against that is the suggested alternative of a rebate not paid until some time late in 1991 which does not reflect in any sense any assessment of need. It would not be paid to the carer. It would not be paid regularly when it is needed. In fact, the Opposition simply intends to put in a line of $1 billion in terms of some statement. However, when it comes to spelling out what that will mean in terms of the needs of families, or working out what it will mean in terms of a policy that integrates with the needs of a whole range of families, it is unable to do so. Until we see some indication in terms of specifics, we are inclined-as I am sure most people in Australia will do-to wipe out these words as being a mere vague intention that certainly will not be paid for and will never be implemented.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, give it away, will you, for God's sake. As far as the pilots are concerned, I am relying on memory, but the cost to the Budget so far is about $30m in a Budget of $90,000m and a surplus of $9.1 billion. Of course, unlike the coalition's period of office, last year we had a Budget surplus of just on $6 billion. This year we have made it $9 billion. I could have said to my colleagues, `Look, we have $3 billion here. Let's have a spend-up like the coalition wants to do. Let's make fiscal policy a bit weaker. Let's not add to the surplus. Let's have a spend-up'. Indeed, we spent it on the surplus: $3 billion of it went onto the surplus. Honourable members opposite might ask why we showed the responsibility of putting it onto the surplus when they did not do so. We did it because we are conscientious about the national economic condition. We are not about doing the shabby Liberal thing of trying to buy votes in the way in which the Liberals did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Kodak matter has yet to be finally negotiated by Kodak and Senator Button. Whatever the costs will be, they will be costs incurred at some point in the future. They may have some small effect on this year's Budget. The point the honourable member is trying to make is that these costs are having a big effect on this year's Budget. One so far is worth $30m and the other would be part of that. The cost would be a very small part of a $9,100m surplus but an even smaller part of a $90,000m Budget. Of course, what really amuses me is that the honourable member has the hide to ask the question when he has brought down a policy in which he had the option of cutting expenditure and adding it to the surplus, but decided to cut expenditure and spend it.</PARA>

What a breathtaking social change that is. The Opposition will actually put $5 on the top of the Government's $28 and then invest itself with the great family title. What humbugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know about the former Treasurer's fiscal record. The then Treasurer left me with a deficit of just on $9.6 billion. We have been cutting outlays for seven years and we now have a surplus to which we have added $3 billion this year. We had a $6 billion surplus last year and this year we have a $9 billion surplus. But when the test came for those opposite they said, `No, we won't add any. We'll spend it'. Just to add insult to injury, they have made it clear, in briefing the journalists, that the twin deficit linkage does not matter anyway, that public savings do not matter. They say that the fiscal surplus does not matter because enhanced public saving means diminished private saving, so what is the point?</PARA>
<PARA> That is the line those opposite are pushing, a line which is not part of the consensus in financial markets worldwide, not part of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development consensus, not part of the International Monetary Fund consensus or the consensus in Australia. This is the Liberal Party saying `Fiscal policy does not matter', and those opposite have proved it by spending the cuts that they would otherwise make in government expenditure. They have proved that they have no premium on fiscal policy. That is the point I have been making: they have no premium on fiscal policy; they have no wage policy. So guess what cops the load? Interest rates; monetary policy. If 20 per cent is only slowing the economy, what will it take to eliminate inflation, as those opposite suggest they will do? They are saying that the next coalition government will conduct monetary policy with the medium term objective of reducing and eventually eliminating inflation. If 20 per cent is just slowing the economy, what interest rate eliminates inflation? Thirty? Twenty-seven? What guess over 20 actually reduces and eliminates inflation? Is it 25, 27, 30? The coalition's fiscal policy is weak; it has made that clear. Its wages policy is a cave-in. For six or seven weeks now those opposite have been telling us to give in to the pilots. They do not have a policy, so the honourable member should not get up and try to ask me a pathetic, weak little question about whether $30m will weaken a fiscal surplus of $9 billion, when he has been running around telling people that the twin deficit theory does not matter.

Even more importantly, the honourable member for Bradfield spelt out the inherent logic of the Opposition's proposals.

Let us look at what he said; look at the denials; and see what they mean. First, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is saying that it will not be committed to those 30,000 places. It is not making that commitment. I know that the honourable member for Bradfield has had to deny that he said that. The Leader of the Opposition has said that he was wrong. What is clear is that in the Liberal policy public expansion is to end. It might not end in its first year of government; it might not end in its second year; but it has made it perfectly clear that it wants a privatised system of child-care-that is, an end to further public expansion. We are saying on all the figures we have that we will not need just the 30,000 new public places. Throughout the 1990s we will have to provide further public places in child-care. That commitment is now ended. However opportunistic the exact point of time, that public provision will come to an end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bradfield told us yesterday that under a coalition government middle-income families would not be allowed into government child-care centres. I am not sure whether that proposal has been denied. If the coalition is going to provide only a small component of public places, then obviously those places will be kept just for the poor and less well off. That is, the coalition will not be able to allow middle-income families and their children access to those centres.</PARA>
<PARA> We oppose that policy on two grounds. First, there are enormous advantages in having a good social mix in child-care centres and in not concentrating the children of the poor or low-income families in those centres. Secondly, as I shall point out in a moment, where would those middle-income families take their children if they were excluded from public centres? I return to the two fundamental points. Unless this Government continues its free relief expansion, it will not provide places for middle and low-income people in child-care in this country. If the Opposition comes in with a policy to end fee relief-it said it might not end it next year, but it will be put to an end because it will rely on this rebate-the result will be that many thousands of middle income--</PARA>

Because of the very cost of child-care, unless there is a continuing and expanding fee relief segment, child-care will be unaffordable and access will be denied to low income and middle income families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition says that that does not matter because child-care will be given to the free market; that there will be extra rebates, and lots of child-care centres will be built all over the place. That is not going to occur. Unless substantial fee relief moneys are provided and unless parents are given a pretty substantial amount of support, it is very unlikely that many more child-care centres will be built. Indeed, the only places where child-care centres will occur will be in those wealthier suburbs of our country. For example, when an open system of benefit for nursing homes existed, where did those nursing homes occur? They were in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, in the North Shore of Sydney, and in the eastern hillside suburbs of Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA> If child-care were left to the system that has been suggested by the Opposition, inevitably a few new child-care centres may be built, but they would be in those areas that contain the wealthier segments of the population. One has only to look at the provision of nursing homes across this country in the 1970s and early 1980s, which we have changed.</PARA>
<PARA> Unless the Opposition rethinks its policy on child-care and unless it gives, firstly, a central place to fee relief as a critical path or, secondly, a continuing commitment to public expansion, child-care in this country will be put back a generation.</PARA>

<PARA>When asked how inflation would be reduced by shifting the weight off monetary policy and not onto it, the shadow Treasurer answered that under their wages system-the one I just read out-wages would fall, and that would produce a great leap down in wages. In other words, the economy is growing like it is now, and all of a sudden we go to enterprise bargaining where there is no accord, no Australian Council of Trade Unions, no Bill Kelty, no fireman, and no-one to help-just enterprise agreements. Those opposite would go to these enterprise agreements, and all of a sudden wages would leap down, and as they leap down that would reduce inflation. Because inflation is down, interest rates will come down. No-one else in the world would write rubbish like this.</PARA>
<PARA> We would not mind all this had we not had in this very Parliament within the last month a classic example of enterprise bargaining, with two enterprises-Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines-being preyed upon by the pilots for a 30 per cent increase while the Leader of the Opposition urged the Government to cave in. He is the Neville Chamberlain of Australian industrial relations, the great industrial appeaser, the craven appeaser of industrial relations. He has urged the Government for seven weeks to cave in to a 20 per cent plus wage claim. But no, under his policies wages will just go down. You see, had we had a Liberal Government when the pilots put their claim in, they would not have gone for 30 per cent, they would have gone for minus 5 or minus 6 per cent. That is what the Liberals' policy indicates. It is pathetic. Can we imagine a major political party publishing tripe like this? Even in the Liberals' worst days, when Malcolm was around trying to trick himself into office, he would never have been guilty of putting out this kind of rubbish, suggesting a reduction in inflation and shifting the weight off monetary policy.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the shadow Treasurer has been in this Parliament he has talked about nothing other than putting weight on monetary policy. He has been saying how the Government has been tricking up interest rates, has not been running a decent monetary policy, has been politicising the Reserve Bank of Australia and has not been putting weight on monetary policy. All of a sudden his document comes out, and he is taking the weight off monetary policy, not putting it on it. Then, when the Leader of the Opposition is questioned about how a requirement to hold wages down would imply a tighter monetary policy with high employment, what does he answer? There will be no unemployment with higher interest rates. That brought a horse laugh from everyone on the panel on Face to Face. If it were not for the propriety of television journalism, they would have laughed him off the set when he said that we could have a draconian monetary policy without any lift in unemployment.</PARA>

The idea, then, that we would end up with lower inflation which would lower the inflationary floor under interest rates is the greatest load of codswallop that has every been spoken by a major political party. That is the basic essence of their policy. The spending things are one thing-we can all have a debate about tax expenditures-but the essence of their policy on running the economy is that they would get a wage fall out of the bargaining system which would then reduce inflation, and that would reduce interest rates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think there is any reason why the Government should go easy on the question of unemployment benefit. After all, that is an area in which we have seen the effect of government policies each year, certainly since 1984. The number on benefit has fallen from 635,000 to 363,000. In every category of duration-under three months, three months to six months, six months to nine months, over nine months, over five years-numbers are now falling. This has been achieved through an approach that the Leader of the Opposition, who is prattling, would not understand. It is an approach which is sophisticated and involves 1.5 million jobs. Unemployment has been reduced as a result of our very successful program of job creation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that the honourable member interjects. After all, he was not involved in the policy, he was not consulted, he did not get the figures wrong, and when he came in he was repudiated. The second thrust of the Government's policy has been in terms of education and training. The Government has sought to ensure that, as jobs are created, those who are most disadvantaged have been able to take up the various positions. I do not think we have ever had, in terms of an integrated labour market policy linked to social security, a more successful policy. It has resulted in tens of thousands of people each year moving from benefit into the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third element of the policy has been to ensure that, from a social security point of view, we run a tight system; that is, that we administer unemployment benefit fairly and effectively. One only needs to go back to 1982 when the Opposition, which was then in government, abolished the work test, removed the requirements to lodge personally the continuation of benefit form and removed the requirement for registration at the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES). If we look at social security and at measures that have been introduced by this Government to ensure that there is no leakage in relation to unemployment benefit paid to those who are actively seeking work, we see that a range of conditions has been introduced. We have reintroduced registration with the Employment Service and the requirement to lodge fortnightly forms and we have introduced employer separation certificates, the comprehensive documentation of work efforts each fortnight, and interviewing of long term beneficiaries. We have introduced through the Newstart program joint interviews with the CES and the Department of Social Security. The result has been that through job creation, through integrated labour market program efforts, and through a system-run in an incredibly lax manner by the former Government, specifically by Senator Fred Chaney, who was then Minister for Social Security-which has been run tightly and effectively, there has been a massive reduction in the number of unemployment beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA> I end on this point: the Opposition has had seven years to look at what the Government has been doing in terms of the administration of unemployment benefit, the link with CES, and so on. After seven years and a much vaunted policy, the substance of the policy--</PARA>

In case he has in mind misrepresenting my question, let me say that the Opposition will be very pleased to sit into December in order to facilitate the business of the House. He indicated earlier that there were 60 legislative packages that had been granted high priority by the Government. That is not 60 pieces of legislation; that is 60 packages which include several pieces of legislation. Already up to 16 June this year the Government has used the guillotine 32 times. Rather than pushing legislation through the Parliament in that way, we would be prepared to sit longer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition may well be prepared to sit longer and we on this side of the House may well be prepared to sit longer; but, as the Opposition spokesman on House matters, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), well knows, the point of sitting longer rather disappears after 23 November. As he well knows, that is when the Senate cut-off date is imposed on business of the House of Representatives. From that point on, anything that is considered by this place has no guarantee. With the exigencies of the situation and the amount of legislation that the Senate invariably then has before it, there is not a great deal of point in continuing until we are able to get back from the Senate material which we have passed prior to that date. I happen to think that it is one of the parliamentary scandals which ought to exercise the minds of members of the House of Representatives that we have that cut-off imposed upon us by the Opposition parties in the Senate, but nobody seems all that concerned about it. Nevertheless, it applies, and it rather defeats the purpose of sitting much beyond 23 November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, there is a possibility that there will be business considered by the Senate after the completion of the period of sitting of which we have given notice to this point. If that occurs and there are matters of sufficient degrees of urgency which require our consideration because they have been amended or whatever, then Parliament will be called back. I cannot say when that will be. That depends very heavily on when the Senate rises or looks like rising, because obviously again there is no point in coming back until Senate business is close to its conclusion. So there is a high level of likelihood of a sitting some time in December, probably towards the latter part of it, but I will not be able to give honourable members information on that point for some time. </PARA>

The illumination of the flag has been reduced because of the difficulty with the moths. I go from recollection now, but I understand that advice was sought from the Department of Administrative Services, which is responsible for advice on these matters, and that what is being done is in accordance with protocol.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to continue my comments on this legislation. I indicated two weeks ago that it should be of interest to all of us who are involved in pushing for legislation which meets the very practical challenges of regulatory protection of the environment. The first Bill, the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill 1989, establishes a national scheme for the notification and assessment of industrial chemicals. It is designed to ensure adequate information on and regulation of any possible hazards associated with chemicals imported to or manufactured in Australia. It is a response to inadequacies in the information and regulatory systems covering industrial chemicals in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second Bill, the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill 1989, proposes a system for the control of the import and export of hazardous wastes by the use of ministerial permits. Its objective is to ensure that such wastes are disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner here and overseas. The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) and other speakers detailed the provisions of these two Bills before debate was interrupted on 5 October. I do not want to waste time going over those details again. I had begun to make some general comments about the background and context of the two Bills in that earlier debate and had noted the tardiness which appears to have characterised the bureaucracy and the Executive in bringing this legislation before the Parliament. I reminded the House that all the matters dealt with in these Bills were first raised in two reports by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation nearly seven years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The two reports of the inquiry into hazardous chemicals provided a comprehensive analysis of the problem along with specific, workable and urgent recommendations on the three main areas covered by these two Bills. The first area was the need for databases, licences, monitoring of regulatory coverage, and sanctions in the area of chemical usage and waste disposal in Australia. The second was the need to clarify the Commonwealth's role and powers in this area and to structure coordination and cooperation with the States. The third was the need for international machinery to regulate international movement and disposal of wastes. I argued that seven years ago the Executive had been alerted to the policy and legislative responses needed to deal with the dangerous and immoral inadequacies of our regulatory framework in the area of hazardous chemicals and wastes. I suggested that the reports of the environment committee in 1982 are a clear example of the important role of the parliamentary committee system and a clear example of the way the Executive continues to ignore that system to the detriment of good government. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I return to the substance of the legislation, focusing in particular on the Hazardous Waste Bill and dealing with the broader issues this kind of legislation raises for the Parliament and the community. It has been argued by many commentators that, in the area of environmental conservation, restoration and protection, the biggest single challenge facing the world community today is to establish effective mechanisms for governance and management at the international level, with workable linkage to the other levels of governance, from national to local. The legislation before us is one instance of this Parliament's legislative efforts to meet that challenge, in the context in particular of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Basel Convention and these related Bills are instances of an international effort to develop a global ethic and a global legal framework which will support the long term work of restoring and nurturing the earth and all its forms of life. That global ethic and legal framework, and the legislation before us now, are the fruit of an ongoing rethink of humanity's place in, and obligations to, the global ecosystem. For the last decade we have seen an emerging dialogue and convergence, a dialectical process involving the dominant homocentric world view and an emerging ecocentric world view. We have begun to see what has been described as the technospheric ethic, which rationalises and validates the world of human artefacts and technology, being challenged by a biospheric ethic, which seeks to rationalise and validate the preservation and nurturance of the natural world. Socially we have come more and more to affirm reverence for life in all its forms and variety, and piety towards all creation. Scientifically we have come to emphasise a holistic approach to analysis and interpretation. Politically we have warmed to the language of mutual commitment, obligation and interdependence. Theologically we have returned to the concepts of humble and accountable stewardship and have remembered the scriptural teaching that creation itself is caught up in God's work of salvation. Of course, that is not out of kilter with the significance of the prayer that is given in this House every day. That is the broader context of our discussion and deliberations today. </PARA>
<PARA> Another context for this legislation is the age-old commitment within our political system to protecting the weak. I refer specifically to the main concern of the Basel Convention, which is to deal with the transfer of hazardous wastes to the Third World. A major area of concern with regard to this Bill is the predicament that many Third World countries are in as a result of even deceitful dumping of wastes on their territories. Australia's record in this regard is, I understand, not a problem. Most of our hazardous waste is legally shipped to a Welsh town called Pontypool, where it is incinerated. I do not think that too many Australians would know that piece of information. If ever anyone would like anecdotal evidence of interdependence and interconnection in this small world, it so happened that the British member of parliament whose constituency covers Pontypool, the honourable member for Torfaen, Mr Paul Murphy, was present by chance in the House two weeks ago on the very day we commenced debate on these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia's record is thus far unquestioned, the record of the industrial world overall has been disgraceful and criminal. Many honourable members will have read the account in Newsweek last year of the Nigerian farmer paid a pittance by an Italian businessman to store wastes which subsequently turned out to be highly toxic. They will remember the scheme designed by one American entrepreneur to ship 15 million tons of waste over five years to Guinea-Bissau, a scheme which would have earned him profits of $400 million. The scheme would have earned a small income for Guinea-Bissau but at a long term cost to its fragile environment. Either because of poverty and debt or because of corruption, countries like Guinea-Bissau have become the dumping ground for the West's toxic wastes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now time that we in the West were brought face to face with the waste generated by our industrial way of life. It is time we brought irresponsible corporations and public utilities under a regulatory system which respects both the environment and the rights of citizens in countries in no position to resist the dumpers. The legislation before us now is a means to that global objective, as will be our ratification of the Basel Convention, along with that of the British Government, in the very near future. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one final aspect of the legislation before us upon which I wish to comment. It may seem surprising that a Liberal member of parliament could be so enthusiastic about legislation which seeks to extend the regulatory reach of the state. I make no apology for my support for the Bills, or for the regulations and sanctions they will establish. Recently proposals have been put forward for a market approach to environmental values and environmental protection. Some of my colleagues will have seen reports, for instance, about a British document, Blueprint for a Green Economy, put together by a Professor Pearce for the Minister for the Environment in the British Parliament. The thrust of the report is along the lines, I understand, that environmental degradation and abuse have arisen because of inadequate or absent market signals about the value of natural resources and because many natural resources have been freely available to producers to use directly or to foul with waste. The solution, according to Professor Pearce, is to determine a monetary value for environmental assets and resources. The development of a user pays approach would then allow the market to properly value the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Making clear to producers, consumers and government the costs and opportunity costs of resource use and industrial lifestyles is undoubtedly necessary, and I believe mechanisms such as pollution taxes are worth considering, especially as a source of revenue for environmental repair work. Ultimately, however, what we value in the natural world cannot and must not be reduced to economic or consumer preferences and values-that is, to the simple question of what someone is willing to pay. Such an approach will lead to utilitarian dead-ends and be exposed as unreliable, simply by inequality in the capacity to pay or by subjective determination of preferences. In the last instance, environmental policy must be the product of a political process which seeks what is good and right and must reflect deeper questions of ethics, science, culture, aesthetics and spiritual values. Once such values are given, in the last instance, greater weight than economic values, once one acknowledges the failure of markets in the past because of economic and political power inequalities, indeed once one honestly assesses the likelihood that individuals and corporations will continue to act irresponsibly, it becomes necessary to accept the need for regulation of environmental matters by government on behalf of the community. This is not to write a blank cheque for a regulatory state. It is simply to insist that in many instances political prudence as much as moral obligation requires us to rely on regulations and sanctions to protect the environment. To quote Edmund Burke, our passions forge our fetters. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, these Bills are timely, even if six years later than they need have been, and I commend them to the House. I also take this opportunity to call on State governments to lend their support to the Basel Convention by expediting negotiations with the Commonwealth which would allow Australia to ratify the Convention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following on from the comments of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), I am glad that the conservative side of politics has mentioned a pollution tax. Four or five years ago I raised this matter, and I also mentioned that a greenhouse tax and a technology tax should be applied toward research. A nice little buzz word was `tech-tax'. I thought it was a nice little word, but no-one took it up. I am glad to see that the subject is on the agenda again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These two Bills are very important. They will shape pollution controls for Australia into the next century. Pollution controls have to be tightened. They are not stringent enough and the fines are not severe enough. The controls contain a clause that our waste will be exported. Our waste should not be exported. Any chemical organisation or fuel or oil company that makes chemicals should have the obligation of getting rid of its waste. It should be the company's moral obligation to get rid of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Waste has been around for a long time and in that regard I want to quote a few things from a book entitled High Tech Holocaust. Man was certainly aware of hazards that accompanied the quest for material goods. In the fifth century BC the Greek physician Hippocrates wrote of the effects of working environments on human health. He described cases of lead colic in miners, and other occupational diseases. We have known about this sort of thing for a fair while, yet not too much has been done about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1950 United States industrial complexes generated some six billion tonnes of toxic waste from chemical plants, refineries, smelters and other installations. Each year yields a further 250 million tonnes of hazardous garbage, with inadequate controls over where and how it is dumped. All of this is being manufactured by the chemical companies, the oil companies and industrial complexes, yet they have no real responsibility to clean it up. All they do is put it in a drum and store it somewhere. It should be the responsibility of the companies to clean it up. If they do not clean it up, they should be fined heavily. </PARA>
<PARA> Planet Earth is being slowly poisoned by the effluent of the affluent. The smokestacks, discharge pipes and slurry tanks of a million and one manufacturing plants, power stations and industrial premises across the world have poured out toxic substances for over 200 years, and they continue to do so. Other industries have created products that contaminate our insides through the foods or liquids we ingest or the medications we take. They continue to do so. The creation of new technologies, contrary to expectations that they would lead to a cleaner and safer habitat, has merely added to our ability to generate yet more poisons. Some time ago I spoke about pesticides that have been put into our food. All of these come from chemical companies and all of them generate other toxic and hazardous waste. What happens to it? It is just stored up waiting for someone to come along in the future, fix it up and look after it. Recently I spoke about a dump in the electorate of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). I believe that dump contains waste material from a BP refinery. I believe that the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) is now investigating that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Now is the time to do something about this legacy we are leaving for our children to clean up. Both of these Bills tend to point us in the right direction. In the United Kingdom, the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment, in its report on toxic waste, mentioned some of the criticisms that have been levelled at this report. It made the following points:</PARA>
<PARA>Fifteen years after the Control of Pollution Act (CPOA) was introduced in order to control the disposal of `controlled wastes', the term `controlled waste' still remains unsatisfactorily defined; 56 out of the 79 Waste Disposal Authorities (WDA) in England and Wales have yet to submit plans for the disposal of controlled waste in their areas-some 10 years--(Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to point out to the House that we are talking about hazardous wastes, and in this House there is only one lot of hazardous waste-on the Opposition side. They should all be buried and disposed of. They are toxic. </PARA>
<PARA> I was about to mention the Thatcher Government's record on the environment, which is strongly support by the Opposition. The report makes the following comments about the UK Department of the Environment:</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Environment has `grossly understaffed' those sections responsible for monitoring and giving advice on waste disposal, with `only 6 inspectors in post to oversee more than 5000 disposal sites in England and Wales'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of thing which, if we pass this legislation, the Opposition would probably do-if it ever gets into power. It would understaff the department and allow its mates to bury toxic waste all over the place. That is happening in Wales. Mention was made of the House of Commons member for Pontypool, Paul Murphy, who was in the House of Representatives chamber when the legislation was last before us. I have spoken to him. He gave me a little note which I have with me. I noticed that last week's edition of the New Scientist said this about Pontypool:</PARA>
<PARA> Government scientists are this week monitoring vegetation, foodstuffs, soil and water around one of Britain's biggest chemical incinerators in south Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>That is where Australia sends some of its waste. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Their investigation follows claims that pollution from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is abnormally severe in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Rechem International operates the incinerator at Pontypool. It handles much of the country's growing trade in wastes that are contaminated with PCBs. The cause of the investigation is a report by the local authority, Torfaen District Council, which claimed a significant rise in pollution by PCBs in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> The council found that PCBs in vegetation contained 1200 parts per billion, compared with levels below 20 parts per billion in the company's own routine tests. Torfaen also tested duck eggs and found they contained 60 times the level of pollutants in a control sample of eggs. </PARA>
<PARA>We are sending wastes to that area, polluting it for the people who live in the surrounding area of Wales. What do we do about it? No-one wants to know about it. We just keep sending toxic waste over there. It is interesting to note that the incinerator is in a Labour area. I imagine that if the Opposition ever got into power it would build such an incinerator in a Labor area. We would not find one on the North Shore of Sydney or somewhere like that. </PARA>
<PARA> Another country that is being affected by toxic waste is Ireland. The tightening of environmental regulations in the richer countries has forced heavily polluting industries to transfer manufacturing capacity to less developed countries which have weak or non-existent regulatory frameworks. The Republic of Ireland, much less developed than most Western nations, has ineffective anti-pollution legislation and a government keen to provide employment at almost any cost. Multinational pharmaceutical industries have taken full advantage of this situation, relocating the most polluting parts of their businesses to the south of Ireland. </PARA>
<PARA> The article to which I refer went on to give an example of Merck, Sharp and Dohme, a huge drug company which makes all sorts of things. It has set up a plant in Tipperary. A farmer called John Hanrahan-Hanrahan is a very famous name in Australian poetry-who lived a mile from the factory lodged a complaint with the Tipperary County Council. He claimed that he had difficulty breathing and that his cows had streaming eyes, which he blamed on emissions from Merck. Others living in the vicinity also complained of problems with their livestock-that is, stillborn and aborted calves. Carcasses of dead animals were sent to a veterinary laboratory for examination and nothing was found-not surpisingly as the laboratory had no facilities for examining for toxic chemical substances. That is the sort of thing which large companies are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of continued monitoring, it was revealed that during May and June 1980 acidic emissions from the factory were four times the permitted level. Tipperary County Council took no action against Merck, Sharp and Dohme. Hanrahan was the butt of widespread slanderous rumour and innuendo which blamed the events on his farm and even on his personal incompetence. However, he instituted legal proceedings against Merck. None of the reports and other information from local government or health board sources were made available to him, even though they were supplied to Merck management by council officials. </PARA>
<PARA> By 1985, when the case came before the High Court, 225 of Hanrahan's cattle had died. The High Court ruled against Hanrahan on the grounds that it could not be proved that the factory was directly responsible for the human and animal health problems on the Hanrahan farm. Hanrahan appealed to the Supreme Court and the case was heard in June and July 1988. In a unanimous verdict the three Supreme Court judges overturned the High Court ruling and found in Hanrahan's favour. The Court found that atmospheric pollution, mainly in the form of hydrogen chloride and hydrochloric acid mists, was present in the region and that it was an unquestionable fact that the Merck factory was the source of that pollution. A small farmer had to battle against a huge multinational to prove his case, and it took him years and years. I believe that chemical companies must be made to clean up their act. We should not, under any circumstances, export waste to another country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill provides for the assessment of the various chemicals being manufactured and allows the chemical companies to do their own assessing. I appreciate that they must put in a report to Worksafe Australia, but should we trust chemical companies to do their own assessing? I do not believe that we should do so. One has only to look at a few case studies of what companies have done in the past. I refer to a giant company in the United States called Velsicol which makes heptachlor and chlordane. Some of those chemicals are still used in Australia. It is generally assumed that the database on toxic chemicals generated by industry provides a reliable basis for the scientific evaluation of their public health hazards and for government regulation. In fact, as has been documented in detail, this is generally not the case. The article to which I refer states:</PARA>
<PARA> A critical, but not a typical, illustration is provided by an evaluation of the track record of Velsicol Chemical Company, the sole manufacturer of the ultrahazardous, carcinogenic and highly persistent hydrocarbon pesticides chlordane/heptachlor . . . These were widely used for agricultural purposes in the U.S.A., until they were phased-out following cancellation and suspension hearings in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA>They are still used in Australia, I believe, for controlling termites. They are used extensively in Western Australia. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 40 years, Velsicol has a near consistent record of failure to publish in house research and contracted research by commercial laboratories on the toxic effects of chlordane/heptachlor. Suppression of such information has prevented the appropriate warnings being issued to householders and pest control operators, and has also prevented an independent review of the validity of the test data, methodology and conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of thing with which we will have to deal if we allow all the power to stay in the hands of the chemical companies, oil companies, et cetera, which make hazardous wastes. </PARA>
<PARA> Most countries have some sort of controlling legislation to regulate pesticides and so on, as we do in Australia. The precautions which one should take should be marked clearly on the labels. In this case we are talking about a huge chemical company which has made millions out of a chemical and which has suppressed information as to its dangers. How are we to do battle with the ICIs, the Dow Chemicals, the Velsicols and all the rest? We will not be able to do it. Those huge companies will suppress the information and claim that because of their own patented manufacturing processes they cannot disclose the actual ingredients of the pesticides and things that they are making. All these chemicals have a detrimental effect. A book called Silent Spring was put out many years ago. I am certain that if the young people who are in the gallery who have not read the book did so it would scare their socks off. </PARA>
<PARA> Various suggestions were made in the 2 January 1989 edition of Time magazine entitled `Planet of the Year-Endangered Earth' as to what we should do about hazardous waste. They included raising the price of garbage collection and toxic waste removal and the penalties for improper disposal as incentive for companies and households to curb the problem at the source. Households should be charged according to the amount of garbage they produce. That is a good idea. I have a compost bin in my backyard. I get rid of all my waste scraps from the kitchen through the biodegrading of that waste for the vegie garden. We should encourage recycling, sharply increase the variety of containers that can be returned to stores or other collection points for cash, raise the reward for returned items, and require households to sort garbage into recyclable and non-recyclable items. We should increase the funding for testing of chemicals to determine their toxicity and cancer causing potential. We should ban ocean dumping and, most importantly, ban the export of waste. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not export any waste. It should be up to the companies that produce it to fix it up. They are the ones creating it; they are the ones who should have the responsibility of making certain they get rid of it. I do not know how they would do this. If they have a process of which one of the by-products is a toxic waste, such as some sort of carcinogenic chemical, maybe they should not produce the product. One could argue that this would ruin our lifestyle and that there would be many beneficial items that we could not use because these items could not be produced without also producing some sort of hazardous waste. But under no circumstances should we allow chemical companies to export their waste. </PARA>
<PARA> One has only to look at the recent headline `EPA Acts on Lead Hazard' in the Age. Buried toxic waste sites are found all over Australia. If people know the location of these sites, they should let us know. We should expose them and have them dug up quickly before they do any harm. I have received a simple letter from a young lady called Jane. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Hazardous wastes should be banned in Australia because they are destroying the environment. We do not need them. We can live without them. </PARA>
<PARA>This letter shows the interest that young people are taking in this topic of dangerous wastes that we are discussing today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill 1989 and the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill 1989. The purpose of these Bills is, first, to establish a permit system for the export and import of hazardous waste and create offences for the unauthorised import and export of such waste; and, secondly, to establish an inventory and assessment system for certain industrial chemicals and create offences for the unauthorised importation or manufacture of those chemicals. While the Opposition supports these Bills, we do have some concern about the possibility that section 31 (2) of the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill 1989 could lead to undue delays and costs to the applicant for assessment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill clearly envisages that an assessment is normally to be made within 90 days. However, section 31 (2) provides for the 90 days to be restated if further information is required. While section 27 allows the applicant to appeal against a request for further information, the appeal process itself could involve substantial delay and extra costs. This procedure has the potential to lead to significant bureaucratic delays in assessing chemicals. We do not propose to seek to amend the Bill at this stage. However, the Opposition will be closely monitoring the administration of the scheme and we will seek to amend the legislation if there are unnecessary delays in assessing chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members would be aware, chemicals are used in a wide variety of industrial processes and are virtually in every commodity, including textiles, paints, plastics, adhesives, cleaners and pesticides. It is estimated that there are 25,000 to 30,000 industrial chemicals in Australia which are formulated into approximately 80,000 trade name chemical products. The community has become increasingly aware in recent times that careless exposure to many of these chemicals can lead to illness and even death. The public as well as workers can be exposed to hazardous chemicals through emissions to air, water and soil from industrial plants; through accidents and spillage during transport, storage and use; through inadequate waste disposal methods; or by ingestion of contaminated food or water. </PARA>
<PARA> Up until now Australian legislative arrangements for managing chemicals have been fragmented. Commonwealth legislation includes clearance processes for agricultural chemicals, veterinary drugs and therapeutics, a scheduling system for drugs and poisons, and customs and quarantine controls. The States have the majority of the powers for controls and restrictions on chemicals. There are many State and Territory Acts and regulations which cover chemicals, including dangerous goods, pesticides and poisons. However, unlike other classes of chemicals, there is no mandatory assessment of industrial chemicals prior to their use in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One important development in relation to the chemical industry was the adoption by the Australian Environment Council (AEC) in 1977 of a national action plan on environmentally hazardous chemicals which provided a system of managing chemicals in Australia. The main AEC strategy was to establish a national notification and assessment scheme. The scheme was to provide a mechanism for evaluating new and in use chemicals. In October 1981, the AEC commenced a voluntary interim notification and assessment scheme for new industrial chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation held an inquiry into the management of potentially hazardous chemicals to health and the environment. The Committee's recommendations included that the mandatory notification and assessment scheme for new chemicals be implemented without delay and that the Commonwealth exercise its full constitutional powers to provide the legislative backing for the scheme as a matter of urgency. In July 1983, the AEC announced that a mandatory chemical notification and assessment scheme would be developed to commence in 1985. In September 1985, the Government announced that it had decided to proceed with the preparation of legislation providing for a national notification and assessment of industrial chemicals scheme and that the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission would administer the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Following increased representation to Government, particularly from major environmental groups, on the need for cooperative action, the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments in late 1987 established the joint task force on intractable waste. It is the subject of the disposal of intractable waste that I wish to draw the House's attention to today. A description of an intractable waste is a substance for which there are no environmentally acceptable disposal facilities currently available in Australia. The term has been applied in general to very stable organo-halogen compounds and particularly organochlorin compounds. Many of these chemicals are suspected of having carcinogenic properties. These compounds include polychlorinated biphenyls-PCBs-alluded to earlier by the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), dioxins and furons; organochlorin pesticides such as DDT and dieldrin; hexachlorobenzene waste from the manufacture of ethylene dichlorides; and chlorofluorocarbons-CFCs. </PARA>
<PARA> Preliminary inquiries by the task force to identify stable organochlorin waste quantities in Australia have revealed 9,100 tonnes of stockpiled materials, 3,000 tonnes of material in service, and a generation rate of 425 tonnes per year. Currently, about 500 tonnes of organochlorin waste per year are being exported from Australia for disposal. The honourable member for Dunkley explained that much of this waste is going overseas, some to Wales and possibly elsewhere. We have recently read of ships on the high seas being diverted from some ports because of the actions of those who are environmentally concerned that those wastes not be disposed of in other countries. It is likely that further investigations will reveal significantly larger quantities of organochlorins requiring destruction, particularly PCB waste. It has been estimated that the current quantity could be doubled. The sources of these wastes include electrical capacitors and transformers in service, contaminated mineral oil in badly flushed transformers, and contaminated soil, particularly in electrical switch roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The task force's terms of reference directed it to consider primarily the need for disposal facilities for intractable wastes. The possible disposal of non-intractable wastes was to be considered as a matter of secondary importance. The task force considered a wide variety of current and potential processes for waste disposal. After considering all options, which included land fill and chemical and biochemical processes, it decided that a fixed, land based, rotary kiln, high temperature incinerator should be established in south-eastern Australia. This was done after a great deal of research both in Australia and overseas. Necessary associated facilities would include a dedicated rail based transport system with ancillary road based collection transport and transfer arrangements. Not only could intractable wastes be destroyed but also some non-intractable wastes known in the jargon as non-BAT wastes. The committee is now involved with phase 2 of its task, which is to choose an alternative site for the high temperature incinerator. Construction of this facility will start towards the end of 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that these toxic wastes have to be treated. It appears that an incinerator should be established because these wastes, much of which are stored in warehouses in Sydney and Melbourne, are day by day becoming a greater risk to residents and the environment. If the honourable member for Dunkley and the Government do not wish these wastes to go overseas, these wastes have to be destroyed and disposed of in our own country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the use of an incinerator using the latest technology would not pose a danger to the community or the environment. However, even though members of the Committee believe there is no danger, it will be very difficult to impart that belief to the community. Unfortunately, people tend to associate an establishment of this type with the Bhopal disaster in India or the explosion at the chemical plant in Texas that occurred today. In view of some of the statements in some publications read out by the honourable member for Dunkley, that fear is understandable. Some of it is warranted and some of it is not, but it is a fear nonetheless. The Bhopal disaster and the United States chemical plant explosion are quite different from what we are talking about with respect to the waste incinerator. </PARA>
<PARA> I am extremely gratified to see that the Committee is composed of people of great experience and that they have conversed and will continue to converse with groups including the environmental lobby, the union movement and many others. Even allowing for this, its task in siting the incinerator will not be easy. I say that because I have had a great deal of experience with people who have tried to establish a toxic waste incinerator in my electorate. The first experience was with a company which wished to place an incinerator at a small railway siding at Bringagee on the Narrandera-Hay railway line. The local people were outraged as the site was very close to the Murrumbidgee River and in a productive primary producing area. In the end, community pressure stopped the construction of the incinerator. </PARA>
<PARA> The next suggestion was that the incinerator should be placed at Mount Gipps, a small railway siding near Broken Hill. The same thing happened, with the community overwhelmingly opposing the development. The State government of the day eventually stopped the proposal going ahead. Selling the incinerator to any community will be very difficult and will take all the skill of those trying to put the case for its establishment. In a nation as large as Australia an extremely isolated location with no habitation could be found, perhaps in central Australia. With all the proper environmental precautions, an airstrip could be built alongside the incinerator and the toxic waste could be flown into the area. I say this because, no matter how safe the incinerator is, when placed near habitation, no matter how sparse, some people will oppose it whether on environmentally political grounds or because of genuine concern.</PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the siting of the incinerator because in the past it has been the practice to consider western New South Wales as a suitable place to dump items not wanted elsewhere. For example, at one stage it was proposed to bury low level radioactive waste near Ivanhoe, which was strongly opposed by the westerners. Now we have the saga of the toxic waste incinerators. We in the west say that if these developments are not harmful, let the waste be buried near Sydney or the incinerator be built in Sydney close to the waste. Of course, this is not a practical answer. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever development is used to dispose of these toxic wastes, it will cost money. I notice that the combined governments have allowed $25m for this project. While I sympathise with the various governments and the committee, I think that the disposal of toxic waste is a national problem and should be viewed in that way. Fortunately, Australia is a large nation and while we have much fertile area where human activities can take place, we also have some very inhospitable country which is not inhabited and which could be used for the placement of the incinerator. Certainly, there will still be those who would oppose this on environmental grounds, but the waste has to be disposed of. If the incinerator is as safe as the committee and others believe, this is the place for it. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that flying the waste into an isolated area is impractical, but I am yet to be convinced. This problem is very real and urgent and it appears that at this stage the incinerator is the most effective and safe way to dispose of toxic waste. However, I was interested to read a press release put out on Friday, 16 June, by Mr Tim Moore, the Minister for Environment in New South Wales. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The State Government today announced a major grant to Sydney University, for research into a new process to clean up environmentally hazardous chemicals and render them harmless. </PARA>
<PARA> Environment Minister . . . said $73,000 had been given to the University's Hazardous Waste Research Project. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Moore said some areas of Sydney were heavily contaminated by toxic chemicals that could last in the environment for thousands of years. The new process being investigated at the University was an exciting development, as it put Australia in the forefront of international attempts to find cheaper, safer ways to dispose of hazardous chemicals than now exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Moore said the SYDOX process developed by the University's Dr James Beattie, Dr Robert Kaziro and Dr Peter Lay, oxidises organochloride waste compounds into harmless inorganic salts. Basically, it broke down the toxic chemicals into salt, baking powder and water. </PARA>
<PARA>It almost sounds too good to be true, but if it is true we have another process which we should investigate. The press release continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Pickard said SYDOX had the potential to treat PCB's-</PARA>
<PARA>probably the most dangerous wastes we have in Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>which had been used in the electricity industry up to 1975. Mr Pickard said for that reason, industry had provided over $60,000 in funds for the University's project. He said the electricity industry must not only be efficient, it must also be conscious of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Moore and Mr Pickard stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The State Government has a positive and balanced approach to solving the environmental issues faced by New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This project complements the move by the Government towards a high temperature incinerator for intractable chemical waste in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, I reiterate that, as the honourable member for Dunkley said, if we create waste we have to dispose of it. It will not be a cheap system. Those who create the waste have some responsibility to get rid of it. However, after reading the Committee's report, I believe that the Government should be in charge of the whole operation. However, I also believe that should the incinerator be built-it seems that such technology should be used; it is the most up-to-date technology-it should be placed in a very isolated area with very little access to it. One problem with disposing of the toxic waste is that we have to transport it to where it is to be incinerated. That is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to make sure that our country remains environmentally sound, we must use the opportunity to develop some new technology in the disposal and transport of waste. I implore members of the committee and the New South Wales, Victorian and Commonwealth governments which have representatives on it not to send their waste to western New South Wales. We have already twice been through that process. We do not want to go through it again. Whether the process is safe or not, it is very hard to convince people with a very real fear of its safety. If it is to be placed anywhere, it should be placed in one of the most isolated places in Australia where the gases from the flues can be disseminated, I suppose I could say--</PARA>

The site for the incinerator should be not only isolated, but also barely inhabited, if at all. The site should be such that we would not have to go through the process of holding up the scheme because we have to get rid of those toxic wastes. It is becoming a very urgent problem and anything that holds up the project should be dealt with immediately. Once again, we do not want the incinerator in western New South Wales. It is not a matter of putting it in someone else's backyard. We do not want it in Victoria or New South Wales, which are heavily populated States. We want it in one of the most isolated regions in Australia. Surely with the size of our country, we can find a solution to the problem. Surely we can find a geographic location where the problems would be minimal so that we can overcome this very real environmental threat.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill and the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill. Both these pieces of legislation are timely. Indeed, they provide further evidence of the deeply held commitment of this Government to improving the quality of life of all Australians. The legislation builds on a very fine and good record in environmental matters, a record of which this Government can be justifiably and rightly proud. In no small measure, it is a reflection of the positions held by various Ministers with responsibility for the environment in the term of the Hawke Government. I remind the House of things such as the Franklin River, Kakadu National Park, the Great Barrier Reef National Park, saving the wet tropical forests in Queensland and the World Heritage listings of same, and so on. This Government clearly has this conviction; it clearly has the will and the way to implement the policies necessary to see that the quality of life and environmental protection are very real parts of Australia, very real parts of the psyche of every Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, this legislation is important and, as I said, timely. How many times would honourable members have turned on their television sets or picked up their newspapers only to see or hear reports of accidents involving trucks carrying contaminated toxic waste of some description? How many people in this age of environmental awareness can honestly say that they do not from time to time see reports in the media or hear people talking about toxic wastes being disposed of through the sewerage systems of Sydney, Melbourne, the other capital cities, and indeed the major cities of this country? How many people can honestly say that they do not believe this practice is inappropriate and that there is a need to clamp down on it?</PARA>
<PARA> It is not often that I and other members on this side of the House have a fond word to say about a conservative government. However, I have to say that the Greiner Government in New South Wales, through Tim Moore, the Minister for Environment, has looked at this issue and is doing something about it. For that I commend him. What I would say to people such as Tim Moore and Senator Richardson, the Federal Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, and to people in all levels of government, is that it should not necessarily be their role to do something about this. It should be the role of the companies-the chemical companies and so on to which my colleague the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) referred earlier-to take a more active position in the whole issue of improving our living environment and our quality of life. After all, the executives and shareholders of those companies have to live on this planet as well. If they want an appropriate quality of life they should look at the profit margins they are handing down and say, `Perhaps we should carve off some of that money and put it back into research and development into environmental quality. Perhaps we should plough it back into looking at the sorts of chemicals that are being produced. Perhaps we should look at ways in which they can be made biodegradable. Perhaps we should look at ways in which our quality of life will not be damaged by man's continuing onslaught on the environment'. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill has a number of purposes, but principally it is to establish a national scheme for the notification and assessment of industrial chemicals to protect people at work, the public and the environment from the harmful effects of those chemicals. As all honourable members are aware, the scheme is known as NICNAS, that is, the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme. Because I come from an industrial centre in Australia, the Illawarra region, I can well and truly identify with the basic aims and thrusts of this legislation. I can understand why it is so important to ensure that protection is afforded to workers in industrial workplaces. Equally, of course, I can see the benefits that flow from protecting our environmental heritage in the regions of Australia in which industry in particular is located. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been indicated already during the debate, this legislation is to apply to industrial chemicals that are imported into or manufactured in Australia. It will apply to individual chemical substances but not to mixtures or formulations. The interesting aspect of the legislation is that its control is to lie with the States, and I will have more to say about that in a moment. All new chemicals have to be notified and assessed prior to importation and manufacture, which is appropriate. I believe the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) went through the number of chemicals that are presently being manufactured. As I understand it, something in excess of 100,000 individual industrial chemicals are in commercial use worldwide; over 30,000 of those are used in Australia and are found in a bewildering number of chemical products. Is it any wonder that there is concern out there in Australia about disposal of the toxic wastes that come from those products and, indeed, concern amongst the manufacturers themselves, as rightly there should be?</PARA>
<PARA> The assessment process will identify controls and precautions that are necessary for the safe use of all these chemicals. As I have indicated, the State and Territory governments will have responsibility for enforcing the controls and precautions. So for constitutional reasons, it is okay for this Government to identify and bring down these notification and assessment Bills. However, there is a role for State governments as well. That role is to carry out the enforcement procedures. Again, I can only refer to what has been done in New South Wales by Minister Moore and the department he administers through the State Pollution Control Commission and commend him for the initiatives that have been displayed in New South Wales. They are appropriate, but more can always be done. I would hope that, once the legislation has been passed, having received bipartisan support within the Commonwealth Parliament, the States will accept responsibility for enforcing the controls and precautions. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the process of notification and assessment that will be undertaken is an inventory process. The Australian inventory of chemical substances is a list of all existing industrial chemicals. It has two basic sections, namely, a confidential section and a non-confidential section. The new industrial chemical is a chemical that is not on that inventory; it is added to the inventory five years after assessment. Those processes are included to protect the companies' manufacturing rights. As far as the procedure for assessing these new chemicals is concerned, the importer or manufacturer is required to apply for an assessment certificate. The application must be accompanied by a notification statement setting out technical information on the chemical. The information required is specified in the schedule to this Bill, and I will not go into that in any detail. Within 90 days an assessment report must be provided on all the information. As indicated by the honourable member for Riverina-Darling in his contribution, there is an opportunity for the Minister to extend that period by up to a further 90 days. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I am concerned, the most important part of this legislation is the public accountability provision. NICNAS will be the first chemicals review mechanism to be publicly accountable. Earlier I mentioned the problems of spillage and of vehicles transporting toxic waste and other chemicals occasionally having accidents. If a spillage occurs in a residential area, people may have to be evacuated from their homes, and so on. Through the processes under this legislation there will be public accountability, which has been sadly lacking in the past. That is in contrast to other notification schemes, which do not publish the results of their assessment. Let me outline what I mean by that. For each assessment a summary of the assessment report will be published. A copy of the full assessment report, with only the confidential information deleted, will be available to the public on request. In addition, the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act will operate to release more detailed information. So it is covered in all ways. That information will be publicly available for assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> What sort of information is out there in the public domain? Firstly, there is the name or names by which the chemical is known to the public or is intended by its importer or manufacturer to be so known. How many times in the past have various formulations of the same chemical been marketed under different names or disguised under different names without people being aware of them? That information now must be publicly disclosed. People will have the opportunity to know that a particular product is manufactured by one manufacturer or imported by one manufacturer and that it is being marketed under a variety of names. </PARA>
<PARA> The second piece of information that will become known to the general public is a chemical's general uses. Again, that is clearly in the public interest. Thirdly, information will be required on the precautions and restrictions observed in the manufacture, handling, storage, use and disposal of a chemical. No-one could argue with any of those requirements. Next, there will be recommendations arising from the assessment of a chemical under this Bill that relates to disposing of the chemical and rendering it harmless. My colleague the honourable member for Dunkley went to the heart of the problem, the concerns of many people, not only in Australia but worldwide, about the disposal of toxic chemicals and toxic waste. I agree with him 100 per cent. We should not export the waste of this country and make it a burden on some other country. All governments in this country need to get together in the way advanced by the honourable member for Riverina-Darling, with the bipartisan approach being shown to this legislation, and ensure that whatever solution is devised is acceptable in the public forum. I am sure that it will be. </PARA>
<PARA> Other information which must become public as part of this accountability process includes the procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency involving the chemical. Again I go back to the examples I have used. What about Bhopal? What about the problems caused in India then? What about the compensation that had to be paid, and what about the loss of life? No-one can ever be compensated for loss of life. So it is important that, where emergencies are involved, clear, concise emergency procedures be put in place. This is particularly so in industrial areas where hazardous chemicals and wastes are a matter of everyday life. I am sure that my colleague on the other side of the House at the moment, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie), would agree that there are parts of Sydney, for example, where industrial manufacturing processes and refineries and so on are clustered where these sorts of emergency procedures must be put in place. Indeed, the State Government has worked on doing exactly that. </PARA>
<PARA> There must also be prescribed physical and chemical data about the chemical itself, and there must be prescribed data relating to the health effects of the environmental effects of the chemical. So under the public accountability criteria of this legislation there will be the chance for people who have a concern about the importation or manufacture of a particular chemical under this legislation to see what chemical properties are contained within it, what procedures of an emergency nature are to be put in place, how it can be disposed of in a harmless fashion, its general uses and so on. Again, I emphasise that in my view the public accountability process is the most important part of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned that confidential sections would be deleted from the public record. That is the case because, as I think we all recognise, there is sensitive commercial information that needs to be maintained in confidence. The Bill recognises that that is the case. There is a route for gaining the confidential status of information, and that is to apply under section 75 to get exemption. Again I do not see any problem with that. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look back at industrial areas-again I will use an example from my region-we can see how, by working through a solution to a very complex problem, we can come to a real outcome that is appropriate for our environment, and for improving our standard of living and our living environment together. I speak in particular about a proposal recently announced by the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) and the Water Board in Wollongong, at Port Kembla. The proposal there is, through a process within the Water Board system itself, to reprocess effluent and mix it with some of the less toxic substances emanating from the steelworks, together with some natural soil base and other fill, and use it as a base within the steelworks itself at Port Kembla for beautification projects. It is proposed that thousands of trees will be planted, using this material that has been regenerated for a more appropriate environmental use. I think we will see from that a real example of how issues raised under this broad heading of the legislation we are dealing with tonight can be dealt with for the benefit of local residents. The environment of a workplace can be improved and, after all, that is one of the major considerations of this legislation. In fact, this can lead to a better quality of life in an industrial centre. I wish BHP and the Water Board every success in implementing that proposal. It is worth while. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I want to say something about an issue raised by both the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) and the honourable member for Dunkley. They were talking about what was described by the honourable member for Macquarie as environmental taxes and by the honourable member for Dunkley as a `tech tax', which is a very catchy phrase which might be picked up, given that we are talking about NICNAS and all sorts of other things in this legislation. This is appropriate in a certain set of circumstances, and I would think those circumstances would be if we had to force industry, chemical companies, petrochemical companies and so on into putting something back in terms of improving the environment and doing something about toxic wastes and chemical spills, generally cleaning up the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> One would hope, however, that in this age of environmental awakening we would not necessarily need to have the Government resort to this sort of process. One would hope, as I said a little earlier, that corporations-many of them multinationals-and individual companies might just see that there is something to be gained in their own environment from improving the quality of life for their local workers but, more importantly, from improving the environmental quality of this planet, and therefore put dollars into doing the research work and the sort of work necessary to dispose of toxic waste and do all the sorts of things being outlined in this legislation. I am not suggesting for a minute that the proposals for environmental taxes should not be seriously considered. In fact, in New South Wales now an additional $80 a year-and I am not too enthusiastic about this-is levied on the Water Board rates charged by the State Government for residents of the Illawarra, Sydney and the Blue Mountains to clean up Sydney's effluent problem. But there is no problem in Wollongong; the beaches there are superb. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Possibly in Cronulla. Certainly we are being charged this $80 environment tax by the Greiner Government to look after the mess that is evident on Sydney's beaches. So that is one example of such a tax already. Of course that money is going towards trying to do something, although I did notice that the latest brainstorm of the Minister for Environment in New South Wales, Tim Moore, is to turn back the tide, as it were, and duplicate all of the effluent disposal systems in Sydney and process the effluent so that it can all be turned inland to the west and so on. I wish him luck with that. The cost will be horrendous. I am not sure whether he has worked out how he will do it, but I wish him luck. The point is that at some stage in the future it may well be that governments, whether they be State or Federal, do have to look seriously at environmental taxes. I am particularly pleased to see that it is members of the Opposition who are putting forward such propositions. In this present climate of debate about lower taxes and so on, I am pleased to see that at least there is one member of the Opposition prepared to stand up and be counted and suggest putting on a tax to improve environmental quality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation is timely. It is further evidence of the commitment of this Government to improving quality of life for all Australians. Because of the bipartisan support for this legislation, I believe it will receive the overwhelming support of people in Australia-indeed the world-and I wish it every success in its passage through the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the features of this debate has been the enthusiasm of all the contributors from both sides of the House. It is important that we realise the measure before the House has bipartisan support. Earlier speakers in this debate, such as my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton), were apparently intent on talking about who had done the most work on the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation in 1982. This is specious and nonsensical in this sort of debate. I thought that I had mentioned all the members of the committees of the Thirty-first and Thirty-second Parliaments, but anyone who is interested in this subject can go ahead and read about it. One of the great problems of a government, whether State or Federal, is getting people to read more than just the newspaper headlines when it comes to environmental matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very important that we have come today to the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill. The coalition has already declared that it has decided to support this Bill. I do not intend to speak to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill; merely to this one. I would hope that when a decision is being reached as to whether there should be an incinerator and where it should be placed, whoever is in government-and I hope it is those of us on this side-will ensure that this is a subject of great debate in this House before the final decision is made. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) and the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) speak strongly on these issues. When we reach that stage of our deliberations in this Parliament we must take care to listen to some of the experts who have not yet been announced. I refer, of course, to geographers. We are talking about wind and flow, and what have you and, obviously, before anything like this can be placed-it is not a case of putting it where it will only damage some kangaroos or koalas, or in a place where it will damage a few trees or something else-we have to work out air flows, the stability of the land mass and all these things before we proceed. I genuinely believe that we have to debate these issues in this Parliament and not just outside on the hustings. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some technical aspects of the legislation which cause the Opposition some hope. There was a wish that they be amended. I must confess at this stage that I do not know whether they have been amended or not. If they have not been, I believe they will be looked at much more carefully and directly in the Senate. However, I strongly support the amendment to be moved by my colleague the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) in which he puts the case that when the Crown is the owner of waste material, the Crown should be prosecuted. We believe that it is not enough for the Crown to be merely bound by the legislation. It is important that where appropriate the Crown and its agencies must be liable to prosecution. If the Government does not accept the amendment I wait with interest to hear the reasons for not doing so from the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), who is at the table. I shall not proceed with further details because Hansard will show that my colleague from Tasmania has covered these points very well and fully in his speech. As the digest of the Bill before the House says:</PARA>
<PARA> Hazardous waste has become the focus of increasing public interest in recent years. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed it has. The interest and concern is very properly international. Our attitude to the importing and exporting of intractable waste is fundamental to any environmental policy which may come forth from this Parliament. The Minister mentioned in his second reading speech that on 22 March 1989 a United Nations Environment Program convention, held in Switzerland, was unanimously adopted by all governments represented there on the control of trans-boundary movements of hazardous waste. I congratulate this Government and the Minister on taking an active role in drawing up the convention. Surely, a matter as serious as this, with the universal requirement of saving our planet, must go beyond individual, domestic party policies or ideological international differences. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the matter does not finish here. As the Minister said, several of the obligations of the convention fall within the responsibilities of our State and Territory governments. This puts a large responsibility onto them, and I am sure they will be cooperative. They have to be cooperative on this issue. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) pay tribute to Tim Moore, the New South Wales Minister for Environment. I know that the progressive and forceful policies of that Minister have shown a progress in matters relating to the control of environmental abuse not known before. I am not being party political when I say this. I am putting to the House that we are very lucky in New South Wales. I speak as someone who has been an environmentalist all his life, and that is a long time now. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put on record the tremendous dedication of Minister Tim Moore to clearing up the horrible abuses that have taken place in the Sydney metropolitan area over a very long time under governments of every colour and inclination. Politically one of the problems we have to face is that too often with current information, with scientific knowledge gleaned recently, we are too quick to criticise the actions of people who went before us, who did not have access to the scientific or other environmental information. This goes right across the board of environmental matters, not just hazardous waste. I must say-and I can be political in this chamber; I suppose that is what we are here for-that it is extremely disappointing to notice that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has turned his back on any cooperation with the New South Wales Government's plan to find solutions to the gross pollution of Bondi Beach. </PARA>

It is a disgrace that a modern city in this day and age has to put up with it. We will see what will happen. I hope that this does not presage similar attitudes from the Treasurer on the need for cooperation federally on matters relating to the disposal and control of intractable hazardous wastes from any part of Australia. One would have hoped that the opportunity would have been taken by the Government to debate this Bill in this House to establish what could well be a bipartisan approach to the domestic control of these particular wastes and to give some lead as to what finances may be anticipated and what should be available. I suppose, in reality, as this Government will only be here for a matter of months, we should be working out what Senator Puplick has to say about these issues as much as what the present Government has to say. Whatever the scene, we must have a truly national outlook in controlling hazardous waste materials throughout Australia.

If this should be the case in the future, and provided the right technology is available and is applied, perhaps there is a role in the future for Australia to have its own Pontypool. As all honourable members who are interested in the environment will know, the plant in this south Welsh town is operated by the Rechem company and, together with a plant in Fawley near Southampton in England, treats something like 40,000 tonnes of waste a year. Honourable members will realise, after I have given them some figures later, that this is just a mere drop in the whole problem. To get the technical side out of the way: I have been informed that the actual plant is a liquid injection incinerator and wastes are converted into a fine spray via a burner and then ignited to provide a stable flame for the end disposal of the formerly intractable material. Though the English academic J. H. Sparrow was referring to dogs when he referred to that indefatigable and unsavoury engine of pollution, I believe we can apply the term to the constant creation of hazardous waste by so-called advanced industrial activity. The solution to this problem of international trade is not a simple one. It is not a problem that has a simple solution. It is not a problem that can be solved by any unilateral action being taken by any one country. It has to have the cooperation of all nations, both rich and poor, both developed and undeveloped, and both heavily populated and sparsely populated. I quote from the Bible. Matthew 7.13 says:</PARA>
<PARA> Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction. </PARA>
<PARA>It is understood that Matthew did not have in mind hazardous waste, but it does us well to realise that, unless there is international commitment to controlling this awful trade, then we have opened a very wide and broad gate to environmental destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> About a year ago Newsweek magazine had a remarkable article on the global poison trade. It described how toxic waste is dumped on the Third World. A member of the environmental group Greenpeace said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is morally reprehensible for an industrialised nation to be forcing developing nations into this choice between poison and poverty. </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring, of course, to the reported use of such tiny nations as Guinea-Bissau as places which could accept untreated intractable waste as a means of improving their international financial position without any regard for its effect on their local people. One of the tragic statements in this article was from the Minister for Tourism and Trade of this small undeveloped country who, when asked why they had agreed to accept this untreated waste, simply said, `We need the money'. </PARA>
<PARA> We are starting to see a history of large profit making by unscrupulous people at the expense of poor underprivileged countries. We have already seen a history of gross carelessness by industrial countries. We have seen the problem being presented to us in graphic form of who collects this sinister garbage. As a West German waste disposal expert said:</PARA>
<PARA>Toxic waste is a big lucrative business-for the recipient countries too. </PARA>
<PARA>Another international commentator said:</PARA>
<PARA> When ignorance is coupled with greed, the situation can be lethal. </PARA>
<PARA>If we wonder at the immensity of this problem, an interesting figure is that each year over 700,000 tonnes of intractable industrial garbage is exported by West Germany alone. </PARA>
<PARA> Many aspects of this Bill will have to be given more consideration than the debate today will allow. The need for destruction of all our industrial waste has to be looked at with some vision of the future. It is fashionable at the moment to say that nothing has been done, but there has been an awakening in recent years. For those of us who have been coming to Canberra for many years, it is good to know that the monstrous burning of tyres which used to take place once or twice a year in this fair city does not now occur. The great poisonous black smoke that used to hang over Canberra for days while all the tyres were being burnt has gone. Similar situations are happening all around the world; but it is not enough. There has to be greater cooperation and coordination between countries. </PARA>
<PARA> It is significant that we are not an importer of toxic wastes at the present time. Although there have been some differences of opinion as to whether high temperature waste disposal facilities should be established in Australia, or at least where they should be sited, one can only hope that disputes do not stop us progressing to an intelligent solution. One awaits with great interest and concern the outcome of a current tripartite inquiry involving the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria. No doubt we will all have much more to say on this subject once the results of this inquiry are known. The preliminary report issued in July last year shows that the issues are being correctly identified. With 39 major recommendations in the task force's preliminary report, one can confidently anticipate that sound and acceptable solutions will or at least should be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> I have every confidence that neither Australia nor Australians will become involved in any unsafe transportation of this hazardous international garbage, and that no Australian government would approve of such a situation. I have confidence in Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd, which plays a large part in the transportation of Australia's toxic waste to Pontypool. However, it is still necessary for us to be a signatory to the Basel Convention. It is still necessary for us to play a positive role in coordinating and encouraging not only all the governments of Australia but all the governments within our sphere of influence to view this problem seriously and in a cohesive manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that in my own area of Sydney we have had oil spills and cyanide being accidentally or carelessly dropped in the Cooks River. The last State Government in New South Wales was trying like mad to have an area at Kurnell between two pristine national parks in my electorate of Cook made into a toxic industry area. I objected to this intrusion. I also objected to the fact that nowhere near enough thought had been put in by the then State Government to the siting and level of noxious industries and the disposal of its waste. I am pleased to say that I had some input into Minister Moore's awareness of the Kurnell problem. </PARA>
<PARA> If the international problem of intractable waste is not handled soundly, humanely and with firmness, then we are up against what could be said to be a non-combatant chemical warfare worse than the chemical warfare that happened in the Iran-Iraq war and upon which the superpowers are now congratulating themselves on their declared but as yet unfulfilled promises to eradicate all instruments of chemical warfare. It should be clearly understood that the illegal movement of deadly hazardous waste is no less challenging to the welfare of the planet. We would expect the major powers to become as interested in controlling the disposal of this hazardous waste as they have been in destroying stockpiles of chemical weapons. I hope that the debate we have had today is the first of many. I hope that the many pieces of legislation coming into this House will do much to improve in a practical way the environmental ecology of our planet. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank those honourable members who have participated in this wide-ranging debate in respect of these very important Bills, the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill and the Hazardous Waste (Regulations of Exports and Imports) Bill. Mention was made of the delay in the introduction of the legislation. The delay was due exclusively to the exhaustive process of consultation that has taken place on this issue. It was necessary, and I believe it has been productive. There has been widespread support for the Bill to give effect to a national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme. That is evident from the speeches that we have heard in the House both this afternoon and on the earlier occasion when the Bill was debated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The scheme is necessary to correct the inadequacies in information and regulatory systems covering industrial chemicals in Australia. At present, Australians, unlike our major trading partners, do not have a scheme providing them with information about potential health and environmental hazards from industrial chemicals either in use or likely to be used by industry. The scheme will form a vital component in an overall chemical safety management strategy for Australia. The notification and assessment of chemicals will improve the efficiency of other elements of this overall strategy such as labelling, provision of material safety data sheets, and education and training. The assessment of industrial chemicals under the scheme will provide objective information about potential hazards and will contribute to safer workplaces and to a cleaner environment. The scheme will also contribute to improved consumer protection and reduced chemical pollution. The information will be made available to the public and to workers. Decisions made under the scheme may be subject to review by the director of the scheme or by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on application by industry or by interested organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in the second reading speech, the scheme will be administered by Worksafe Australia-the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission-a tripartite body with representatives from industry, unions and State and Commonwealth governments. The scheme will involve extensive coordination by three Commonwealth departments-the Department of Industrial Relations, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, and the Department of Community Services and Health. In this way concerns relating to occupational health and safety, the environment and public health will be effectively addressed and coordinated so that a rational approach to problems raised may be taken and duplication of effort avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> While mindful of the mosaic of regulation already imposed on the chemicals industry, the Government believes that this scheme will provide positive advantages to industry: a single notification regime will be established; compliance will be easier and quicker; requirements will be clearly established; and all Australian jurisdictions will be satisfied at the one time. The information resulting from the assessment process will be available to State and Territory governments and will enable them to develop uniform regulatory regimes, thereby reducing the burdens upon industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) raised the importance of ensuring that hazards of chemicals assessed overseas are considered, given that Australian circumstances may be quite different. Let me say that the Government strongly endorses this point. Indeed, the Bill provides for this to occur. While clause 44 seeks to minimise duplication of overseas assessments, these assessments will not be adopted if they are inappropriate. Requirements for chemicals on overseas inventories will be determined on a case by case basis. It is a fact that the Business Regulation Review Unit at one stage proposed modifications to the scheme. However, these concerns have been overcome through consultation. The Unit now strongly supports the Bill. Indeed, the Director of the Unit has expressed his support for the Bill in a letter to the Chief Executive of Worksafe in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>In the Bill we have a model for regulation which offers improved assurances of safety to the community at large and to the work force while minimising bureaucratic cost impositions. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the Government's intention that the commitment of industry and trade unions to this scheme be maintained and their involvement continued. To this end an advisory committee will be established within the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. The major effects of the scheme will be evident in the areas of occupational health and safety and protection of the environment. Overall, we believe that real benefit will follow because the legislation will encourage uniformity of regulation by the States and Territories. It will require those introducing penalties to know their products and to be aware of the chemicals' identity and properties. It will increase rational debate in the community on chemicals issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) raised the statement by the Australian Institute of Petroleum relating to the 90-day time frame. The inclusion of the existing 90-day time frame imposes a significant burden on the Government. No timeframes are imposed under similar legislation-for example, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1989. Every possible effort has been made to balance the concerns of industry about delays in importation and manufacture while an assessment is being carried out with those of government to ensure a workable scheme. Bluntly, a shorter time frame is unachievable. While there are provisions to appeal requests for further information, and thus extend the 90-day time frame, it would not be in the best interests of the industry to mount frequent appeals. It is a costly and time consuming process. It would not be in the best interests of the public, workers using chemicals or the Government to perform assessments hurriedly. </PARA>
<PARA> In my second reading speech I announced that a tripartite advisory committee involving State and Territory governments, industries and unions would be set up inside the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. I referred to it again a few moments ago. I envisage that the timeliness of assessments will be discussed by this committee. If a consistent pattern of delays occurs, the matter can be taken up with the Ministers. Notifiers can help to facilitate timely assessments by ensuring that their application is complete, accurate and internally consistent. Only the director of the scheme can formally request additional information. It is not possible for the request to be made solely on the whim of an individual assessor. As I said, I thank those honourable members who have participated in this important debate. We welcome the support of the Opposition, especially the honourable member for Bass, for this legislation. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The effect of the amendment is to make it possible for the Crown not to be absolved from being able to be prosecuted. I understand that the Government has agreed to that proposal. I thank the Government for so doing. The reason, of course, is that in these days of statutory activity, with government corporations being involved in a whole range of activities, we believe that the Crown should not be able to hide behind Crown immunity. I thank the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) for the remarks he made in his summing up of the second reading debate on the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill. I underline yet again the importance of this legislation and the importance that the Opposition places in this legislation. I did criticise the length of the delay in the legislation being considered by the House. Be that as it may, I welcome it wholeheartedly, as does every Opposition member. </PARA>
<PARA> The thoughtful remarks by the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie), who is the chairman of the Opposition's environment committee, were notable. He has been chairman of that committee for a long time. I know that he feels that this legislation is a milestone for the nation. It will put into place a regulatory system which has been embraced by the Business Regulation Review Unit. It was encouraging to hear the quotation by the Minister from a letter written by the Director of the Unit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989 will implement some of the measures announced in the 1989-90 Budget and the 1989 April economic statement and other minor administrative changes which resulted from those measures. The main measures are the introduction of new arrangements to determine whether recipients of certain social security payments are in a de facto relationship; the introduction of a waiting period for unemployment benefit where recipients move to an area that reduces their chances of gaining employment; the provision that unemployment and sickness benefits will not be payable to those who do not provide their tax file numbers; changes in the education leaver deferment period; the tightening of the recovery procedure where a person receives both compensation and benefits; some minor administrative changes for the child support scheme; and changes to the income testing arrangements for the family allowance and family allowance supplement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps the most contentious and complex amendment contained in the legislation relates to the definition of `de facto relationships'. The concept of a de facto spouse is relevant to many areas of the social security system and even beyond that. For example, it is found in the Immigration Act, the Family Law Act and other legislation as well as social security legislation. It is, however, of particular importance in the area of supporting benefits because we have seen over the last 30 years or so a pronounced change in the social mores and people's attitudes towards de facto relationships as distinct from de jure relationships. A hundred years ago marriages were regarded as a lifetime experience. Regrettably, we are now seeing marriages breaking down at the rate of one in three. I have not seen statistics for the breakdown of de facto relationships. I suppose one could claim that the definition of `de facto' makes it almost impossible to achieve any statistical base. Nevertheless, relationships between people change on a very regular basis. One of the most fundamental problems facing social security administrators is how one can determine on a fairly regular basis whether people are entitled to the benefits they are claiming. </PARA>
<PARA> A de facto spouse is defined to be a person of the opposite sex who is living as the spouse of the applicant on a bona fide domestic basis. The determination of whether this is occurring has led to many difficulties, largely based on the vast range of relationships that may exist between people of the opposite sex who may cohabit. The lack of a purely objective test-such a test may not be possible-results in many claims that people are living in de facto relationships while receiving the supporting parent's benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> To clarify this situation, on 30 June 1988 182,007 people received a supporting parent's benefit, an increase of nearly 3,000 on the previous year. There were 95,369 new grants of benefit and 90,565 terminations during that period. Of the terminations 11,810, or some 13 per cent, were due to the person living in a de facto relationship. In some cases, of course, an old relationship had been renewed. </PARA>
<PARA> In Budget Paper No. 1 it is estimated that the supporting parent's benefit will cost over $2.236 billion in 1989-90, an increase of nearly 5 per cent over the previous year. The Government's attempt to define de facto relationships has caused some concern among various sectors of the community and among welfare groups in particular. The Opposition has received-as, no doubt, has the Government-numerous representations from welfare organisations as well as sole parent associations. I hope that the Government has taken some consideration of those. </PARA>
<PARA> Many groups-in particular, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Women's Electoral Lobby and the National Women's Consultative Council, which is the Government's principal mechanism for consulting with women in the community-have criticised the Government's proposals. The main concerns include the continuing confusion over the definition of `de facto relationship' as it appears in a range of State and Federal legislation. This legislation seeks to provide a series of very specific indicia to determine whether or not a bona fide domestic relationship exists. These would affect all pensioners and beneficiaries, presumably including age pensioners. The Secretary, through this legislation, will have regard to a number of matters upon which to base his decision. These include financial aspects, the nature of the household, social aspects of the relationship, any sexual relationship and the nature of the people's commitment to each other. One could say, I think, that these are extremely complex issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation may be seen by age pensioners as yet another example of government interference. They may regard it as a gross invasion of their privacy, especially if their living arrangements are being investigated. It can be argued that the proposed changes will not prevent those who lie in order to receive fraudulently a pension or benefit from continuing to do so. I would concede that almost any attempt to tighten up in areas of potential abuse will meet this obvious criticism. The issues raised are of legitimate concern. However, we support the Government's intentions to tighten up on an area of social security-in fact, in the entire system of social security-where there is evidence to suggest that an unacceptable level of abuse is taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has no wish to disadvantage people who are not breaking the rules. For that reason we will seek the assurance of the Minister that the appeal mechanisms will be fairly administered. The Opposition will continue to monitor the effects of the definitions, especially in relation to de facto relationships, contained in this legislation and review the legislative impact of those changes when we are in government. In addition, there is the consideration that this is a Budget Bill, and on those grounds we will not oppose the legislation. As I said, it is fundamentally part of the Budget package. According to the Government, it is proposed that once these measures come into force on 1 January 1990 they will save some $8m this financial year and $29m in the full financial year 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of unemployment benefit, which is also one of the areas in which this legislation contains some administrative changes to access. The legislation will amend the Act so that people moving without specific reason to an area with higher unemployment than the one they left, or who otherwise reduce their chances of gaining employment by moving, will be subject to a 12-week waiting period for the benefit. The coalition recognises that this is an aspect of social security that is also being abused. We believe it is simply not good enough that people who are having difficulty finding employment can move to regions in which their employment opportunities are severely reduced. That is not a difficult thing to determine because the structure of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) and the Department of Social Security across Australia is such that it is possible to determine in advance whether a person is a bona fide job seeker or is simply trying to use the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation allows for education leavers to reapply for job search allowance (JSA) or unemployment benefit after four weeks as compared with 13 weeks for the first application. The coalition believes that people should not be encouraged to leave education and expect to receive government support at the full level until they have their first job. Therefore, under the Liberal-National Party proposals contained in our Economic Action Plan announced last week we will not be providing the full unemployment benefit but only the JSA for persons over the age of 18 who are attending universities or tertiary education centres until they have graduated and sought and obtained their first job. We do not see the provision of unemployment benefit as an adequate alternative to enable persons who in most cases are receiving public support through the Austudy program simply to drop out of their studies for whatever reason-other than illness, of course-and then expect to be a cost to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe, frankly, that the unemployment benefit scheme in its current form is in need of significant reform. Last week we announced the coalition's unemployment relief scheme. Unlike the Government, we do not regard the indefinite receipt of unemployment benefit as an adequate alternative to employment. Our policy will provide unemployment benefit for a maximum of nine months. It should be remembered that the unemployment benefit was originally introduced as a temporary income supplement or support measure between jobs. Quite clearly, today this intention has been distorted, despite the fact that in recent years there has been a considerable increase in employment. I should just like to cite some particularly pertinent statistics contained in the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) submission to the Government before the last Budget. ACOSS made the point that if existing employment trends continue `it will still take another 10 years of labour market growth at the rate of the past five years to see the unemployment rate fall to approximately 2.5 per cent'. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that it is the objective of all parties that full employment should once again be on the Australian political agenda. What ACOSS pointed out in that submission is quite clear: unless we can do better than we have over the last seven years-and that is not denying that there has been a significant improvement in employment over that period-the fact of the matter is that we are looking at at least another 10 years of high unemployment benefit payments. It is the view of the Opposition that, in view of the very difficult and critical economic circumstances facing Australia, we simply cannot afford another 10 years without significant reforms to our unemployment system. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore believe that the provision of unemployment benefit for an indefinite period to people who are employable reduces the urgency of the job search and that an individual is likely to choose leisure over independent income, provided that income support in the form of government benefits is continuously available. The work test arrangements are often difficult to verify, enabling the indefinite receipt of benefit by individuals despite individual efforts by government to require them to seek employment. A Liberal-National Party government will provide intensive joint interviews and assessments of the unemployed by the Department of Social Security (DSS) and the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) and a range of job training programs will be available for the unemployed and the disadvantaged. Our unemployment relief policy seeks to maximise the application of available staff resources in the Department of Social Security and also DEET to assist the unemployed to the maximum extent possible during the first nine months. It will result in a lowering of overall unemployment, a significant reduction in expenditure and a consequent increase in revenue from income tax collection. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government has any comment to make on this issue, it is to answer the fundamental question which it raised itself in its feeble response to our successful policy launch. The Government said that there were savings to be made in the area of unemployment benefit. If that is the case, we have to ask: why is the Government not making them? In fact, the Treasurer in his feeble attempt to demonstrate that our costings were wrong actually provided a document which suggests that the Government alone accepts that at least 20 per cent of current unemployment beneficiaries could be removed from the system. Therefore I ask: Why are they not being removed from the system? I go through the numerous press releases of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), who in recent months has been making much about the success of the Newstart program. That is a very interesting analysis, because the Newstart program demonstrates that the Government is removing from unemployment benefit between 25 per cent and 34 per cent of long term unemployed. Not all those people are going back into the labour market, but the important thing is that they are removing themselves from unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> How was that achieved? By the simple process of writing a letter. On that basis alone, about 6 per cent did not even turn up for interviews. As a result, they were automatically removed. The remainder did turn up for interviews. They were then placed in training programs or other arrangements were made for them. The quite spectacular success of the program directed at the long term unemployed-and I remind the House that this is people who have been unemployed for over 12 months and in some cases for as long as 10 years-makes one seriously question the definition in Australia of `labour market', which comprises people who are in employment and who are available for employment. I honestly believe that no-one in this House would delude himself into believing that someone could seriously be unemployed for up to 10 years and still regard himself as being available for employment. One can only conclude that such a person has placed himself in a position that can be best described as being geographically inaccessible to such an extent that no jobs are available and that he therefore proposes to trade indefinitely on the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Precisely because of that, we believe that the principles of the Newstart program should be brought forward from 12 months to three months. ACOSS work and other worthwhile analyses of the psychology of unemployment demonstrate clearly that people are far more active in their own search for jobs in those early months of unemployment. Quite the reverse, we are told, takes place for people who have been unemployed for over 12 months. Consequently, we are absolutely confident that, with a more pro-active approach and because we are dealing with people who wish to seek employment, with job-training programs, with the capacity to put into job clubs and so forth younger people who may not have been in the work force, with the capacity to give people adequate counselling in that early stage, there is every reason to presume that if a success rate of 25 per cent to 34 per cent can be achieved for people who have been unemployed for over 12 months, at least as good a result will be achieved for people who have been unemployed for under 12 months. As they say in the courts, I rest my case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to emphasise that, in our opinion, unemployment is not a satisfactory alternative for the men and women of Australia. If we are to work our way out of our economic problems we need every person we possibly can to be employed and involved in the labour market on a permanent or part time basis. Consequently, we believe that it is absolutely ludicrous for the Department of Finance to assume a leakage from long term unemployment to special benefits of some 80 per cent. Clearly, the assumption contained in this document is politically motivated in an attempt to discredit the coalition's policy to terminate unemployment benefit after nine months. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures of the Department of Social Security indicate that about 70 to 75 per cent of the long term unemployed are under the age of 45, about 65 per cent are single and over 75 per cent do not have dependent children. It is precisely in the context of those statistics that we have developed our approach to the provision of special benefits. Special benefits are not available for those who choose not to be employed or who voluntarily adopt a lifestyle which makes it difficult or impossible to earn a sufficient livelihood. It should be noted that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the Conroy case considered that the degree of control that a person is able to exercise over the circumstances which give rise to his or her inability to earn a sufficient livelihood must be a relevant consideration in deciding whether or not special benefit should be granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot seriously argue that up to 80 per cent of the long term unemployed, who according to its own definition are unemployable, would pass that criterion. Clearly, most of the long term unemployed will be expected to accept jobs that they would otherwise find unacceptable or live by their own means-that is, if they do not qualify for special benefits. In some cases, especially where we are dealing with young people who do not have domestic involvement-children, families and so forth to maintain-they may have to move to areas where jobs may be available. Again, that is one of the elements of the package which is not emphasised in the Government's current arrangements. The Government has effectively allowed people to remain indefinitely on unemployment benefit in the expectation that a job may appear one day. We believe that that expectation is unreasonable. At this point I will read into Hansard a most poignant letter dated 13 October which I received the other day. The letter, which was unsigned, was written by a gentleman who described himself as a grandfather and citizen from Newcastle in New South Wales. His letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I have an eighteen year old grandson who left school at 15 1/2 years. He had no desire to seek work and could not wait until he could claim welfare at 16 years. He left home as soon as he received his payments to board with an aunt on his mother's side of the family. She took a small payment for board and he feeds himself on fast junk food. For the past three years he has spent the rest of his money in hotels, clubs and on poker machines. His father and I have frequently advised him to seek training for employment but he is not interested. </PARA>
<PARA> The irony of it is that he has two young uncles and a friend, with whom he associates, who also have never been employed. They appear resigned to living the rest of their lives taking welfare. None have girlfriends and they are not `gay'. They are in good health and fit to work but have no incentive or desire to improve themselves. These men are but a few of many thousands of men in a similar situation in Newcastle who are frustrated by the deal that Newcastle, the second city in NSW and the largest port, has been handed by the Hawke government. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> I applaud the proposed action to endeavour to change this situation and hope that it will be successful in stirring these young men into action. </PARA>
<PARA>Because we are in Canberra we tend to forget that that letter describes the reality. Unfortunately, in our society we have failed for too long to allow people to realise that the work ethic has virtue and that we as a nation simply cannot succeed unless we are prepared to work a lot harder than we have in the past. We cannot expect, as a government, to be responsible for the interests of those who are disadvantaged and handicapped, those who need support, without at the same time realising that we are also responsible for the millions of taxpayers who are making a contribution so that those benefits may be at an adequate level. In other words, we have two levels of responsibility. It is not a case of one being above the other. They both call for an equal commitment from us. Unfortunately, that is one of the fundamental differences between the approach adopted by the coalition parties and the approach taken by the Government over the last seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Government's criteria, special benefits are for those who are not capable of supporting themselves and/or their families and not for those who are not prepared to change their lifestyles and take jobs that they may find unattractive. The coalition should not be judged by the performance of the Government, and in particular of the Minister for Social Security, in administering special benefits. The coalition's assumption of a leakage of about 50 per cent is very conservative. Indeed, the leakage will most likely be much lower. Therefore, we believe that our estimate of some $835m additional expenditure on special benefits is more than adequate to provide a safety net. We are simply not in the business of providing wall-to-wall support. We are providing a safety net while at the same time ensuring that the fundamental criterion must be that we are there to help people help themselves. That is what the training programs are there for-to enable people to obtain qualifications so they are better equipped to go into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have seen with the Government's programs in so many cases-the criticism is on the record; the reports by the Auditor-General have been tabled in the Parliament-is that, sadly, many of the short term courses lead nowhere. That is the problem. I met a man in Perth who said that he had done five three-month courses. He still did not have a job because he was seen by employers as a jack-of-all-trades and a master of none. What we ask for is programs which give people qualifications in the long term. In other words, if they have three months job experience, plus technical and further education-type training, the time they spend in TAFE will give them credits towards finally getting a proper qualification which is accepted by unions, industry and employers. Then we can give those people who have had the frustration of trying to be trained, but being trained for nothing, an opportunity of having a qualification which is meaningful and will entitle them to a much higher salary and much more secure employment opportunities. What is more, the coalition has no intention of letting the special benefit become an automatic substitute for unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the family allowance and the family allowance supplement. The legislation also seeks to make adjustments to the income testing arrangements for the family allowance and the family allowance supplement. The family allowance and the supplement provide significant support for Australian families. As I have said on many occasions, we support the continuation of those arrangements. As with other pensions and benefits, the coalition supports their payment to families and their indexation. The coalition, when in government, will continue to provide indexation for those payments. Australian families have been bearing the burden of increasing financial strain for too long as a result of record mortgage rates and higher taxes imposed upon them by the Government, which is the highest taxing Australian government this century. The coalition's recently released taxation policy recognises this. We will provide over $2 billion to Australian families through significant improvements in the dependent spouse rebate and taxation rebates for children and their care as well as maintaining the current Government's commitments to child-care funding. I re-emphasise that we will meet the full commitments made by the current Government to child-care funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policy has been criticised by the Government and it only confirms our suspicions that the Government is anti-family. It is against women working. That is exemplified by its superannuation policy which will allow women to contribute to a superannuation scheme for only two years after leaving employment. The Government will not allow their spouses to subsidise their contributions, as the coalition would do. The Government is not providing retirement savings accounts. Therefore, it is giving women nothing except a policy for one-child families. In addition, the Government is unable or unwilling to recognise that women who work should be compensated for the cost of placing their children in adequate child-care. The fundamental fact that the Government must face is that it has made a commitment valued at $225m or so and we have made a commitment, through the existing programs plus the rebate, valued at $1,000m. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the dinner break I was emphasising the difference in policy approach between the Government and the Opposition on the question of providing child-care. It is an open secret in Government circles that for at least three Budgets the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) has been urging the Government to introduce a viable and effective long term child support arrangement. I gather that that has been rejected by none other than the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Consequently, events in this House today demonstrate quite clearly the simple fact that the Opposition is prepared to commit up to $1 billion in child-care support as a total package, which contains both the existing child-care support package plus the commitment of a further 30,000 places over the next few years. In addition, through the tax rebates we are effectively ensuring that far more people will be able to enter the work force and get support with the provision of additional funds to enable them to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This raises the interesting question-I am glad that the Minister for Social Security has come into the House-of exactly what the position of the Government's family policy is. The Government claims it has a policy, but through our policy in the last few weeks we have been able to demonstrate what its interests ought to be in so many areas of fundamental importance to ordinary Australians-those very people who are being ignored by this Government. The Government's criticisms claim that we are taking from the rich and giving to the poor. This is a bit rich, coming from a government that has fostered changes in the taxation system and elsewhere that undoubtedly have had the greatest benefit for the wealthiest people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Surveys carried out over the last three years demonstrate that in the seven years of the Hawke Labor Government there has been an enormous transfer of wealth from the middle classes to the rich while those on the other side of the equation-those at the bottom-have not particularly benefited one way or the other. Those graphs and reports are clear. A new survey has been put out by the Social Welfare Research Centre of the University of New South Wales only in the last two weeks. It compares Australia to New Zealand in international trends and so forth. I recommend that the Minister read that document. Brian Toohey, in an article last Sunday, made the point that the Government's tax policy has significantly advantaged the rich to a greater extent than anybody else. In various other areas-not that we are necessarily opposing them; we happen to support dividend imputation, for instance-there is no denying the fact that people whose incomes are based on shares and so forth do get certain advantages from those sorts of arrangements. These advantages are not available, through the Government's tax policy, to people whose non-earning income may come also from non-equity investments such as fixed interest securities. They are subject to the full taxation system at present. That is why so many retired people feel that this Government has not given them a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian people are sick and tired of the hypocrisies and the evident inadequacies of this Government. Tomorrow we will see some more horrendous trade figures. The day after that we will probably see some horrendous consumer price index figures. And so it goes. There is no end to the fall in the standard of living of the Australian people. They see it consistently falling. All of this has been to a large degree exacerbated by a Government that, quite frankly, has lost touch with the people. It is for that reason that these people wait for the opportunity to throw the Government out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to support the Government in this debate on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who preceded me, raised a number of points which I would like to rebut. But I will leave that to the end and speak first to the important measures this Bill implements. In a way, the Bill reinforces two very basic aspects of this Government's social security policy and its family policy in particular, that is, fairness and equity-fairness in that only people who deserve and need assistance will get it and people who do not need it or at least do not deserve it will not get it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill makes changes to the present eligibility for the family allowance supplement (FAS). Recently changes were made to the Act whereby the basis for awarding the family allowance supplement was the previous year's income for the family. Under current arrangements, a family may qualify for FAS if its taxable income for the financial year ending in the previous calendar year is below certain levels. If the family's previous taxable income was higher than these levels but its income dropped so that the taxable income in the current financial year will be at least 25 per cent less, the family can qualify for FAS on the basis of the current financial year's income. That means that many families whose income is low this year and who would have qualified lost the family allowance supplement because of their income for the previous year. The father of a family in my electorate had two jobs in the previous year. He gave up one of those jobs, quite reasonably, so that the family could qualify for the family allowance supplement. But he found that this year, because of the new provisions, the family lost that family allowance supplement because its current income was not at least 25 per cent less than the previous year's income. That anomaly has now been rectified and many of those families will now be getting the family allowance supplement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also tightens up eligibility for a number of allowances. Family allowance provisions will be changed to require recipients to inform the Department of Social Security of certain notifiable events which occurred during the calendar year and which may alter their eligibility for that payment. Similarly, recipients of FAS will also be required to inform the Department of Social Security if their circumstances change to the point where they are no longer eligible. Also, the four-week period of grace for education leavers to register with the Commonwealth Employment Service after leaving study will be abolished from October 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> In future, a recipient of unemployment benefit or Jobsearch allowance who moves and reduces his or her employment prospects as a result will have his or her benefit cancelled and on reapplication will have to serve a waiting period of 12 weeks. The Bill also provides for unemployment and sickness benefit not to be payable when the beneficiary does not provide and will not apply for a tax file number. All of these latter provisions tighten up eligibility for social security payments and follow on from other moves we have taken to tighten that eligibility. Certainly, that does not accord with what the Opposition has been saying about this Government being lax in its awarding of social security payments. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent days there has been much talk of family support, family policies and family assistance. I remind the House of what this Government has done to assist families, particularly low and middle income families. There have been-and people forget this very readily-three lots of tax cuts under this Government. The top tax scale has been reduced from 60c in the dollar to 49c in the dollar. As a result of those three lots of tax changes, many low and middle income families are paying considerably less tax. There has also been the introduction of the family allowance supplement. Nobody can play down its enormous benefit to low income families. We have also targeted the family allowance-again, this denies what the Opposition has been saying about targeting-to families which need that payment. </PARA>
<PARA> This year we have increased the dependent spouse rebate. Somebody on the Opposition side asked today what our policy on the dependent spouse rebate is. We increased the rebate only three months ago. That is our policy on the dependent spouse rebate. We have also increased family allowance and the family allowance supplement. Most importantly, we have indexed all of those payments so that the recipients will not fall behind the consumer price index. The Government has not been given enough public credit for the fact that all such payments are now indexed to the consumer price index. As well as that, there have been increases in Austudy and other ways of assisting families through different portfolios. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not asking the House to accept only my opinion on this. The honourable member for Bradfield quoted the Australian Council of Social Service, ACOSS, in respect of recipients of unemployment benefit. He said what a creditable body ACOSS was. I absolutely agree with him, but I notice he did not quote what ACOSS had been saying about the Opposition's so-called family package. ACOSS said that it is a means of redistributing wealth from the well off to the least well off and that it is by no means an equitable program. I should stress that our family policy, our family package, our family assistance, is not something that was thought up on the spur of the moment; it is not policy on the run. It is not buying votes. It is the result of years of detailed studies and analyses of the social security system and the anomalies that exist in it. The social security review under Professor Cass was set up years ago by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe). One of the first reports that she produced was the one on assistance for low income families. That has been the basis of our family package-a well researched, well documented and sustainable family policy. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Bradfield lingered so long on the Opposition policy on families, I would like to take this opportunity to address those matters. What is the Opposition offering families? It is offering universal child rebates and a child-care rebate. It is to be paid for from cuts in funding for Aborigines, the long term unemployed, migrants, and people in Third World countries; that is, people who do not get a vote at all in this country or people who vote mostly for Labor anyway. (Quorum formed) This policy has been called clever. Perhaps that is right if by `clever' we mean cynical, self-interested and self-serving. I quote from an article written by Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald on 18 October. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>You don't judge a polly just by the size of the handout he's offering. You have to be confident that he'll deliver, once your vote is safely gathered in. You have to know where the money's coming from. </PARA>
<PARA> Well, no probs there. Mr P has spelt it all out. The money will be taken from the unemployed, blacks, migrants and people on invalid pensions. Fine; never did like them, anyway. </PARA>
<PARA>I must add that the article is written with a great degree of sarcasm, which must be taken into account. It has been fairly well demonstrated by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Social Security that not all the money the Opposition needs for these programs, should they ever be implemented, could come from those areas. The savings that the Opposition proposes will come from those areas have been grossly overestimated. Indeed, where is the money coming from? Yesterday the honourable member for Bradfield said that the money for the child-care rebate would be coming from cutting child-care places and gradually privatising the industry. Today the honourable member came out and said that was not what he meant. He said that he was quoted out of context, that he was misrepresented. The Leader of the Opposition said that he was wrong. Presumably he was correctly represented, but wrong. I do not know who to believe. I want to know, if the honourable member for Bradfield was wrong, if that was not what he meant, where he got the information from? The Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) said in the House today that the honourable member for Bradfield was not an unintelligent person. He does not strike me as being someone who suffers from wild fantasies or hallucinations. Where did he get the information from?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Far be it from me to impute that to the Liberal Party, but it is well worth asking exactly where the honourable member for Bradfield got those ideas. Let us look at what the Opposition is saying. In the House today, the Treasurer compared what the Government is giving families and what it has already given families with what the Opposition is offering. He said, for example, that a person with two children and on 100 per cent of average weekly earnings-a single income family-is receiving $24.30 a week from the Government and the Opposition is offering $5.05. We are giving a person on 75 per cent of average weekly earnings $31.05 a week and the Opposition is offering $5.05. It made great play of the fact that it was offering this on top of what the Government already offers. But it is a very piddling amount compared with what we have offered. As the Treasurer said, it is like the Government building the Empire State Building only to have the Opposition put a brick on the top and say, `Look what we have done. Isn't it wonderful?'. The Australian Labor Party has a reputation for supporting families; it has the runs on the board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will be kind to the honourable member for Bradfield and go along with the fact that what he said yesterday was not really right. In respect of the child-care policy and the child-care rebate I would like to ask: Who would be eligible for that child-care rebate? The honourable member for Bradfield has said that anyone who has a child in registered child-care would be eligible for the rebate. I would like to ask: Who would be registered? Which child-care bodies would be registered? Presumably the existing public funded ones would be registered. Probably most of the existing private child-care centres would be registered. What about those people who are providing child-care on the black market? There are a considerable number of them. Would they be registered? Maybe some of them are quite good and maybe they should be registered. Probably a lot of them are not any good. Would they be registered? Who would decide whether they should be registered? How much would it cost to decide whether those private individuals are worthy of registration for the child-care rebate?</PARA>
<PARA> If the people who are using the services provided on the black market are going to claim the child-care rebate, the care givers would have to declare their income for tax purposes, which is a very good thing. But that would mean that a lot of people would drop out of that system, and a lot more places would be needed in child-care centres. At the moment there is a shortage of places available in child-care centres. The Government is promising 30,000 places. The Opposition is also promising 30,000 places. There is no doubt that the pressure for child-care places would increase. </PARA>
<PARA> I can envisage all sorts of rorts coming out of that system. What about when granny minds a child? My mother used to mind my children. I believe that some of the best child-care available is when granny looks after the children. But would granny be able to be registered if she was a good child-care giver? If granny was registered, presumably the mother of the children could claim the rebate. Granny would declare her income, but provided that it was within the income test free area it would not affect her pension, she would not have to pay tax on it and she could give it back. All sorts of rorts and all sorts of loopholes could be opened up under the sort of system that the Opposition is suggesting. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to talk about one thing which I think will change from now on. Before the 1987 election the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made a pledge that by 1990 no Australian child need live in poverty. In the past few years that commitment has been made great fun of by the Opposition. It has been the object of a great deal of derision by the Opposition. However, I cannot imagine that that will happen from now on unless the Opposition is totally shameless. Today the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said that the Opposition is totally without shame. The Opposition would have to be pretty shameless to continue deriding that commitment of the Prime Minister, because the Opposition is taking money from Aboriginal children, from migrant children and from the children of the unemployed. Those children are the same as any other children. In common with any other children, those children also belong to families. What will the Opposition's policies do to those children?</PARA>
<PARA> A cartoon that appeared last week in a newspaper showed the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) saying, `By 1990 no rich child will be living in poverty'. That is the Opposition's policy from now on. That is its commitment. Unless the Opposition is totally without shame, I do not expect to hear any more deriding of the Prime Minister's commitment about child poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> Time does not permit me to do so, but I would have liked to comment at length about what the honourable member for Bradfield said earlier about long-term unemployed people and their training. The honourable member said that people who are undertaking training courses through Jobstart and Newstart are not getting proper qualifications and that they should be going to TAFE colleges. Of course they are proper qualifications. Those people are gaining skills that are needed in the community and they are getting jobs. There is a very good employment acquisition rate for people who undertake that sort of training. For the honourable member for Bradfield to say that those people should all be going to TAFE colleges and getting proper qualifications reeks of the worst kind of intellectual snobbery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security and Veteran's Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill is important for the way in which it changes the law, but it is more important for the way in which it fails to do so. One significant and, for some, controversial proposal that is contained in the legislation is the new test that is proposed for determining the precondition of eligibility for a sole parent pension. To be entitled to receive pensions or benefits in Australia, applicants must fit into a category: they must be aged 65 for men and 60 for women; be invalid, 85 per cent incapacitated for work; be unemployed, having satisfied the work test and being available for work; be sick, temporarily medically unfit for work; be a sole parent who is not living in a married relationship, de jure or de facto, and who has the responsibility for providing a child or children with care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, fitting into one of those categories is, by itself, not sufficient. The category determines eligibility for a pension or benefit. The amount, if any, is then subject to the income and/or assets test which applies to the particular pension or benefit. Those income or assets tests require those who are married-again, whether de jure or de facto-to bring into account not only their own income and assets but also the income and assets of their spouses. Under the current arrangements, persons who are married or living in a de facto relationship are not eligible to receive the sole parent pension. Until now there has been no legislative provision to guide the staff of the Department of Social Security as to how to determine whether an applicant for a sole parent pension is living in a de facto relationship. Clearly, there is a need, recognised by the Government, to inject certainty and confidence into what has been an arbitrary and uncertain decision-making process. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislative provisions that are proposed in this Bill seek to provide the staff of the Department with that confidence and certainty. These legislative provisions outlining the tests that are to be applied in determining whether a de facto married relationship exists have been made necessary as a consequence of the changes in social behaviour that have occurred over the past two or three decades. De facto relationships have become more socially acceptable than they were, and many couples now choose not to marry. In some cases couples who are in a de facto relationship have made a permanent commitment to each other which is similar to the commitment that is made in a de jure marriage. In other cases couples who are living together, although regarded by many as living in a de facto relationship, do not acknowledge that their relationship is one of a de facto marriage because they do not consider themselves to have made the type of commitment that they personally believe that marriage involves. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a debate in which it is not necessarily helpful to be moralistic or judgmental about the nature of those relationships. What is important is that the taxation and social security legislation should be reformed to treat couples whose relationships and economic circumstances are substantially similar in a manner that does not discriminate in favour of one against the other. Because such discrimination occurs under the current legislation, it has become necessary to spell out in legislation the circumstances that determine what constitutes a de facto marriage relationship for the purposes of pension and benefit eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, the public sector provides income maintenance to those categories of individuals who can prove that they are unable to work due to sickness, invalidity, old age, inability to find employment or because they have dependant responsibilities. That support may be a sickness benefit, an invalid pension, an age pension, unemployment benefits, a sole parent pension, a widow's pension or a special benefit. Those pensions and benefits are paid to some people at the standard rate, whereas others receive them at the married rate. Those rates have been set at levels that society, through this Parliament, has from time to time regarded as sufficient to meet the subsistence requirements of pensioners and beneficiaries. The debate as to the adequacy of those amounts should take place from time to time in the light of society's changing circumstances, changing expectations and changing affluence, as well as the desire to achieve the appropriate fairness and equity to those who are in need as well as to those who support themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the standard pension, there has been a loose nexus between it and 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The married rate pension is approximately 80 per cent of the standard rate pension. If a person who as an individual is entitled to a pension or benefit legally marries or enters into a de facto marriage, his or her entitlement to a pension is affected. In the case of a sole parent pension, marriage, whether de jure or de facto, removes the person from the eligible category-that is, such a parent is no longer considered to be a sole parent. It is assumed the person to whom that parent is married, de jure or de facto, will provide the support he or she would otherwise have received by way of a sole parent pension. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of other pensions or benefits, marriage has the effect of decreasing the pension or benefit firstly to the extent that the combined income and assets of the married couple affect pension or benefit eligibility and, secondly, the pension payable is at the married rate rather than the standard rate. Implicit in the marriage tests applied by our tax and social security legislation, including the amendments being made by this Bill, are social judgments about the nature of the marriage relationship. A sole parent pensioner who is judged as having married becomes the financial responsibility of his or her working spouse. Other pensioners and beneficiaries who marry have their pensions assessed on the basis of their combined income and assets and receive the lower married rate pension rather than the standard rate pension received by them as single people. The application of these marriage tests involves the imposition of a penalty on those who marry, whether de jure or de facto. Their use makes it necessary to determine when the marriage relationship exists in law or is deemed to exist in fact. </PARA>
<PARA> A sole parent pensioner who marries or forms a de facto relationship forfeits eligibility for the sole parent pension. An unemployment or sickness beneficiary or age or invalid pensioner who marries whilst satisfying the eligibility criteria often loses entitlement to these pensions or benefits as a consequence of the application of the means test. The only acknowledgment received from the public sector of the financial responsibility borne by a working spouse is eligibility for the spouse rebate. This rebate is $1,200 per annum for a spouse with children and $1,000 for one without. It is a token payment which only partially recognises the costs faced by a taxpayer who supports a dependent spouse, just as the present Government's family allowances are for the great majority of Australian families token allowances that acknowledge in a very small way the additional costs borne by people who bring up and support children. That comment can apply to every family where there is one member at least in the full time work force. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that before putting these amendments forward there was no fundamental examination of and debate on the criteria which should be used to determine entitlement of social security payments. We should be asking who should be responsible for supporting those who have no income of their own. Should we, for example, impose on adults who share an accommodation unit the obligation of supporting each other while one of them has no income? And should assets and income tests be applied to assets and income of the members of a household in determining the eligibility of any member of the household to any of the benefits currently being paid? Should we move in the opposite direction by reforming the tax and social security system so that it incorporates a comprehensive and effective capacity to pay regime? Or do we continue with an intermediate position in which adults who share an accommodation unit are responsible for supporting each other only if they are married or living in a married-like relationship?</PARA>
<PARA> Under this approach a price is imposed on those who choose to marry or live in a married-like relationship, just as a price is imposed by the tax and social security system on those who choose to have children. Present arrangements discriminate against those who are married, discriminate against those who have children, and favour a whole range of other shared accommodation arrangements such as those between brother and sister, and between young adults-whether of the same or different sex-including even young adults living at home with their parents. I do not believe we should move to a position where adults should be required to support those with whom they live in circumstances where the tax they pay is related only to the income they receive. We should move in the opposite direction and reform the tax and social security system in a dramatic and innovative way. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Australian social security and taxation system puts a price on living with someone defined in the legislation for both those regimes as a dependent spouse. It does not put such a price on living with others. The amount paid by those who choose to marry, whether de jure or de facto, is substantial. The Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) has sent a news release to, I would assume, all members of parliament calling for a deferral of this legislation. I do not believe that ACOSS's view of the Government's proposal is a sensible or fair one. I think the approach that it is taking fails to examine the fundamental bases upon which the present social security and tax system needs reform. The Council's reaction is a knee-jerk reaction. It talks about the concept of the criminal law and says that the changes being made should not be made because one should apply the principle of being innocent until proven guilty, as if being in a married relationship, albeit de facto, is cause for guilt. What ACOSS should be concerned about is getting a regime that is fair to all families, to all people who live in and share accommodation units, and not press for the continuation of an arrangement that enables some families, although they are living in married-like relationships, until this legislation comes into force to qualify for benefits that are not available to de jure and de facto marriages. </PARA>
<PARA> ACOSS also calls for a fairer and more administratively effective system. It does not suggest what changes should be made. Let me put to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, a proposal which would be fairer and administratively more efficient. In doing so, I pick up a comment made by the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Harvey). She criticised the Liberal and National parties' recent proposals in respect of the universality of child tax rebates as though that were a bad thing. What is a bad thing is the present Government's selective unfair treatment of a large number of families which have children to support. If it is a matter of achieving equity, all families with children should receive like amounts of benefit in respect of their children, and if we need more tax revenue and people must pay more tax, let all taxpayers, single taxpayers as well as married taxpayers, pay more, but give to families with children equal substantial rebates and equal substantial family allowances so that those below the tax threshold benefit as much as those who are above the tax threshold. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Liberal and National parties' proposals are doing is going some way to redressing the imbalance caused by the present Government, whereby the Government has increased the benefits payable for some children whereas it has held frozen the benefits payable for others. I acknowledge that those benefits have now been indexed, but they have been indexed from a very low base compared with the level of benefit that is payable for the children of pensioners and of those on low incomes. All of those benefits are still substantially lower than what the Institute of Family Studies has identified as the real cost of maintaining children. We have tried to provide the large body of parents who are supporting and caring for the great majority of Australian children with some fairness, which has been denied to them by the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put to the House a proposal that would be fairer and more administratively efficient. In this proposal I look primarily at the approach to the support of dependent spouses. Let us abolish the price of choosing to share accommodation in a married or married-like relationship and put the sharing of accommodation in such relationships on the same footing as sharing accommodation with adults of the same or different sexes. The marriage test now contained in the social security and tax legislation should be abolished and replaced by comprehensive and adequate `capacity to pay' rebates. </PARA>
<PARA> A minimum subsistence level of income should be available to every adult and, at the same time, all should be guaranteed a minimum level of personal economic independence. Taxpayers who assume responsibility for providing this minimum level of income to another adult who would otherwise be dependent on the public sector should be relieved of tax to the extent of the subsistence income required by those dependent on them. The tax system should be reformed so that it truly reflects the principle of capacity to pay. Labor's tax system uses only the individual's income as a measure of capacity to pay. It fails to acknowledge, except in a meagre and tokenistic way, the effect of the support of dependants on a taxpayer's taxable capacity. Tax relief now available to those who support a spouse, children, adult student children, other family members or even friends is either non-existent or much less than the cost of providing for those who are dependent on the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax system should be adjusted to reflect the principle of capacity to pay. Tax credits should be made available to taxpayers who support dependants. These credits should be at a level equivalent to what would otherwise be the public sector cost of supporting those dependent on the social security system. If the tax system is reformed in this way, as it should be, these rebates should be part of the underlying tax base. As a consequence, they should not be treated as tax expenditures. Where such a tax credit has been claimed by a taxpayer who is responsible for the support of a dependant, that dependant should cease to be eligible for a pension or benefit. With adequate tax rebates available to taxpayers who support dependants, there would no longer be any financial penalty imposed on a couple living together in a de jure or de facto married relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> This system of tax credits need not reinforce the dependency of a non-earner on the taxpaying spouse. The tax credit, or part of it, could be paid as a tax refund to the dependent spouse out of the tax paid by the household. In this way some degree of personal economic independence could be guaranteed to those in the phase of their life cycle when they have no other income of their own. A similar approach should be adopted to the differential between the married rate and the standard rate pension. The married rate pension should be basic pension and the difference should be paid as a living alone allowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). I will address those amendments which specifically relate to the needs of sole parents in our community, in particular those amendments to the Child Support (Assessment) Act and those in relation to the assessment of domestic circumstances of sole parents. I am very interested to hear Opposition members demanding that people in the community accept responsibility for marriages and dependency and not create dependency. I would be very interested to hear what they have to say about the child support legislation. I remind them that under the child support scheme to date a quarter of a million Australian children have received financial maintenance which they had not received previously. That is, over 190,000 Australian families have been financially supported through the introduction of the Child Support (Assessment) Act. This means that non-custodial parents can no longer walk away and absolutely reject their responsibilities. We have created a system whereby non-custodial parents must accept responsibility for the maintenance of their children. That is what this Government is about-caring for Australian children and ensuring that they are adequately covered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Child Support (Assessment) Act has ensured that the system is now in place. It is now simply a process of law. It does not require the custodial parent consistently to go back to court to fight, to argue and to struggle for a level of maintenance which may be anything from $5 to $50 a week. Stage 2 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act, which came into being on 1 October, sets down very clearly a formula for child support. Not only have we acknowledged the need for children in our community to be supported but also we have ensured that the level of their support is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in this legislation provide for extensions in the application of the automatic withholding of child support from salaries and wages. This has proved to be the most effective way of collecting child support. It will also be possible for the Child Support Agency to impose automatic withholding more quickly. We will be able to use that provision in the collection of arrears by the Agency. This is a real process in the way in which the Government ensures that the community accepts its responsibilities and that we as a government ensure that those people who have children in our community financially maintain them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am interested to hear who these sole parents are in our community. We have heard much discussion from the Opposition about the kinds of marriages that exist and about the kinds of families that exist in our community. We know that the Opposition does not acknowledge migrant people, black people, or people who are unemployed for more than nine months, as part of its family grouping. (Quorum formed) As I was saying before I was interrupted, who are the sole parents and families that the Opposition is concerned about? We know that they are not migrants. They are not Aboriginals and they are certainly not people in rural Australia; nor are they middle-aged. We know this because Beryce Nelson of the National Party in Queensland says that she would do away with all these sole parents. So what is going to happen to those women in the country towns throughout Australia in their mid-40s whose husbands have left them with two or three children and who are supposed to find maintenance for themselves? These are the kinds of people and families we refer to when we talk about sole parents. They are the people that we, as a government, make a commitment to. I add that in Queensland the State Government has failed and is refusing to pass a law whereby it will make collection for children of ex-nuptial parents. The same group of people squeal the loudest and talk about parental responsibility. When we offer a process through the Child Support Act whereby those parents, and in particular fathers, should be responsible for their children, it refuses and simply walks away from it. So we may well ask: Who are the families that this Opposition is concerned about? It is not concerned about pursuing people to be responsible and act responsibly as a community for the support of our children. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also lays the groundwork for the overhaul of the assessment of domestic circumstances for sole parents, who are very much at the front of our policies. The reason is that they are the poorest people in Australia. Through the 1970s and early 1980s, the dark years of Fraser-indeed, when the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), was in the Treasury-sole parents were trapped in a spiral of dependency. They had to depend on a less and less adequate pension. Eight out of every 10 sole parents had children through their marriage. When their marriages broke down, what was done for them? The fact that the bulk of our sole parents have been married for quite a considerable period singularly seems to have escaped the attention of the Opposition. We have very many examples. I presume that there are some members on the Opposition benches whose own marriages have broken down. It is not a new or extraordinary phenomenon to have people, mainly females, in our community whose marriages have broken down and who need to be cared for. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government done? We have ensured that payments for sole pensioners are indexed and acknowledged in the system. We have also looked at a process for child-care and at labour market programs to help sole parents. Very many of our sole parents have been forced into public housing estates in outer suburbs that are a long way from schools, child-care centres and jobs. That was the legacy and tragedy of the Fraser years. That is what we inherited. When the Hawke Government came into office there was a feminisation of poverty and families depending solely on inadequate pension for longer and longer periods. The child support scheme set out to address that issue. As I have already pointed out, a quarter of a million children have benefited from that scheme alone in the first 12 months of its existence. It is surely a landmark in acknowledging care for children within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also completely restructured the pension and tax system for sole parents through major changes to the pension free areas and through lifting and indexing the sole parent rebate. We have made it worth while for sole parents to work. A social security earnings credit has been introduced. We have continued fringe benefits for six months to ensure that sole parents after starting work have a better start in the work force. The Government has also increased the payments that a sole parent receives for children. In 1983 a sole parent pensioner received $21 per week for her or his first child. Today that pensioner receives $45 per week for the first child under 13 and $55.10 for a child aged 13, 14 or 15. Every part of those payments for children is protected from inflation by automatic adjustment every year. That is what we have done in terms of caring for families. The Government is putting cash in people's hands, not promising a rebate at the far end of the year when perhaps we may or may not put in a tax return. We are seeing real reform and progress in attempting to address the problems of those families in our community who need our help. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also ensured comprehensive labour market programs. I speak from personal experience of the jobs, education and training (JET) program, job, clubs and Jobtrain. JET has already put 3,000 sole parents into the work force. Many members on the other side of the House would not understand what it means to be unemployed. They do not understand because the Opposition intends to cut off unemployment benefits at the end of nine months, which is the time when people are at their most vulnerable. Are people going to roam the streets or be tied up in camps? Good heavens, no. Not only is the Opposition going to cut off unemployment benefit but also it is going to cut off the very work force programs that ensure that people can get into employment. That is the nonsense of the Opposition's supposed change in action. JET is a very real program which has brought real change to 3,000 families to date and, hopefully, many more by the end of the year. The JET program has broken the cycle of poverty for women and children in those families, has ensured not just for today a lack of dependency on the system and also has meant that in the longer term those sole parents and their children will be able to participate in the economic life of Australia. That is very important. Fairness is about ensuring that every single individual in this community has access to the economic advantages of Australia; that is, access to education, work and the ability to participate in whatever programs he likes. </PARA>
<PARA> JET also acknowledges the need of sole parents to have access to its child-care programs. The Opposition is about to fling $20 at people who happen to have a child in care, whether they are rich people who can afford to have nannies in their homes or are people currently on subsidy relief. Where is the fairness in all this? We have heard the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) suggesting universality, that we should all pay more tax. One can only hope that the President of the Liberal Party will join his plea and pay more tax. Will his children be subsidised? Is he also going to get the $20 a week child rebate? What a nonsense. It does not create any more child-care places or help any more people to get back into the work force. It is just a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about fairness we must also talk about the changes in the way in which we assess the domestic circumstances of people who are currently receiving our sole parent pension to ensure that those people who are most in need and are eligible for our pension get it. We have established a universal set of guidelines and processes which will be managed and dictated through a trained and skilled staff. </PARA>
<PARA> These recommendations stem from a legislative working party of the Social Security Advisory Council. The members of this working party are lawyers and welfare rights workers. Another is the national convener of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. They are supported by the women's consultative committee of the Department of Social Security. It is hoped that this legislation will create indicators which will ensure that every person in Australia who applies or seeks eligibility for a pension is treated in the same way. That is what fairness is about. It is not about being treated differently depending on whether one happens to live in Brisbane, Perth or Melbourne. Indeed, these indicators set out very clearly for those people who are testing eligibility a proper and informed series of processes for the assessment of eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also ensures that people will be treated normally within the departmental process. Gone are the days when people were supposedly snooped on. People will visit the office and their domestic circumstances will be assessed by the claimants or pensioners themselves. The existing law sometimes results in the practical onus of proof being on a pensioner. With regard to the question of onus of proof, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA> In the present case, the problem arises in an acute form. Facts are clearly established indicating co-residence of a woman, a man and their child. The man gives some pecuniary assistance to the woman for the support of the child. Although he has borne the major responsibility of providing the house in which they live, she has played a definite role in the acquisition of two properties in which they have lived. On this basis it may be that an evidentiary burden is cast on the applicant to establish facts which satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that I should conclude that she was not at the relevant times living with (the man) as his wife on a bona fide domestic basis. Those facts are exclusively within the knowledge of the applicant and (the man). </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation will not impose any different onus or obligation on anybody; rather, it will make it clear that in making decisions in this area the Department and the Appeals Tribunal must look at all the evidence and make a fair decision on that basis. This legislation is about fairness. It is about ensuring that everybody is treated in the same manner, irrespective of where one lives in Australia. It will ensure that, while appeals are being heard and while people's positions are being clarified, they will continue to be provided with income support by this Government. The whole question of sole parents within our community has been at the forefront of Labor's priorities. These changes to legislation show a commitment to those people who are the very poorest in our community. As I have already said, child support has already brought a quarter of a million children under its umbrella. It will not only continue to do so but also enforce within the Australian community a commitment by parents to ensure that they maintain their children. The changes affecting sole parents bring about a compassionate, standardised and fair process whereby all Australians will be treated in the same manner. That is, after all, what this Government is about. It is not about stealing from the poor to give to the rich. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having just left a meeting of the Standing Committee on Procedure and walked in during the last moments of the speech of the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), I cannot help but ponder the cause of all the excitement, and why the honourable member was so passionate in her comments. I will make one or two observations in terms of the supporting parent's benefit. I remember when the current Governor-General, as Minister for Social Security in 1974, introduced the concept of a supporting parent's benefit. The total cost of that benefit at the end of the first year was $40m. This year, 13 or 14 years later, that $40m has rocketed to about $2.3 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think it is fair to say to the honourable member that I believe that this Parliament has a responsibility to contemplate what has happened in the last 15 years which has led to the breakdown of family values and marriage. The honourable member is shaking her head as if to say that these things do not count. Why has the cost of the supporting parent's benefit rocketed? Why has there been such a growth in the number of people who now need to be cared for by the Government? If the honourable member for Forde is not even prepared to give consideration to the causes of this, she does not deserve to be here. Now it is my turn to get excited.

Perhaps this will have the effect of curbing the recklessness that has visited this country in the last 15 years, which has meant that the amount of money paid in benefits has gone from $40m to $2,300m. That is a huge increase and it cannot be dismissed lightly.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not wish to dwell on those points because no doubt this has been canvassed extensively tonight while I was at the committee meeting. However, I wish to raise some issues which are really important in terms of social security. What we on this side of the chamber are proposing to do following the next election, whenever that might be held-I was sure it was going to be held in a few weeks' time but the Government has run away from that idea and is postponing it until next year-is to recognise families and assist them. In terms of supporting the family, upon being elected to government the Liberals will introduce a two-tier tax system within three years. This should be compared to Labor's policy, which has led to the highest taxation that has existed in this country's history. In terms of bracket creep--</PARA>

<PARA> Over the last six years the Government has rebuilt the integrity of Australia's social security system. </PARA>
<PARA>We dispute that. The Government has created a greater dependence on social security. I am trying to outline the alternative that we propose. The Minister went on to talk about family allowance provisions on the third or fourth page of his printed second reading speech. I acknowledge that the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party are at one in terms of family allowances. There is very little difference between us in relation to that. In terms of the family allowance supplement the Liberals will also leave the Labor Party's initiative in place. What we will do is additional. So that we reduce the future growth in dependence of people upon the Government and upon social security, we will introduce the child tax rebate, which the Labor Government will not do. We will also recognise child-care costs by introducing a child-care rebate. If this is not related to the Bill I will go he. I am outlining the coalition's better ways of doing things. The Labor Government brings in one or two major initiatives and then spends year in and year out putting bandaids over them. That is the way it does things. </PARA>

The truth is that this is nothing more than a political broadsheet being financed by the taxpayers of Australia to try to push this Labor Government's barrow. It is just plain dishonest. The Minister is using his Department to send this stuff out in the guise of helping pensioners, but all he is doing is promoting propaganda. If the Minister has announcements to make, I would go along with an A4 sheet of paper with dot points. But if the pensioners of Australia are to be subjected to this propaganda every two months between now and whenever the next election is held, the Minister should not come in here telling me he is trying to help people and inform them. He should not say that. He is playing the same game as the Nationals in Queensland are playing with their television promotions. It is not worthy of him. I will not name the other Ministers involved, but as the Minister moved this publication along the front bench they were sniggering and saying, `Ha ha, you are doing a good job there, Brian. Pump this propaganda out. Keep it up. We have to get back these elderly people whom we have lost as a result of our policies and whom we have been ignoring in the last handful of years'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although, unfortunately, this speech has been interspersed with interjections and frivolous points of order from the Minister at the table, in the final few minutes available to me I want to make reference to the veterans' affairs segment of this legislation. It is a pity that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) is not in the chamber. I want to protest that this legislation does not reverse the Government's program of handing over the veterans' hospitals to the various State governments. To its credit, the Western Australian Labor Government has said that it will have nothing to do with this proposal. But this Government, through the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, is pushing hard to ensure that there will be no such thing as a veterans hospital beyond 1995. The Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital is in my electorate and I take an interest in that hospital. I am aware that the average age of those who have been in that hospital in the past 12 months is below 70, but in this day and age, when people live beyond three score years and 10, I believe it is utterly unrealistic to suddenly make the judgment that there will be no need for hospitals for veterans beyond 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Minister to increase the number of non-veteran patients in the hospital. I recognise that, as the numbers diminish, the medical staff have to be given experience in all fields of health care. Perhaps the proportion could go from 20 per cent to 40 per cent. After the next election it probably will not even be important because my Party is sworn to abandon the Minister's policy. But let us bring rest now to the minds of the veterans, who are wondering just what awaits them in the future when the Government relentlessly pursues a policy of getting rid of all veterans hospitals by 1995. It is callous, unthinking and uncaring. I ask the Minister to reverse that policy. I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I regret very much that you were forced to intervene as often as you were by the Minister, from whom we would expect more and who should have been a more calm and rational person than he has shown himself to be tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Moreton was speaking about the Age Pension News. It is interesting that Opposition members always object when the most vulnerable in our community are given access to information on which they can make decisions about what they are entitled to, what they can apply for and how they can plan and manage their lives. Perhaps there is no more vulnerable sector in our society than age pensioners. It is reprehensible that the honourable member for Moreton did not acknowledge the action of the Minister in publishing this information in the Age Pension News. It has been overwhelmingly favourably received by pensioners right throughout Australia. They have welcomed it as a great innovation because, frankly, they were not being accessed. It is absolutely reprehensible of the honourable member for Moreton not to acknowledge the contribution the Minister has made in this way to age pensioners. In particular, to liken the administration of the Minister for Social Security to the corrupt National Party regime in Queensland, which for years the Liberals have been happy to support and to which they have defected from their own Party, I think is the height of hypocrisy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In commencing his remarks, the honourable member for Moreton spoke about the present Governor-General, Mr Bill Hayden, introducing the supporting parent's benefit and in fact suggesting that it would cost, I think, some $40m. It is a pity that the honourable member for Moreton did not inform the House why that was introduced. It was introduced, in particular, to rescue those women who were locked into marriage and were suffering, because of either beatings or alcoholism-an intolerable situation-and had no escape route; they had to remain in the marriage. It is always a matter of regret when a marriage breaks down. I think that the honourable member for Moreton would agree with me that when a marriage breaks down it is important to have support mechanisms so women can have real choices about staying in the marriage or not risking the financial security of the families by leaving the domestic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Moreton was going to say that the Opposition was concerned about the reasons for family break-ups. I find it sad that families break up. However, one of the really historic breakthroughs that Brian Howe has achieved has been the new Child Support Act. As a result of that Act people have to accept financial responsibility for families, particularly the children of families. That was never the case under 30 years of Opposition rule. The Opposition is quite happy to mouth all sorts of things in support of families and the institution of families, which we on this side of the House share, but the reality is that we on this side provide the action to back up the concepts. They are not empty concepts with us. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that the Government's whole philosophy of family support and social security is that the best means of support is by way of entry and re-entry into the work force. It is an outstanding feature of this Government that, given the poisoned chalice supporting 630,000 unemployed people, in our period of office that number has been reduced to some 380,000. At the same time, about 1.4 million jobs have been created. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has tightened the social security system. I suggest that honourable members look at a booklet put out on the reforms of social security policies and administration. That booklet demonstrates not only where the Government has tightened the social security system but also where we have increased the benefits available. Our family package, already enacted, is worth some $3.5 billion. Honourable members should contrast that with the Peaconomics announced under the guise of the Opposition's so-called tax policy. I will not stray into taxation and I will not say that I do not know what the marginal rates are. However, I make the point that every saving that has been made in social security has been turned back into the system, and more. We do not resile from the fact that we do not believe that Tony Packard and his family or Mr Elliott or any of the other millionaires in Australia are deserving of support from the public purse. We have always said that benefits should be targeted to those most in need. That is in stark contrast with the Opposition's approach. The Opposition takes from the most vulnerable, the most politically expendable in its terms, and gives, without any restriction, to millionaire families in particular. </PARA>

The likelihood is that new child-care centres will not be built in the burgeoning estates of Foxdale, Erskine Park, Minchinbury, Hassellgrove and Doonside. They will be built in the electorate of the honourable member for Bradfield, in St Ives. People in the western suburbs are entitled to child-care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have spoken about the unemployment situation which the Government inherited. Once again, I do not want to stray onto the tax package and suggest that unemployment would rise as would interest rates, but I want to say this about unemployment: there are many contrasts between what the Opposition proposes to do and what the Government is doing. I have already mentioned the number of people the Government has removed from the unemployment list and put into meaningful employment. Previous speakers have spoken about the jobs, education and training program for sole parents and Newstart. In the Budget we announced a $10m package to help the long term older unemployed-those over 55. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to put yourself in the position of a worker in New South Wales, say, aged 55, who was retrenched by the Liberal Government, probably from the State rail system. If he was not retrenched from the railways it could have been the Water Board or any of the other government instrumentalities where employment has been slashed. Some honourable members might approve of that and think that it is a good thing. However, I ask them to imagine the position of a person aged 55 years looking for a job and knowing that after nine months, under the Opposition's policy, he will not count; he will be a statistic that can be removed without any support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not disagree with the honourable member. In speaking about the changes that have been made I have not mentioned the family allowance supplement. I was very proud to have the Minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in my electorate. They came to Mount Druitt, not Prospect, Blacktown, Doonside or Campbelltown. It was actually Mount Druitt shopping centre. In fact, the Minister could probably show the driver how to get there because he has been so keen to get out there so often.

<PARA> The launch of that family allowance supplement was very important. This is a benefit paid to people in employment; it addresses the needs of those earning the least. This is real heartland stuff for a Labor government. We are very proud of that sort of initiative. Not only did the Prime Minister get a tremendous response, but the initiative also spoke volumes for the Minister for Social Security. Together they got a tremendous response in my electorate. The family allowance supplement has been introduced in a climate of Federal expenditure cutbacks. The $2.1 billion we are spending has been won at a time when there has been a consistent cutback of Federal expenditure. We are very proud that in this time of rigorous fiscal restraint by the Government we have been able to win through with real reforms such as the family allowance supplement. </PARA>

<PARA> I conclude on this note. We on the Government side are very proud not only of our achievements in the social security area but also of the accomplishments of our Minister for Social Security. The benefits we have put in place, such as indexation, have been hard won and they are long term. Indeed, it is a tragedy that, the Government having won through in hard economic times and having indexed benefits such as the family allowance, the Opposition is not prepared to bite the bullet and index what it is offering. The Opposition is taking from the poor to give to the rich-the reverse Robin Hood. It is giving not only to the rich but also to the mega-rich. There is no targeting, there is no compassion, there is no soul in its policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) is very sincere in his care and concern about people. I only regret that his passion this evening, as distinct from his compassion, led him into so much error. The honourable member has not been here for very long; I can claim greater longevity. I really do feel therefore that I should set him right so that he does not make the same mistakes again on a couple of points he made so wrongly with such feeling. It was the Fraser Government that indexed pensions. It was the Hawke Government that put pensioners in the position of being threatened with having to pay tax on a pensioner loan. It was the Hawke Government that had pensioners paying tax on the small amount of money they were allowed to earn before their pension was affected. Those pensioners who were getting as income just the minimum amount they could receive in order still to get the full pension paid tax on that minimum amount under a Hawke government, not under a Fraser government. It was the Hawke Government that last year raised the passions of aged pensioners intensely, just before the Budget, when the pensioners were saying that if they did not get the threshold lifted those of them who were getting only the pension would be paying tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Chifley ought to have a look at a few of those facts. He said that pensioners are very happy about the Government's decisions of late; they are very relieved that they have a promise for the future, that they will get something approaching indexation. They are relieved that the Government has taken away the penalty put on them in December 1985, when their increases were deferred another six weeks, just before Christmas, to save a few million dollars. I congratulate the honourable member for Chifley. He said the benefits had been hard won. I can imagine how hard he has had to work to get the Government to reverse that sort of decision. </PARA>

<PARA> The honourable member said that in 1973 the then Minister for Social Security introduced what he called the supporting parent's benefit. In fact, he did not; he introduced the supporting mother's pension. It was the Fraser Government that made that a supporting parent's benefit, extending it to men. Despite the pressure there had been from men rearing families, whether because they were widowers or because they were divorced, the Labor Government did not do that; a Liberal Government did it. Women who were separated or divorced from their husbands had a source of income previously, contrary to the assertions of the honourable member for Chifley. They were on the special benefits and on the widow's pension. There was a process of support for those women. The honourable member says that they were on long-term unemployment benefit. I do not know off the top of my head what the unemployment rate was in December 1972 when the Whitlam Government was elected but it was under that Government that unemployment in this country really took off. </PARA>

Prior to the Whitlam Government, conventional wisdom in Australia was that any government that let unemployment go over 2 per cent was out of office. I can remember the shock and horror when it went to 5 per cent in 1974 under the Whitlam Government and much higher subsequently thanks to the wreckage of the economy by the Whitlam Government from 1972 to 1975 from which this country has never recovered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Chifley expressed concern about there not being any new child-care centres in his suburbs. The honourable member for Chifley and I have had occasion to swap statistics in this chamber before about our respective electorates. He has since been good enough to acknowledge that, whilst part of my electorate constitutes a placed called the Gold Coast, not everyone living on the Gold Coast has his pockets lined with gold. There are some very poor areas in my electorate, including on the Gold Coast. I can tell the honourable member for Chifley that if it were not for private child-care centres, particularly in the Labrador area, which has a very high unemployment rate and a very high number of pensioners, a lot of supporting mothers in that area simply would not be able to go to work because child-care would not be available for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Many poor areas of Australia today do not have child-care available for people who can get jobs. In the area that I am talking about, those who have jobs get no relief at all because there is no government funded centre. Under the policy that the Opposition has announced they will get a child-care rebate; they will get help. They get no help at the moment. So long as it is confined to government, it is the whim of the Government and where the Government places child-care centres that determines whether those people get help. The honourable member for Chifley expressed concern that people with private child-care centres or who were interested in establishing them would not put them in certain areas. I have as much concern that governments do not put them in certain areas where they are needed. If we have encouragement for both systems-there is a commitment by the Opposition to the maintenance of the present and the promised free child-care places-we will have an expanded and a better availability of child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been noticeable that, apart from the honourable member for Chifley's reference, there has been no reference to the Opposition's promise of child-care rebates. The previous speakers, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) and the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Harvey), just avoided the subject. I am very pleased that the Opposition has promised child-care rebates. I mentioned it in my speech on the Budget. This was something that I said should happen and which women's groups have been saying for a very long time should happen. It will be a brave government that says that it should not happen. The Government, of course, will maintain the silence that it has essentially maintained on the subject in the debate tonight. The Opposition will not be silent, because it is a good promise. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue we are debating has been overwhelmingly the subject of family support and eligibility for the supporting parent's benefit. The amendments to the Act that we are considering have much to do with de facto relationships and how they can be established and, with that, whether an entitlement to a benefit for a family or a pensioner is established. It has rightly been pointed out that this will apply not only to those on supporting parent's benefit, widow's pension or whatever, but also to all pensioners. The debate has essentially revolved around women. </PARA>
<PARA> A term that Government members have used consistently in this debate is `vulnerable'. They talk about how they are concerned about vulnerable people. My heart goes into my boots because I remember a government decision in the 1987-88 Budget where a decision in relation to supporting parents was dressed up in the most positive possible language. Supporting parents were to be `counselled' when they presented themselves regularly at Social Security about this and that. It turned out to be nothing of the sort. It was policing. The Government should not dress this one up as counselling. It is policing. A Government member had a half-hearted go at dressing this up in positive terms earlier in the debate. It will not wash because too many of the women who are now on supporting parent's benefit went through that procedure and did not get the counselling or the support. We were told it was going to be information giving. Information giving indeed! Who will be giving the information? The recipients will be cross-examined. </PARA>
<PARA> People who are familiar with this group-the honourable member for Chifley is one-know that they are very vulnerable to intimidation, particularly by public servants. I do not want to bag all public servants tonight, much less all the employees at the Department of Social Security, but I would like to bag a few of them and the way they behave towards their clients, particularly on the subject of cohabitation in relation to the supporting parent's benefit. I get complaint after complaint about how people from Social Security approach people such as real estate agents and attempt to intimidate them. I have no doubt that they use the same intimidatory tactics against recipients of the benefits, against people who are far more vulnerable to official intimidation than are people in the business of letting accommodation to those on benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> It is highly relevant in this debate to talk about taxable income and tax rebates. It is highly relevant to point out that taxation policies are inextricably linked with the people who are affected by this legislation and who are on benefits or on lower incomes. It is relevant, for example, to point out that average income earners today are paying a much higher rate than they were under a Liberal government. I refer to statements made in a very thoughtful speech by the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson). It is a fact that we have many areas where people are given a disincentive to repartnering or remarriage or a disincentive to re-enter the work force-there are all sorts of disincentives to getting off benefits. Some of these are referred to as poverty traps, but some of the disincentives are even more subtle. For a long time we have heard about people who have done their sums and decided that they were better off separating or divorcing, with the women going on supporting parent's benefit while still getting financial support, which is concealed, from their former partners. We really have to address seriously those disincentives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not at all opposed to Government moves to stop fraud against social security. If people are receiving a benefit or a pension to which they are not meant to be entitled, we ought to take steps to try to stop it; but a little bit of lateral thought might be in order. We are forever trying to plug those sorts of loopholes. The sort of social change that has occurred in Australia and is still occurring, particularly in relation to the subject of marriage, whether de jure or de facto, is going to force a new approach. Trying to become more and more punitive will not altogether solve the problem. We need incentives for people to support their families and to work to support their families, not incentive to look to the public coffer or to have to depend on the public coffer. </PARA>
<PARA> I was a member of the committee of which the honourable member for Chifley was a member, and I agree with him that it is highly desirable that people be given incentives to get back into the work force, because that is the best way out of poverty. Child-care rebates will be an incentive for people to get back into the work force. Many women who attended meetings of that committee pointed out what a major disincentive the cost of child-care is if there is no access to child-care alternatives. People ought to have the widest possible availability of those alternatives instead of having to depend solely on government decisions about the location of those alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Opposition is not opposed to attempts to overcome fraud, but it does share the concern that has been expressed by many people about the way in which fraud is being approached. I have to make one comment, because I would be quite remiss if I did not refer to it. There has not been much debate about the actual criteria that are built into the Bill. I really want to know how the criteria that will be used as the basis on which responsibility for housework is distributed are going to be handled. I really want to hear the Minister's response to that. It has been pointed out quite sarcastically-but, I think, quite truly-that one can be quite sure that a household in which the man is making a substantial contribution to the housework is not one in which there is a marital relationship, whether de facto or de jure. It seems to be a very odd statement indeed. I have my misgivings about the guidelines essentially because I do not believe that they are going to be approached sympathetically. So many aspects of the matter of entitlements are not approached sympathetically or even politely by those whose job it is--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on a number of issues that have been raised by members of the Opposition during the course of this debate. First, let me pay a compliment to the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Harvey), the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) and the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) for their contributions from this side of the House. In many respects they raised most of the issues essentially involved in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should like to talk about unemployment benefits. Whilst this legislation addresses issues of child support, sole parents and reform of family payments, the issue that is of crucial importance is unemployment benefits. I am glad that the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) has returned to the chamber because, during the course of his contribution, he spoke about the Liberal Party's Economic Action Plan and what its proposals are to get people back into the work force. There are a number of ways to describe the honourable member for Bradfield and his contribution. Firstly, we know that he was not part of the team that included the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) and the shadow Minister for Finance, which drafted the action plan. We know that the honourable member for Bradfield was not consulted on what was going to be included in that plan in terms of employment benefits and getting people back into the work force. We know, similarly, that the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) was not consulted on those aspects of the action plan that deal with Aborigines and, in particular, the cuts in Aboriginal affairs that relate specifically to unemployment benefits, to which I shall come shortly-the $100m. </PARA>
<PARA> In this House on a number of occasions the honourable member for Bradfield has said that he was a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs which visited a number of communities in the Northern Territory-my electorate-and saw the extreme poverty which was visited upon people in that electorate. There is no doubt that that is true. But we now have a schizoid member for Bradfield, because he has now adopted a different approach. He has decided to accept that people should be dumped in the social sink and that the plug should then be pulled out. If one takes what the honourable member for Bradfield exhorted in his contribution to the action plan in conjunction with what has been put forward in terms of education and employment strategies, and in particular what has been put in place for Aboriginal Affairs and the $100m cuts in that area, one sees that the plug is well and truly pulled on the most disadvantaged group within the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of unemployment benefits, the so-called action plan contains a proposal not to allow for the creation of any new community development employment projects in the Aboriginal communities of the Northern Territory. Within that context is the idea that, after nine months, people will go onto special benefits. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the honourable member for Bradfield to examine those two things and to examine the labour market particularly in the Northern Territory as well as in the other remote areas of Australia. I ask you to think about the regional impact of this stupid proposal. There is absolutely no doubt about its impact. It condemns people to poverty. It condemns them to a future without jobs. It condemns them to a future without any opportunity for training or advancement in terms of income security. The Liberal Party has done this cheekily by, on the one hand, cutting off those benefits and changing the benefit structure, by dropping people off unemployment benefits so that they no longer have to pass a work test and no longer have to go to counselling by the Department of Social Security or the Commonwealth Employment Service; then the Liberal Party has knocked off all the training programs so that those people cannot physically get back into the work force because no jobs exist in many of those remote places. </PARA>
<PARA> Any social improvement program such as the CDEP scheme, which was introduced by the Fraser Government, is now going to be canned by the Liberal Party if it ever gains government-God forbid. The future for Aboriginal people, in the Northern Territory in particular, is one of total despair. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the great action plan, unemployment benefits will not be available after nine months. The plan is based on the philosophy of dole bludgers. The Government knows who the bludgers are in the community. Today in the Melbourne Age, Mr Elliott was reported as receiving an 81 per cent salary increase-$1.5m. (Quorum formed) I was talking about bludgers. We know who the bludgers are. Mr Elliott has got a $1.5m salary package. His salary has gone up by 81 per cent. He is going to be a net beneficiary of this Economic Action Plan. How is he going to be a beneficiary? He has just had another child-and I congratulate him for that-so he will get a rebate for the child allowance. He will get other tax rebates, and he will be a beneficiary of the windfall profits that will accrue to him as a result of the abolition of the capital gains tax. He is not doing too badly-and he is the bloke who calls out about bludgers! We know what this policy is all about, and we know the difference between the policies of the Australian Labor Party-policies that have been put through this Parliament by the Minister at the table, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe)-and the policies of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's policies will be seen by the electorate for what they are when we come to an election. The Opposition is advocating the politics of division. There is no credibility in the policies of those opposite. Let us remember that the cornerstone of the policies of the Labor Party, the cornerstone of this legislation which we are discussing tonight, is the concept of justice-social justice, equity in the distribution of economic resources, equality of civil, legal and industrial rights, fair and equal access to essential services, and the opportunity for participation by all in personal development, community life and decision making. There is the difference. Those opposite do not believe in equity in the distribution of economic resources; what they believe in is the transfer of benefits from the poor to the rich. They have decided to pull the plug on those people in that poverty trap, that poverty sink. They will not get fair and equal access to essential services, including education. There is absolutely no doubt what this policy is all about. It would remove any concept of fair and equal access to resources. </PARA>
<PARA> I again refer to the Northern Territory. Let me just remind the honourable member for Bradfield, who has so kindly spoken in the Northern Territory in the past, what his policy means. I remember vividly on one occasion his talking about the Papunya community and his feelings for those people. He does not feel for them any more; he has shown by his advocating of this policy what he really feels. Does he know, for example, of the unemployment statistics for the Northern Territory and of the number of long-term unemployed there? Unemployment periods run not just for nine months, but many times for over 12 months. In the Alice Springs remote area-that is, the area not including Alice Springs but outside the town and including Tennant Creek-73 per cent of those people on the unemployment benefit have been unemployed for longer than 12 months. For the Katherine remote region the figure is 64 per cent, and for the Territory as a whole it is 34 per cent-or 2,810 individuals. What are the members of the Opposition saying to these people? They are saying, `Get back into that sink; get back into the slime and the gutter because we don't want you. Go back to where Fraser put you; go back to where Menzies put you. Let's have a Thatcherite economy in this country; let's have division and social dislocation in this country and let's forget about those people in need'. That is what they are after, and they make no bones about it. </PARA>
<PARA> They try to pretend in this House that they believe in fairness and in families, but what about the families of the 2,810 people who are long-term unemployment beneficiaries in the Northern Territory, who have been unemployed for longer than 12 months? What have they done for them? They have knocked off Jobstart and Newstart, and they have knocked off Skillshare. Skillshare in the Northern Territory is very important. I visited a Skillshare group in Darwin recently, and saw a number of people who were being placed in jobs. What was the status of these people? The honourable member for Bradfield should take note of this, because he has knocked off the scheme. Two people have been out of work for 72 months-six years. What are Opposition members saying as a result of their action plan? Tough titty! They are saying that these people have been in that position for six years, and they can stay there forever. They do not give a damn. They make no apology for it. </PARA>
<PARA> But let me tell the House something else about this Skillshare group. The Skillshare committee comprises a number of people and the honourable member for Bradfield might like to know who some of them are. One of them is a former Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, and he is now the Minister for Conservation. The other is the Minister for Transport and Works in the Northern Territory Government. They are two people whom I understand to be close to the Liberal Party. They are two people whom I understand to be also sympathetic to people in need in the Northern Territory in this instance. What are those opposite saying to them? What is the message they are giving to the Northern Territory community via these policy prescriptions? They are saying to those people who live in the regional and remote areas of Australia in particular in this instance, because they are the people who spend longer periods on the unemployment benefit than other people in this country, that they do not care. </PARA>
<PARA> What are they saying about people who live, say, in Tennant Creek or Katherine and who might be made redundant when they are 45, 50 or 55 and are without any real prospect of finding a new job? They may have a redundancy payment as a result of their 15, 20 or 25 years in the work force, but those opposite are saying to these people that although they have that payment and are very close to getting the pension, the Opposition does not care about their retirement income and whatever plans they have for the future; they will not get any benefits from a coalition government until they have knocked off any money available to be paid out as leave, until they have knocked off long service entitlements and until they have knocked off any redundancy payments. The Opposition is saying to these young people that it does not care. What is it saying to those young people under 25? It now says they will have to face an assets test before they can get any benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrast that with what the Opposition is saying to its friend the bludger, Mr Elliott. It is saying to him, `Don't worry, pal, you don't need to go near an assets test'. All those people on the unemployment benefit need an assets test, but no-one else. It is saying to those people who are wealthy. `Don't worry, we will knock off the capital gains tax which was in place; you can get the windfall profits'. It might cost the economy over a period of years $400m, $500m-or $60 billion, as I saw in the Australian Financial Review the other day-but still it says, `Don't worry about that; just bank the money, John, or go home and give it to the wife-no worries'. But if someone is poor or unemployed, perhaps being a long-term member of the dole queue, sitting in the sink of poverty, what does that person have to do? He has to spend all his leave loadings and entitlements, all his holiday pay accruals, before he can get a benefit. What is the Opposition saying to those people under 25? It is saying they have to face an assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) has walked in. Here is a bloke-I will talk to him about this later-who was on the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. He fully supported the recommendations in a document called A Chance for the Future. What does it say? Among other things, it says that expenditure for Aboriginal education and training will be increased. I remind the honourable member what it says. It says it will knock off $10.6m from the land and economic development program, which includes the community development employment project's new programs. It says it will knock off $22m from community development support and community infrastructure. The Opposition thinks that Aboriginals do not need employment, education and training because they are the long term unemployed. So it says it will knock off $23m from that program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security said that the honourable member for Bradfield was not a part of the process for defining this program. I have some respect for the honourable member for Bass and I am sure that if he were involved in the process he would have said, `Hold on, fellows. The honourable member for Wentworth, the Ferrari driver, should hold on. Do not worry about it. Have you ever been to the Northern Territory or visited any of these communities?'</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bradfield told this House about his concerns for people living in remote communities, especially the Aboriginal people. What would he say? Would he be of help? He did not help. He came in here yesterday and made a fool of himself. He made some gaff that caused him to have his backside booted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock). </PARA>

<PARA> The honourable member for Bass made a pathetic contribution to the debate that has come from the Opposition front bench. I know from personal conversations with him that he feels for the Aboriginal people. I know about his concern for Aboriginal employment, education and training. He believes more resources should be devoted to that area, yet who are the people who are being targeted? It is the people the honourable member for Bradfield, the honourable member for Bass and other people on the Opposition benches see as the most needy in our community. They express concern for these people. Single parents who earn under a certain income level will not be beneficiaries of any of the programs which have been advocated by the Opposition. If one is an Aboriginal person, forget it. If one is a newly arrived migrant, forget it. If one is an invalid pensioner, forget it. The Opposition says, `Do not worry. It is okay, we will look after John. He is the President of the Party, the king of the bludgers, they are all sitting over there, and they are here often'. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the honourable member for Bradfield and to the honourable member for Bass that they counsel the renegade senator from Queensland who masquerades as the shadow Minister for finance and the honourable member for Wentworth. In fact, they could even talk to the Leader of the Opposition, although I doubt it. They should be taken aside and told, `There is not much wisdom in what you are doing. In fact, there is no wisdom in what you are doing. You are setting us on a division course. You are making sure that there is social dislocation, and social and economic disruption in this community'. Let there be no doubt about it, there is a recipe in this process, and the honourable members opposite know what it is. It is not just a recipe for giving the long term unemployed and those people least able to defend themselves in the community a kick; it is to put more people in the dole queues. All we have to do is go back to Thatcher's policies in 1980 to work out what they are doing. From those policies they have worked out the programs that they want put in place. What we should be concerned about is not only the long term unemployed but also the new unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House has been treated to one of the most incredible contributions that have been made in this debate. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) has nothing to say about the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) which is before the House. If he did he could not have been so absolutely out of touch with reality as to carry on the incredible distortion that we have just listened to. The circumstances of this legislation point up very clearly that the Government has realised many of the inequities, many of the unfair effects, of the present legislation and of the regulations that have been applied for some time past in the matter of entitlements under the benefits that will now be altered. I commend the Government for taking these steps. They have been obvious to many of us. Those of us who pay attention to our electorates have received many approaches from people who find that they are in some difficulty because their circumstances have been to some extent under challenge by the Department of Social Security. As these people put their case, one wonders what the truth really is. Of course many of us are concerned about the genuine cases, those genuinely in need, those who warrant special assistance, yet many are polling on the system, using the opportunity to take advantage of what is available before the loopholes are closed by this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will give the House an example of a young woman, with a child, who lives in a de facto relationship. It is discovered that the male living in that home has a Public Service job. There are few Public Service jobs that do not pay well, for which the income is not adequate. The intention is that that income should be able to sustain a family. We find that the taxpayer is paying because the situation in that particular home is ruled not to be a de facto relationship. Let us take that example in detail. We check back to find that the two people were living together at an earlier time, before the child was born. So questions are asked. Who is really the father? They are not sure because there were several other people who shared a house in another location. I hope that this legislation will provide a means of ensuring that that sort of breach can be assessed clearly and that the taxpayer will not be obliged to go on paying when it would be reasonable to expect that the interests of the child in particular ought to come first. The child grows up believing that it has a mother and father, but the mother says, `I am not sure who the father is'. There are horrific situations that drastically affect children in this country. The system, as it has been applied, is encouraging and not discouraging these situations to occur. Yet we hear the kind of rubbish that is parroted by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. He did not speak on the Bill before the House at all. He distorted the Opposition's policies. He distorted them totally and he knows it. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) that not only are issues about de facto relationships raised in this legislation but also there is the issue of the introduction of a waiting period for unemployment benefits, where recipients move to an area that reduces their chances of gainful employment. This has been a widespread community concern for a long time. It has taken this Government at least two terms to come to grips with that situation, and it is well overdue. We can look at other aspects where benefits obviously have been sought not because of a real need, not because there is justification, but simply to suit the whim of the person who wants to have a particular lifestyle. It is easy on the east coast of Australia to spend most of one's time on the beach. It is easy for a person to go to various locations to obtain a signature to confirm that one has applied for work. </PARA>

With the economy of this country running downhill, we will see where the extra 50 jobs and the hundreds of other people on that industry's payroll will get to. The jobs are in serious jeopardy as a result of award claims, a leave arrangement that runs for more than eight weeks a year, and the way in which the restructuring of awards has occurred. As a consequence, no extra productivity has been gained. The industry I am talking about is related to the beef industry; it is an abattoir, which is dependent on the export trade of this country. That abattoir has now to increase its charges. Whereas it was making a slight profit and was able to stay afloat, it is now facing a very grim financial outlook indeed. Yes, it has 50 extra employees because of award restructuring and all that went with it, but because of the economic stringencies we are faced with and this Government's economic policies, not only are those 50 jobs at risk but many more also.</PARA></TALK.START>

All of them were wrong. He talked about the problems that the unemployed in the Northern Territory would face. Does he not know that the proposition to try to create a better basis for social security benefits provides some new categories in order to get away from the 50 clumsy training programs that this Government has introduced? None of these 50 schemes is really working efficiently. What absolute rot we hear from the honourable member for the Northern Territory. The honourable member, like so many others, including the Minister, will go out and say that the Opposition's proposal is aimed at depriving people of unemployment benefit. That is utter rot. It has been proposed to put into a category of real significance those who have special problems. There will be a special benefits arrangement that will enable those people who are long term unemployed to be given some special consideration. That special consideration must be related to effective retraining, if that can be done, and effective recognition of their real problems. </PARA>

If we do not see a change of direction very quickly, this country will not be able to support those who need support and help. I suggest that, as the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) has an interest in Canberra, he ought to have a look at the figures disclosed in yesterday's Canberra Times. We have reached the stage in this country where less is being saved than is being spent. The honourable member for Fraser should look at the consequences of that and think about what is really happening in this country, where costs are running away with the dollar to the extent that those people who deserve some real opportunity are faced with severe hardship, where everyone concerned with providing gainful and productive employment is virtually being put out of business.</PARA></TALK.START>

Surely he will have the guts to get up at the close of this debate and recognise that what he has done has been worthwhile and offer some encouragement for it to be followed through in an effective and practical way. He will not do that because he has been playing politics all day. He played politics when he raised points of order earlier in this debate. He did not like the heat that was being turned on about the very ineffective administration by his Government. I do not reflect on those public servants who have had to carry out the instructions given to them by the incumbent Government. This country needs a new direction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. We have just had a waste of 20 minutes of the House's time, during which time not one fact was put before the House. It is about time that a few facts were stated. I will refer to some of the things that have been said by those opposite in relation to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989. What happened a moment ago reminds me of one of the reasons that people are losing faith in politicians. People think that politicians are people who will say anything and, if they say it often enough, maybe they will believe it themselves, although no-one else does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us not talk about statements that do not have any basis in fact; let us talk about a few of the facts. I refer first to some facts on families. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) said that we should recognise families. The payment of the family allowance supplement or its equivalent is giving on average an additional $50 a week tax free to over 500,000 families comprising 1.2 million children. Here is another fact: in 1983 when we came to office nearly 270,000 children were dependent on adults who were in receipt of the unemployment benefit. In August 1989 there had been a dramatic downturn in that figure to less than 170,000 children dependent on adults in receipt of the unemployment benefit. We have doubled expenditure on families. Our entire family assistance package is based on researched policies. Every piece of legislation that is introduced in this House by the Government is required to have a social justice component. In that way our objectives are objectives of equity. Our programs are income tested. We have indexed family payments. That is an historic reform. It is the first time that any Australian government has done that. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Moreton talked about the rocketing cost of programs. In fact, there have been savings of $5 billion in social security and we have achieved a Budget surplus. Michael Stutchbury, in an article in today's Australian Financial Review, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The quiet story of the 1980s, however, is how a Labor Government has cracked down on welfare dependency to a degree that Mr Malcolm Fraser probably could never have got away with. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason that Malcolm Fraser would not have got away with it is that he would not have tackled such an area with compassion or fairness, as we have done. It is an obvious absurdity to talk about the rocketing cost of programs. The honourable member for Moreton also talked about the growth in the numbers of those who need help. In fact, the opposite has been the case. I mention not only those who do not need help because they are no longer in receipt of the unemployment benefit and have found jobs, but also sole parents. The proportion of pensioners solely dependent on the pension is plummeting. In 1979 the proportion of female sole parent pensioners solely dependent on the pension was 67 per cent. By 1983 it had climbed to 71 per cent. After we came to office the proportion steadily fell between 1983 and 1987 to 66 per cent. In the last two years-years in which the Government's reforms have begun to bite-there has been a dramatic change. In January this year only 38 per cent of sole parent pensioners were solely dependent on the pension. Sixty-two per cent-almost two-thirds-of sole parent pensioners received some income from work or from maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the child support scheme has made a dramatic difference. Since the introduction of stage 1 the proportion of sole parent pensioners receiving maintenance-that is, support from the non-custodial parent and not from the Government-has increased by 36 per cent and average levels of maintenance have increased very significantly. Now that stage 2 has come into force, many more will receive adequate support from the non-custodial parent. How can the honourable member for Moreton talk about the growth in the numbers of those who need help when exactly the opposite has been the case?</PARA>
<PARA> Our Government has approached the situation of children in this area in four different ways. We have developed administrative procedures to prevent fraud and abuse. That is why I cannot believe that the honourable member made those comments. We are taking steps to lift the level of income support. The effect of this has been quite extraordinary. A sole parent with one child has received an increase in income of about 17 per cent compared to what that parent previously received. A sole parent with two children has received an increase of about 13 per cent compared to what he or she previously received. We are also making sure that sole parents receive adequate child support from the other parent. Through programs such as JET-the jobs, education and training program-we are providing appropriate information, advice, counselling, labour market programs, child-care, et cetera, to get those sole parents where they most want to be, that is, off dependency and into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one final comment: nothing has been revealed more sharply in the last few days and in the last couple of weeks than the difference in philosophy and approach between the Labor Government and the coalition forces opposite. There has been confirmation in the last couple of days of the very worst fears of the public. The coalition forces want to divide society. They want to create two classes. They want to maintain the mentality of dependency amongst people who are welfare recipients. They will put such people where they think they belong-in receipt of welfare-and keep them there. Michael Stutchbury in the same article in this morning's Australian Financial Review talked about some sort of soup kitchen underclass. That is what those opposite would like welfare recipients to be. That is the whole policy of the coalition opposite-to divide society. It wants people to have welfare child-care. One day, I suppose, it will want them to have welfare education. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) has revealed all, and he should not think we will allow people to forget it. The honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) talked about this legislation introducing selective unfair treatment. In other words, he said all families should receive the same benefit. So he is totally against targeting and getting taxpayers' money to where it is needed most. Yet the Liberal policy defines a separate group, the underclass. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) gets up, I will remind the House of what he said in his speech to the conference on social policy at the University of New South Wales. He said that the last six years had seen the rebuilding of the base for sustainable economic security for all Australian through employment growth, wages policy and, most importantly, the overhaul of the tax and social security systems. He said that it is now time to build upon the achievements of the last six years to address the conditions of the living and working environments of our people. It is not time to dismantle those programs and to give way to a coalition which is happy only when society is divided along the lines that suits that coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank honourable members on both sides of the House for contributing to the debate on the Social Security and Veteran's Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). It has been a somewhat wide-ranging debate and I will not attempt to summarise the contributions of either or both sides of the House. I indicate to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) that this particular piece of legislation does not address the issue that he raised about the rationalisation of veterans' hospitals. I assure the honourable member that the Government's policy of integration will be pursued with complete sensitivity to the interests of veterans to ensure that over time we are able to achieve a situation where veterans are able to gain much better access to medical services that they need than they are under current circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to run through in detail the comments of the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) except to reiterate that the Government has been successful-more so than certainly its predecessor governments-in terms of winding back social expenditure. It has achieved very significant savings in social security-as the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) said, of more than $5 billion-while at the same time ensuring much greater adequacy of and access to opportunity. We have thought through in detail the policy implications of the various proposals that we have had before us arising out of the Social Security Review and in the Budget context each year, and we have sought to improve adequacy and maximise opportunity for people who experienced under the previous Government much higher levels of unemployment than we had seen at any time since the 1930s. That was reflected not merely in terms of the numbers on unemployment benefit-about 680,000 when we came into office in 1983-but also in the vast increase in the number of sole parent pensioners and the increase in invalid and sickness benefit. Sad to say, all of that is labour market related. It is not unrelated to the massive increase in overall levels of unemployment under the macro-economic policies of the previous Government. That conclusion is unavoidable, as is the conclusion that this Government has been able to reduce dramatically levels of dependency and increase the opportunities for people to move into the work force. I would have thought that that is quite undeniable. </PARA>
<PARA> On the whole, we have tried to avoid arbitrary decisions. The Opposition's Economic Action Plan that has been referred to tonight is a kind of massive and insensitive arbitrariness and is the very reverse of the whole thrust of the policies that have been argued on both sides of the House. One of the confusing issues is that very often people on both sides of the House with an interest in social welfare tend to exhibit similar attitudes. Often there is not as great a difference between opposite sides of the Parliament on particular issues as one might think. But the honourable member for Bradfield apparently had very little part in the production of the economic sham put out by the Opposition; so he was led into a situation where he came into the Parliament and defended the cutting off of people from unemployment benefit after a period of nine months even though that would result in massive harm to people in particular situations. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) referred to people in remote Aboriginal communities. The honourable member for Phillip and other speakers referred to the impact on older unemployed people whose workplace had undergone structural change. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to reduce the number of people on unemployment benefit by 50 per cent and not cause massive suffering for people that are affected. The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), the Opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, is really the person who is involved in this debate tonight. In relation to these matters, no longer does anyone take seriously the honourable member for Bradfield. The honourable member for Wentworth essentially says that, one way or another, the coalition will achieve the result of an immediate 50 per cent reduction in the number of people on unemployment benefit by adjusting the guidelines on special benefit in such a way that it produces that result. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition is not on about a serious policy or a situation where it is really concerned about whether people get back into the work force and get access to training programs. It is not concerned about integrating this aspect of social policy with any other aspect of social policy. It is not worried that programs like Skillshare and Jobstart and training opportunities for people are being wiped out on a significant scale. After all, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) has been through that before. He tried very unsuccessfully to wipe out a predecessor program of Skillshare. The Opposition says essentially that, come what may, the figure of $1,145m will be saved from social security payments irrespective of policy considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> In a sense, that is why tonight in the debate there has been considerable tension on both sides of the House. For six years we on this side of the House have attempted to think through in a detailed way approaches to policy. We have worried about the ramifications. What we have seen in the last few days would make such an approach impossible. The honourable member for Bradfield will not be able to appear with any credibility whatever in many sectors of the welfare area within Australia. Essentially he suggests that policy consideration is not a priority and that the decisions made by the Opposition are not about what happens to people but are about achieving the bottom line that will offset payments that the Opposition projects might be made in the future to other groups within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not much point in saying very much more than that because there is no basis for engagement around the issues contained in this Bill or in the thrust of the Government's social security policy. </PARA>

The third and fourth amendments would ensure that there is no room for doubt. The proposed subclauses 43a (6) and 43a (8) would apply only in cases covered by the proposed new section 43a. These subclauses provide that the pension will not continue unless the Secretary, on the weight of the evidence, concludes that the person is eligible.

That section provides for a power to continue payments of pension pending resolution of reviews or appeals by the Department or the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> I have made it clear that the Government's position is that, when a pensioner promptly appeals or seeks a review, payment will continue pending appeal or review. This amendment would entrench the Government's policy, making it clear that a person whose pension is cancelled because it is concluded that she or he is living in a marriage-like relationship will be entitled to continue receiving payments pending resolution of an appeal or review when he or she has appealed or applied for review within 14 days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak about today's centenary of the Tenterfield speech which led to the federation of Australia. In the history of Australia it is not often that we have an opportunity to revert to the origins of this nation. Today happens to be the occasion on which exactly 100 years ago this night, in the Tenterfield School of Arts, as a result of a speech by a former Premier and then Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, Australia began the process which led towards its federation of which this House, of course, is part.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Interestingly, the circumstances follow the commemoration the previous year, as we had our Bicentennial, of a centennial in which the then British colonial administration tried to bring together the elements of Australia to talk about white settlement. The proposal was that there should be an amalgamation of the States into a council which might advise the colonial administration. It was not until Sir Henry Parkes went to Brisbane and managed to get the coincidence of views of the Queensland Parliament and the New South Wales Parliament that it was felt there was sufficient unanimity amongst the then divided States that there could be a prospect of the federation of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential characteristics of his speech in Tenterfield-there are many elements of it and I do not have time to speak about them-related to the problems of defence and to a General Edwards, who was a British general who had formerly been responsible within Hong Kong for the defence of the then colony. There was reference, therefore, to the needs of the States to meet together to talk about a common defence. There was reference to the need for a common railway system and to the problem that still exists in Australia of the difference between the State gauges. There was also, and more essentially, a reference to the fact that it was not suitable to Australia that there should need to be a violent revolution or a civil revolt within Australia to bring federation into place. </PARA>
<PARA> All of those things were referred to in a re-enactment that took place in Tenterfield on Saturday. I thought that Leonard Teale did a brilliant job in re-enacting Sir Henry Parkes's speech. It was great that Eric Geyer, the Chairman of the Committee, and Nancy Summers, the Secretary, brought together so many people. The point that I want to bring out tonight relates to two elements beyond that. The first is that not in 1889 but in 1989 I find it incredible that a move is being made in Europe for the amalgamation or integration of the states of Europe into a common bond in 1992. In 1889 the divisions in Australia were as great as they are in 1989. Yet today there is no move in Australia towards the removal of the barriers that divide us, as there is in Europe. We essentially derive our culture and that which we commemorate in a way because of the facts of 1889 and the Henry Parkes speech. There is no move here to remove those divisions that divide us. That is something to which we might give a brief thought. </PARA>
<PARA> The second element relates to our future and what Henry Parkes said 100 years ago this night. He spoke about the problems with our railways. He spoke about the difficulties that existed on that occasion of trying to get a responsible union amongst the States in order to bring together something that was not just an advisory council. I found Leonard Teale's rendition on Saturday so reminiscent of the problems of today. If we had an efficient railway system, if we had a communication base between our States, I would submit to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the members of this House, that many of the problems that we see on our roads, many of the problems in our infrastructure and many of the problems in our micro-economic reform would be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I pay a tribute to the memory of Sir Henry Parkes, who was three times Premier, a Colonial Secretary and a remarkable man but a product of a very difficult Birmingham environment, a man who brought an inspiration to Australia which made it whole. Tonight, 100 years later, I would suggest that the same inspiration might well apply to this Parliament of Australia as it did that 100 years ago. I would like to think that in Australia today there are more people like Henry Parkes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although I use the privilege sparingly, I want to take the opportunity of raising an essentially local issue. It deals with the profession, training and availability of optometrists in Western Australia. Until this year, the Australian qualified optometrists to the providers of the actual services for which they are trained were educated in only three Australian universities. This year, for the first time, Curtin University in Perth was allocated Federal funds for the specific purpose of instituting a course in optometry. It was a modest start. Twenty first-year students were enrolled for what was to be a four-year course. Although guaranteed funding was for only three years, there was a reasonable expectation, with inductees of about 20 in each succeeding year and assuming an adequate pass rate, that at the end of three years up to 60 people would be in the throes of graduating in the degree course of optometry. Expectations of students and their parents alike were framed accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It transpires that the university is now equivocating about whether the program will be continued, despite guaranteed funding, for reasons that are far from immediately clear. The uncertainty for the parents of students is alarming and, for students preparing for final year exams, it could be devastating. Unless the university takes immediate action to clarify the position, the prospects for this year's crop of students and for those who will enrol for next year are untenably obscure. Even if the financial wherewithal existed, those who passed this year would not have the option of transferring to the three established degree courses in the eastern States, each of which, I am reliably informed, is fully committed. Besides, the profession has been grievously undersupplied with graduates for many years, with Western Australia and the Northern Territory suffering more than most as a result. The extent of the shortage is best illustrated by the salary commanded by graduates. A graduate optometrist anywhere in Australia commands a salary in the range of $32,000 to $35,000 in his or her first year. That is just for starters, because in what is a classic sellers' market, conditions and perks of employment mean that the total cost of employment is much greater. </PARA>
<PARA> To counteract this, over many years Western Australian optometrists have campaigned for our tertiary institutions to meet a clear and unarguable demand for graduate optometrists. Federal funding for the current triennium, to go some way to meeting the needs of practising professionals, was eventually obtained, albeit to alleviate demand four years hence and thereafter. It now comes to pass that those who relied on explicit and implied assurances are, at best, left in a state of flux and, at worst, completely in the dark. </PARA>
<PARA> Although deserving of our prime consideration, it is not only first year and aspiring students who are affected. Parents, Curtin University staff and practising optometrists are in much the same boat. For the time being-but for the time being only-I call on the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) to take immediate action and prevail upon Curtin University to honour its legal and moral obligations to its would-be optometry graduates. The first step the university must take is to confirm, without delay, its intention to continue the graduate course in accordance with its initial agreement to conduct one and to accept, at the same time, Commonwealth funding. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1750" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CAPRICORNIA" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of the increase in the percentage of farming and grazing land purchased by foreign interests. Those increases, however, are from a small base and are believed to remain at a low level. The Australian Bureau of Statistics conducted a survey of agricultural land in 1983-84 and estimated total foreign ownership at that time at 5.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Where a foreign purchaser makes an equity investment in Australia, it is immaterial whether the purchaser uses his or her own money or borrows offshore.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The availability of foreign capital can advantage Australia in a number of ways: it adds to investment in Australia; it creates extra jobs for Australians; it expands market opportunities, and it allows economic growth to occur at a rate faster than would otherwise be possible. The confidentiality surrounding foreign investment proposals constrains the specification of particular examples. One notable example, however, is Auscott Limited which, until its recent purchase by Consolidated Press Holdings, was owned by United States interests. From its establishment in northern New South Wales in the early 1960s, Auscott has been a major cotton grower in its own right. Skills were brought to Australia from the USA through irrigation engineers, agronomists, cotton classers, marketers, farm managers and ginning experts. The company is now an integrated organisation processing and marketing about 23 per cent of the Australian cotton crop, comprising both its own production and that of independent growers.</PARA>
<PARA> Again, Japanese investment, for example, in the local beef industry is helping to secure and expand a Japanese outlet for Australian beef.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Foreign Investment Review Board's records indicate that approval has been given to foreign interests to acquire 7.2 million hectares over the period from 1982-83 to 1986-87 (see the attached Table 11.3 from the Foreign Investment Review Board Report for 1986-87). These figures take no account of sales of Australian land by foreign interest to residents of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Australian Bureau of Statistics conducts periodic surveys of foreign ownership and control of different sectors of the economy. In 1985, a survey dealing with foreign investment in Australian agricultural land by foreign interests was published.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Major proposals (involving acquisition of rural properties valued at $3 million or more) are examined individually under the Government's foreign investment policy and the possibility of adverse effects would be addressed at that time. Proposals which were judged to be contrary to the national interest would not be approved.</PARA>
<PARA> Concerns have been expressed that more vertically integrated foreign owned enterprises may lead to lower prices being received by individual Australian farmers and/or result in restricted market access for farm products from Australian farmers. There is no evidence at this time, however, of any such adverse effects. It is sometimes suggested also that `transfer pricing' practices-to transfer profits offshore-could be a problem but the Commissioner of Taxation is in a position to combat any such eventualities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology are undertaking research leading to a better understanding of the greenhouse effect and its consequences.</PARA>
<PARA> Based on national and international research, a CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research information paper of August 1988 identified increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as important causes of climate warming. This paper indicated that:</PARA>
<PARA> almost all the current increase in carbon dioxide is due to the burning of fossil fuels:</PARA>
<PARA> the increase in methane is closely linked to growth in the world's population and its growing need for food. The main sources of this increased methane level are cattle, sheep and the vast increases in the acreage of rice paddies. Losses from coal mines and natural gas fields also have contributed to the increased methane level;</PARA>
<PARA> nitrous oxide increases are due to fossil fuel combustion, burning and fertilizer use;</PARA>
<PARA> CFCs are human made gases that, although well recognised for their potential to destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere, contribute to greenhouse warming in the lower atmosphere.</PARA>

<PARA> Has the Government adopted a position concerning the current wave of popular unrest in the People's Republic of China; if so, what is that position?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government has condemned in the strongest terms the gross abuse of human rights which occurred in the suppression of the pro-democracy movement, culminating in the massacre in Beijing on 4 June 1989 and continuing in the period since then. These actions by the Chinese leadership have created an international wave of shock and revulsion, including amongst the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA> From the moment that news of these tragic events in China reached Australia, the Government has given the highest priority to urging the Chinese authorities to respect the fundamental human rights of their citizens and cease persecution of pro-democracy activists. This action was taken both through diplomatic channels and in a letter from the Prime Minister to Chinese Premier Li Peng on 12 June 1989. The Prime Minister's letter called on the Chinese Government to cease violence against innocent citizens and initiate a policy of dialogue, tolerance and trust. The Prime Minister noted that if these steps were taken, China would, in time, be able to resume its path of reform and modernisation and that, on this basis, Australia remained prepared to enjoy a constructive relationship with China, as we have since 1972.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government took a number of other steps to register Australia's abhorrence of the massacre and sympathy for its victims following these events in Beijing:</PARA>
<PARA> the Prime Minister's planned visit to China in October this year was cancelled;</PARA>
<PARA> the goodwill visit to Shanghai by HMAS Parramatta scheduled for June 1989 was cancelled;</PARA>
<PARA> a planned visit to Australia by a delegation from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade was postponed;</PARA>
<PARA> all Ministerial-level visits were suspended;</PARA>
<PARA> assistance was promised through the Red Cross to help Chinese people in need of humanitarian assistance following recent events;</PARA>
<PARA> the Government decided to extend temporary entry permits on application until 31 July 1990 for all PRC nationals legally in Australia on 4 June 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> These developments in China necessitated a fundamental reappraisal of Australia's relations with that country. On 13 July 1989, the Government decided on a framework for the conduct of Australia's relations with China.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken the view that it is imperative that Australia continue to signal its abhorrence of the human rights violations which have occurred. The Government will not consider any easy or early return to ``business as usual'' with China.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes it equally important that Australia avoid action which would harm the Chinese people, cause the country to become more inward-looking and stifle the pressures of reform so vital to the country's future.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that it is important to try to keep open as many channels of access and communication as possible, with a broad cross- section of Chinese society, in order to encourage a return to the policies of reform and liberalisation. We wish to open doors, not close them; to do otherwise would force the Chinese people to bear the burden of the conduct of their leaders.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that Australia's capacity to influence events in China through unilat- eral action is limited, and has therefore taken into account the reactions of like-minded countries. We will continue to explore with them areas where collective action might prove effective in influencing the Chinese Governments.</PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with these broad principles the Government had decided to:</PARA>
<PARA> continue to make vigorous human rights representations, bilaterally and multilaterally, and in particular urge the Chinese Government to adhere to internationally accepted standards of human rights and the principal human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;</PARA>
<PARA> maintain an appreciably downgraded relationship, by suspending all ministerial visits both ways at least until the end of 1989;</PARA>
<PARA> continue to constrain severely official contacts at senior levels at least until the end of 1989, except those of a narrowly economic or commercial nature;</PARA>
<PARA> suspend all political visits, involving party and parliamentary delegations, at least until the end of 1989;</PARA>
<PARA> suspend indefinitely high-level defence visits (including ship visits), and all possible defence sales;</PARA>
<PARA> suspend indefinitely all visits by public security and police officials, except visits considered operationally essential by Australian law enforcement authorities;</PARA>
<PARA> urge State Premiers to adopt a similar policy approach in relation to visits;</PARA>
<PARA> in relation to aid policy, postpone consideration until further review of any new technical cooperation and agricultural research activities which might be proposed by the Chinese Government;</PARA>
<PARA> suspend the Market Advisory Program in 1989-90;</PARA>
<PARA> not accept until further review any new aid proposals under the Concessional Finance Facility/DIFF mechanism;</PARA>
<PARA> support, to the extent consistent with the articles of agreement of the particular institution, the deferral of consideration of new loans to China from international financial institutions;</PARA>
<PARA> not support at this time further liberalisation of COCOM restrictions on Chinese access to dual-use technology;</PARA>
<PARA> continue educational, legal, cultural, media, economic and other professional exchanges, in order to keep open as many channels of access and communication as possible;</PARA>
<PARA> and to reassess this policy approach were any major changes to occur (leading to either an improvement or deterioration of the situation in China), and in any event before the end of 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is confident that the overwhelming majority of Australians share the sentiments on which these measures are based.</PARA>
<PARA> We remain committed to a long-term cooperative relationship with China. It is the Government's earnest hope that moderation will prevail, enabling China to resume the path of reform and providing the foundation for the resumption of a strong bilateral relationship based on respect, common regional interests and mutual benefit.</PARA>

<PARA> What are the current shipping freight rates in terms of (a) bare tonnage per tonne, and (b) container rates, from (i) Australia to Japan, (ii) Chile to Japan, (iii) the west coast of the US to Japan, (iv) Singapore to Japan, (v) Melbourne to Tasmania, (vi) Melbourne to Perth and (vii) Australia to the west coast of the US.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr Robert Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Freight rates are determined on a commodity basis and for containerised trades shipping lines rarely quote general cargo rates. When these are available they are generally much higher than specific commodity freight rates. For a commodity not listed in a tariff, FCL (full container load) rates are available on application.</PARA>
<PARA> Information on freight rates for trade areas outside Australia is difficult to obtain without specifying a particular commodity and most industry sources were not able to supply a general rate. Where quoted rates are available they usually involve a broad range to take account of different cargo types and volume/mass considerations. In order to undertake a meaningful comparative analysis of shipping freight rates in various trades there needs to be a greater specification of the characteristics of the trade including commodity flows and dominant cargoes. The following rates were obtained from commercial sources and provided as a guide to freight rates applying in the separate trades.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) I am advised that shipping industry sources are not aware of the term ``bare tonnage per tonne'' and therefore I am unable to supply information on this part of the question.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Indicative container rates obtained from industry sources for 20 foot containers for the trade areas listed are:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Conference tariff rates are not published. However, some examples of Conference FCL container rates for commodities under contract are $5527 for reefer containers of meat, $4465 for reefer containers of cheese, $1160 for pet food and $1200 for aluminium ingots. Rates for commodities not under contract are generally higher. An indicative range for non contract cargo is $1100-4000.</PARA>
<PARA> Non-Conference freight rates are about 10 per cent less than Conference rates. Rates provided were in the range $900-1200 for FCL non refrigerated cargo, $4000 for meat (reefer) and $3600-3700 for cheese (reefer).</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) No rates available.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) freight rates for non refrigerated cargo were in the range $US1200-2000.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) freight rates for non refrigerated cargo were in the range $US600-950.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) an indicative rate provided is $950 for containers under 12 tonnes and $1020 for containers up to 24 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) an indicative rate provided is $1675 for FCL containers of non refrigerated cargo and $1925 for FCL reefer containers.</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) an indicative conference rate for non refrigerated cargo is $2300-2560. The rate for commodities not listed in the Conference tariff is $255.10 per 1000 kilograms.</PARA>

<PARA> In 1987, government endorsed a test system to be developed.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the implementation of the test system in 17 sites (unions, employer bodies, companies) the government agreed to develop a full national system. Coopers and Lybrand were engaged to determine the likely revenue, users and price those users were prepared to pay.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The full year effect on taxation revenue of the amendment to section 82a of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 made pursuant to section 81 of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 is estimated to be of the order of $40m.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The income tax law specifically provides that a deduction is not allowable in respect of a contribution payable under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. If, however, there is sufficient connection between the studies undertaken and the derivation of assessable income, self education expenses in excess of $250, including higher education tuition fees, not being contributions under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, are allowable deductions under s.51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The statistical information necessary to separately identify self education expenses from other deductions allowable under s.51 is, however, not available. It is therefore not possible to provide the information requested as to the number of taxpayers eligible to claim income tax deductions for self education expenses in 1986-87 and 1987-88.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 15 August 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to a statement in the May/June issue of ``Consumer Views'' that some pesticides, including chlordane/heptachlor, are being dumped in Australia by a US company; if so, is the statement accurate.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What is the Federal Government doing to ensure that harmful pesticides are not dumped in Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of the article and the statement regarding the insecticides chlordane and heptachlor to which the honourable member refers. It is a charge often made against these insecticides and it is incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA> Pesticides are not being dumped in Australia and in respect to chlordane and heptachlor, their use is still approved in the USA for the control of termites. Heptachlor is also approved for control of Fire Ants and until recently also approved as a seed dressing.</PARA>
<PARA>Both chlordane and heptachlor continue to be permitted for use in many other countries.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) To prevent dumping and to ensure that pesticide products are safe and effective, all new products sold in Australia must first be cleared and registered under the Commonwealth Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act and individual State pesticides registration legislation. It is an offence to sell and in most States, to use an unregistered product.</PARA>
<PARA> The organochlorine insecticides such as chlordane, heptachlor, aldrin, dieldrin, DDT, HCB and lindane, have been declared to be prohibited imports under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations and importation for approved purposes, such as termite control, where there are as yet no satisfactory alternatives, requires my specific authorisation. No approvals for DDT importation will be given.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Did the Minister personally deal with the temporary import application to bring the giant panda Wei Wei from China; if so, why.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Did the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service have full authority under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 to make a decision on that question.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Did the Minister personally stop the Acting Minister from being involved in dealing with the application while the Minister was overseas in 1988; if so, why.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an estimate that more than $1m would be raised for the China Wildlife Conservation Association, specifically for the preservation of the giant panda, from the proposed display of Wei Wei in Australia, together with promotional displays.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the facts that Wei Wei (a) is a 17 year old male, (b) has been certified as infertile by the Shanghai Zoo and (c) was acquired by the Chinese Government before 14 March 1984, the date of the listing of the panda species under the CITES convention; if so, what relevant interest is served by prohibiting bringing in, for the purpose outlined in the application to the Minister, a 17 year old infertile panda for public exhibition.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) With regard to the visit to the Melbourne and Sydney zoos in 1988 of a young pair of caged giant pandas, (a) was the Minister responsible for, or did the Minister assent to, the temporary import permit, (b) in what respects does the Minister suggest the visit differs in principle, or in likely effect on the animal, from the proposed visit of Wei Wei and (c) how much money did the visit raise for giant panda conservation.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Has the Minister received, either directly or indirectly, orally or in writing, representations in relation to the application for importation of Wei Wei, or in relation to the proposed visit of Wei Wei, from parties other than the applicant; if so (a) what were the dates of the representations, (b) who made them, (c) were they oral or in writing and (d) what was their substance.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr Holding</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Section 43 of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 provides for the Minister, at the Minister's discretion, to give or refuse to give an authority for the temporary import of animals into Australia as part of a circus or exhibition.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. However, Section 76 of the Act provides that, although a power under the Act may be delegated, this does not prevent the exercise of the power by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. It was agreed with Mr Holding that I would deal with all matters relating to the application.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Mr Cambridge has indicated that his contract with the Chinese Government contains such a provision.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a), (b) and (c) Mr Cambridge has provided a copy of a telex from the Shanghai Acrobatic Troupe indicating that this is the case.</PARA>
<PARA> The giant panda is considered to be one of the rarest and most endangered animals in the world. It is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) which registers plants and animals in extreme danger of extinction. A 1976 survey concluded that fewer than 1 000 pandas survive in remote areas of China and it is believed that numbers have declined even further since that time.</PARA>
<PARA> There is strong concern internationally to ban the temporary display of giant pandas outside China. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) urged zoos outside China and the Chinese authorities to cease their involvement in exhibition loans of giant pandas, once the loans in Canada, Sydney and Melbourne were completed.</PARA>
<PARA> The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) has recommended that specific consideration be given to the proposition that any exhibition should only be an adjunct to and completely compatible with an international captive breeding program for the species.</PARA>
<PARA> These recommendations were made in recognition of the critical conservation status of the giant panda and in a belief that commercial activities related to endangered species tend to put pressure on the wild populations.</PARA>
<PARA> The refusal to approve importation of a giant panda as part of an acrobatic troupe accords with the recommendations made by the world's leading conservation bodies and is consistent with the strategies being developed internationally for conservation of this most endangered species.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) (a) Yes. Approval was given, under delegated powers, for the temporary importation of two giant pandas in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The 1988 panda visit was a bicentenary gift from China to Australia and the animals were exhibited at Melbourne and Taronga Zoos. The import was approved under Sections 13 and 36 of the Act which allow for the exchange of live animals between approved zoological organisations and prescribed scientific organisations as defined by the Act. The proposal from Mr Cambridge would have had the panda performing as part of a travelling acrobatic group.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) It is understood that more than $800,000 was raised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Ter- ritories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Airstrips in Antarctica range from gravel, sea ice and compressed snow runways suitable for large wheeled aircraft to unprepared areas of snow used for ski-equipped light aircraft. Sea ice is normally suitable for only a few months each year and compressed snow runways are often prepared only for specific operations. It would be very resource intensive to assemble the detailed information requested on all areas used to land aircraft. I have, however, arranged for data to be prepared on the more significant airstrips where it is available from information which is provided under the exchange provisions of the Antarctic Treaty. The data is reproduced below. It should be noted that the detail varies from nation to nation and is incomplete in some instances. The exchange information does not generally contain details of facilities beyond those for the current operating year.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The purpose of the Countrylink program is to improve access to Commonwealth government services and programs by people in rural and provincial areas by making information about Commonwealth government services and programs more accessible.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In the 1988/89 financial year total expenditure on the program was $913 841.29. For 1989/90 the program has a budget of $400 000. Records do not allow a clear differentiation between establishment costs and operating costs.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) (a) The response to the advertising undertaken is best measured by the number of 008 phone calls received. Each caller is asked where they heard about the Countrylink 008 line. In 1989 approximately 80% of calls on the Countrylink 008 line were a result of direct mail advertising, 4% from newspapers, 16% from other sources. Based on present predictions around 20,000 Countrylink 008 calls are expected to be received in 1989-90.</PARA>

<PARA> (7) (a) The estimated cost of the Countrylink shopfront/display to attend 40 shows/field days during 1988/90 is $120,000.</PARA>
<PARA>(b) The purpose of the Countrylink shopfront/display is to help improve the access of rural and provincial people to Commonwealth Services and Programs by enabling people to talk directly to Countrylink staff about special needs and to have access to the range of brochures, books and information held in the Countrylink database.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) (a) Current records do not enable an accurate assessment of the establishment cost of the Countrylink database. The most significant cost element is the staff cost of entering data provided by other departments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes-The over optimistic projections of nuclear generating capacity made in the 1970s and early 1980s have not been fulfilled. The projections now being made, however, are likely to be more realistic given that they are based largely on reactors in operation.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) At present the Department does not undertake primary research in this area, and refers to a number of internationally recognised publications for this information, particularly the Red Book.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Department uses a range of internationally recognised publications in assessing the growth of nuclear power. The Nukem projections for the year 2000 nuclear power capacity are not inconsistent with the Red Book, and both publications indicate that non-communist world demand for uranium in the year 2000 will be in excess of 50,000 tonnes U.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) (9) and (10) I am aware that R&amp; is being undertaken on `inherently safe' reactors in a number of countries. My Department is not yet in a position to assess the prospects for such technology, given that its commercial viability remains to be proven. The Department is not aware of any decision having been taken for commercial development at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) (12) and (13) I am aware of the article to which the honourable member refers. The Nuclear Engineering report of July 1987 is about the cost effectiveness generally of the US nuclear industry and indicates, that with escalating costs there is agreement between US Regulators and public utilities that sweeping changes are needed to maintain the viability of the nuclear option in the US. The article highlights issues specific to the US industry which impact on costs, and as well, canvasses developments which US utilities see as a means to improving the economic performance of the industry without affecting safety. This is also the theme of the June 1988 Nuclear Engineering report.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) It is not possible to make sweeping assumptions about the competitive costs of nuclear power. As a general rule where coal fired power stations are built in close proximity to supplies of low cost coal they are more competitive than nuclear. The situation, however, is also affected by discount rates. Recent information on comparative generation costs for new coal and nuclear power stations, supplied by the CEGB to the public inquiry presently being held on the proposed Hinkley Point C PWR station, indicates the cost of electricity per kWh from a new power station to be as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>5%</PARA>
<PARA>Discount</PARA>
<PARA>rate</PARA>
<PARA>8%</PARA>
<PARA>Discount</PARA>
<PARA>rate</PARA>
<PARA>Coal ...</PARA>
<PARA>2.50 pence</PARA>
<PARA>2.97 pence</PARA>
<PARA>PWR ...</PARA>
<PARA>2.24 pence</PARA>
<PARA>3.09 pence</PARA>
<PARA> The level of incentives/subsidies provided by Governments to electricity generation in their respective countries would also need to be taken into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the future demand for Australian uranium, it will of course be affected by the number of nuclear power stations in operation and operational costs will be a factor in power utilities' long term planning programs for the continued use of nuclear power. Longer term projections however, for demand not yet under contract, show a substantial expected increase in the latter half of the next decade and market opportunities, which should be enhanced by a projected decline in inventory levels, should occur.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Changes made in the tax arrangements applying to superannuation, announced in 1983 and 1988 and also in the 1989-90 Budget, have been designed: to achieve more equal tax treatment of different types of benefits (i.e. lump sums and pensions); to provide fairer access for all members of the workforce to superannuation tax concessions; to provide incentive to preserve superannuation benefits until retirement through access to concessionally taxed rollover vehicles; to secure more even-handed taxation of income attributable to different types of assets funding superannuation benefits; and, as superannuation spreads in the workforce, to contain the substantial cost of taxation concessions by largely eliminating the deferral of taxation that results from taxing benefits at the point of payment rather than at the point of accrual. As a result of these changes, the taxation of superannuation has been placed on a fairer and more consistent basis, enabling individuals and the industry alike to invest and plan with certainty, while retaining very significant concessions as an incentive for adequate self-provision of retirement income. Details of the changes in the arrangements are contained in the 1983-84 Budget, the May 1988 Economic Statement and in the 1989-90 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The potential tax liability in the different circumstances described would depend on a number of factors not adequately identified, including in particular the period in respect of which the lump sum accrued, the extent to which the benefit was funded by the employer or employee contributions, the recipient's other income in the year of receipt and (after 1 July 1988) the type of fund from which the eligible termination payment is paid.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A superannuitant's rights to lump sum benefits within the Retirement Benefit Limits are limited only by the rules of the superannuation scheme from which the benefits are paid. No changes affecting a person's entitlement to superannuation benefits in lump sum form have been introduced by the present Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Section 4a of the Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915 provides that, subject to that Act, the laws (including the principles of common law) in force in the Australian Capital Territory are, so far as they are applicable to the Jervis Bay Territory and are not inconsistent with a Jervis Bay Territory Ordinance, in force in the Jervis Bay Territory. The principles of common law referred to in section 4a include the principles relating to the liability of an occupier of premises or property to a person who enters the premises or property. Until recently, the common law was understood as providing for different duties of care depending on whether the injury to the entrant was caused by activities being carried out on the premises or by the nature of the premises and also depending on whether the entrant was an invitee, licensee or trespasser (the last mentioned category including a person who enters for the purpose of robbery). In the case of Australian Safeways Stores Pty Ltd v. Zaluzna in 1987, however, the High Court of Australia held that the existence and extent of such a duty of care is governed by the general law of negligence. The High Court approved the following general statement of the law:</PARA>
<PARA> `it is not necessary, in an action in negligence against an occupier, to go through the procedure of considering whether either one or other or both of a special duty qua occupier and an ordinary duty of care was owed. All that is necessary is to determine whether, in all the relevant circumstances including the fact of the defendant's occupation of premises and the manner of the plaintiff's entry upon them, the defendant owed a duty of care under the ordinary principles of negligence to the plaintiff. A prerequisite of any such duty is that there be the necessary degree of proximity of relationship. The touchstone of its existence is that there be reasonable foreseeability of a real risk of injury to the visitor or to the class of person of which the visitor is a member. The measure of the discharge of the duty is what a reasonable man would, in the circumstances, do by way of response to the foreseeable risk.'</PARA>
<PARA> The application of these principles could, in a particular case, render a occupier of premises liable in damages for injury to a person who entered the premises without authority. Issues would include the likelihood of the person entering the premises, the nature and extent of the danger and the means available to avoid or reduce it. Also, the occupier could incur liability in damages for injury caused by the occupier failing to take reasonable care in relation to dangerous measures designed to deter or apprehend an unauthorized entrant.</PARA>
<PARA> The above principles apply where injury is caused unintentionally. Under the common law, an occupier of premises is not liable in damages for injury to an unauthorised entrant caused by the occupier acting to protect his/her property or family against the entrant, provided that the occupier used no more force than was reasonably necessary in the circumstances for such protection. A further proviso is that, in many circumstances, force can only be used if the entrant has failed to comply with a request to leave the premises. Again, whether such a request should be made will depend on the circumstances of each case.</PARA>
<PARA> There may be legislation altering or supplementing the above common law principles in relation to specific situations in the Jervis Bay Territory. In the absence of a specific situation requiring my consideration, however, I have not requested my Department to expend the resources necessary to carry out a search of all potentially applicable legislation. Also, whilst I have endeavoured to assist you by outlining the general principles, it is outside my responsibilities to provide legal advice to members of the public. If a member of the public wishes to have legal advice in relation to a specific situation then that person should consult a solicitor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), considering the conduct of former and present councillors and employees of the Tweed Shire Council took evidence on 19 July 1989 from Mr Ross, then an officer of the Department of Administrative Services and previously a senior member of my staff from mid 1983 to November 1987, in relation to a sum of $5000 paid into his bank account in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ross testified that after leaving my staff and before joining the Department he had been paid for preparing a report which was submitted to a person whose activities are under investigation by the ICAC.</PARA>
<PARA> I requested an examination by the Departmental Fraud Control Unit of Mr Ross's activities since joining the Department. This was instigated immediately and he was allocated to different work.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the appearance of a second witness before the ICAC on 7 September 1989 I requested, through the Minister responsible, that the Australian Federal Police (AFP) investigate the activities of Mr Ross. At the same time he was moved to another area in my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> I wrote also to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs requesting that he investigate references made at the ICAC to certain immigration matters. Further evidence in relation to this was given to the ICAC on 3 October 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> On 9 and 10 October 1989, Mr Ross was recalled by the ICAC and in the course of giving testimony he agreed he had:</PARA>
<PARA> previously given perjured evidence to the ICAC;</PARA>
<PARA> misled the AFP;</PARA>
<PARA> conspired with others to conceal his participation in certain business dealings; and</PARA>
<PARA> engaged in conduct when employed by me which was reprehensible and in breach of his duty to me and the Government, namely the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information.</PARA>
<PARA> The resignation of Mr Ross from the Australian Public Service was accepted from close of business 10 October 1989. Had the officer not resigned, my Department was prepared to proceed with dismissal action.</PARA>
<PARA> When first employed, all the security, police, character and pecuniary interest checks on Mr Ross were satisfactory. At no time while he worked for me was I given any reason to believe that he was a party to any activity of the kind the ICAC is investigating.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand AFP investigations are continuing and that co-operation has been established between the ICAC and the AFP. The AFP is now responsible for taking action which may lead to the consideration of criminal charges being laid against Mr Ross. The Fraud Control Unit will continue to work closely with the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Certain advice was sought from the Attorney-General's Department, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the AFP. I am unable to comment further while the investigations and the inquiry are in progress. See also my response to question 1 above.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am unable to confirm that Mr Ross used the name Michael Prince although in evidence to the ICAC he agreed that others may have used that name for him. Mr Ross has admitted being a paid secret partner in Mr Cassell's consulting firm.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes.</PARA>
