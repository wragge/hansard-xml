<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in paying tribute to the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child), said that she had made history, and made history well. It is my honour this afternoon to nominate as her successor the person who has been at her right hand for the past 3 1/2 years, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay). Since his election in June 1979, the honourable member for Grayndler has made an outstanding contribution to this House. I will mention two areas of his service. First, I refer to his service on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure, a committee on which the honourable member for Grayndler served between 1979 and 1986. He was that Committee's Deputy Chairman from 1981 to 1983 and its Chairman from 1983 to 1986. Secondly, the honourable member for Grayndler has served this House as its Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker from February 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position of Speaker demands a thorough knowledge of the Standing Orders, the rules and procedures of this House. The honourable member for Grayndler has demonstrated a sound record in this area. On the occasions when he has occupied the chair as the Deputy Speaker and as Acting Speaker, he has applied the rules fairly and firmly. The position also requires sound administrative ability. Along with the President, the Speaker is responsible for the running of the Parliament. On the occasions on which he has acted in that role, the honourable member for Grayndler has performed those duties well. </PARA>
<PARA> The position of Speaker requires representational skills of a high order. On the many occasions on which the honourable member for Grayndler has represented the Parliament both here and overseas he has performed that role with diligence and distinction. The position of Speaker also requires a commitment to the committee system of this House. I have mentioned the service of the honourable member for Grayndler on the Expenditure Committee. Certainly, during his period as Chairman, the inquiries have been relevant to the needs of contemporary Australia. There have also been important inquiries. I mention just one-the inquiry into nursing homes. The report of the Committee was entitled In a Home or at Home. That inquiry led to the establishment of the Government's home and community care program. Under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Grayndler that Committee was truly an exercise in taking the Parliament to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 the honourable member for Grayndler was also responsible for the development of the first comprehensive committee system for the House of Representatives. That committee system works well and it owes its success to the honourable member for Grayndler. He offers experience and a proven record in all of those four areas. In addition, he will bring to the position of Speaker a loyalty to and love of this institution. In his period of service not only has he developed an interest in a wide range of policy areas, but he also has a close interest in the way the institution works and its traditions. I recall that some years ago in a discussion the Leader of the House referred to the honourable member for Grayndler as the `parliamentarian's parliamentarian'. That truly sums up his commitment to this institution. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways the position of Speaker is the loneliest job in this place. The Speaker frequently faces unique pressures and must face them alone. He must interpret the atmosphere of the House and move to a swift resolution of pressures. The honourable member for Grayndler will bring to this task a wealth of experience, a proven capacity for judgment, authority and determination, and a commitment to the Parliament. Above all, he will bring to the position great personal warmth. Both sides of the chamber have in the honourable member for Grayndler a person who will serve the House with distinction and in friendship and in the highest traditions established by his predecessors. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that we nominate the honourable member for Curtin, Allan Rocher, for the position of Speaker. There are certain harsh realities about politics. As I commence these remarks, one reality is that the weight of numbers seems to be on the other side. If on this historic occasion, when the first woman Speaker retires, there could be equally some historic movement in the amorphous blob of the Caucus to consider the arguments, one would find that the argument in favour of Mr Rocher outweighs the argument in favour of the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin was elected as a senator for Western Australia in 1977. He resigned in 1981 and was elected to the seat of Curtin at a by-election on 21 February 1981 and has retained the seat since then. He has been a significant contributor to debates in this House. He has served both Houses with distinction and has long experience in committees in the other place as well as here. He has served on the Senate Committee of Privileges, on legislative and general purpose committees, the House Standing Committee on Standing Orders and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and has been a most distinguished Deputy Chairman of Committees in this House since April 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall that on a previous occasion, when the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) was nominating Mr Rocher, he referred back to the qualities that former Speaker Snedden defined as necessary for occupying the position of Speaker. A cursory examination of those qualities reveals to me that only Mr Rocher would qualify of all members in the Parliament. I will remind the House what they were: integrity, judgment, commonsense, firmness, patience, impartiality, tact, a sense of humour, self-confidence, presence of mind and, above all, firmness tempered with kindness. Nothing more befits the honourable member for Curtin and, with the greatest of respect to the honourable member for Grayndler, he runs second on every test. Allan Rocher unquestionably has all the prerequisites suggested by former Speaker Snedden and he would unquestionably make an excellent Speaker of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I need hardly lecture honourable members on the nature and history of the Speaker in the Westminster system. However, the reality is that that impartiality that exudes from the Speaker's chair in the mother of parliaments, has not always been evident in this chamber, particularly under this Government. Honourable members would search in vain not merely for examples of the honourable member for Grayndler naming any miscreant on the other side but also for any Labor Speaker-save and except for Speaker Cope, and we know what happened to him as a consequence-seeking properly, within the Standing Orders of this Parliament, to deal with members from his own Party. Again, on that test, Mr Rocher comes with hands that are so clean that he named and had expelled the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck). So one has a scalp on his belt and the other does not in terms of his own side. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not always received that degree of impartiality which the Parliament actually demands. Allan Rocher exudes that impartiality. It is with great pleasure, albeit with little confidence, that I move that he take the Chair of the House as Speaker. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great honour to second the nomination of the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay) as Speaker of the Australian Parliament. The office of Speaker brings with it many onerous responsibilities, the most difficult being keeping dignity and order in this chamber, sometimes in periods of extreme tension between members and parties. Whilst serving with former Senator Reg Withers on a parliamentary committee a few years ago he offered me, as a relative newcomer, some pretty sound advice about this place. He said, `We're not here for a tea party, you know; it's a fight to the death to decide who will form the next government of Australia'. This `fight to the death', as Reg Withers called it, sometimes involves some pretty torrid exchanges in this House. The first qualification needed by any candidate for Speaker is the ability to keep order in this chamber with firm and fair decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last 3 1/2 years Leo McLeay, as Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker, has demonstrated that he has already developed the toughness required and earned the respect of both sides of this House which is needed to be Speaker. In particular, he has worked with the support of Speaker Joan Child to expand the role of the House of Representatives committee system which, in the long term, will significantly enhance the role of back bench members of this chamber and provide for a more rigorous examination of the Executive and the Public Service. As a member of the task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on retirement incomes I also had the pleasure of serving with the honourable member for Grayndler in a series of meetings around the country. Again, he did a great job there. </PARA>
<PARA> Before Mr McLeay's election as Chairman of Committees, he was Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure. His committee reports include Patronage, Power and the Muse, on funding for the arts, and his report In a Home or at Home on the provision of care for the elderly resulted in many changes, including the home and community care program and major reforms for elderly people. I understand that he was even responsible for lobbying for a bit more money from funding going to opera and ballet being redirected to our developing rock industry. That is something that I commend. As his taste in music indicates, Leo McLeay will be one of the youngest Speakers of this House; he is only 43 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members-How old?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask honourable members opposite just to listen as they will learn something. He was born in working class Marrickville. I am happy to note that both his parents are sitting in the gallery this afternoon, with his wife Janice and youngest son Martin. I am sure that they are very proud of their son, husband and father. Mr and Mrs McLeay must be proud that their son, the product of the local parish primary school, St Pius-and, like the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and myself, the product of the firm authority of the De La Salle brothers-can be nominated on this day in this chamber. I hope for those opposite that Mr McLeay does not use the same firmness and discipline that was applied by the De La Salle brothers. Leo McLeay, having left school at year 10, took his first job as a telegram boy at Marrickville Post Office. After becoming a telephone technician and working for Telecom Australia he worked very hard to be elected as the member for Grayndler, and he has served his constituents with distinction ever since. He will not forget those people in Marrickville and I am sure that he will discharge the office of Speaker and its responsibilities with dignity and distinction.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in seconding the nomination of Allan Charles Rocher. In doing so I must remark with some amazement at the comments made by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee). I suggest that he chose his quote most inappropriately if he and the Government have any real commitment to the traditions of Westminster government. In nominating him for Speaker, to quote a partisan remark that reflects a commitment to partisan politics I think is quite amazing. I sincerely hope that, should Mr McLeay be successful in this ballot today, he will recant the remark that he is prepared to fight to the death to achieve the election of a particular party to government. What is fundamentally important in this place and in all parliaments throughout this country is that we do have independence and we do have a bipartisan approach from the Chair. Regrettably in recent times that has not always been obvious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleague the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) spoke at some length about the qualities that Speaker Snedden identified as being important for a Speaker. He spoke of a person needing the highest integrity. When it comes to Allan Rocher's integrity there can be no question; when it comes to his judgment there can be no question at all. We saw an example of this in this place the other evening in his handling of a very sensitive incident involving a member of the Government, where he chose to take a very mature and independent approach to ensure that there was no embarrassment caused to the Parliament. That, of course, highlights his common sense which again is a fundamental quality required by a Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, these qualities are needed more than ever because of the events that have taken place in this Parliament in recent months and recent years. Never before, in the history of this Parliament, to my knowledge, have we had documents prepared which refer to the decline of Question Time, documents with a title which refers to the decline of Question Time in the Hawke era, blood sports and media events. What we need is a Speaker who will address the need to make this Parliament more relevant and more in tune with the community. Mr Rocher will of course address those problems. He would recognise the need to ensure not only that questions are asked in accordance with Standing Orders but also that answers are given in accordance with Standing Orders. Perhaps he would do something about the excesses of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in terms of the length and relevance of his answers. Perhaps he would even address the Treasurer's language. We on this side would not resile from his total commitment to enforcing the Standing Orders with impartiality to both sides of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The quality required of a Speaker is to do something about the use of dorothy dixers which increasingly in this place are used as a substitute for parliamentary statements. I am sure that someone with the understanding of Standing Orders and the commitment to the Parliament and the Westminster system that Mr Rocher has would address that problem. There is an urgent need in the lead-up to the election to ensure that this Parliament remains relevant to the Australian community, that Question Time fulfils its appropriate role which is that it is an opportunity for information to be sought and information to be provided; for it no longer to be a media stunt for blood sports, or for the substitution of statements-this is provided for in other places in Standing Orders- or as an attempt to prevent the genuine seeking of information by the Opposition. It is important that Question Time become orderly, that all honourable members, including members of the back bench, have an opportunity to pose their questions. I have no hesitation in commending Mr Rocher's nomination to the House. I find him eminently qualified for the position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free) in which he used the words `outstanding contribution', `sound record' and `fairly and firmly'. Let us see what the Canberra Times had to say about some of those things on Tuesday, 25 October. It is a pity that the Labor Party Caucus did not read this particular newspaper in 1988 on this particular matter. I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The performance of Mr McLeay . . . is not good enough for Australia's Federal Parliament. It has been that way for more than two years. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister asks who the Canberra Times is. That is a good one for the record. Let me go a bit further and look at the words of Derek Parker, a well known political scientist. He wrote in the Current Affairs Bulletin on April 1989 in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that the duration of Question Time has remained static, how can the number of questions have dropped?</PARA>
<PARA>This article is in relation to the Hawke Government's dealing with Question Time. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The answer is clearly that the Government's answers, especially to questions from its own backbench, have become longer. In the 1987 Budget sitting/1988 Autumn sitting period, 206 replies exceed 750 words, with about a quarter of these exceeding 1,000 words. Of the eight replies which exceed 1,800 words-taking about 20 minutes-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My point of order is that under the Standing Orders relating to the debate on the election of a Speaker there is a requirement for the debate to be relevant. The points that have been raised here by the honourable member for O'Connor are points that are made in relation to the conduct of Question Time-when neither Mr McLeay nor Mr Rocher, the two candidates, has been in the chair. I would submit, therefore, that the detail in which the debate is taking place does not go to the character of either Mr McLeay or Mr Rocher and is irrelevant to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a direct quote of how Question Time operates, Mr Browning, and the Standing Orders, of course--</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Clerk-I will rule on the point of order. It places me in a very difficult position, as the House would realise. I think the honourable member for O'Connor can continue in the vein that he has been following. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much. By their squeals would we know them. Continuing the quote of Mr Derek Parker in the Current Affairs Bulletin, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The standing orders, of course, do not stipulate the length of answers, so it is effectively left up to the Speaker. Very long answers, however, obviously limit opposition opportunities by reducing the overall number of questions. It is a tactic which can only work with the Speaker's approval and thus his or her agreement to a partisan strategy which involves a denial of what Question Time is for: the asking of questions. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the indictment from two independent commentators-the editor of the Canberra Times and Mr Derek Parker-of the person whom this Government has chosen to inflict on this Parliament. Members of the Government can always rely on my behaving myself when they do. That is the point that is most necessary to be known. They are the people who are abusing the Parliament and the Leader of the House takes most responsibility for that. If he gets off the Speaker's back, there may be a chance that that person will have the opportunity to do his duty in the way that Speaker Snedden once said it should be done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The comment of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) goes to the point I want to make about Leo McLeay, and that is, irrespective of factional differences, Leo McLeay has been one of the strongest supporters of multiculturalism in Australia. He has supported continuously all actions in favour of multiculturalism. His work for the various ethnic communities not only in his electorate but also throughout Australia has been outstanding. At a time when many people opposite could do well to recognise that Australia consists of people from all over the world-we are a multicultural society-Leo McLeay, in his work, has put forward a great deal and done a lot to promote that cause. In that regard he will be a Speaker who represents not merely the members of this House but also all Australians, because he is cognisant of the fact that Australia is a multicultural society and consists of people from many other places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard a lot from the Opposition about the abuse of Question Time. I am not aware of a claim in any democratic country, but it is made constantly by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), that it is not possible for a Minister, when answering a question, to compare the policies of the Opposition with those of the Government. If that determination were to be made, which it never has, it would be an abrogation of democracy. The continual interjections by the honourable member for O'Connor on that point are out of order.

I join with the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free), who nominated you, in expressing the view that your family must be extraordinarily proud of you and your achievement. What you have done before coming to the chair has been adequately described on this side of the House. Your career commenced in the area of local government. In your time in this place you have displayed a considerable interest and involvement in and commitment to a wide range of areas of interest and importance to your constituents. I must, particularly from my own experience, refer to two areas. As has been said, you were co-chairman of my task force on retirement incomes. The work you did in that capacity played a significant part in the evolvement of the wide ranging policies the Government has been able to adopt with wide approbation in that area. I thank you for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, I have been in your electorate with you and have seen your absolute commitment to the interests of all sections of your community and your particular interest in trying to ensure that those who come to Australia from overseas to make this their new home should be made welcome in this country. We are all indebted to you for your particular interest in that area. You come to the Chair with great experience, great commitment, great integrity, and an appropriately wide range of interests which give you a feel for the real interests and aspirations of the Australian people. Therefore, both personally and on behalf of the Government, I congratulate you and wish you well. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that you will also allow me the opportunity of briefly paying tribute to your predecessor, the honourable member for Henty, Joan Child. As has been said already in this House, and as I said in Caucus this morning, about the honourable member for Henty: she made history and she made it well. All our respect, regard and our affection go to the honourable member for Henty. We thank her for the job she has done over many years, and most particularly in her job as Speaker.

And on these occasions we join in congratulating you and say to them that we share, in a sense, the satisfaction of a family rejoicing in the elevation to the great post to which you have risen today. Party differences may divide us but your occupancy of that position, as I say, is an occupancy of very great tradition and convention, and we look to you to uphold it and wish you and your family all the best. </PARA>
<PARA> I also join with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in wishing the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) well. We cannot rewrite history. We have disagreed with a number of her rulings. But we hold her in the highest personal regard, and this is the first step in the process of two steps towards her retirement from this chamber. I would wish on the occasion of the first step-namely, retirement from the position of Speaker-before she retires from the House of Representatives at the next election, to thank her, to wish her the best of health and enjoyment in whatever she pursues after her retirement from this House, and to wish her and her family well. </PARA>

As the Leader of the Opposition has said, we have not always agreed with her rulings but we have always respected her position in the chair. Perhaps I might just say to you, Joan, that I think it was particularly appropriate that you went out on a very high note and that in your last day in the chair, in your last Question Time, you sat the Treasurer down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I add my congratulations to you on your election. It is with the utmost goodwill that I express the hope that you will merit the support of the House in your important work and, as a consequence, enjoy the respect of all honourable members. I have had occasion once before to echo the sentiments of Speaker Peel when he said to the House of Commons, `Without the support of the House, the Speaker can do nothing. With that support, there is little he cannot do'. Mr Speaker, given your experience as Chairman of Committees, you will appreciate those words more than most. Although your conduct of proceedings in this chamber will be the criterion on which your contribution will be publicly judged, there is other equally important work. In tandem with Mr President you are required to oversee the management of Parliament House and its precincts. It is not generally known that that task involves management of an annual budget which exceeds amounts appropriated to run some government departments. That side of your duties should account for a greater amount of your time than the time you actually spend in the House-usually without the publicity of the kind generated while you occupy the chair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There remains plenty to do or be settled in the running of Parliament House. Mr Speaker, not the least of your problems will be remedying the dearth and the conditions of employment of Hansard reporters. Whether that problem is the result of the amalgamation of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff into and subordinate to the Joint House Department is a matter for you. Ultimately, of course, it is a matter for the Parliament. I wish you well in resolving that and recurring problems with regard to catering and the provision of other services, many of which involve industrial relations issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Being amongst the first formally to congratulate the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) on her election to the Speakership in February 1986, I am pleased to have the opportunity to pay my respects to the honourable member for Henty on her abdication, premature though it is. She has distinguished herself in this place, both as a person and as Speaker. On more than one occasion I have shared and appreciated her friendly good humour.

I also thank you for the honour that you have bestowed on my electorate of Grayndler, which is one of the most ethnically diverse electorates in Australia. Only four members have represented the electorate of Grayndler since it was first created. I thank the House for allowing me to make my mark, along with Fred Daly, Frank Stewart and Tony Whitlam. I thank the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free), the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) and the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) for their remarks in support of my candidature. I am pleased to see that their eloquence swayed the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt), and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) for their remarks. I assure the honourable member for Curtin that I value his friendship and I see no animosity in his decision to run for this office. In the 10 years that I have been a member of this Parliament I have made friends on both sides of the House. I hope I can continue to rely on those friends for advice. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was sitting in my office this morning thinking of what I should say today, I glanced at my desk calendar. The motto on the desk calendar read, `He that is overcautious will accomplish very little'. That, of course, reminded me of the old saying, `He who makes no mistakes learns little'. I hope that my friends on both sides will ensure that in the first month or two in which I hold this office I neither learn too much nor accomplish too much. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dobell mentioned in his remarks that I had started my career as a telegram boy at the Marrickville Post Office. It is a long way from Marrickville Post Office to the high office of Speaker of the House of Representatives. But it does say to the people of my electorate that in Australia we still can be whatever we wish to be. For the people who live in my electorate, many who have come from countries around the globe where there is no such thing as parliamentary democracy, the fact that someone who has lived and grown up with them can reach this high office is of merit. </PARA>
<PARA> If the House will allow me, I would also like to make a few remarks about my good friend the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child). In joining with the Prime Minister and other speakers, I would like to say that the bond of friendship I have had with her over the last three years as her Deputy has made me feel a very lucky person. I particularly thank her for giving me the opportunity to hold this high office. The best way to sum up Joan Child is to read into the record the editorial in the Sydney Daily Telegraph this morning entitled `End of an era'. The editorial stated:</PARA>
<PARA> She reached the top through sheer grit and feminine tenacity. She was not fired by political ambition but by a fierce sense of humane justice. Her political career was sparked by anger during the Vietnam War. </PARA>
<PARA> And life was not easy for Joan Child. Widowed in 1965 she worked hard to rear her five sons and she epitomises the true fighting spirit of the Aussie battler. </PARA>
<PARA> She worked on a factory assembly line, as a hospital cook and a cleaner and rose from those humble jobs to one of the highest offices in the land. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Child is an inspirational example to all women. She showed that a woman has a place in the House as well as the home. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is the best way to sum up our dear friend Joan Child. I thank the House once again for the honour it has bestowed on me and, as Joan said in her acceptance speech for the office of Speaker, I can assure all honourable members that my door will be open to all of them. I hope that you will help me to do my job. I assure you that I will do this job to the best of my ability and with the fairness that you all demand. I thank you very much. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In putting forward the nomination of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) I say to the House that he is thoroughly qualified to take up the position for which I have nominated him. The Parliamentary Handbook tells us that Mr Edwards was elected to the House of Representatives for the division of Stirling in Western Australia in 1983, 1984 and 1987. He was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. He is still a member of that Committee, which has been renamed the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. He has been a member of the Joint Statutory Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings since 5 May 1983 and is also a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Within Caucus he is chairman of the economics committee. As you would know, Mr Speaker, that is a committee that has overseen some of the great reforms that we have put into this Parliament. Mr Edwards has held that position with distinction. Recently he has been Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the electorate of Stirling Mr Edwards is a tireless worker. Nobody works harder than he does. As members of parliament we all like to think that we work to our utmost and do our very best for our constituents. From my conversations with the honourable member for Stirling I thought that I was up with him until one day I read in a newspaper that on one of his early morning swims he had pulled one of his constituents out of the surf when that person was in difficulties. As a member with a landlocked constituency I will never be able to equal him on that one. No-one represents his or her constituents more effectively than Mr Edwards does. He is a tireless worker for them and for the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member is also a very keen sports follower and supporter. Ron is well known in his local area for supporting all forms of sport and giving them every encouragement, right through to international events. Sometimes I have been quite surprised when watching these events to see Ron pop up on them. He is one of those rare Western Australians who follow rugby, over and above our great Australian rules code. </PARA>

He does the best for his constituents by making sure that his local clubs are well looked after. When I looked at the pictures in the hallway of former Deputy Speakers, I noticed that the last Chairman of Committees to come from Western Australia was Mr Joe Berinson. He is currently Attorney-General in the Western Australian Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to say something about the candidature of Mr Clarrie Millar. The Opposition has put up a very good candidate and it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge that. Clarrie Millar is a thorough gentleman. He is one of those rare members of the Opposition who happen to have travelled through life and have learnt something and that sets him apart. Clarrie, I am sorry but I cannot vote for you today. You would understand that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment to such high office. I trust that with the passage of time in this important office you will prove to be not just the choice of the Right but the right choice as well. I congratulate the retiring Speaker, the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child), for the work she has done for the Parliament, her place in history and her personal goodwill which she always showed to me and, I know, all other members of the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to speak to the nomination of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) because he is the best qualified of any member of the Parliament, any honourable member, to be the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees. He is the most knowledgeable and experienced member. He has the best temperament, an important part of which is to allow things to cool down from time to time. His eloquent and elegant language by itself has that cooling effect as people work out what it is that he has actually said. He also has a great record of impartiality and has shown sound judgment on every occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> What of the honourable member's experience? He was the Chairman of Committees, Deputy Speaker and, on many occasions, Acting Speaker in the five years from 1978 to 1983. That in itself is a better training ground for experience than anybody else has been able to put forward in any other nomination. Since then he has been a Deputy Chairman, a member of the Privileges Committee and a member of the Procedure Committee. In other words, he has total experience-more so than any other member. He has been a member of the House since 1974 and would have observed five or six Speakers in office over that period. If honourable members do not want to accept my comments on his impartiality, I will quote the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on, I think, five occasions in relation to this nomination. First of all, April 1983 when I think it was the then honourable member for Hughes, Mr Les Johnson; again in February 1984 when it was the honourable member for Henty; and again in February 1985. I will quote what the Prime Minister said at that time:</PARA>
<PARA>No member in this House is more universally liked and respected than the honourable member for Wide Bay. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister evidently thought that that was still the case in February 1986 when you, Mr Speaker, were first elected as Chairman of Committees; and again in September 1987. I say to the Prime Minister and to those on the Government side of the House: for once, just for once, because the honourable member for Wide Bay has announced that he is not contesting the next election, in other words he would be the Chairman of Committees between now and that election, let him be elected to the position. Just for once, accept that the honourable member is the best-honourable members know that he is the best-and vote for him. Actually honourable members should support their Prime Minister in the comments that he has repeatedly made in this House over these years. </PARA>
<PARA> Can I also acknowledge the sound judgment of the honourable member for Wide Bay because in all of the years that he has been in the chair I cannot remember any contested or challenged situation which did not indicate his very impartiality, his very cool nerve and his very sound judgment. I use a cattle industry term to describe the honourable member for Wide Bay: because of his experience with the industry, he has been performance tested. Over all the years in this job he really knows what it is about. Honourable members should not let their fertile imaginations run away with anything in that regard either. I do formally nominate the honourable member for Wide Bay, Clarrie Millar, for Chairman of Committees. I believe it would be both just and proper, and a recognition of his very considerable role in this Parliament, for him to be elected to that position today. </PARA>

While many of us in Western Australia would not support him in that view, I have no difficulty with his football preference and I watched the game with interest. But imagine my surprise when his very handsome picture appeared on the television screen that night and underneath it were the words `member for Perth'.

I might say that as a member from Perth it is necessary for us to spend a great deal of time together sitting on aeroplanes and indeed my electorate adjoins that of the honourable member for Stirling. It is in that way that many times our duties overlap, and indeed it is necessary for us to cooperate. I can say that I have found him always to be totally reliable and very consistent. He is an extremely hard worker but, more important than that, he is respected by people in his constituency and by the general population in Western Australia. The reason that is the case is that he is genuine. What you see is what you get, when it comes to Ron Edwards. I might say that in this place his contribution has always been thought-out and very constructive. It is only over the last year or so in which he has increasingly been deputising in the chair that we have come to see him operate in that way. He has been a very firm and fair chairman and he has carried out his responsibility with a commendable show of commonsense and good humour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might say with respect to the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) that I appreciate that he is performance tested and indeed many of the qualities that I have ascribed to Ron Edwards I could equally ascribe to him. It is my view that he has played an important part and made an important contribution here and certainly I respect the advice that he has given me from time to time. But what Ron Edwards provides is additionally some youth and some enthusiasm for this role which will complement your experience, Mr Speaker. I believe that the honourable member for Stirling unquestionably deserves the support of the House on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA> At times like this we concentrate on the importance of the role of the office that is under consideration as well as the experience and suitability of the people who are nominated to be particular officers. At the moment we are concentrating on the office of Deputy Speaker. Like the office of Speaker, this office plays a very important and difficult role in the Parliament. The Speaker and Deputy Speaker of this Parliament have to tread a very fine line in upholding the dignity of the House and its many traditions. If the role is to be fulfilled as it should be, then the person in the chair must be able to withstand pressure from both sides of the House. Through his or her rulings that person can do much to enhance the quality of debate and the role of Parliament as a truly legislative forum. </PARA>
<PARA> Because my constituency is close to the Australian Capital Territory I had the privilege between 9 May and the end of last year to welcome some 2,000 schoolchildren to this building. There have been occasions when I have been embarrassed by what has been going on in this chamber when I have known that some of the schoolchildren from my constituency have been in the gallery. The role of the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker and, indeed, the temporary chairmen of committees is to uphold the standard of the Parliament. This can be done in two ways: first, by the example that is set and, second, by upholding the Standing Orders. The best way to uphold the standard of this Parliament is for the Speaker and Deputy Speaker to lead by example. </PARA>
<PARA> The person who has been nominated by the Opposition for the position of Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Wide Bay, Mr Clarrie Millar, has unquestioned and unchallenged integrity. Certainly he is a person who has not only the credentials-as a result of his long experience in this Parliament and his total of five years as a Deputy Speaker-but also the integrity, judgment, commonsense and, indeed, personality to preside over the affairs of this chamber. I have much pleasure in seconding his nomination. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Murray and Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) has pointed out, the honourable member for Wide Bay was Deputy Chairman of Committees from 1978 to 1983. On a number of occasions he was also Acting Speaker. In large measure the conduct of this House and the perception that the public has of the House as a whole and of its individual members rests in the hands of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker. At no time during the five years that the honourable member for Wide Bay was Deputy Speaker can I recall the House being out of order or being in the position where any of us would have felt ashamed of the conduct of the House. I strongly and warmly support the nomination of the honourable member for Wide Bay in terms of both his experience and his personal suitability for this very high office. </PARA>

<PARA> I simply reiterate, in congratulating the honourable member for Stirling, that he occupies a position of very great authority and brings to it some experience in various committee work and as a Deputy Chairman of Committees. The duties of impartiality and those qualities that I enunciated, laid down by Speaker Snedden, apply also to the Chairman of Committees. The high regard in which the honourable member for Wide Bay is held is largely because of the way in which he conducted himself when he was Chairman of Committees in the past. He was a role model for so many. We congratulate the honourable member for Stirling. We wish him well. I like the honourable member for Stirling; I respect him very much. I have no doubt that he will undertake his tasks admirably. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I thank my colleagues and members of the House. They have indeed done me a great honour, and they have also honoured my family, to whom I owe so much for helping me to achieve my position here. They honour my electorate as well, and all the constituents of my electorate. When people make kind remarks about a person, he often wonders whether it is him that they are talking about. I thank all of those who have spoken, particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt) and my colleagues the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) and the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth). I felt that it was important that Western Australia be well represented here today. I thank those honourable members for supporting me. I say to the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths) that there are no more ballots today, so we can relax. I listened carefully to the remarks of the Speaker and his observations about opportunity and the chance for us to do well in this country. I also have that inheritance, and as the son of an engine driver I am proud to have made it here. I think many people in Australia would feel equally that this is a very special country in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleagues mentioned the names of people who have previously held the position of Deputy Speaker. Of course, the names McLeay and Child are fresh in our minds. I join with many others in wishing the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) very well. In my view she always represented great commonsense, warmth and decency in politics. When she got her hands on an issue, one knew she had it the right way round. That was a very special quality she always had. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I congratulate you. You represent a very important tradition in Australian politics. The role of Irish Catholics in the Australian Labor Party is a very significant one. You are one of many who have that very important background. I acknowledge that, and I am sure that your electorate is very proud of you. I look forward to working with my colleagues who make up the team that is known as the Chairmen of Committees team. That is a very important team. We have a lot of work to do in this place to keep the chamber running. I also look forward to working more closely with the Clerks because they also have a very important part to play. I think that this opportunity is very important for us. I also say to my colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay: I heard all the speeches made about you, Clarrie, and I look forward to drawing upon your experience. At one stage I think there was probably someone on our side who was about to go for the sympathy vote, but the Australian Labor Party does have discipline and it stuck there right to the end. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people often ask me what is so special about politics. I think that politics has two very special elements. Firstly, it is a game in which conflict is assumed to exist, one does not have to pretend. Many people in the external world pretend that conflict does not exist. In politics one assumes that it exists. Secondly, one sees his ideals and values being acted out. To that extent it is very self-fulfilling. For those of us who are privileged to be here, we have the opportunity to be part of the main game. There is no doubt in my mind that this chamber is where it is all at. I say to members of the public and members of the Press Gallery, `This is the main game, and I am pleased to be part of that main game'. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make one other observation: one reason I decided to move into this arena was that my colleague, now the President of the Senate, the Hon. Kerry Sibraa, gave me great inspiration and made me realise that there is a positive role to play in the Parliament. In playing my part in the position to which I have been elected, I hope that I can represent all members of parliament and provide a fair and important forum in which they can operate in what I would claim is the most important game in Australia. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Initially I extend my congratulations to the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards). Happily there is a touch of perverse satisfaction in the outcome-not that I was surprised at it. When Ron was first appointed as a Deputy Chairman of Committees in this place, I took advantage of my relatively advanced years and my experience in the chair to offer to him the comment that he showed a great deal of promise and aptitude for the job and it could well be that in the fullness of time he would make a good Deputy Speaker for this House. We have arrived at that point in circumstances not envisaged, circumstances which we all lament to some extent, because that was dependent or contingent on the resignation of the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child). I am not surprised that the honourable member has been elected, and I wish him well. The position that he will occupy, in cooperation and collaboration with the Speaker, is a demanding one. As I have said before, the Chair has been described by a perspicacious press person as `the hottest and loneliest seat in Australia'. It unquestionably is hot, as you are aware, Mr Speaker. It is not always hot, but when hot it is exceedingly hot, and it is always lonely. The Chair is very much on his own. Mr Speaker, I suggest to you that the best way to ensure a satisfactory conclusion to your incumbency is to know that come what may you have done that in which you have believed. If you engage in any deviations or diversions to achieve a preconceived or predetermined outcome you may well suffer the ignominy of falling short of that which is expected of you and be tortured in the knowledge that you did so because you failed to be yourself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To my sponsors I say thankyou. To those on the other side for their most generous remarks-the Prime Minister and others-I say thankyou again. I do so with a touch of nostalgia because almost certainly this will be the last occasion on which I will be involved in an exercise of this nature, having announced my intention not to contest the next election. I feel that the warmth of this occasion has a place in the scheme of things even though no doubt, Mr Speaker, at the conclusion of this particular phase, your first exhortation to the House will be, `Let battle resume'. No doubt it will. The brief allusion by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), to my singular manner of expression did not escape me, but he will have to do better than that to match the utterance of Senator Sheil, who is on record as saying, `Clarrie Millar has never been known to use one word where 12 will do'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your ascension to the chair. It is somewhat ironic that you started as a telegraph messenger. In 1940 I started as a telegraph messenger at the Hobart General Post Office. It has worked for you; it has not worked for me. I can only conclude that I made my run too soon. I thank the House for the goodwill it has extended to me, and for the company that I have had the privilege of enjoying over 16 years. Whatever the future holds for us collectively and individually and for our nation as a whole, I wish you one and all well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I remind him that since the Budget strategy was announced the annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia has severely criticised the Government's economic strategy, Moody's Investors Service has downgraded our credit rating yet again-it is down from AA1 to AA2-and the pilots dispute has resulted in a significant loss of export earnings from tourism. In the light of these developments, will the Government now review its inappropriate Budget strategy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="481" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given the range of topics involved in the question from the Leader of the Opposition, I indicate that it will take some time to answer it. Let me go, first, to his observations about the Reserve Bank annual report. As is usual when it gets to matters economic, the Leader of the Opposition has got it wrong. Any press reports suggesting that the Reserve Bank's annual report criticises the Government's economic strategy are a complete beat-up, as is the question from the Leader of the Opposition. First, it has been claimed that the Bank differs from the Government on the timing of interest rate falls. This is what the Bank actually had to say, and I quote from the report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the general buoyancy of the economy has been such that rates may need to remain high for quite some time to achieve the desired effect.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, you will be aware, as will all members of the Parliament, that the Treasurer and I have been saying that monetary policy will remain tight until such time as there are clear signs that demand has peaked and the current account is trending down. Therefore there is manifestly no inconsistency between what the Reserve Bank, the Treasurer and I have been saying about interest rates. Second, it has been claimed that the Bank believes that the investment boom will not help our future export capacity. What did the Bank actually have to say about that? It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . much of the investment should contribute to future productive capacity . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I note that the fastest growing category of investment in 1988-89 was plant and equipment, much of which will be adding to our capacity to increase exports-a position that we have made possible, and a position which is endorsed by the Reserve Bank. Third, it has been claimed that the Government and the Bank differ on the importance of who owns our foreign debt. The truth is that winding back Australia's current account deficit and our foreign debt is a fundamental objective-it has been made clear right through that it is a fundamental objective-of the Government's whole economic strategy. This point was reiterated by me in my speech to the Australian Financial Review post-Budget dinner on 16 August. Fourth, it has been claimed that the Government's budgetary strategy is very vulnerable to external shock, such as falling commodity prices and declining world growth. Our whole concern is to wind back our current account deficit and our foreign debt and to broaden the base of Australian industry through micro-economic reform, and it is all designed to reduce our vulnerability to these external factors. When one looks at the facts, one sees that there is no basis for this suggestion that has been beaten up in the press and taken up by the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> The second item to which the Leader of the Opposition went in his question concerned Moody's. It was inevitable that the Leader of the Opposition, or someone on that side of the House, would grab at the Moody's straw. Let us deal with the Moody's straw. The first thing I want to say--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Moore" NAMEID="EI4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will look at messengers, and at the end of what I have to say, honourable members can take their pick about them. They will not be too happy about the array of messengers that are lined up against their mob. In the end, the market is the only test of whether a security is a good buy. We have deliberately opened Australia to the discipline of 24-hour scrutiny by the market. The market has taken the latest offering by Moody's in its stride. Reuters' comment on the screen this morning was that Moody's downgrade was a big yawn. What happened in respect of the trade weighted index? Before Moody's announcement it was 59.6; it went to 59.3; and when I last looked at it, it was up to 59.4. Of course, this same sort of observation was made by the shadow Treasurer on the night of the Budget when he was in debate with the Treasurer and when the Treasurer did him like a dinner. In the course of that debate it was pointed out by the interviewer that the market did not seem to have been upset by the Budget. The shadow Treasurer's great offering was, `Ah, but the market really has not had time to digest it yet. You wait until it has really had a chance to digest it and see what it does then'. Of course, the shadow Treasurer was wrong then. The market and every commentator in Australia and elsewhere received the Budget for what it was-a most responsible document. Without any question it is the best received Budget that has been handed down--</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Peacock interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition can yawn. The fact is that he and those opposite have got no comfort whatsoever from the Budget analysis that has been taking place since it was delivered, and the shadow Treasurer's prediction, as with most of his predictions, was lamentably off target.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at this question of Moody's. Perhaps the best thing I can go to first is the comment in the International Financing Review on 3 June 1989 when Moody's announced that it was going to have another look at Australia. This is what the International Financing Review had to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Last Friday, when Moody's announced that it was considering a downgrading of Australia's debt, it should have been aware that the reaction would be savage. Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke led the counter-attack by saying: `Real questions need to be asked about Moody's professionalism and competence in taking this action'.</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members opposite laugh, but they will laugh on the other side of their faces when I quote further from this article, which leads off by quoting me and the Treasurer. It quotes me as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Real questions need to be asked about Moody's professionalism . . .</PARA>
<PARA>A month earlier, Australia's Treasurer, Paul Keating, had been equally scathing on the subject. Among his remarks were:</PARA>
<PARA> `They (investors) don't want to give their debt back because of the fact that we are now running a surplus on the Commonwealth account and we are not producing, we are killing debt.'</PARA>
<PARA>Another Keating comment was:</PARA>
<PARA> `The junk bond market has made monkeys out of the rating agencies as well they might.</PARA>
<PARA>The International Financing Review, having quoted the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Even in 1974-75, there was not the slightest doubt that the United Kingdom would not be able to service its debt. The same is true of Australia in 1989, which is why we agree totally with the criticisms raised by Mr Hawke and Mr Keating.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have the International Financing Review looking at this political, incompetent exercise by Moody's. The International Financing Review quotes me and the Treasurer and then states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . which is why we agree totally with the criticisms raised by Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. If the ultimate credit risk in Australian government or government-guaranteed debt is zero-and we believe this to be true-the country's credit rating should be AAA.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me turn to what Salomon Brothers have had to say today about the Moody's exercise. Their article is entitled `Moody's downgrading unjustified'. Salomon Brothers state:</PARA>
<PARA> `It is not justified and there are two reasons why' Salomon's Sydney office Managing Director Trevor Rowe said. In the 1989-90 Federal Budget we have a large surplus and secondly, the retirement of public debt.</PARA>
<PARA>Rowe said:</PARA>
<PARA> Government debt is declining and the economy is in a stronger position than it was in 1986 when Moody's last downgraded Australia . . . This downgrading was not justified.</PARA>
<PARA>So there we have the comments of the International Financing Review and Salomon Brothers. Let us look at the local observation in today's Macquarie News:</PARA>
<PARA> National Australia Bank spokesman says he doesn't think the change will have any great effect.</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>

When honourable members opposite are landed with the truth, they should not abuse the messenger. They were talking earlier about abusing the messenger. The Westpac Banking Corporation had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Westpac's Bob Graham agrees and says he's disappointed by Moody's decision.</PARA>
<PARA>Just as honourable members opposite are on a furphy with the report of the Reserve Bank of Australia, so they are on a furphy with Moody's, and their most remarkable furphy is the pilots. Is that not a beauty? All I can say is that Lewis Carroll would sit back in awe as honourable members opposite entered into their Alice in Wonderland exercise about the pilots. What are we faced with in respect of the Opposition's attitude towards the pilots? It really is a bottler. What is the Opposition's policy in regard to industrial relations? Honourable members opposite criticise the situation. Let me give its historical context. Under this Government's industrial relations policy there has been virtually a 60 per cent reduction in the level of industrial disputes in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay; let me give honourable members opposite the statistics. Average monthly working days lost per 1,000 employees-the standard textbook measure of the level of industrial disputation-were 241.7 during the working period April 1983 to April 1989, which is 58.5 per cent less than the average during January 1976 to March 1983.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Such brilliant enterprise from the buffoon boy from Adelaide. He says that this occurred when I was President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Let me deal with that matter as honourable members opposite have thrown that in. When I was President of the ACTU I wore the parliamentary corridors thin talking to and pleading with the conservative Government to adopt an industrial relations approach which I said was more appropriate than its confrontationism. I said, `The ACTU does not want to be in conflict. Let us sit down and talk and have a situation where the same rules apply to both sides'. I was rejected. Fortunately, as events turned out, I had the opportunity of putting to the Australian people in 1983 the proposition that there was a better way in industrial relations. I tried to get this in the period when honourable members opposite were in office. They would not listen. So I went to the people on 5 March 1983 and I said, `There is a better way'. The statistics show that there is a better way: a 60 per cent reduction in industrial disputation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the Opposition's position? Confronted with the fact that under our policies there has been a 60 per cent reduction in industrial disputes, Opposition members put it to the Australian people that we should return to the chaos of 1981-82 when the centralised wage fixing system was abandoned and when what the nation had is what they are proposing now: let people go off and negotiate and get what they will in the market. They are now saying, `If the unions and the employers want to opt out of the system, our Liberal-National Party policy is that they opt out'. The Opposition's policy is for people to opt out and to go and negotiate. When the pilots do that, what is the Opposition's Alice in Wonderland  answer? It is, `We will bring in legislation to impose more penalties inside the system'. The pilots have flown the coop. According to Opposition policy, what is the Opposition's answer? It is to impose more penalties inside the system from which they have fled. As I have said, Lewis Carroll would sit back in awe if he saw this Alice in Wonderland nonsense with which honourable members opposite go on.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite clear why the Opposition does not like it, but it is going to continue to get it. We will now go to the pilots. As to the pilots dispute, I am saying what the position of the Government is and why the position of the Government is exactly what it is and will continue to be. The pilots have not moved from a position of intolerably bad conditions. This is what their previous President, Captain Fitzsimons, has had to say about their existing agreement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Firstly, . . . It is an excellent document that contains and maintains some of the best working conditions in the world of aviation.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, he then says to them:</PARA>
<PARA>You are the only bid system pilots in the world who have a block guarantee of pay.</PARA>
<PARA>He further says:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no other pilot group in the world that enjoys your overall standard of pay protection'.</PARA>
<PARA>His fourth point says that the total wage packet has been such that it is no longer accurate simply to compare gross salaries over a period.</PARA>
<PARA> From that position, described by one of their own leaders as the best in the world of aviation, what was the considered contribution of the pilots of Australia to the welfare of this country? They decided that they would make a claim for a 30 per cent increase. A 30 per cent increase on what? The average position of the pilots in question was an average salary of $80,000 a year for an average period of eight hours a week at the stick. They wanted a 30 per cent increase on that $80,000. Even members of the Opposition will not find it beyond their limited capacities to work out that a 30 per cent increase on $80,000 represents a claim for an increase equal to the average wage of Australian working men and women.</PARA>
<PARA> That is the position with which this Government was confronted. The pilots were not prepared to do what all the working men and women of Australia had done, and that is exercise restraint. That restraint had brought about a rate of employment growth in this country five times as fast as when the Opposition was in office and more than twice as fast as the rest of the world. That is what the workers of Australia had done. But that was not good enough for these people on $80,000 a year for eight hours a week at the stick. They wanted a 30 per cent increase, equal to the average wage of their fellow working men and women, and they said they were not going to operate within the system.</PARA>
<PARA> What did the Government do, and what are we continuing to to say? We are saying a very simple thing. We pleaded with them, saying, `Stay within the system and within that system your claims for an increase in salary can be properly processed, as have those of other Australian working men and women'. They said, `We will not work within the system'. We supported Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia and said, `If your employees will not accept the rights and obligations of the system and are going outside it, then in those circumstances we will support your use of whatever measures are necessary under the law to bring this to an end'.</PARA>
<PARA> Now that is the fact. This Government has not spent 6 1/2 years first of all to get this country out of the worst recession in 50 years, which was the Opposition's legacy, and then to create jobs five times faster than the Opposition did, to have the wages system and this economy blown apart by a group of people acting according to the Opposition's industrial relations policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the honourable member, I advise the House that a number of steps have been taken to try to ensure that we have a basic level of domestic air services in this country while the pilots continue to refuse to undertake their normal duties, indeed persist with the situation of a highly irresponsible claim and resignation from their employment. The measures taken, which will be generally known to members of the House and I mention them just briefly, are, firstly, that we have authorised all international airlines serving Australia to carry domestic passengers, freight and mail on domestic sectors of their existing international services. We have authorised foreign airlines to carry international interline traffic over Australia's domestic routes-that is, foreign travellers who are passengers of other airlines. That is a right previously enjoyed only by Qantas Airways Ltd. We have authorised foreign airlines to extend their international services to Australian cities they do not currently serve but are entitled to serve under the bilateral aviation agreements and to offer additional services over domestic routes that they are currently serving. We have authorised the Royal Australian Air Force to operate services for domestic passengers with planes crewed by RAAF personnel. We have also authorised the charter of an Ansett airfreight plane, a DC8 from the United States, on a fully crewed basis.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It just puts the Opposition in line with the pilots. The results of the measures taken by the Government have been significant. They cannot, of course, provide the same level of service as we would have if we had normal domestic services in this country, but we have been able to maintain a reasonably basic level of service. There are 17 foreign carriers operating over domestic routes in Australia and 16 of them agreed to carry Australian domestic passengers. One of those who originally agreed, United Airlines, has now seen fit to withdraw that agreement as a result of the unwillingness of its pilots to be involved in carrying domestic passengers. In the first five days of the new arrangements the foreign internationals have carried 9,100 domestic and interline passengers. Qantas has carried 8,200 passengers of a type it would not normally carry. These are mostly interline passengers who would normally have travelled with the domestic airlines. There have been some few hundred more domestic passengers despite the fact that Qantas pilots said that they did not want to carry them, only those they regarded as having compassionate grounds. The RAAF has operated nine aircraft. It has one 707, four Hercules and four Hawker Siddeley 748s. It is serving areas not well served by the internationals-that is, Perth, Adelaide, Darwin, Alice Springs and Tasmania, in the main, and also north Queensland. It has carried over 7,000 passengers in the last four days. Altogether, the special arrangements have enabled 24,300 passengers to be carried around Australia in the last five days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to further developments and the prospects for further increases in capacity, I advise the honourable member and the House that we can expect another RAAF 707 to come into service later this week following its release from the Kangaroo 89 exercise. Negotiations are continuing between the domestic and international carriers to use international planes for domestic services during their down time in Australia. Quite a few international flights spend a lot of time in Australia before returning overseas. The use of those planes for domestic services during that down time in Australia would seem likely to be very productive of additional services in the near future. We also expect that that would be particularly important for services to Perth. Despite the loss of United we believe that capacity should be considerably increased over the present approximate 15 per cent of normal capacity.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I advise the House that airlines have received a substantial number of applications following recent advertising at the end of last week both within Australia and overseas for pilots to apply for positions following the resignation of all of the airlines' pilots. Ansett has received around 200 applications, as has Australian Airlines. East-West has received about half of that number-that is, about 100. There are real prospects that domestic airlines could be operating their own aircraft in the near future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the discussions that we had with the two domestic airlines last week a question was raised by both about difficulties that were created for them by what they understood to be the action of Qantas, which had not abided by two agreements. Those two agreements were to the effect that should Qantas be approached to be involved in any discussions which concerned salary upgrading due to new configurations of aircraft it would not come to any agreement without prior discussion with the two domestic airlines. The two domestic airlines were naturally enough concerned that they should be faced with a situation where Qantas would have done that. In light of suggestions that this had happened inquiries were made of Qantas by the relevant Ministers to ascertain whether this was the case. It was put to Qantas that we would not tolerate that situation if that had happened, if it broke agreements with the airlines as to what should be done in terms of pilot remuneration in those circumstances. It was made quite clear that that would not be accepted. As I understand it, Qantas, in the light of that approach that was made to it and the position of the Government being made quite clear to it, gave an undertaking that no such agreement had been finalised and that--</PARA></TALK.START>

All I am saying is that we will not accept it in regard to domestic pilots. I have no reason to believe on the evidence available to us that, with regard to Qantas, as a result of the intervention by the Ministers in the terms I have put there will not now be an acceptance of our system-that is, the centralised system with guidelines that are laid down in the interests not only of the parties immediately involved but of the country as a whole.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will deal with that. The reality is that as a result of the pilots' industrial action the tourism industry in Australia is involved in a massive exercise of damage control. In any one day in Australia there are some 6,000 overseas visitors. One can imagine the sorts of things that they will say about Australia as a tourist destination when they get back home, as they are faced with the problems of not getting onto aeroplanes and not being able to get to their destinations. The Australian Tourist Commission, as part of that damage control exercise, has cooperated fully with major overseas operators, particularly in Germany and Japan. Under their consumer protection laws those operators, having sold packages for their tourists, can be confronted with significant legal actions in their own countries if there is a failure to deliver on the contracts that they have undertaken. That is a problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There can be no doubt, in my mind, that many sections of the tourist industry are in a difficult position. Many major hotels are starting to lay people off. The operator of a major resort told me today that he was thinking of closing and many segments of the industry are looking at the issuing of legal proceedings against not merely the Australian Federation of Air Pilots but individual pilots.

The Opposition's policy which has been advocated involves, first of all, conducting a secret ballot before anyone can go on strike. The pilots had their secret ballot and decided to go on strike. Secondly, its policy, which it has announced widely-it has made no secret of it-is that employers and workers should go outside the Industrial Relations Commission; they should abandon it and get into collective agreements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Bendigo for his question and the close interest he takes in the sheep industry. Recently I informed the House of the Saudi Arabian rejection of some, but not all, recent shipments of live sheep from Australia, allegedly on the basis of disease. I should mention now that the Australian Government and Australian industry have yet to see any scientific evidence for these allegations. Honourable members will perhaps be aware that all five shipments diverted from Saudi Arabian ports have now been unloaded. The Kuwaiti authorities, for example, have declared the sheep to be free of bluetongue, sheep pox and brucella melitensis-after taking proper diagnostic tests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, some people with axes to grind in Australia have attempted to attribute the shipment rejections to the general health status of Australian sheep and the quality of Australian veterinary surgeons and the professional judgment of people they once worked with. That is not only mischievous, it is wrong and ignores many efforts which have been made to enhance the welfare of live sheep for export. Sheep are checked by veterinarians before leaving Australia and are accompanied by trained stockmen who oversee the animals' welfare during the voyage. Although veterinarians do not accompany every shipment, they do so periodically. Indeed, a Western Australian department veterinarian was on board one of the vessels rejected by the Saudi authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a steady and marked reduction in animal mortality levels from the unacceptable levels of the 1970s, and an improvement in the animals' general turn-out condition. This has been achieved through, for example, new codes of practice for export feed lots; revised standards for export feed pellets; and detailed specifications for sheep carriers, particularly in regard to pen sizes, ventilation, watering and feeding systems. Export control powers are used to ensure that professional animal welfare standards are maintained. This is not to say that there is any reason for complacency. We should continue to see the monitoring of animal welfare as a matter of priority. To this end I recently established the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare. The Government is continuing high level efforts to resolve the trade dispute with Saudi Arabia. I will advise the House of further developments as they come to hand.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 August the State Minister for Community Services in Victoria, Peter Spyker, put out a press statement entitled `Federal MP gets it wrong' in which, amongst other things, in relation to the issue of overseas adoptions, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Claims that bureaucratic delays by State and Federal Government Departments is causing long waits for couples gives the wrong impression to prospective adopters . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He said that my comments were wrong and continued:</PARA>
<PARA>If he is concerned about this issue he should first of all get his facts straight, or take up the matter with his Federal colleagues who really hold the only key to this difficult area . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I regret the comments of Mr Spyker but his comments are entirely mistaken. The fact is that on this issue the Australian Adoption Council sent me a letter which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Adoption Council wishes to strongly support comments you have made about intercountry adoption. </PARA>

<PARA>This Council supports your contention that the rules and regulations applicable in most States are too rigid . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, as chairman of the immigration committee I have an obligation to raise this matter and to try to ensure, as I said in the initial statement, that in fact we do everything we can to make it easier for Australian couples to adopt children. It is unfortunate that Mr Spyker did not contact me before issuing the press statement. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, on my first opportunity to address you as such let me congratulate you on your elevation to the chair. You will recall that just over nine months ago, on 22 November 1988, I tabled in this House the Government's policy discussion paper on AIDS-`A Time to Care, A Time to Act: Towards a Strategy for all Australians'. That paper presented the wide range of issues and options relevant to the HIV epidemic in Australia as a basis for consultation, discussion and formulation of a national strategy on AIDS for the foresee- able future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At that time, I promised the members of this Parliament and the people of Australia that I would return in the 1988-90 Budget context with a clear, broad strategy to guide Australia in the management of AIDS during the next stages of the epidemic, and that the Australian community would have the opportunity to participate in the consultative process. That process is now complete. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy information paper I present to the House sets out the policies and programs which the Federal Government believes are appropriate to deal with the HIV epidemic into the 1990s, as well as the parameters for funding, administering, coordinating and monitoring this nation's AIDS programs and activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The national strategy encompasses complex medical, scientific, economic, legal and moral issues within a framework in which the protection of public health is always paramount. It has absorbed and reflects a wide range of views obtained from the comprehensive consultation process which involved State governments and authorities, the research community, those who care for people with HIV, the private sector, unions, people with HIV, the Australian National Council on AIDS, the Inter-Governmental Committee on AIDS, the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, the Parliamentary Liaison Group on AIDS, concerned individuals and representatives of many community groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The cornerstone of this process was the six working panels which I established early this year to provide a forum for public consultation. Those six panels-which included honourable members and senators from both sides of this Parliament-held 38 meetings and met with 1,800 people, from Perth to Cairns, Hobart to Darwin, and Alice Springs to Palm Island, and visited prisons in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. The reports of the panels were published in May this year and, along with the written submissions received, provided a broad-based and bipartisan input to development of the national strategy. The policy information paper, or White Paper, is not just a document for governments, people with AIDS or those who care for people with AIDS. The policies and programs it contains are designed to reach and influence all members of the community because AIDS has the potential to touch the lives of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> When I addressed the House on this issue last November, I informed honourable members that 1,100 cases of AIDS had been reported in Australia, that 538 of those people had died, and that the number of cases continued to mount inexorably. On every day since then, at least one new cases of AIDS has been reported in this country. On almost every day since then, another life has been lost to the disease. As at 9 August 1989 there have been 1,414 cases of AIDS reported in Australia, and 733 of those people have died, nine out of 10 of those Australians who have contracted the disease are or were under 50 years old. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that homosexual or bisexual transmission continues to account for the overwhelming number of AIDS cases in this country, some 88 per cent. However, incidence of the disease among intravenous drug users-including homosexual and bisexual IVDUs-has risen to 3.8 per cent and heterosexual transmission has increased to 1.6 per cent of reported cases. While prevalence of AIDS remains relatively low among these latter groups, the experiences of overseas countries, particularly the United States of America, demonstrates starkly the incipient threat which AIDS continues to pose to the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States HIV infection is as high as 30 per cent among intravenous drug users and is steadily increasing in the heterosexual community. In New York City, for example, AIDS is the biggest killer of women under 30 years, and, tragically, one in 60 babies there is born with the virus. Surveys carried out in Sydney show increasing rates of infection among intravenous drug users from less that one per cent to more than 10 per cent over the past two years. With the estimated number of drug users in Australia ranging from 90,000 to 130,000, the potential for spread through the drug conduit among the heterosexual community is therefore inescapably significant. Denial of that threat now would be unwise and ultimately, of course, tragic. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there are some people in positions of influence within our community, including one or two honourable members in this House, who are encouraging others to deny the potential for transmission of the virus among the heterosexual population. Rather than viewing the currently low prevalence of heterosexual infection as an opportunity to modify behaviour pre-emptively, and thus turn good fortune to good management, they choose to use data showing what was happening yesterday as an excuse to deny that a real problem exists today. It is these same people who seek to undermine Australia's consensual approach to AIDS with allegations that our policies to deal with this epidemic have been hijacked by the homosexual lobby. </PARA>
<PARA> It was just such divisive and damaging tactics which Jonathan Mann, Director of the World Health Organisation's Global Program on AIDS, spoke about at the fifth international conference on AIDS in Montreal in June. Dr Mann warned of a third epidemic of social, cultural, economic and political reaction and response to AIDS `in which the twisted bring forward their twisted ideas of massive cover-ups and AIDS conspiracies (and this) threatens increasingly to overshadow and overwhelm the epidemics of HIV and AIDS themselves'. Dr Mann said that this third epidemic could be as important to our future as the virus itself if complacency, fatalism and marginalisation were allowed to reduce the commitment to or change the course of efforts to protect public health. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who peddle these myths about gay conspiracies, who prefer the potentially fatal consequences of denial to the guarded optimism of realism, either fail or refuse to understand that the cooperation of the victims of AIDS-in this country to date, predominantly homosexuals-is essential to our ability to stem the epidemic. We have never disguised the rationale of our efforts to give people with AIDS confidence in the health services of this country through our emphasis on privacy, on confidentiality, on anti-discrimination, on adequate counselling, on opposition to compulsory testing, on endeavours to reduce the stigmatisation associated with AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA> None of these steps has been taken primarily on the grounds of civil liberties or human rights, but on the grounds of public health. The Government has always believed that the protection of public health, rather than the preservation of individual rights, must be the overriding concern in developing and implementing AIDS policies and that public health and individual rights march hand in hand on the AIDS issue because the health and well-being of the many is dependent upon the cooperation of the few. </PARA>
<PARA> In the words of Admiral J. D. Watkins, in his landmark report on AIDS in the United States, effective anti-discrimination protection is, paradoxically, the sine qua non of an effective HIV containment policy. That paradox is possibly the most important thing we have learned about management of the AIDS epidemic since I first addressed this House on AIDS more than four years ago. We have also learned that history holds no simple truths for combating AIDS, and that there are no easy answers to this awesome health crisis. AIDS is a new disease presenting an unique set of public health problems. </PARA>
<PARA> But there have been a few shafts of light. We have learned that the overwhelming number of Australians have the strength to resist the temptation to succumb to draconian measures offered as facile and ineffectual `quick-fixes' to the disease, and that we possess the individual and collective commonsense and will to take the superficially less attractive, but potentially much more effective, decisions demanded by AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has become internationally acclaimed for its approach to the dilemmas posed by the disease, leading most countries in the world in terms of the development of logical, cohesive and effective containment policies. Our efforts have won praise because, from the beginning of the epidemic, we have taken a cooperative approach involving the development of an unprecedented partnership and level of trust between all levels of government, all political parties and the affected community groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The production of this policy information paper is another first for Australia among the developed nations of the world. The twin goals of Australia's unique national HIV/AIDS strategy are to eliminate transmission of the virus and to minimise the personal and social impact of HIV. The strategy is ambitious and purposely so. The Government believes it would be derelict in its responsibility for the public health of Australians if it were to be anything less. </PARA>
<PARA> The goal is supported by 10 principles developed to guide the formulation of policy and appropriate program responses. They are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Transmission of HIV is preventable through changes in individual behaviour; education and prevention programs are necessary to bring about such changes. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Each person must accept responsibility for preventing themselves becoming infected through sexual intercourse or the sharing of needles and for preventing further transmission of the virus. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The community as a whole has the right to appropriate protection against infection. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The law should complement and assist education and other public health measures. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Public health objectives will be most effectively realised if the cooperation of people with HIV infection and those most at risk is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Specific informed consent should be obtained before any test is performed to diagnose a person's HIV infection status. The result should remain confidential, and appropriate pre- and post-test counselling should be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. People infected with HIV retain the right to participate in the community without discrimination, and have the same right to comprehensive and appropriate health care, income support and community services as other members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Professional care givers have a duty to care for infected individuals; government, employers and unions have a responsibility to provide working conditions and training programs which minimise the risk of occupational transmission. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. Research into the epidemic is essential to the management of the epidemic.</PARA>
<PARA> 10. General principles of public health, service provision and the legal system should be applied to the HIV epidemic; special measures or services require justification. </PARA>
<PARA> The national strategy has six key elements: education, prevention, treatment care and counselling, access and participation, research, and international cooperation. It is based on our best scientific knowledge at this time. Obviously, if a cure or vaccine were to become available, if radically new treatments became available, or if the nature or progression of the virus were to alter significantly, the Government would need to reconsider the appropriateness of the national strategy. The education and prevention strategies outlined in the paper are premised on the basis that transmission of the AIDS virus is preventable and that education remains the most effective means of prevention. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to place on record, specifically for the benefit of people who continue to argue that our AIDS education efforts to date have been improperly targeted to the whole community rather than to people most at risk, that the Government spends approximately $7.50 per head on AIDS education within high risk groups, compared with approximately 27c per head on AIDS education on the whole community. It will be heartening too for all honourable members to note that major studies indicate a decline in the rate of infection in homosexual men, and significant behavioural change among homosexual and bisexual men. While none of this is reason for complacency, nor any indication that the epidemic has peaked or stabilised, it does indicate that the emphasis we have placed on, and hopes we place in, preventive education are not misplaced. The education strategy outlined in our policy information paper has three broad target groups:</PARA>
<PARA> people whose activities place them at greater risk of infection than the general community and those infected;</PARA>
<PARA> carers of people with HIV, including professional care givers; and</PARA>
<PARA> the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> A new national media campaign will have two specific purposes. First, it will address the specific educational needs of groups which might not be reached through community based programs, including bisexual men, non-dependent drug users and people of non-English speaking background. Second, the campaign will be used to raise the level of awareness in the general community about modes of transmission and to allay fears and prejudice about the virus. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be consulted in developing a public education campaign directed against AIDS-related prejudice and discrimination. The new Commonwealth AIDS prevention and education, or CAPE, program will replace the former existing community education grants to provide funds to community based organisations which develop nationally relevant prevention and education programs for priority groups identified in the national strategy. Funds will be earmarked for grants to organisations developing programs for Aboriginal and Islander communities, people of non-English speaking background, and services for tertiary students. The States will receive substantially increased education and prevention funds to meet State priorities. Some of this matched funding will be tied. For example, the Government is asking the States to ensure that education programs are introduced for prisoners and prison staff, people in residential institutions and their families and carers, homeless young people and children in detention centres, police, and other State employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Education must start with the young. It is essential that the young people of Australia are aware of the facts about HIV and the risks of transmission and that they are sensitive to the issues which cause prejudice and fear. Accordingly, included in the funding for the States is an amount to be directed to the Curriculum Corporation of Australia, a company owned jointly by the State and Commonwealth Ministers of education. The Curriculum Corporation will assess and, where necessary, develop HIV-related curricula and provide teaching material for schools. By providing funds for this purpose, the Commonwealth is demonstrating its commitment to providing appropriate public health education to young Australians. A key issue which was identified by many groups in the consultative process was the need to provide educational opportunities for people in the work force, especially professional care givers. </PARA>
<PARA> A Commonwealth AIDS work force, information, standards and exchange, or CAWISE, program has been designed to ensure that the work force has access to information and resource materials, retraining and skills development programs and development of guidelines and standards. Grants will be provided to unions, professional and employee associations and employers. Funds have been earmarked for the development of guidelines on nutrition and HIV infection, a national code of practice for counsellors, and for a care model for Aboriginal and Islander people. Another new initiative, HIV study grants, to be cost shared with the States, will be available to professional care givers to undertake short term training and development in another State's hospital system. This will particularly give professional care givers in States with low AIDS caseloads an opportunity to learn on the ground from the experience of their colleagues in States and hospitals with high caseloads. </PARA>
<PARA> While education is a key preventive strategy which is critical to elimination of the virus, other prevention strategies require the agreement and cooperation of governments or relate to personal choices. Significant among these issues is testing for the virus. The Government will continue to encourage testing, with the specific informed consent of the individual and with pre- and post-test counselling. Knowledge of one's HIV status provides an opportunity to encourage change in lifestyle and behaviour and to provide the earliest possible treatment and care. Testing and counselling is already widely available, but could be made more so, and State governments will be asked to improve community access to testing with counselling by expanding the availability through family planning clinics and other community health centres. People whose activities place them at greater risk of infection will be strongly encouraged to fulfil their duty to be tested. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some situations where the public interest demands that people be prohibited from participation in certain activities unless they accept testing and are found to be negative. Such mandatory testing will continue to apply for donors of blood, tissue, organs and semen. The Government considers compulsory testing to be applicable in only four situations, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> testing of prisoners on exit from prison;</PARA>
<PARA> testing of persons charged with a sexual offence where requested by the alleged victim;</PARA>
<PARA> testing of a person where necessary to determine medical treatment of another person, for example, in providing treatment in the event of a needlestick injury; and</PARA>
<PARA> testing of a person suspected of being HIV-positive who is placing others at risk of infection. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last three situations, testing should be implemented as a last resort and should be ordered only by a judge in a closed court. This also applies in confining an individual who is wilfully or knowingly placing others at risk of infection and who is likely to continue to behave in such a way despite appropriate counselling. Hearings in such cases should be conducted in a closed court with restriction orders given for a fixed period and subject to rights of review and appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> Guidelines on the testing of patients for surgical procedures, based on the interim guidelines established by the Australian Health Ministers Conference earlier this year and endorsed by the Australian Medical Association, are set out in the national strategy. In essence, these guidelines state that testing should be encouraged where clinically relevant to the patient or where the patient is believed to be at high risk, and that such testing should be performed only with the patient's consent and with follow-up counselling if the result is positive. I and the medical profession are confident that when patients are advised of the relevance of the test in appropriate clinical situations, the response of patients will be overwhelmingly positive. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the testing policies I have just outlined are primarily the responsibility of the States and require changes to legislation or, in some instances, new legislative measures. All these issues are to be examined by a subcommittee of the Inter-Governmental Committee on AIDS, comprising officers from the departments of Health and the Attorney-General, with a view to bringing consensus and uniformity to legislative initiatives arising from the national strategy. Rarely has there been so great a need for uniform policies through the nation. The virus does not recognise State boundaries. We should not allow such boundaries to interfere with an effective national response. </PARA>
<PARA> Other issues to be covered by the legal review include:</PARA>
<PARA> legal sanctions which impede the operation of needle and syringe distribution and disposal programs;</PARA>
<PARA> legal sanctions which might impede the changing of personal use patterns of drugs which are not administered by intravenous methods; and</PARA>
<PARA> laws which impede public health programs promoting safer sex, especially amongst homosexuals and prostitutes. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the testing of immigrants to Australia, the national strategy makes a distinction between applicants for permanent residence and applicants for temporary residence and tourist or other short term visas. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the testing of immigrants to Australia, the national strategy makes a distinction between applicants for permanent residence and applicants for temporary residence and tourist or other short term visas. People who wish to migrate to Australia are currently tested for the virus if there are medical or other indications of infection. The Government has decided that mandatory HIV testing will be introduced for all applicants for permanent residence. This is unlikely to have a significant impact on the spread of HIV infection, but HIV infection status, as with other medical conditions, is a factor to be considered when assessing applications on the grounds that there are considerable potential costs to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> But a positive result will not automatically exclude applicants from permanent residency; scope will be retained to approve applications where justified by compassionate or other circumstances. I have already stressed the importance of avoiding discrimination against people with AIDS, but it remains a fact that many people with HIV, their relatives, friends and carers have faced discrimination. Some have been dismissed from employment, some evicted from accommodation, others refused medical or dental treatment or perhaps harassed by the media. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is asking the States to establish, extend or clarify anti-discrimination legislation, to provide redress for people with HIV, their families and carers in basic areas such as employment, education and training, accommodation and supply of goods and services and to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or imputed sexual orientation. This issue will also be included in the legal review and will seek to ensure that people with HIV are treated fairly and equitably, and on the same basis as people with other life-threatening conditions. As a first step, the Commonwealth Government will bring forward amendments to section 33 of the Public Service Act and regulations under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Research is vital to our understanding and knowledge of the AIDS virus and in the search for a vaccine or therapy. Grants for AIDS research have been managed through the Commonwealth AIDS Research Grant Committee, a subcommittee of the Government's AIDS advisory body, the Australian National Council on AIDS, known as ANCA. The two special research units on AIDS virology and AIDS epidemiology and clinical research will be continued under the auspices of ANCA, and the Government has decided to establish a third ANCA special research centre on HIV social research. The new centre will be responsible for coordinating research into the social and psychological effects of the epidemic, identifying further educational and training needs and examining the impact of projects and policy initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of our regional responsibility, Australia will publish results of AIDS research for dissemination within Australia and Western Pacific, South East Asian and Indian Ocean nations. A new national clinical/laboratory surveillance scheme will be promoted through the ANCA special research centre for AIDS epidemiology and clinical research to improve the data base on HIV infection in Australia. Some good has already come out of this terrible epidemic in that it has inspired an extraordinary level of international cooperation. Despite the many issues which divide humanity, we have all united in our defence against AIDS. Developed nations are assisting less developed nations to combat the disease, some in the form of financial assistance and others by providing medical and scientific expertise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government will provide $1m to the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau to provide help to our regional neighbours for activities such as securing the blood supply and study grants. In addition, Australia, in association with the World Health Organisation, will host a conference on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific in Canberra next August. </PARA>
<PARA> I have briefly outlined some of the major issues in the national HIV/AIDS strategy. There is an issue which remains to be resolved. The Government is further addressing the issue of special assistance to haemophiliacs affected by the HIV virus and a decision will be made and announced by mid October. The Government has allocated $318.5m over the next four years to implement the strategy. In this, the first year, funds of $60.9m have been made available, an increase of 43.6 per cent on the previous financial year. Details of these funds are included in the national strategy document. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I would like to thank everyone who has been involved in the preparation of the national strategy, including members of both Houses and all parties of this Parliament who have ensured that both the spirit and the practice of bipartisanship have been preserved. They have helped to formulate policies which put the public health of Australians above all other considerations, but which recognise the aspirations of all citizens of this country to a dignified and secure way of life, to a society which is free of prejudice and to a society which is caring, just and humane. Effectiveness of the national strategy will, of course, depend on cooperation between a wide range of sectors of Australian society, across the three levels of government, between government and non-government sectors, between unions and employers and between all these parties and people infected with the virus. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be somewhat ingenuous to believe that everyone will agree with all that is in this national strategy. As I said in my speech to the House in November, there will continue to be diversity of opinion between different States, different communities, different organisations and different individuals, and that diversity will be reflected in the range of programs established to respond to the virus. The Government believes that such diversity will continue to assist our national offensive against AIDS providing it is underpinned by a solidarity of purpose. Solidarity gives us the confidence to face up to the challenge of AIDS and deal openly and honestly with the difficult and controversial issues it presents. I commend the national HIV/AIDS strategy to the Parliament and to the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr Deputy Speaker, let me preface my remarks by congratulating you on your election and elevation to high office, and go on to say very clearly and without qualification that the Liberal and National parties welcome the release of this White Paper. While all of those associated with its production would have wished that it could have appeared earlier, nevertheless let me say that on its release now I am prepared to make the comment that it is a landmark policy document in the field of public health in Australia, and indeed the world, and all of those associated with its production, from the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) down, need to be, and should be, congratulated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the development of the production of this policy paper the Liberal and National parties have played a constructive and cooperative part. I was pleased personally to join with the Minister at a joint press conference when he released the Green Paper, which was the discussion paper which ultimately was to give rise to this policy White Paper. Individuals of the Liberal and National parties participated in a representative capacity at the meetings of the parliamentary liaison group and we will continue to do so for as long as we are in Opposition. We contributed to the working parties which toured around Australia gathering advice, evidence and input, which has gone into the drafting of this particular document and, indeed, by way of making almost a formal submission during that process we ourselves published the Liberal and National parties acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) policy in June of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to be able to say that this Parliament and indeed the nation is in the happy position whereby the Liberal and National parties' AIDS policy published in June lines up very squarely with the White Paper and the reverse is also the case-the White Paper lines up very squarely with the published policy position of our joint parties in Opposition. The overriding goal of this policy is to eliminate the transmission of HIV infection to ensure that no more Australians than is the case now will be affected by AIDS. That is the overriding goal of our own policy. We endorse each and every one of the 10 guiding principles that guide this policy and the Minister covered them in his speech. We stand four square with the Government in recognising that AIDS is a major threat to public health in this country at the current time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has documented the statistics that up until 9 August this year 733 people, or more than 50 per cent of Australia's 1,414 reported AIDS cases, have died. But these two statistics mark what is even more alarming out there in our community. Reliable estimates are that there are between 15,000 and 25,000 people infected with the HIV virus and our knowledge of the virus is such that we can now confidently conclude almost 100 per cent of those will go on to develop AIDS. Even if those statistics are a little overblown and we conclude that, say, there is half that number, 7,500 people, who are HIV infected in our community, we have a serious and major health problem on our hands. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that backdrop it is important to appreciate that the proper implementation of the White Paper's recommendations, its suggested strategies for halting the march of AIDS through the community, depends upon the Government having the courage to go beyond an agenda determined by the dictates of electoral cycles. We are likely to have a Federal election within the next 12 months, but HIV infection and AIDS is a crucial issue that the community cannot afford to have caught up in electoral planning. It needs a far more farsighted, long term response. </PARA>
<PARA> From the Government's point of view it is pleasing to see that the Minister has indicated that the policies and programs which are to be set in place are aimed at dealing with the HIV epidemic into the 1990s. From our point of view I want to repeat a comment that I made at a press conference this afternoon: with a change of government, which we expect in the next 12 months, these policies and this program will not be disturbed. We embrace the national strategy as if it were our own. While we do not commit ourselves at this stage to every detail contained in the document, it will be our guiding policy document when in government. While at this stage we do not commit ourselves to the legislation that the Government has yet to bring forward, the document will be our guiding policy document when in government. </PARA>
<PARA> Local and international experience identifies the principal weapons in the fight against HIV and AIDS as education and research. Local and international indications are that education programs targeted towards homosexual men have produced significant behaviour modifications, and they support the argument for preventive education as a major component of any national AIDS strategy. In Australia, as the Minister correctly pointed out in his speech, the homosexual community was responsible for the so-called first wave of HIV and AIDS, but it is no longer a disease which affects that community alone. National and international AIDS experts are unanimous that the threat of widespread transmission of AIDS into the general community is coming, and will continue to come, from intravenous (IV) drug users who, together with bisexuals, can act, and are acting already, as a bridge for the second wave of infection into the wider community. Therefore, it is imperative that every member of the community take active steps to avoid high risk behaviour and adopt safe sex practices as a means of protecting not only themselves but also other members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> In common with the approach adopted by the Liberal and National parties in our policy document, the Minister has stated that the transmission of HIV is preventable through the modification of individual behaviour. This is the positive message to come out of this public health tragedy. Now that the Government and agencies have been successful in securing the public blood supply in this country, the good news in the AIDS story is that no-one currently uninfected need ever get it. If they understand how it is contracted, it can be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> Central to bringing about these changes are effective education and prevention programs which are specifically tailored to successfully reach particular target groups and the community as a whole. As the Minister has reported, a great deal of work has already been done to deliver successful education programs to and within the homosexual community. The spread of HIV infection through bisexuals must also be actively addressed. Generally, men in stable heterosexual relationships who also engage in male homosexual intercourse from time to time do not identify with any homosexual or gay community. We need, in the context of this strategy, to ensure that the education message is reaching that sub-group of our community, because, whatever we may think about it from a moral point of view, we will not eliminate that sort of bisexual behaviour and from an AIDS perspective the education message must be carried to that group as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Sharing of needles and syringes between drug addicts has also been shown to be a major means of HIV transmission. Education must state that total abstinence from drug use is the first and best option. In confronting the whole drug problem and how it interrelates and interacts with the AIDS problem, we do not abandon the fight against drugs and drug addiction, but subsequent messages must reinforce that refraining from sharing drug equipment and the thorough cleansing of such equipment are essential to achieve protection from the risk of HIV infection. </PARA>
<PARA> The efficient transmission of infection by heterosexual activity has been clearly demonstrated by the African experience of AIDS. The important point I want to stress for Australians is that this has not come about simply as a result of poor genital health. I refer to the statistics which the Minister has cited on other occasions in relation to HIV infection in the United States. For example, in New York City AIDS is the biggest killer of women under 30 years of age and one in 60 babies is now born with the virus. These figures are a chilling foretaste of what could happen in this country. It therefore remains imperative that the whole community-I stress, the whole community-remains vigilant, that HIV and AIDS are not dismissed as a nine-day wonder, or not dismissed as belonging only to certain sub-groups in the community. We cannot allow the possibility of our becoming complacent about its potential to reach the wider community and, indeed, potentially to touch us all, if not directly, then certainly through our families and friends. </PARA>
<PARA> The verdict of scientists at the Fifth International Conference on AIDS held in Montreal, Canada, in June this year was that beyond any reasonable doubt the spread of AIDS has become a major life threatening reality for millions and millions of people. The bulk of those in greatest jeopardy are young people who, by virtue of their risky sexual and drug taking behaviour, are placing themselves in grave danger of becoming infected with the HIV virus. Therefore, school children and sexually active young people must also be the focus of preventive education campaigns. If we are complacent, if we neglect to communicate the risk of HIV infection to the nation's youth, we could see an uncontrolled epidemic into the year 2000 and beyond. The Opposition is very pleased to associate itself with a policy that sees the delivery of education at all levels, as mentioned by the Minister in his speech. </PARA>
<PARA> If the point needs reinforcing, AIDS is not a political issue. It is a public health issue requiring the utmost cooperation at all levels of government. Taking action against AIDS will not be an electoral plus. It will not win governments many brownie points. Dr Earl Berger, a senior AIDS policy adviser to the Canadian Government, has said, succinctly and pithily:</PARA>
<PARA> There are no votes in AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA>But any government or any opposition which fails to take or advocate appropriate action now could find itself accused of neglect when the 20-20 vision of hindsight which makes all of us wise men and women is brought to bear on what could well become a widespread epidemic and a national tragedy if we do not take the right action, and take it now. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a decade since AIDS was first identified. The Minister has referred to a paper which Jonathan Mann, the Director of the World Health Organisation's Global Program on AIDS, gave at the Montreal conference in June. In that paper Dr Mann revealed that as at 1 June this year a cumulative total of 157,191 AIDS cases from 149 countries around the world have been officially reported to the World Health Organisation. Dr Mann went on to add that the reporting is incomplete. The actual cumulative global total of AIDS cases is estimated at nearly half a million, or more than three times the number reported. </PARA>
<PARA> The epidemiology of the HIV infection gives a more complete and current view of the pandemic. Beginning this decade, 100,000 persons worldwide were infected with HIV. During the 1980s, five million to 10 million people around the world have become infected. If we take the conservative figure of five million and we spread that estimate around, we see that there are approximately 2 1/2 million cases in Africa, two million in the Americas, 500,000 in Europe and in our own part of the world-Asia and Oceania-about 100,000. The cumulative world total of AIDS cases is expected to double from today to the end of 1991-less than two years away-to over 1.1 million. One does not need any more statistical evidence to come to a conclusion that reinforces the view of both the Government and the Opposition in this country that intending migrants to Australia must be screened for AIDS. It is pleasing that the Government, which is currently responsible for the nation's migration policies, has adopted the view that we adopted in June in our policy. It is imperative that this health screening of migrants be implemented without delay in order not only to protect public health in this country but also to protect our budgets and the amount of money that we have available to spend on treating our own. We cannot afford to put ourselves in a position of importing HIV infection and then leaving Australian taxpayers open to the considerable cost of funding the care and treatment of those individuals. Quite frankly and bluntly put, we will have enough trouble looking after our own. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also pleased to recognise that the Government has again picked up a point in our policy-I do not seek to make a cheap point here; it might have adopted and come to this view independently-and is calling for the testing of prisoners before they go back into the community. Our prison system regrettably is an important conduit for HIV infection and prison inmates must be screened on their release to reduce their potential for threatening the health of the wider community. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9J4">Mr SHACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our own policy says that we should also test people when they go into gaol, and that is a minor point of difference between ourselves in this particular strategy although the Minister, to give him his due, recognises that the delivery of that is up to the State governments anyway. It does not matter what Minister Blewett might recommend, the acid will be on State health Ministers and police Ministers around the country. Let us put them on notice that our clear view is that there should be testing of inmates as they go into the penal system and testing of people as they are released. An important offshoot of that is that a proposed national prisons epidemiological study will provide important information to help contain the spread of HIV infection and AIDS. As I have said, we very strongly trust and hope that the States and Territories, which are responsible for prisons, will actively cooperate in the study and uniformly adopt pre-release testing as a bare minimum and preferably move towards testing on admission as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said before-I cannot cover the entire report-that education programs aimed at homosexual men have achieved significant changes in behaviour in this country. The success of these programs has largely been due to their grassroots nature. Messages have been developed and delivered appropriate to the target group, and they are being presented in a way which is relevant to them and are coming from sources which have won their confidence and trust. On other occasions I have had the opportunity to speak with the Minister about this particular aspect, and I express at this stage some concerns that we have in prospect. </PARA>
<PARA> The real success of the Government's strategy so far in delivering education programs in this country in the fight against HIV infection and AIDS is that it learnt from its mistakes in the campaign against drugs. We collectively-that is, the taxpayers of this country-saw many millions of dollars wasted in that campaign. Governments are good at some things. The Commonwealth Government-I am sure that the public of this country will agree-is a very good taxer. We are good at raising money. We are also good at handing out dollops of money to State governments, local government and community organisations. We are good at coming up with policies. But we are not good at delivering programs or implementing strategies from Canberra. Equally, the same argument applies to the State government level. The State governments are good at policy; in their own way they are also good at raising money and handing out dollops of money. But in a whole range of areas they are not good at delivering programs, and in respect of the fight against AIDS and HIV infection they are not good at delivering the educative message that needs to be got across to the sub-groups in our community- homosexual men, bisexual men, IV drug users, prostitutes and other sex workers. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Minister: for as long as he and the Government have carriage of this policy they must continue with the strategy of funding community groups through the Commonwealth AIDS prevention and education program and the other programs mentioned in the detail of the policy. Quite frankly, they produce literature which, from my point of view and the point of view of many members and senators, is quite shocking. But that is not the point. They deliver the education message from within and to their peer group in a way that is relevant and which the Minister has recognised is working. We have to have the courage of our convictions, within appropriate guidelines and appropriate checks, and continue to do that in respect of IV drug users and sex workers. I do not stand Buckley's chance of trying, as a prospective Commonwealth Health Minister, to convince people that they should not share needles, but it is those people who share needles with them who may stand a chance. We have to fund their arm, as it were, and ensure that the education message is developed and targeted in the best way and gets to the people who need to hear it in a way they will understand and, importantly, accept. I personally will be constantly looking for any bureaucratisation or any bureaucratic moving in on the funding of these programs because that is not the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister briefly mentioned that the Government is giving further consideration to special groups that have been infected by the HIV virus and AIDS. Of course, foremost of those is the haemophiliac group in this country. Currently 400 Australian families of haemophiliacs are facing up to the problem of HIV infection contracted, tragically, through essential treatment but involving contaminated blood products. They were contaminated before we had even heard about the virus. I simply say to the Minister publicly across the table that we on this side of the House hope that the Government will give very serious, detailed and compassionate consideration to the claims that are being made on it by this particular group in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Akin to the remarks I made about the delivery of the education message, I also want to say that in implementing its national strategy we sincerely hope that the Government will heed the warnings of its former chief adviser on AIDS, Professor Tony Basten, who said that too much money is being spent on committees and meetings and too little on research. Professor Basten also claimed that the bureaucracy had taken too long to act on key anti-AIDS strategies. We need to ensure that we do not waste time and do not waste money. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, another area to be resolved is the whole area of research and developing a foolproof non-reusable syringe. The Government has mentioned this responsibly. The jury is still out on this technology. We say to the Government that we hope it will pay very close attention to the need to continue to fund research into the development of this technology because the prevention of the re-use of syringes is one of the best ways of inhibiting increased community infection via IV drug users. Perhaps a foolproof non-re- usable syringe will be a key element in that particular area. Safer syringes could also eliminate needle stick injuries, which pose a threat to health care workers. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, we welcome the White Paper as a blueprint for dealing with HIV infection and AIDS on the basis of what is currently known about the infection and the disease. But the importance-one might even say the beauty-of the strategy is that as our knowledge bank improves and increases the strategy also allows for development and improvement. The paper represents a sensible balance between the interest of the public health of the community and the need for care and compassion in the treatment of those already affected by the disease. We are pleased, in a no-nonsense way, to offer bipartisan support for the initiatives which the Minister has outlined, but we place the Minister and the Government on notice that we will monitor progress and, where and when necessary, make known apparent deficiencies in the interests of the wider community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me start by putting the record straight. The Opposition does not accept the rantings and ravings that we had from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) at Question Time and his attempts to put the blame for this pilots strike on the Opposition. I have a pretty simple message for the Prime Minister: `Listen, mate, this is your policy. You have revved up this dispute'. I can tell the Prime Minister that he will be wearing the consequences of the damage that the dispute will cause this country. It is no good for him to come in here with his Pontius Pilate attitude and say, `I wipe my hands of the whole thing'. That will not wash. I can tell the Prime Minister that his claim that this is an example, a microcosm, of the Opposition's policy is nonsense and deserves to be exposed. One would think that we had been in government for the last seven years. The only thing I can say about that is that: if we were in government things would not be in the mess they are in today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On this first day back in the Parliament after the escalation of the pilots dispute we have initiated this debate just to get a few things on the public record. Firstly, we wish to expose the gross irresponsibility of the Prime Minister, whose personal intervention has clearly escalated this dispute to the situation today where it is hard to see an end in sight. Secondly, we wish to direct the underlying causes of this dispute where they rightly belong-at the feet of the Government's failed accord and its centralised wage system and to condemn the Government for perpetuating this system when reforms of the sort proposed by the Opposition are so obviously required. Lastly, through the contribution of my colleague the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull)-I might say that he is generally recognised by honourable members on both sides of this House as being an expert in tourism and aviation matters-we will try to get the message through to the Government that this dispute has already irreparably damaged our economy and not just the airline industry but also the very important tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The reactions of the Prime Minister have been nothing less than incredible. The hypocrisy of this man seems to know no bounds. He might think that this will give him some sort of window of opportunity for an early election on the basis that, like the old days, he would start the fire and, hey presto, he would come in with the fire brigade, the hose in his hand. The fact is that there will be no kudos, no political marks, for the Government from the way in which this dispute is going for the simple reason that the damage that will be caused to our economy will be so great that no-one will be thanking the Prime Minister for his personal intervention. He really is completely out of touch if he thinks that, at the end, people's gratitude for his personal intervention will somehow flow over into the ballot box at the next general election. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever his motive, there is no doubt that he has been so desperate to escalate this dispute that he has abandoned, denied, walked away from virtually all of his previous announcements on industrial relations. This is the man who, in July 1986, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't believe that better industrial relations are brought about by the method of harsh legal sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA>He has done a 180-degree turn and, just a few days ago, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I say without equivocation-</PARA>
<PARA>that ought to make honourable members worry-</PARA>
<PARA>that when the airlines decide to initiate these legal processes with significant very drastic financial penalties against individual pilots and their organisation the airlines will be pursuing those legal processes with the full support of my Government. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the same bloke who in 1974 supported a 27 per cent wage increase for international airline pilots. This is the same bloke who parades around this country as the high priest of consensus. Yet just a few days ago there he was on the media declaring war, for heaven's sake, on the pilots. Instead of looking for some solution to this problem, instead of looking to his beloved industrial relations system to find a solution, instead of taking a deep breath and asking himself `What would be in the national interest in this case?', he sits down with his minders, gets a can of petrol and starts pouring it on the flickering flames. On Saturday, 19 August, he had the Commonwealth support a cancellation of the pilots award. He must have known that that action could do nothing other than stiffen the pilots' resolve. They do not want to have anything to do with the award and his system. On the Sunday, after years of trying to prevent people from having access to common law actions, he was making pronouncements supporting common law action against the pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard him on Melbourne radio on Monday and he really went berserk. He started pushing the line that anyone could fly an aeroplane-it was the same as learning a trade, as if honourable members would be happy to have their local plumber fly them in and out of Canberra. He said that it was no more responsible than driving a bus and that he-Captain Rambo Hawke-would make the pilots regret that they had ever heard of flying. We know that he can fly a kite. We have heard that he had lessons in a Chipmunk and he might have had a refresher course from Biggles Evans in the other place; but he really ought to understand that it takes a lot of skill to be a modern pilot. Quite frankly, it is no help whatsoever in trying to settle this dispute to have the Prime Minister attempting to belittle the pilots. Apparently, he had Ted Harris on the phone ticking him off for escalating the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had reports about senior Ministers. Perhaps the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) will get up and say what he told the Prime Minister about the escalation of this dispute. In the Australian the other day Richard Farmer quoted one pilot who I thought put it pretty well. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Hawke gave us the Araldite to stick together. </PARA>
<PARA>He was not joking. When the letters went out from the airline companies the pilots were already galvanised by the Prime Minister's remarks. They had their chain telephone system so cranked up as a result of his remarks that within 11 hours-from 3 p.m. one afternoon to 2 a.m. the next day-they had 1,640 letters of resignation in their hip pockets ready for delivery to the airline companies the next morning. As we all know, ever since then the whole system has been at a standstill. The fact is that the Prime Minister has deliberately escalated this dispute and, as the damage bill mounts, he stands condemned for his actions in exacerbating this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Before proceeding to analyse the failures of the Government's industrial relations policy, let me just make clear our attitude to the pilots. The Opposition does not have much time for the pilots. They have a double-barrelled shotgun pointed at the head of this economy and they have already pulled one of the triggers. This is the classic Aussie dispute. This is the way we run industrial relations in this country. We have a union with strong industrial muscle running amuck, inconveniencing the public-which is one of its favourite levers-and, as a result, we are seeing the country going broke. Today Moody's Investors Service Inc.-as if we needed to hear the message again-is downgrading our credit rating. Why? Because we do not run industrial relations very well in this country. It is about time that we started to recognise the causes of our very poor industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> In analysing this issue let me once again dismiss that propaganda and make it clear that Labor's industrial relations policy carries the blame for what is happening. Just to add to it, today at Question Time the Prime Minister was talking about the Qantas dispute. I do not know the details but he was actually revving up. He did not say it but he might as well already have declared war on the Qantas pilots. If they were not going to go out, I reckon he has certainly increased the chances of their doing so. People would ask, `Why is it that the Prime Minister takes this view?'. One of the reasons that the Government sees this as a threat to its centralised system is that every wage increase must fit within the deals worked out behind closed doors between Mr Kelty and Mr Keating. They call it comparative wage justice. It is one of the principles of which they are very fond. No-one can move in this country without Bill Kelty's approval. The whole system has been established, set up and maintained to deliver control to the ACTU hierarchy, and under this system all wages and conditions, as best as they can organise it, must be related one to the other. Not only has their abject failure been in terms of perpetuating this dispute; with award restructuring, the Government actually wants to worsen the situation; it wants to give us a more centralised, more rigid, more inflexible system than this country has ever had. It is a point that the Minister for Industrial Relations recognises. I will give him his credit. He said to Bill Kelty that he was a bit worried about the inflexibility of the lower wage proposals, and Bill Kelty went straight to the Treasurer and this Minister, for good measure, had Bill Kelty get his scribe, Pamela Williams, to do him over in the Australian Financial Review, to say what a hopeless Minister he was. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that this Government is intent on maintaining its centralised system regardless of the consequences. The mechanisms which established this system of rigidity and centralisation are principally the structure of awards and the structure of unions. Union structure encourages the system to deliver the same wage outcome in every enterprise in the country regardless of the circumstances of the enterprise. The Government has encouraged bigger unions with bigger muscle. It has failed to reduce the number of unions in individual enterprises. The award structure complements that process and carries the same result. The Government has failed to promote tailor-made enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> All this means that Labor's industrial relations system is a recipe for break-outs-and, of course, we have them; we have them regularly under the centralised system. They are a product of the industrial relations systems in this country, and the entrenchment of comparative wage justice has a whole lot of other adverse consequences, one of which is that if people work better, if they work more efficiently, there is no reward for it. We do not have a system of incentive. People want to know why we have such an appalling productivity record compared to all our competitors. I call it the yawning productivity gap-we are going down and everybody else is going up. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it, then, that we have that? One of the principal reasons is that in this centralised rigid system we cannot introduce a means of paying people which will encourage productivity. What flows from that? Not only do we have this poor productivity performance; we have the Government running a low wage policy. On top of that, we have resentment building up, and people resent having their standards of living reduced. So what do we get? We get a vicious circle operating, so we get these unreasonable and unaffordable demands for pay increases. </PARA>
<PARA> To add insult to injury, our arbitration system is a toothless tiger. Let us look at what has happened in the pilots dispute. The Industrial Relations Commission directed a return to work-and the pilots say `Get lost', `Drop dead'. Why should anyone be surprised? We have been running the system like that for years. It is a one-sided system. If people do not like what the Commission, the umpire, says, they can just walk away from it. That is one of the central features of this system under Labor's failed accord and failed industrial relations policy. The Government has conceded this point. There is no great intellectual fight between us and the Government. The Government actually introduced a Bill in 1987 to give us a decent system of enforcement in our industrial relations system-and what happened? It had on the other side a proposal to do away with section 45d, which the Prime Minister now reckons is the greatest thing since sliced bread. So we find Crean saying, `No, you cannot have a decent enforcement procedure in the Act'. They admitted it; they conceded the ground; and in the end they did not have the political will, the political determination to do what is in the national interest to improve our industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> The hypocrisy of this Government is just mind-boggling. The Prime Minister talks tough; we heard lots of tough talk today. But he is not prepared to toughen up his own industrial relations system. He supports the system, but he is not prepared to do anything to improve it, although those reforms are so very clear. By way of contrast, he capitulates to the wharfies at the drop of a hat. The rorts are worth $850m a year. It is the same with the meat workers. There are many examples. With the pilots there is a different attitude, and we are to be taken to the brink of ruin. It will be a long drawn out battle, where the only body that could arbitrate a decision stands idle on the sidelines rendered impotent by the Government's failure to adopt our sanctions Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Once the problems are identified, the solutions become clear. We ought to do something about union structure. We ought to have a situation where there is only one union in each enterprise in the country. The Government ought to do something about our award structure, both within the Commission, so that we have an enterprise focus, and in the system of voluntary agreements, to allow and encourage people to sit down and talk on a one to one basis and improve industrial relations in every enterprise in this country. We should abandon the `big is beautiful' theory of the Keltys of the world and the megalomania that goes with it. </PARA>
<PARA> We condemn the Prime Minister for revving up this dispute. We condemn the Government's failed industrial relations policy for being the prime causal factor in the bringing about of this dispute. The Opposition makes a final appeal to the parties in the national interest. The Government ought to drop its political agenda, it ought to sit down and start to give some direction and start searching for some solutions for a problem which is going to cause real damage to our economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think anybody listening to that speech could only hear the ultimate in hypocrisy coming from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) when he accused the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of hypocrisy. It is the same old record, round and round. We have heard it ad nauseam. Nothing new; the same old story, a little bit out of date. But anybody listening on air this afternoon to that can only come to one conclusion: that the Opposition is supporting the Australian Federation of Air Pilots in the damage that it is doing to the aviation industry and to the tourism industry of this country. Have no doubt about that. The tone of questions from the Opposition in Question Time and the tone of the contribution by the honourable member for Flinders leave one very clear conviction in mind: that the Opposition is supporting the pilots on the path that they are on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The disruption to Australia's air services by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is both irresponsible and unnecessary. This approach by the Federation of Air Pilots is a gun to the head of Australia approach. It is an approach that will not be accepted or tolerated by this Government. It is obviously encouraged by the tone of comment that comes from the Opposition and the policy they espouse. What the Federation is saying to the people of Australia is this: `Give us a 30 per cent pay increase, or else. Or else, we will ground air services in this country and we will wreck air services and the tourism industries of this country'. That is what they are saying, and they are getting encouragement from the Opposition in that course. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's clear preference was that this matter should be pursued by the Federation of Air Pilots through the Industrial Relations Commission, in the proper process, like other wage and salary earners. The Federation made it very clear repeatedly that its members were not going to be party to that process, that they wanted to go outside the system, as they are encouraged to do by the Opposition's policy. They wanted to go outside the system, and now they are outside the system, totally. The comments made by the honourable member for Flinders regarding sanctions are utterly irrelevant. The sanctions that they talked about had relation to people operating within the system. In this case there is no strike; the pilots have resigned. We have got to have employees and employers. If the Opposition is going to apply sanctions to that, then we have got to have the employees back in the system, so let us not have any more of this humbug going on about what the Opposition's sanctions Bill might have done. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that what we have in this country today is a shining example of what we would have across the board, industry after industry, workplace after workplace, if the industrial relations policy of the Opposition were to be implemented. It is very simple and very clear. This is exactly what the Opposition is promoting. It is the Opposition's policy. Having told people to go outside the system, now that they are outside the system, it is saying that they ought to go back inside it and the Government ought to be doing something about legislating to deal with them when they are back inside the system. The policy that is being pursued by the Federation of Air Pilots is that which the Opposition is promoting. It cannot have it both ways. It usually wants a dollar each way, but it wants industry outside the system and firms outside the system. The Federation is outside. That is where the Opposition wants it to be. From comments made by members of the Opposition this afternoon it obviously supports the course being followed by the pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the conflict within the Opposition. It is very difficult for anybody who has been trying to follow what has been happening in recent weeks to know just where the Opposition stands on this issue. Its policy encourages what is happening. On 23 August the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we hear this nonsense proposition that the airline dispute is just `the free market doing its thing'-as if the unbridled use of coercive power and brute force is fundamental to our policy and to the operations of truly free markets. </PARA>
<PARA>The next day the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt) said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the belligerent attitude of the Prime Minister is a politically expedient `band-aid' approach that fails to address Australia's long-term labour market problems. </PARA>
<PARA>That is going in a different direction again. On the morning of 25 August the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA>It's a classic case where you've got to go beyond the employer-employee fight and look after the national interest. And the Government is correct. </PARA>
<PARA>Later, on 25 August, when asked how often he would need to use the proposed sanctions of the Bill-the failed sanctions Bill of the Opposition-he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think that in fact, you might only have to use that sort of power once in a decade. </PARA>
<PARA>That goes to the trivia of what the Opposition is about. The Leader of the Opposition says that once in a decade we might use that power. He had previously said that the Government was correct. The Leader of the National Party says something different. Then Senator Chaney, that nice gentleman who likes to have something each way, says we should leave it to the employer and the employee to sit down and work it out themselves. Today the Opposition is saying that that is not right, that the Government should be fixing it. This is the confusion that comes from this. Senator Chaney says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . our industrial relations system is aimed at allowing market forces greater operation, but giving a real prospect of increased productivity which can underpin real wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA>On the 7.30 Report of 22 August he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The pilots and employers could, I believe, work out a better arrangement than they've got at present. That is up to them. </PARA>
<PARA>They are out of the system. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), has a different view from that. At the National Press Club a couple of days earlier he said:</PARA>
<PARA>You wouldn't be getting a claim of that size under our system. </PARA>
<PARA>All I can say to the Opposition is that it is time it worked out exactly what its policy is and tried to get some consistency within it. It has to accept that what is happening here in this dispute is its policy in practice. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should tell them to write to his great leader. We come back to the old story about attacking and denigrating the accord-the failed accord, as the Opposition puts it. The failed accord has produced 1 1/2 million new jobs in this country. It is the accord which has produced what the Opposition does not really like-a 60 per cent reduction in the rate of industrial disputation. It cannot accept that. That is a major achievement of the accord. Under the accord we have seen a containment of wages costs. The pilots are saying that they want a 30 per cent increase. The Opposition says the pilots should sit down and have a yarn with the employers and work something out-30 per cent, that should be all right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That kind of reaction and that kind of process would quite clearly produce a wages explosion, rampant inflation, a collapse of the economy and a massive increase in unemployment. The people of Australia understand that. They understand the risks and dangers of what the pilots are about. They understand the risks and dangers of what the Opposition's policy means in practice. Similarly, industry understands that. It is not supporting the enterprise by enterprise arrangement that the Opposition is talking about. They are hands on people. They have to deal with the practicality of running businesses. They know that if the policy put by the Opposition were to come into practice there would be a wages explosion. There would be an eruption of strikes across the country as one pressure group sought to grab gains for itself and was followed by another pressure group in a similar circumstance. That clearly indicates the futility of the Opposition's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of my remarks I said that the Government wanted this matter to be dealt with through the ordinary processes within the system. The Federation of Air Pilots did not see it that way. It has gone outside the system now. It is simply a matter of employees talking individually to their employers. The airlines have advertised for pilots in the process of recruiting new staff. They have had a substantial response to those advertisements, especially from younger pilots and pilots abroad. I hasten to add that one would not be surprised if there were a response from their former pilots. It is a matter of those discussions taking place under the Opposition's policy-employee to employer, one to one, and not as the Federation of Air Pilots. The Federation of Air Pilots is irrelevant in this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to what the Opposition has said about its failed Bill on sanctions and the compliance package in the 1987 Bill. The constant claim made by Senator Chaney, and made earlier this afternoon by the honourable member for Flinders, is that the package in that Bill was dropped because of union pressure. That has been claimed many times by the Opposition and it is absolutely untrue. There is no truth whatsoever to it. The 1987 Bill contained a total compliance package. It provided for enforceable directions by the Commission through an injunctions process. It also limited access to other legal remedies outside the system. That package was not opposed by the union movement; it was opposed by the employers. On 6 June the then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, the present Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis), announced that the compliance provisions of the Bill would be amended. Mr Willis emphasised that the system would not work without the commitment of the parties. The employers would not accept the original compliance package. The unions would not accept only those parts of the package which had employer support. For those reasons the compliance provisions of the 1987 Bill were amended to retain the bans clause process from the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, to remove any restriction on access to the common law and to retain unchanged the processes for dealing with secondary boycotts under the Trade Practices Act. The intention to amend the 1987 Bill in this manner was announced in detail by Minister Willis on 6 June 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the claim by Senator Chaney that the 1987 compliance package was dropped because of union pressure is patently false. It is absolutely false. He knows that to be true. The matter put by the Opposition in respect of the relevance of the compliance package to this dispute to the pilots withdrawing their services and resigning, is irrelevant. The sanctions have no relevance at all. As I mentioned earlier, the pilots have resigned. They are no longer employees. There is no place for them within the system. Their bleating is irrelevant. The Federation of Air Pilots was absolutely resolute. It wanted to be outside the system, despite the view of the company and the Government to the contrary. It is now dealing with an environment which is totally different from what it expected. It now has to live with the consequences. As individuals the pilots have to find their way back. They can only be encouraged by the questions asked and the comments made this afternoon by the Opposition in this place. They can only be encouraged, to the great damage of Australia's tourism and airline industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by returning to what is the real aggro, the real concern, the matter that drives the Opposition most, and that is its anger with the accord because it is working. Real unit labour costs are down some 14 per cent under this Government. Employment is at its lowest level over seven years at 6.1 per cent. Gross domestic product growth was at 3.3 per cent in 1988-89 and 1 1/2 million new jobs have been created as a result of the wage restraint that has been experienced through the processes of the accord. Within that accord and the Government's legislation there is provision for, firstly, control of wages policy and restraint of wages and, secondly, the flexibility that is needed, through certified agreements, through sections 115 and 118, to provide for unique circumstances and needs in certain places of employment. We have a double system which represents the best of both worlds: a centralised wage system-control over wages as an essential element of economic policy-and the flexibility to provide for improvement and unique circumstances. Added to that, which is what the Opposition does not want to understand, are the advantages and gains to be made in productivity through the award restructuring process. That process is well under way. It is something that cannot be contemplated by the Opposition and the Opposition does not want to understand it. It is in that orderly process that we will get a more flexible and better skilled work force-a work force that can make Australian industry more efficient and competitive. We will do that without the confrontation, division and fragmentation proposed in the policies being pursued by the Opposition. What we are seeing with the current air services problem and the actions of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots are examples of the Opposition's industrial relations policy at work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by making three statements of fact: firstly, tourism is Australia's biggest export earner and earned $6.5 billion last year; secondly, tourism, after the Public Service, is Australia's biggest employer, with 450,000 people; and, thirdly, the present industrial policies of the Government and the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) are sending tourism broke and providing the unemployment pile with literally tens of thousands of people, because of the Government's completely inept attitude towards the pilots strike and the Prime Minister's reluctance to take any form of leadership whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to bring to the attention of the House the daily news bulletin of what is happening in the tourist industry. I will get through the figures, which are the most up to date available, State by State. On Queensland's Gold Coast, which is now allegedly enjoying its peak period, already there have been 7,000 cancellations of conventions and group bookings. Last Friday 2,200 convention delegates dipped out-they cancelled-at a cost of $3m. The average loss on the Gold Coast is raging at $2.5m a day. The five-star hotels on the Gold Coast have an occupancy rate of 13 per cent. Three major conventions were cancelled at one hotel alone in Brisbane. Brisbane is losing 4,000 to 5,000 delegates per week on existing conferences. Hotel bookings are down to a 20 per cent occupancy rate. In Cairns the immediate cancellations of groups and conventions are costing $2m a day and more cancellations are coming in daily. </PARA>
<PARA> At this time of the year there is normally a 100 per cent occupancy rate in hotels in Ayers Rock. The rate is down to 40 per cent and one major conference has already gone. Adelaide City alone is losing $3.2m a day because of the strike. If it goes on it will lose much more than that. The occupancy rate at Adelaide hotels at the moment is 25 per cent and there have been staff lay-offs. All hotel bookings in Canberra are down 30 per cent. Seven conferences have already been cancelled and the occupancy rate stands at 20 per cent. In Tasmania tourism has stopped altogether because there are virtually no air services. Hotel occupancy rates are at less than 20 per cent. The marginal operations of motor homes and rental cars-Tasmania's biggest area-have virtually stopped. Staff are being laid off. The Tasmanian economy has been shot to pieces to the tune of $550,000 per day. In Western Australia bookings are down by 50 per cent. Last week the Hyatt Regency Hotel lost $250,000. The Observation City complex lost $630,000 and is working on a 10 per cent occupancy rate. Every domestic tourist going to Western Australia is worth $580. So far it is costing the Western Australian economy $2.5m per week. The Burswood Resort in Perth lost $300,000 in cancelled convention traffic. In Broome the Cable Beach Resort is losing $50,000 per day. That is the story in tourism. People might ask, `What is happening in Victoria?' I can tell them that the Victorian Government is so good that it has wrecked the Victorian Tourism Commission to such an extent that nobody in the Victorian Tourism Commission can say what the figures are; they just do not know. That shows its real commitment to tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened was that the Prime Minister saw an ideal opportunity to get an election issue running. It took him about two years to get the Builders Labourers Federation off the books, but he was into the pilots after 20 hours. We do not condone what the pilots did, but we have reached the stage where the tourist industry is being crippled and it will continue to be crippled. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the latest report from the inbound tour operators of Australia. Today there were six cancellations of tours from one Japanese company. Further cancellations are expected following a big news article which appeared on the front page of Japanese newspapers last weekend. There were another seven cancellations from another company today, worth $1.2m, comprising three groups from Japan and four from Europe. A group of 93 from the United States, worth $500,000, has cancelled and another group has cancelled its trip to Lizard Island. Guess where it has gone! It has gone to Bali. Hotel occupancy rates should be at 80 per cent at this time of the year, but they are down to 30 per cent. The picture is one of disaster and gloom. There have been stand-downs and people are suffering. Yet we have seen nothing from the Prime Minister which will indicate that there is room to move or that he is prepared to undertake some role in trying to get the dispute resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an established fact in the aviation industry that the airlines expect this strike to go on for as long as two months. The Australian Federation of Air Pilots will say that it has strike money which will last for eight months. Are we to see the total destruction of Australia's biggest export industry because the Prime Minister is looking for an election issue? That is really what it is all about. But he has been caught. He has got himself into a corner and there is no room to move. At the very least we should be promoting talks. The pilots should at least get together with the airline companies. Let Hawke and the Government get out of it and let us see whether we can get some rational discussions going. Under the failed industrial relations system that operates under the Government, nothing is working at the moment and nothing is likely to work for the next two months. We hope that the period I have cited will not be correct but, by golly, it looks as if it will be. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw an amazing performance by the Prime Minister today. He minced in here like a latter day Duke of Plaza-Toro. When we asked him a question about the deal that was done with Qantas Airways Ltd he went off his face completely. If he has done anything he has probably kindled the fire from a perfectly rational proposition to making sure that there is the possibility of an industrial dispute with Qantas. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) has just raged on about what we said in Question Time in terms of alternative services. The Government has had the Opposition's support in bringing in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). I might say that the Government was very game to do that. The last government that brought in the troops to break strikes was the Chifley Government in 1949. It lost the following election, as the Hawke Government will lose the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was supported by the Opposition in bringing in the RAAF. We were supportive on interlining and bringing in foreign carriers. Yet when we asked a simple question today about the prospect of charter airlines coming in, and about the safety requirements of those charter airlines, we got from the Prime Minister the greatest pooh-pooh that we have ever seen. I understand that there are at least three DC8 aircraft waiting to be chartered by Australian domestic airlines. I want an absolutely ironclad guarantee from the Government that if we are to go to the cowboy operators in the United States, when those aircraft are involved not necessarily with freight but with carrying passengers, they will have the right certification and be safe. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I referred to Arrow Air. I think that I did so with every justification because at the weekend a deal was quickly snuck through the Civil Aviation Authority. Admittedly, they are only charter aircraft, but I understand that the DC8s that are being offered could well come from Arrow Air. As I said in Question Time today, it has one of the worst safety records in the United States of America. For example, I quote from Canadian Aviation Safety Board report 85-H50902 on the crash of an Arrow Air DC8-63 at Gander in Newfoundland on 12 December 1985, resulting in the loss of 256 passengers and crew. The findings of the Canadian Aviation Safety Board were that the aircraft was not de-iced prior to take-off. There was a partial loss of engine thrust in the No. 4 engine and the integrity of a class D cargo compartment was also involved. The flight was undertaken with two missing side panels in the No. 3 cargo pit; the take-off weight calculated by the crew was 14,000 pounds less than the actual weight of the aircraft; the take-off speeds used by the crew may have been as much as 35,000 pounds less than the actual take-off weight; and the actual weight of the passengers was not reflected in the calculations and accurate weight and centre of gravity calculations were not being performed by flight crews for every flight. The maximum design zero fuel rate of the aircraft was exceeded on each of the Arrow Air troop charters in December 1985. Arrow Air's contractual obligations with respect to authorised payload capacity exceeded the authorised payload capacity of that aircraft being used. Arrow Air flight crews were not recording all aircraft unserviceabilities in the aircraft journey logs and on occasion were accepting for flight aircraft with known defects. The aircraft's flight recorders were not up to date, and the crew had been working 15 hours on the stick that day, with a work load of 20 hours over a 24-hour period. Yet the Prime Minister and this Minister wonder why we raise these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> We must make sure that in these emergency procedures there is absolute safety for the Australian travelling public. But this Minister comes in here and preaches to us with that garbage that he just gave us, while the tourist industry is bleeding, while the aviation industry is bleeding, and while millions of dollars are being taken offshore by the foreign carriers operating in Australia. We are in real strife and unless we get some leadership from this Government, unless we get some indication that the two parties can talk, if we are subjected--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, we have been hearing from two rather ranting and raving honourable members. I refer not so much to the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who gave us a travelogue on what is happening in the tourism industry within this country, but to the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who very quickly is becoming known as ranting and raving Reith. He talked about everything but what the matter of public importance is about. The matter of public importance which has come before this House today is a hypocritical and cynical attempt to blame the Government for the airline pilots dispute. There was nothing in the speech given by the honourable member for Flinders that suggested in any way that this Government was to blame, or that the policies of this Government in the industrial relations arena were to blame, for the actions of the pilots in this dispute. To say that the present airline pilots dispute has resulted from the Hawke Government's industrial relations policy is absolute nonsense. I am sure that all members of the Opposition are aware of that being the case. Indeed, the industrial relations policy of the Opposition, if ever it were given the opportunity to govern, would mean a succession of airline pilots disputes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The pilots are providing the Opposition with exactly what it wants-that is, no accord, just a dog eat dog environment in which the strong will survive and the weak will perish. I suppose that under the Opposition, if people are considered to be employed in an essential industry, as the pilots consider themselves to be, we could end up with a different sort of two-tier system. In fact we could have a system where those who believe that they play a more essential part in the community could make outrageous pay claims. We could have another section of the community, another section of the work force, which is in exactly the opposite situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition should come clean. It is no good coming in here, as the honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Fadden did, and talking about such things as what is happening in the tourism industry. We are not stupid; we know what is happening in the tourism industry. We do not need to have the honourable member for Fadden come in here and tell us the occupancy rates in Cairns or in Adelaide or anywhere else. We all know that this is hurting the country. That is the reason that we must do what we are doing. A personal attack on the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), as we heard in the speech of the honourable member for Flinders-in fact that was all it was; it was just a personal attack on the Prime Minister-is not going to solve this problem. What we need here is some help from everywhere. Instead, the Opposition is coming in and wasting the time of this House, of this Parliament, on a matter of public importance which is nothing short of a cheap political exercise. It is trying to turn a very serious issue which is sending our economy down the tube, which is going to result in massive stand-downs, which is going to result in people who are probably on much less money than what the pilots want in terms of the rise having to live with nothing or on the unemployment benefit because of stand-downs-that is what is happening in this country-into a personal attack on the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federation of Air Pilots wanted this fight last year. This has been a deliberate tactic by the pilots to bring this country to its knees if necessary so that they can go outside the wages system-outside the accord which has been in existence now for some seven years, which has definitely worked and which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) did say has caused a reduction in industrial disputation of up to 60 per cent. What they are saying is, `We are a group of professional people who are needed in the community and we want what we want, nothing less'. The 29.4 per cent that they are after is not an ambit claim. They have made it clear in all their correspondence with the airline companies, in all their negotiations, that that is non-negotiable. Mr Deputy Speaker, the fact is that everybody recognises that the pilots of this country are a very important group of professional people. There is no doubt about that. But there are many other groups of people in this society who are also very important. What difference in real terms is there between the aircraft maintenance people, for instance, who get the planes in the air, and the people who fly? I do not want to denigrate the pilots and I will not, because frankly we all respect pilots as much as we respect doctors and other professional people. But just because they are in an essential industry, just because they are in a position in which, by withholding their labour, they are able to wreck the economy of this country, just because of the fact that they do not believe that they belong to the wages system and are prepared to opt out of it, irrespective of what that does to the economy, it does not mean that they can expect the public of this country to have any respect for them. The only way they are going to get any respect, in my opinion, is to come back to work, to do the right thing and to accept that they cannot be placed outside a system which has worked in this country for the last seven years and will continue to work well. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, I am surprised that the Opposition wants a debate on industrial relations. It certainly has not been one of its strong points in the past and if today is any evidence of what those opposite know about industrial relations and what they would do, then what I have just said is exactly correct-that is, they should be keeping their mouths shut on this issue. If anything, they should be trying to help the Government, trying to help the airline companies, by coming up with proper solutions and not trying to make cheap political capital out of it. The Minister at the table has made clear the amount of days that have been saved in terms of industrial disputation. Of course, all Opposition members want to do in the case of industrial relations is trot out another lousy piece of legislation which they know full well means nothing, particularly in the context of the pilots strike. As the Minister said, the fact is that they are out of the system; they resigned. It does not matter how many laws are written in the Industrial Relations Act; the fact is they have resigned and are no longer covered by the Act. Therefore, all this business about extra sanctions is just absolute rubbish. The Opposition simply wants to be able to smash industrial disputes and smash the unions. That is really what it is all about. That is what Opposition members are saying here. They are simply saying to us, `Look, if we were in government we would fix it all up'. How are they going to fix it all up? They are going to end up in the same situation, not only once but on countless occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other industries, such as the power industry, where essential services are involved. Yet they are prepared to break the wages system that we have at the moment. They are prepared to risk the wages policy that this country has enjoyed, as I said, simply to be able to turn around and say, `Your policies are no good, they are not working' and they cite as an example this one strike. The bulletin brought out by the Air Pilots Federation I think some time last year or this year was a deliberate tactic for war. The Opposition says that the Prime Minister has declared war. The Prime Minister has not declared war; the Australian Federation of Air Pilots has somehow conned its members, people who, I am sure, if they realised just what they are doing to this country, might well change their minds. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet we have here a copy of the financial planning letter that was sent out to all the pilots. Unfortunately there is not enough time to read this but honourable members would be absolutely astounded if they could do so. The letter talks about eating in instead of eating out as one way of saving money. I might tell the pilots that most people in this country eat in because they cannot afford to eat out as they are not getting $75,000 or $79,000 as an average wage. The letter goes on to say that if a pilot is the sort of person who does not like sitting around home and doing nothing he should go fishing or go and fix his car or do something like that. That is great stuff! While pilots are out there fishing there are people who are suffering and, as I said, are probably getting less than the total rise the pilots want and the economy of this country is going down the tube. </PARA>
<PARA> I implore people in the Pilots Federation who have any brains to look at what they are doing and stop causing this hardship. I say to the Opposition, `Instead of wasting the time of this House with this sort of stupid matter of public importance, tell us what you think we should be doing. Give us some constructive ideas'. I am sure the Minister will look at them. After all, the people in this dispute are the sorts of people who vote for the Opposition. If today's episode is not a support of the pilots in this dispute by the Opposition, I do not know what is. Let us have some sanity in this serious situation. I say to the Opposition, `Stop making political capital out of it; it does not become you'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, may I add my congratulations to those of other members of this House to you on your election to the speakership today. We look forward to your occupying that position for many years to come. It gives me pleasure to resume the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 on behalf of the Government. In doing so, I add my comments to those of commentators, honourable members and the public on the 1989 Budget recently presented by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). It is an excellent Budget. That is not just my opinion; it is the general opinion right around Australia. What best points to the achievements of this Budget is the fact that since this Government came to power we have turned a $9.6 billion Budget deficit, which was bequeathed to us by the former coalition Government, into a $9.1 billion surplus. That is a $19 billion turnaround in the space of six years. This is an economic tour de force for which our Government and our Treasurer deserve a great deal of commendation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to confine my comments to the aspect of the Budget with which I have had most to do, and that is the retirement incomes policy. This was one of the major aspects of the Budget and it has generated a great deal of interest and excitement around the community. The Chanticleer column of the Australian Financial Review of 16 August, the day after the Budget, had this to say about the retirement incomes aspect of the Budget:</PARA>
<PARA>The revolution this Government has now produced in retirement income and therefore fund management is now as great as anything else it has done, including its deregulation of the financial system . . . already the things Paul Keating has done to encourage private superannuation have produced a boom for the industry; last night's additions to those will turn it into a bonanza . . . it would mean that within about 15 years, the savings position of the nation will have been transformed to the point where foreign debt of the size we are all now so worried about will either disappear or become irrelevant. And what's more it will be long-term savings-not short-term bank accounts as would be encouraged by such measures as providing tax relief on interest income. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we all know who has been advocating that latter policy. I had the great pleasure of being a member of the task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on retirement incomes, which was most ably co-chaired by your good self, Mr Speaker, and the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh). As you would know, all of us-the 11 Government backbenchers on that committee-had a very interesting and fruitful time travelling around the country talking to groups of people and individual retired people about what they thought our retirement incomes policy should be and, in particular, gauging their response to the Cass report on retirement incomes. We raised many points and when we made our report to the Prime Minister we emphasised those points. I am very pleased to be able to say that many of the grievances which were expressed by retired people around the country have since been addressed either in the April economic statement or in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The four aspects which Professor Bettina Cass nominated as characterising a good retirement incomes policy were adequacy, fairness, security and sustainability. On the question of adequacy, this Budget provides a special real rise of $2 a week from April 1990; that is, $2 for single pensioners and $3.30 a week for couples. Many people have been saying that this is not a large amount but it is the first real rise in pension incomes for many years. In April 1990 pensioners will get not only that rise but also their normal indexation rise. For a single pensioner this will amount to about $14 a week. Also in December of this year rent assistance will increase by $5 a week, with an extra $5 a week increase to follow, for beneficiaries with no children. In June 1990 there will be another $5 per week increase in rental assistance and an extra $5 per week for families with three or more children. In September 1990 there will be yet another $5 per week general increase and from March 1991 there will be six-monthly indexation of rental assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect deemed as being essential to a good retirement incomes policy is fairness. Our credentials on fairness are already well established, principally through our policy of targeting assistance and social security payments to those who most need them. We do this largely in the area of age pensions, through the assets test and through the income test. It is important that all groups of retired people, whether they be on a full age or service pension or on superannuation with maybe a part pension, or people whose income consists entirely of superannuation or some other form of private income, be treated fairly. This Budget addresses that measure. I will get back to superannuants a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> The third aspect is security. This is the aspect which this Budget best addresses. As you would know, Mr Speaker, one of the complaints we had was about the uncertainty in the area of retirement incomes. People felt that many changes had been made, particularly to social security provisions. People felt uncertain about their future. For the first time, we have a long term retirement incomes policy which people can depend on for the years ahead and into the next century. It also encourages people to provide for their own retirement through superannuation. If that is not possible, it reconfirms our commitment to an adequate age pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth aspect deemed necessary for a good retirement incomes policy was sustainability. We need a retirement incomes policy that can be applied for the long term into the next century. This means it has to be a responsible retirement incomes policy without any gimmicks, without giveaways and without a fistful of dollars. It has to be, and it is, a responsible and rational long term policy. There has been much discussion in the press and elsewhere about the benefits to pensioners contained in this Budget as well as the benefits to those currently in the work force and who will not be retiring in the future. I would like to concentrate on the benefits in this Budget for people already retired on superannuation, particularly those people on low or middle rates of superannuation income. I have had complaints in my office from constituents who allege that there is nothing in the Budget for people who are currently retired and on superannuation. That is definitely not the case. As a result of this Budget and of the April economic statement there are real benefits for people already retired on superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> Four changes in those two statements will immediately benefit retired people receiving low or middle rates of superannuation. There are, firstly, the tax reductions in the 1989-90 year, which will substantially reduce the amount of tax they are paying. Secondly, there is an increase in the age pensioner rebate and a new scheme whereby the unused portion of this rebate may be transferred to the spouse. This is a particularly significant change because it provides a certain degree of splitting of the tax liability between two partners. Thirdly, there is an increase in the spouse rebate and, fourthly, an increase in the Medicare exemption levy for married couples. These four measures combined will provide a great deal of relief for retired people receiving superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> All couples who are entitled to a part pension will gain at least $15 a week from these changes. Married couples with total superannuation and other non-pension income of less than $26,041 per year are entitled to a part pension. These superannuants will further benefit from increases in the rate of pension and the earlier payment of pension increases announced by the Government. The next indication increased in the age pension will be brought forward by four weeks to 15 November 1989 and indexation increases will then occur on 18 April 1990, 20 September 1990, and therefore every March and September. So superannuants entitled to a part pension will fully benefit from these increases as well as the other benefits that I have enumerated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to further increases on top of indexation over time. Further initiatives which will assist most people who are currently retired and on superannuation include the annual indexation of the pension income test-free area from July 1991. This will mean an annual increase in the age rebate and the effective tax threshold for many part pensioners. For the first time this threshold will actually be indexed. From 1995 no age or service pensioner, whether on full or part rate pension, will pay any income tax. From November 1989 recipients of a pension or part pension will be able to borrow against their home-up to $40,000 excluding capitalised interest and charges. This amount will not count for the income test and therefore there will be no loss of pension. This measure will allow those eligible to take advantage of the various reverse mortgage schemes offered by financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> From January 1990 the recipient of a pension or part pension whose spouse dies will be entitled to receive special bereavement payments for the next seven fortnightly pension days. These payments will be set at the same total pension rate as the couple was receiving before the death. The surviving partner will have the option of immediately transferring to the single rate of pension and receiving the additional entitlement as a lump sum to meet pressing financial commitments. In addition, from April 1990 annuities will be made more attractive and the social security and veterans pension income tests will be amended so that that part of an annuity which is a refund of the after tax purchase price will be disregarded. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated, there are significant benefits in this Budget and the April statement for people currently retired on superannuation. Perhaps I could just give some figures of what would be the annual increase in income of a typical superannuated couple. If, for example, the husband-and it is usually the husband-of the couple is receiving superannuation of $5,000 a year, with the tax changes coming out of this Budget that family will have an increase in income over the year of $1,001.75. For a couple on superannuation of $10,000 a year-these, of course, are all getting part pension as well-their increase in income will be $947.70. For a couple on superannuation of $15,000, their increase in income will be $799. On superannuation of $20,000, their increase in income for the 1989-90 year will be $929.10, and for a couple on superannuation of $25,000, who still are eligible for part pension, their increase in income will be $966.60. They are substantial increases in annual income and give the lie to the claims made by many people that this Budget contains nothing for people who are currently retired and on superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to turn now to another aspect of the Budget but one still within the retirement income area, and that is the provision by the Department of Social Security for retired people, particularly people who are getting some sort of pension, of an information service. In our travels around the country a great deal of confusion was expressed by retired people about just what their entitlements were and to what extent extra income would affect their pensions. There was a difficulty in getting reliable information from the Department of Social Security. That was not the Department's fault; there simply were not the resources or the expertise within regional offices, or anywhere for that matter, to provide that sort of information. I know that in Adelaide, for example, there were two people in the policy section of the Department of Social Security in the city whose job it was to provide that kind of advice. They spent most of their time advising financial advisers and had very little time actually to advise clients of the Department of Social Security. As a result of this Budget extra resources, extra facilities, will be given to regional and area offices of the Department of Social Security to enable them to provide reliable and useful information to retired people about what their pension entitlements are and what their options are. I very much welcome that change. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention the benefits in this Budget for older unemployed people. I am sure that, like myself, many members are visited occasionally by people in their fifties or sixties who are unemployed for some reason but who are not eligible to receive an age pension. These people are generally in a great predicament because of the difficulty they have at that age in getting employment, combined with the lack of dignity they suffer in many cases through the discrimination which is still shown by many employers against people aged 55 or more. A $10m a year package has been included in this Budget to improve income support and work opportunities for unemployed people aged 55 years and over. I welcome that measure. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I would like to mention in the few minutes I have is the significance for women of certain aspects of the retirement incomes policy. Women traditionally do not take out superannuation, for various reasons: in the past, often because they have actually not been able to-they have been actively discriminated against; and also because of the broken pattern of their working lives and the fact that often they tend to be working part time. They have not been encouraged or been able to take out superannuation and provide in any way for their retirement. Therefore they have been much more dependent than men on a social security pension. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget provides for certain elements which will improve the position of women as regards superannuation. Those working as few as 10 hours a week will be able to contribute to a superannuation scheme and receive a tax deduction. Those leaving the work force may continue to contribute towards their superannuation for up to two years. This, presumably, is aimed at women on maternity leave. There will be changes in the way the maximum benefit is calculated which will help those with low or varied income levels. It will take as a benchmark $25,000 or a worker's highest salary level over three years, not just the pre-retirement level if it is above this. This advantages women, whose incomes often fall as they get older and few earn over $25,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I and many other members of this Government are very proud of what this Government and the Australian Labor Party have done to provide to women in the work force equal opportunity for employment and equal pay for equal work. I see this as being a kind of culmination of that policy. Not only are we getting women into the work force and seeing that they get a fair go, but we are also making sure that they are given the opportunity to provide for their retirement, so that when they finish in paid employment they have the same opportunity as men to have a comfortable and independent retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that other members of the Government will talk on other aspects of the Budget, but I would particularly like to commend the Government and the Treasurer for those aspects of the Budget dealing with retirement incomes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, along with other members who have commented on this matter today, I congratulate you on your election to the high office of Speaker and wish you well for the period that you occupy that office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Budget presented two weeks ago by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) gave the Australian people little hope of any relief from their now lengthy financial sufferance. When one lays aside the Hawke Government's fulsome rhetoric and examines the nuts and bolts of this latest Budget, the truth becomes starkly clear. This Budget makes absolutely no attempt to address the very worrying fundamental economic problems now afflicting our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government in its Budget promises no relief from the very high interest rates under which we have been struggling to survive for so long. The Budget confirms that the Hawke Government has little understanding of the massive burden that high interest rates inflict upon those Australian families trying desperately to pay off a mortgage on their home. Indeed, the Westpac Banking Corporation's Consumer Banking Manager, Mr John Morris, recently said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Budget completely re-affirmed no downward movements this calendar year and they would be looking at the end of March before we would see any variation downwards in housing rates. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Morris went on to say that the fall, when it comes, would only bring interest rates back to about 16 per cent, with last year's low of 13.5 per cent `way over the horizon'. As well as not addressing the high interest rate problem, the Budget fails to develop even a basic anti-inflationary strategy and it also fails to develop a coherent and effective strategy for increasing our productivity and exports. To compound matters, the Budget fails dismally to map out an effective strategy for reducing our total debt. It fails to encourage Australians to save and it very definitely threatens Australia with a recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The abject failure by this Government to tackle our appalling foreign debt problem-now $110 billion in net terms-is the principal reason why the international credit rating agency, Moody's Investors Service Inc., has downgraded Australia's credit rating from AA1 to AA2. This puts Australia's credit rating at the same level as that of Spain. This downgrading alone stands as a terrible indictment of the ineptitude in economic management displayed by the Treasurer and the Government of which he is a part. Furthermore, the huge $9.1 billion surplus so lauded by the Hawke Government and certain commentators is a monument, not to the great economic management of the Government, as it would have us believe, but to the greatest tax rip-off ever perpetrated against the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Grim Reaper's rapacious tax harvest of the hard earned wages and salaries of battling Australians has meant that nearly 50 per cent of taxpayers now face a marginal tax rate of 40 per cent, compared with 30 per cent in the last year of the Fraser Liberal Government. The only reputation that this Budget confirms is that the Hawke Government remains the highest taxing government since the Second World War and that, next to very expensive antique French clocks, the Treasurer's only other interest is bracket creep. Bracket creep alone will claw back 50 per cent of the 1 July tax cuts this year and almost all within the next 12 months. Indeed, if one looks at Budget Paper No. 2, one finds that the estimate of pay as you earn (PAYE) receipts for 1989-90 is $40.4 billion or $2,381.77 per capita. When one compares that with actual PAYE receipts for 1988-89, one finds that the total was $38.5 billion or $2,309.57 per capita. One can therefore see that already the Government is expecting to rip a further $1.9 billion in tax from individual Australians and a great deal of that will be through the insidious instrument of bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget contains yet further tax imposts on Australian companies. The Treasurer requires that 85 per cent of company tax is now to be payable 15 days after the income year, with the remainder payable nine months later. This policy change will adversely affect the liquidity of thousands of companies, resulting in the need to borrow further in a time of horrifically high interest rates. Furthermore, beginning on 1 December this year, companies with annual PAYE remittances exceeding $5m will be required to remit tax instalment deductions from wages and salaries twice monthly rather than monthly, which again will force companies to borrow money. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's message is always the same: Australian families, the private sector and the States must pay through the nose whilst little or no restraint is shown by the Commonwealth in its own spending programs. Additionally, the need to increase production and productivity is not, as it should be, comprehensively addressed in the Budget. For two or more years we have watched and listened to the Government on its soapbox verbalising about the crucial need for micro-economic reform, yet our wharves and coastal shipping remain among the least efficient in the industrialised world. The Budget will do nothing to improve our competitiveness, nothing to bring about micro-economic reform, and nothing to free up the labour market. What it will do is ensure that inflation remains high, that interest rates remain high and that, with the Hawke Government in office, high taxes are here to stay. The Government's pathological agenda to force Australian families to the wall is reinforced under this Budget. By the end of this year a family in receipt of average weekly earnings and with two children will be about $56 worse off than when Labor came to power over six years ago. This does not take into consideration higher mortgage interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time remaining to me I wish to concentrate on an issue that will impact upon the balance of payments. As we all know, one of our greatest problems is that we are importing more than we are exporting. Put very simply, this fuels our foreign debt problem which in turn flows on throughout the system to affect the standard of living of each and every one of us. In his Budget Speech the Treasurer predicted that the current account deficit would blow out this year to $18.5 billion. For a number of years the Government, through the Australian Customs Service, has known the quantity and value, almost to the last cent, of every item imported into this country. This is because every item imported into Australia is logged on a Customs computer system and downloaded to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). As a result, the import figures published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics have been accurate. However, the same cannot be said for our export figures. The current system of recording exports is known as the exporter return scheme. Again, this is run by the Australian Customs Service. Under this scheme an exporter first exports his product. After the export item has physically left the country, he or she submits the paperwork containing the full information on the item exported, such as quantity and value. On receipt of this information the Customs Service promulgates it and ensures that the ABS receives it for inclusion in its statistics. The exporter return scheme has failed. It does not accurately record the quantity and value of Australian exports. I wonder how many honourable members have heard of an export reporting scheme called the EXIT scheme or, to give it its full name, the exports integration scheme?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Tim Fischer" NAMEID="DG4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KD4">Mr ALDRED</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is something that the Government has hoped will prevent a disaster. I would think that not many honourable members would have heard of this EXIT scheme. The EXIT scheme is a major new initiative to record accurately the quantity and value, down to the last cent, of every export item leaving Australia's shores. It involves the Government repealing the legislation covering the exporter return scheme and introducing new legislation to cover the EXIT scheme. The projected dates of effect for this to occur are 30 September and 1 October respectively. Despite this major new initiative-an initiative requiring new legislation and an initiative that will have an enormous effect on the accurate reporting of our exports-I can find no record of any utterances by any Government Minister on the imminent implementation of the EXIT scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It might help honourable members if I give a brief thumbnail sketch of how the EXIT scheme will function. Essentially, EXIT means that no item will be able to leave Australia's shores without first having the quantity and value of the item or items recorded. To be fully integrated into the EXIT scheme, a company involved in exporting will need to have a computer with a modem facility to allow it to hook up to the Customs EXIT network. </PARA>
<PARA> The system will work like this. Exporters or their agents, after initiating all necessary arrangements for shipping their goods, will apply to Customs for pre-clearance of the consignment. Their application will contain details on the quantity and value of the goods to be exported and the application for pre-clearance will be made electronically using the EXIT network. The application information will then be checked automatically by the Customs mainframe computer against pre-set parameters and an export clearance number will be returned automatically to the sender, along with any Customs requirements, such as the need to examine the goods. When the time arrives to physically export the goods, the exporter will take them to the point of departure-say, for instance, the Melbourne docks. On the docks it will be necessary for the shipper to compile an electronic manifest which must include an export clearance number for every item that is loaded for export. The EXIT computer systems will then automatically check the validity of each export clearance number of the goods listed on the manifest. No-I repeat no-item may physically depart Australia without an export clearance number. After clearance of the manifest, all export clearance number information, plus departure details, will be forwarded electronically to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Why EXIT? Let me quote from an Australian Customs Service document that is being circulated among Australian exporters. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past two years Australia's exports have been the focus of Government and media attention. </PARA>
<PARA>Later the document goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Several weaknesses are inherent in the current system for recording and reporting export cargo. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason appearing at the top of the list states:</PARA>
<PARA> Failure to report significant quantities of exports. </PARA>
<PARA>The words `significant quantities' are the words of the Australian Customs Service, the very organisation in the best position to know exactly what is going on. Just exactly how significant `significant' is, I have been unable to determine. However, given that the Government has given the green light to the implementation of the EXIT scheme, it would be a better than evens bet that it would have a fair idea of just how much in dollar terms is currently being exported without being reported and therefore not appearing in the balance of payments figures issued by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Customs estimate that at present approximately one-third of companies involved in exporting are currently participating in the EXIT scheme and by 1 October it hopes to have all companies plugged in. I am given to understand that there are still problems being ironed out with the EXIT scheme and these may take a little time to sort out fully. Additionally, there are also logistical delays in getting companies into the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that all new systems, particularly high technology systems, are susceptible to technical problems when they are introduced, and given that companies involved will take some time to become fully acquainted with the EXIT scheme, it seems reasonable to believe that the first fully comprehensive and accurate export statistics, with no significant reporting failures, will begin to be published towards the end of this year or early next year. On top of this it must be borne in mind that reputable economists, such as the Access Economics Consultancy Group, are saying that the Government's tight monetary policy is now causing a decline in spending which will cause a fall in imports. Furthermore, the same economists are also expecting that there will be rises in the volume of commodity exports sold, thus improving our trade position this year and next. Whilst I am in favour of any initiative that will provide more timely and accurate export statistics, the political advantage that I believe the Hawke Government is waiting to exploit is obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that housing interest rates are expected to fall around March next year. When this is coupled with the expected improvement in our trade position and the effect that the EXIT scheme can be expected to have on our export figures-that is, recording the significant quantities that are currently not being recorded-we see that the climate for an election becomes the warmer some time just after March next year. This House, the Australian people, and particularly the press gallery, should all be aware that as from the coming 1 October there is a very real possibility that an increasingly beleagured and cynical Hawke Government could use what are essentially falsely inflated export figures to hoodwink the nation into believing that it has at last turned the economy around. The statistical subterfuge being attempted by this Labor Government is a classic illustration of what the great British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli once warned of. Disreali stated: `There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics'. However, I do believe that the electorate has had enough of the Government trying to paper over hard economic realities through superficial statistical manipulation. Australians today are politically and economically more attuned and more perceptive than the Government gives them credit for. Therefore, the EXIT scheme will not save this dying Government from its own completely unlamented and long overdue exit from office. In conclusion, I seek leave to table the Australian Customs Service document concerning the EXIT scheme that I referred to earlier. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90, I want to make a couple of points about the comments of the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred). I am not quite sure what he was saying regarding the exports integration scheme, or EXIT, recording our actual export products. If he is saying that for the first time we will have accurate figures which may show that some of our estimates of exports have been wrong and that is a distortion of the truth, I am not quite sure whether his summary actually fills the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He also said that this is the highest taxing Government and that bracket creep will take away many benefits that have been provided through the April tax benefits. It is quite amazing for a member of the previous Government, which developed tax evasion as the only growth industry during that period, to come in here and argue that our program of tax reform should be criticised. Members of the previous Government allowed all sorts of tax rorts to exist throughout the community, and the wealthy and those who were capable of manipulating their incomes avoided paying tax, thus pushing the burden onto the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer, and they come in here and criticise us. We have been in office for almost seven years and we have reformed the tax system and ensured that there is a fairer tax system. People who were previously not paying their tax are now paying. With the introduction of the capital gains tax, the fringe benefits tax and the withholding tax and now the tax file number system, we are ensuring that those people who were evading their responsibility in terms of contributing to the cost of running the country are now paying their tax. The reason members of the previous Government are so critical of our reforms is that for the first time most of their mates are now having to pay genuine tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The announced reforms of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) do not allow companies to continue to hold money that belongs to the Commonwealth in the form of collected tax revenue longer than is necessary. This Government is being criticised because it is making people forward the tax that has already been collected more quickly than they have done in the past. It seems to me that these are ridiculous arguments to be coming forward. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to bracket creep, it has also been alleged that benefits provided in the form of tax cuts earlier this year will be lost, as if in some way this Government has developed bracket creep, that it was its idea, some sneaky concept that it introduced into the system. We should remember that bracket creep is a result of inflation. It is a process which has been in existence ever since governments began collecting taxation. The honourable member for Bruce would know that the coalition parties, which have been in government for some 23 of those 30 years, have had plenty of opportunity to correct what he calls `this iniquitous and terrible crime'. They have had plenty of opportunity to correct it, but they have never done so. They know that there are several ways of dealing with bracket creep. One is to look at indexation, which they have argued for, and the other is to reform the tax system from time to time or to introduce tax cuts, which is the traditional process undertaken by both sides of the House. The honourable member for Bruce knows that the April tax cuts that we introduced were more than compensation for the inflationary effects that existed from 1983 to 1988. So his argument there is also nonsense. This process has been in existence for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member alleged that this Government has done nothing about borrowings. This Government has repaid more foreign debt than any government in the past. He would remember that in 1983, under the previous Government, we had borrowings in the order of 22 per cent of gross domestic product. According to the Budget Papers, that will be reduced to 13 per cent by 1990. Between 1975-76 and 1982-83, which is the period of the last conservative Government, total net overseas raisings were $4.5 billion. Between 1983-84 and 1988-89, which is the period of this Government, we have repaid in net terms a total of $1.5 billion. So the last conservative Government can be seen as a government that did nothing in terms of looking after the economy. It was the borrower. This Government has turned around and begun repaying the debt that the previous Government incurred. Due to our fiscal management and the amount of debt that we have repaid, we have already saved the community in the order of $2 billion. Our surplus of $9 billion this year will be used to repay further debt. So I think all those arguments show that the Opposition is really clutching at straws when it attempts to criticise us on these sorts of issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted to raise a couple of issues relating to benefits flowing from the Budget; but, more importantly, I wanted to raise one issue which relates to the increase in the postal allowance for members of parliament. A number of honourable members opposite have made public statements and attempted to accuse the Government of utilising funds to manipulate election results. That is an extraordinary argument to be putting forward. When I came into this Parliament in 1983 a member of parliament had two office staff, two telephone lines, a typewriter, a photocopying machine and some 60,000 electors to look after. It is no wonder that members were unable to relate properly to their constituents and to inform them of what was really happening. (Quorum formed) The empty bleatings of members of the Opposition about members' increased postal allowance are just that. Because they choose not to service their electorates and because they do not want constituents to realise how poor they are, they attempt to criticise the processes of this Government. As I was saying, when I came into this Parliament members of parliament had two office staff, a photocopier, a typewriter and two telephone lines. It is no wonder that members of parliament were unable to communicate properly with some 50,000 to 60,000 constituents. Members were hamstrung by an inability to utilise properly the equipment that was around. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Government has been in office it has ensured that all members of parliament-honourable members on both sides of the House-have had a tremendous increase in their capacity to look after their constituents. They now have three staff members, computers, three or four telephone lines, facsimile machines and a huge range of facilities. They have also had an increase in their postal and printing facilities, which means that they now have no excuse for not servicing their electorates. Conservatives will no longer be able to hide away in their offices, not communicating with their constituents. They will have no argument or justification for not communicating with them. Because we have set out to ensure that all honourable members deal responsibly with their constituents, communicate with them and keep them informed of the things that we are doing, the Opposition has started to complain. It is a hollow argument and one that I think should be put aside. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the thing that really irks me most about this matter is the way in which some members of the Opposition have inferred that the money that is being paid for postal services in some way is coming to us as members, as if we have direct access to that cash. They know that it is simply there and available if we happen to send mail to our constituents; if we happen to use available postal services. This allowance is not there for us to misuse; it is simply there to allow us to serve our electorates. I object to the way in which members of the Opposition have falsely bleated about it to the community when they are going to utilise the same allowance. They want to try to discredit the fact that we have increased the services available to members so that they can communicate with electors and look after their electorates in a proper way. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to come back and remind people that when the debate is taking place on this Appropriation Bill, on this Budget, they should keep it in mind that the Budget is really being presented in two parts. There was the April statement, in which many of the benefits such as tax cuts, alterations to the payment of pensions and increases in the pension were all announced, and the Budget, which is really just wrapping up, tidying up the edges in terms of these benefits. So when people are looking at this Budget debate they should keep in mind the debate that occurred with regard to the April statement and remember that the benefits such as tax cuts, increases in the family allowance and pensions, and other such benefits which were announced then are all part of an overall economic package for which the Budget is the second part. I commend the Budget to the House and believe that the community out there will see it for what it is-a Budget of enormous benefits and an example of proper fiscal management. I am sure that the constituency out there, when it comes time to reassess the assessment it made in 1987, will do so in a way which will ensure that this party, the current Government, is going to be returned to these benches. I would not be surprised if we were back here with increased numbers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the 1989 Budget brought down in this House two weeks ago fails to address the fundamental issues facing Australia, given our current economic situation. Inflation continues to run ahead of that for almost every Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nation. Our current account deficit continues to rise; Australia's international debt of $129 billion brings home the stark reality of our dependence upon foreign money. Productivity in Australia compared to other developed countries is low. Bracket creep for individual taxpayers continues to bite. Australia's inflexible industrial relations system ensures its competitive ability is considerably reduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst the $9 billion surplus which the Budget indicates for the next financial year is commendable in itself, a closer examination of the background facts reveals the reason why such a surplus exists. It is largely a result of bracket creep and the accounting adjustments between the last financial year and the current financial year to date. Obviously the Treasurer (Mr Keating), in bringing down a surplus, has been trying to influence the international money markets to give the impression of economic responsibility. Only time will tell whether international financiers will continue to support such a precarious debt and current account situation. </PARA>
<PARA> While individual taxpayers believe they obtained some relief from the 1 July tax cuts, as always there is some sleight of hand in that proposal. In one year, half these tax cuts will be gobbled up by bracket creep and within the following 12 months Australian taxpayers will be no better off. The Treasurer has carefully targeted those vulnerable groups within the $12,500 to $17,650 income groups whose tax rates have been reduced from 29c in the dollar to 21c. Likewise, those persons on the income tax scale between $19,200 and $20,600 have had a substantial reduction in their tax rates, from 40c to 29c in the dollar. It should be said from the outset that these small tax cuts across the board offer little incentive for Australians to work harder. </PARA>
<PARA> Out in the electorate there is little reason for individual workers to work overtime, or even raise their productivity, because of the high marginal rates of tax. In the Budget as presented by the Treasurer, individual pay as you earn taxpayers provide 54.3 per cent of the Budget's total income, while companies contribute 11.8 per cent to the total revenue. These figures alone indicate the uneven nature of government revenues in that individuals and companies provide 65 per cent of the total Federal Government revenue. The most disturbing feature of the Budget is the forecast for inflation in the current financial year of 7 1/2 per cent. As all Australians will be fully aware, last year's inflation rate of 7 per cent, after a Budget estimate of 4 1/2 per cent, was an economic disaster for those in low income groups and those on fixed incomes. It also impacted severely on those export industries trying to increase Australia's competitive position with other trading nations in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA> A comparison with inflation rates in other countries makes our very uncompetitive and deteriorating position all too clear. I pause to reflect on the inflation rates in other OECD countries as at June 1989: United States of America, 5 per cent; Japan, 1 1/2 per cent; Canada, 4 1/4 per cent; four major OECD countries in Europe, 4 1/4 per cent; and the United Kingdom, 6 1/4 per cent. Our precarious position is all the more disturbing when one looks at the current estimates for inflation over the next six months of 7 1/2 per cent. There has been no allowance made for industrial relations catastrophes such as the current pilots strike, or the possibility of a major wages breakout which could blow these predictions completely off target. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to move to the Budget Papers and the basis of Treasury's major assumptions in putting the Budget together for the current year. In passing I would like to compliment Treasury officials on the outstanding job they have done in putting the Budget Papers together, in making the figures understandable and presenting a clear and cogent picture of the Australian economy and the Government's Forward Estimates. The basic assumptions upon which the Budget is predicated do not stand up to a clinical assessment. The first assumption is that growth will be down in the OECD and Asian countries from 5 per cent to 4 1/2 per cent in 1989-90. Commentators around the world are very concerned about the impact of a soft or hard landing in the United States economy and its problems with inflation. Both the internal and external deficits run up by the Reagan Administration could impact severely on this assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> The next major assumption is that Australia's trading partners will have an inflation rate of 4 1/2 per cent and, as I indicated earlier, this compares unfavourably with Australia's projected inflation rate of 7 1/2 per cent. The third basic assumption by the Treasurer is that growth in world trade will be down from 8 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent in the forecast year of 1989-90. At a time when commodity prices have enjoyed buoyant levels this could have a major effect on our export revenue which in turn would not help our current account deficit problem. The fourth assumption is that overseas nominal interest rates will remain at 1989-90 levels, and whilst they remain substantially below rates in Australia this will have the effect of ensuring a flow of funds to Australia's higher interest rate regime. The fifth assumption is that monetary policy will remain tight, with high interest rates being maintained in the short term. The consequent effect will be that the productive elements of the Australian economy will continue to suffer under the 20 to 21 per cent interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The next major assumption is that the exchange rate will remain at 58 on the trade weighted index and that the American dollar will be worth 75c Australian. On this assumption the exchange rate will do nothing to help our exporters and, more likely, will further encourage imports. Moreover, the continued high interest rate policy of the Treasurer will prop up the exchange rate to curtail further the ability of our exporters to compete. The next assumption is that the Industrial Relations Commission will be able to control wages, bringing about two instalments of 3 per cent over the next 12 months. Most commentators would agree that the accord has failed and that the likelihood of a wages breakout is imminent. The trade union movement is struggling desperately to maintain the system despite the fact that the union movement enjoys only 32 per cent membership of the total work force. Whilst the furphy of union restructuring in minimum award rates represents the major hurdle facing the union movement at present, the flexibility of our labour market has been further hampered by industrial arrangements organised under our present centralised system. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the few aspects of the Budget which the Opposition agrees with is a recognition of the role of superannuation in providing capital in the longer term for all Australians. The Treasurer has made an assumption that there will be a build-up in capital through superannuation arrangements. In his judgment, these benefits will become operative in 1992-when the coalition will be in government. His forethought is commendable. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the key issue currently facing all Australians is why interest rates are so high. Hardworking Australians find it difficult to understand why interest rates are running at record levels when the Treasurer continues to insist that the economy is under control. Yet interest rates for bank overdrafts remain between 19 and 20 per cent and home loan mortgage rates are running at between 17 and 18 per cent. It would appear to them that there is plenty of credit available, yet for some reason interest rates have been manipulated to suit the policy objectives of this Government, with quite devastating effects on individuals with large overdrafts or house mortgages. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VH4">Mr McARTHUR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are absolutely right. This raises the issue of credit availability and the money supply. Historically, this has been a complicated question, and with a deregulated market the various measures of money supply have become increasingly difficult to determine with any accuracy. In Australia the matter has been addressed by Mr Ian McFarlane, head of research for the Reserve Bank of Australia. In a paper delivered in April 1989 he makes the comment that there are measurement difficulties in the M1 and M3 money supply criteria. He observes that from 1983 to 1988, using these two measures, money supply increased at an annual rate of 12.5 per cent. He also observes that, from statistical information available, bank credit expanded by 23.8 per cent over the same period while other institutional forms of credit expanded by 21.6 per cent annually. Mr McFarlane also states that, in his view, worldwide inflation began spiralling significantly during the 1970s. Throughout this period fast monetary growth was coupled with low interest rates. Over the last five years, however, real and nominal interest rates have been much higher than they were during the 1970s. He poses this question, which concerns every elector throughout Australia: Why is there so much credit available, and how is it affecting the national economy? His view is that it is the natural result of two decades of high inflation and the interaction between inflation and the tax system. In such a high inflationary environment there are major advantages of increased debt over equity. As we have all seen from a cursory glance at the stock market and other forms of business investment, entrepreneurs have used highly geared companies to create wealth for themselves and their shareholders via this medium.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The United Kingdom provides a stark example of the problems of extended money supply. In the Wall Street Journal of March 1989, Mr Congdon, a London economics adviser, draws attention to the Thatcher Government's strict control of the money supply between 1979 and 1986, during which time it gained international credibility in controlling inflation. During this six-year period the money supply was held at an average growth rate of 10 per cent. In line with this policy, the constant rate of inflation was 5 per cent. However, from mid-1985 to mid-1989 the money supply doubled to 20 per cent per annum. In 1985 the United Kingdom experienced a surplus balance of payments of one per cent of gross domestic product, yet by 1988 this surplus had become a deficit of 3.5 per cent of GDP. Mr Congdon makes the policy observation:</PARA>
<PARA>Sustained money control is an essential condition for a reduction in inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Recent economic policy in Britain has therefore one simple message for other countries: sustained monetary control is an essential condition for sustained reduction in inflation. It is a message that the Treasurer could well take on board. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the House to an article by Max Newton in the Australian today. He drew attention to the problems in America with the blow-out in the money supply from the years 1971 to 1981 while inflation remained very high. From 1981 to 1989 there was a cut in the money supply because of a change of policy by the United States Treasury and the inflation factor fell. We therefore see two countries where the attitude towards money supply has been effective and has had a major effect on the inflationary factor. </PARA>
<PARA> The credibility of the 1989 Budget has been severely reduced. There have been two important reports, one as recently as this morning. We saw, firstly, the Reserve Bank's very carefully worded statement about Australia's present economic situation and, secondly, the downgrading this afternoon of Australia's international credit rating from AA1 to AA2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. earlier. Both reports reflect the lack of credibility in the Budget and the way in which the economy is being managed by the Treasurer and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The two reports are complementary in their indictment of the current financial problems facing Australia and the future build-up of debt which is a direct result of the Treasurer's lax monetary and fiscal approach. Moody's emphasised the large and continuing current account deficit and indicated that Australia's debt servicing ratio has fallen out of line with other AA1 rated countries since the last downgrade in September 1986. The factors which Moody's consider to be crucial to this rating action include the following: the Government's inability to control excessive demand growth; insufficient progress in generating sufficient exporting capacity and restructuring industry to achieve productivity gains; and the continued slow pace of structural adjustment which, in its view, makes Australia ill positioned to weather the next downturn in the global business cycle without further large increases in foreign currency debt. In simple words, Moody's are advising overseas creditors that Australia is not a good risk because of its continued current account deficit problems and mounting national debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank makes crystal clear its own view of the policy framework upon which the Government is operating and the attendant risks ahead. Its report is a very carefully worded document and supports the Opposition's claims that the economy is overheated, inflation is too high, monetary policy is only one mechanism to control the economy, interest rates are a problem, and the current account deficit is too high. I will quote from a section of that carefully worded report, which has been mentioned in the Parliament today, indicating that domestic spending has been too great and the current account deficit is too big. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Private spending grew much more rapidly in 1988-89than had been expected. This led to a severe pressure on resources in some parts of the economy, concern at the emergence of stronger inflationary pressures, and a further deterioration in the current account deficit. Though Australia's economic growth in that year was high, it was more than accounted for by domestic demand; net exports fell. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer himself in his Budget Speech agreed with that proposition when he said that national spending increased by 8 per cent. However, national production increased by only 4 per cent, and the gap was our import bill. The Reserve Bank also indicates the bad effects of high interest rates on productive investments. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>On its own, monetary policy will not produce the longer-term structural benefits Australia is seeking. Beyond a point, it may even inhibit the structural change because of the effect of high interest rates on investment of all types. Nevertheless, monetary policy has an essential role in supporting structural reform. </PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank makes the comment that Australia needs to be more competitive and to export more goods and services. We need to create a savings environment and borrow less from abroad. I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia needs a major shift of resources into the traded goods sector to stimulate increased exports and, more importantly, to replace imports. This cannot be achieved if domestic demand is growing faster than productive capacity; but simply slowing demand is not enough either. There is also a need for greater productive capacity, improved productivity and a better overall price performance, at least as good as our competitors. We need also, if possible, to fund a greater proportion of our investment from our own resources and not by borrowing abroad; in other words, more savings, less consumption. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on with this very critical comment:</PARA>
<PARA>Restructuring is more difficult, even impossible, in a high inflation environment which destroys competitiveness and discourages savings. </PARA>
<PARA>The coalition wishes to bring about when it is in government a more productive culture, an industrial relations environment where management and the work force can bring about their own agreements and remove the third party arrangements of the Industrial Relations Commission. When in government the coalition will control inflation, introduce a two-tier tax system and reduce the incidence of bracket creep on individual Australians. It will control the money supply, reduce interest rates and reduce the overseas debt commitment. It will reduce the current account deficit and make sure that Australia exports more and imports less. Under a coalition government the exchange rate will be such as to encourage exporters. It will provide incentive for operators to export goods and services on behalf of all Australians. A coalition government will cut government expenditure and the level of tax on individuals and companies so that they will work harder, take risks and be more efficient and competitive. When it comes to government the coalition will address all those issues and put Australia back on the road to economic prosperity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member is jumping up and down like a golliwog. Let us look at the previous Government's record so that we can see how good the Opposition blokes were. In 1975 they seized power and the one standard they set for themselves-the one thing they said they would do-was to beat inflation. They said that if they fought inflation first every other problem would disappear. When those opposite assumed office the inflation rate was about 11 per cent and it was about the same when they left office. By the standards they set themselves, they were a complete failure. They would have given their right arm for the inflation rate which we have now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Corangamite talked about controlling inflation, but how would he do that? He did not say one word about how he would control inflation. He said that a coalition government would do all sorts of wonderful things, such as reducing our overseas debt. How would it do that? Not one word has been said about how it would reduce our overseas debt. Looking at Commonwealth debt, the Hawke Government is the only government that has repaid debt. The tories, when in power, were the people who racked up debt. One does not have to go too far back to find out about their addition to our debt. As we all found out two days after the election, the last Liberal Budget-if we had allowed it to go ahead-would have added close on $10,000m to our debt. That is the sort of fiscal policy which the Liberals ran. They were prepared to mortgage this country's future in one last ditch attempt to hang on to office, and they failed. They say that they will reduce our overseas debt, but they do not say one word about how they will do it. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed that a couple of times in his contribution the honourable member said that people would work harder. (Quorum formed) One of the redeeming features about calling a quorum is that it brings quality members into the chamber and leaves all the dopes outside. Before I was rudely interrupted, I was saying that the honourable member for Corangamite said that people would work harder. Those in the Liberal Party have never learnt that what they should be doing nowadays is working smarter. We can work as hard as we like, but if we cannot add value to products we are not being very smart. That comes through all the time in the speeches, the old rhetoric, of those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member spoke about the lax monetary and fiscal policy of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). A lax monetary and fiscal policy? We have a Budget surplus of $9.1 billion, which is the biggest this country has ever had, but that is too lax for those opposite. You would have noticed, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the honourable member said not one word about how they would increase the surplus. One can only read into the honourable member's speech that if we have lax monetary policy it has to be tightened up somewhat more, which means higher interest rates. But that was all glossed over and at the end there was a wish list of how the Liberal Party would control inflation, reduce our overseas debt, control our exchange rate-going back to the days when government used to control it-and control government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of government spending, this year the Government has taken our level of spending back to that of the 1970s and, as the Treasurer pointed out, next year we will be back to the mid-1950s level. That is something which the tories were never able to do. Tory governments were always big spending governments. They always borrowed more than they collected in taxes, believing that some other government would have to pay it off. This Government is doing that for them. However, the people in voterland can see through the Liberals. Every time the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) pokes his head up and states what the Liberals will do or goes on television and says anything about economics, our votes go up. We start looking good because the Leader of the Opposition has taken the advice of the Premier of New South Wales to be vague-as if he needed that advice. When the Liberals appear on television and are asked, `What are you going to do about this?', they say, `We will tell you when the time is right'. When they are asked, `Do you have a tax policy?', they reply, `Yes, it is in the top drawer'. Every time they open their mouths there is a different interpretation of their tax policy. I do not think they have one. In the 1987 election it was discovered that the Liberals did not have a tax policy because it was effectively destroyed by the Treasurer when they brought it out. </PARA>
<PARA> I took the time to get the Liberals a tax policy based on their statements. According to the statements of some of their senior spokesmen, it will be a flatter, two-rate policy, the Budget surplus has to be larger, and a reduction in personal tax rates effectively will come from savings to be made in the Budget. That was a very crucial admission by the Leader of the Opposition. When one takes all of those statements and tries to make some sense out of it, then this is a likely scenario. I would assume that the bottom tax rate, which we have reduced from about 30c in the dollar back to 21c, will stay; that in actual fact, when the Liberal Party announces its policy, the 21c will be the bottom tax rate. I also assume, from the contribution of the Leader of the Opposition in his reply to the Budget, that the top tax rate will be 39c, the same as the company tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of bringing those reductions in is put by the Parliamentary Library at $9.5 billion-that is, nine and a half thousand million dollars. How does one get there? Of course, we will never hear from the Opposition one word about how they are going to make those cuts. Here is a likely scenario. It is not an exhaustive list, but it is a list that will get us to $9.5 billion. The first thing that it could do is sack half the Public Service. If the coalition sacks one in two of the Public Service, $4.5 billion could be saved-that is, wages and running costs. Of course, the service that the Public Service gives to Australians will be somewhat diminished, but the savings are there. Australians will have to queue up in queues that are a lot longer. They will not get the excellent service that they now get from the Public Service, but we will save $4.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> We could also eliminate the family assistance supplement (FAS), which, of course, goes to low income families, and we could eliminate Austudy. Getting rid of those two things will save $1.5 billion, so we are up to $6 billion now. But, of course, we notice that the FAS and Austudy are going to low income earners. The third thing that could be done by the coalition is to save $2 billion on age pensions. All the Opposition really has to do is to go back to where they had the pension rate when they were kicked out of office. What that would mean is a cut of $13.30 per week in the standard rate and $11.50 per week in the married rate. So, if the Opposition were to wind back age pensions, as they did when they were in office before, that would save them $2 billion. We are up to $8 billion now. Just to round it off to $9.5 billion, what they could also do, of course, is wipe out 150,000 tertiary education places. There is the $9.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> You will notice one thing about that, Mr Deputy Speaker, and that is that the benefits, by and large, will flow to people on high incomes. They are the people who will gain the most benefit because the top tax rate will be reduced. That could be brought from 47c down to 39c and those two tax rates in between could be eliminated. That, of course, has some benefit for people on middle incomes but none for people on low incomes. Of course, high income earners are the beneficiaries of that sort of approach to taxation reform. But the cost is borne by people on low incomes. Therefore, based on the public statements of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer (Dr Hewson)-and one could throw in Mr Elliott, who reckons we spend too much on social welfare, and Senator Stone, who has a like view-these estimated savings that I put to the House tonight square with their comments too, because what we are doing is cutting the social welfare bill. Of course, the Liberals say it is too high. Everything I have put to the House tonight fits squarely with the public statements of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the sort of detail that the people of Australia are entitled to. If we get Opposition spokesmen running around this country talking about lowering tax rates, having a flatter two-rate tax system, and saying that we are spending too much on welfare, let them spell it out. Let Opposition members tell the people of Australia what they are going to do, and not fudge it, not be vague, not say, `In the fullness of time we will tell the people'. We have all learnt about that. The Opposition's taxation policy was supposed to be out last August. It is a year on now and we still have not seen it. The Leader of the Opposition tells us it will be announced at the end of September, and we are all awaiting that with bated breath. But there will not be too much detail in it. There will be a lot of platitudes. They will take all the pluses but they will not cop the negatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that out in the electorate it will not wash, because the people out there are a lot smarter because this Government has been in office. It is very hard, I suppose, to go back to 1983 and have a look at the sort of information that was given to electors via the news media back then. Certainly, since deregulation of the banking sector and the floating of the exchange rate, people now are getting economic comment every day. The balance of payments is always topical news, as is the inflation rate, and other economic indicators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what is putting a nail in the Opposition's coffin. The simple fact is that the Opposition has to have an answer to it. At least the Government has a strategy for attacking the problem. The fact is that the Opposition cannot fudge it any more. When the Leader of the Opposition is asked questions on Sydney radio, as he was two months ago, and a flood of calls comes into that radio station complaining about the fact that the Leader of the Opposition did not answer the listeners' questions, you have to take some notice of that. The listeners out there are not mugs. People in the Australian electorate are not mugs. What they really want from the Opposition is a bit of detail. I have told you the sort of detail that the Opposition should be putting in its taxation policy. Of course, we will never ever get that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Corangamite talked about the wages blow-out and said that the accord has failed. We have heard every year that the accord has failed. It is amazing that it is still there. As to wages, look at the industrial dispute involving pilots. One really has to look at Australian society to see where the impetus for the wages break-out comes, whether it is from the blue-collar workers and the tradesmen working in the industry of this country, or whether it is from the top sector, from pilots who are earning $100,000 a year but who want $30,000 more. The people who are failing this country are not the workers; they are those greedy people at the top who really are causing this country a lot of harm and distress. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing I would like to touch on is the lack of a health policy by the Opposition. This is the other area that is of great importance to the Australian people. This Government has had Medicare since 1984. For five years now we have had a stable health insurance system. There are sections of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) who have never ever seen Medicare for what it is-the best health insurance system that this country has ever had. The reason it is so good is that it is universal. That is something the Opposition could never promise, something it never had in all the six schemes that it had when in government and the five or six schemes that it has had in opposition. We have never heard one word recently about the Opposition's health insurance scheme. But there are some indicators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is saying that it will have a private scheme. Opposition members have learnt nothing from the past. Forgetting about health delivery, the criterion by which health insurance should be measured is the amount of contributor's dollar that gets to paying medical bills. That is the only measure. With Medicare, 96c in the dollar goes towards paying medical bills; 4 per cent goes in administration. This must be compared with the private insurance schemes that existed in this country prior to Medicare. Their rate was 86c. A huge 14 per cent was consumed in administration, in duplication and all of the advertising we saw around the place. It is not good enough to go back to a system like that. Yet one fears that Opposition members have learnt nothing. When they release their health insurance scheme we will see a trip back in the time tunnel to the bad old days of private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The AMA would welcome private health insurance. It seems to think there is something wrong with taking money from Medicare or from the Government. It is a view that has never been shared by Qantas or Australian Airlines pilots accepting government money, and I have yet to read of any specialist or medical practitioner that sent back his Medicare cheque because it was government money. But the Opposition has learnt nothing about that, and we look forward to the day on which it lets out its health insurance scheme-because it will go back to the bad old days, when two million people in this country did not have health insurance. Medicare is one of those policies I have always been proud to defend, and I have always believed that on the campaign trail it has proved a big winner. I am not going to put myself up as adviser to the Opposition, but certainly one would think that, if honourable members opposite had any commonsense, they would realise after five years that they cannot come up with anything better and that they would embrace Medicare, as the Opposition did in Canada many years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a lot of words from honourable members opposite about what they will do. They are giant killers in opposition. The only thing that limits their ability, of course, is the trip from their side of the chamber to this side. When they get over here they are as useless as they have always been. That is why I believe that when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) calls the election, whenever that is, the people of Australian will see those opposite for the vague sort of people they are and return this Government to office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), on one thing and that is that we cannot take the Australian public for mugs. I cannot help but think that the great bulk of the Australian public is very concerned about the future of Australia, and I think it might be concerned about the way our three major parties and other politicians are handling the situation. That might be a big thing to say, but I believe it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We occupy a country that is rich in resources-people and soil as well as natural resources. Over the last 20 years we have not accepted our responsibilities to tackle the growth and the development of Australia as we should have. This is of very deep concern to many Australians, who have realised in recent years that we have economic problems. Those problems commenced in the early 1970s and were not rectified in the late 1970s or 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something in this debate about the pertinent points in the Budget. I know we are saying something over and over again but it must be said. The issues confronting the Australian people today are those pertinent issues of the economy that related to the national debt, the balance of payments, the inflationary trend and interest rates. These are the issues that worry Australians. Only recently I read an article that referred back to the 1920s. It pointed out that we faced the Great Depression because of low productivity and the national debt. In other words, governments and private enterprise were unable to borrow the money to keep the country going. The article said that the national debt was only #5 per person in 1928-29. </PARA>
<PARA> History repeats itself. If we follow this through we find a build-up in Australia at this time similar to the climax that was reached in 1929. That is pointed up today by what Moody's Investors Service Inc. has said. I take the House back to what the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said in last year's Budget:</PARA>
<PARA>Our foreign debt burden has already stabilised and begun to fall. </PARA>
<PARA>Earlier he had said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . our balance of payments deficit will be halved from its peak of just three years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . CPI should be running at 4 1/2 per cent by the end of the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Our policies are not only lifting the yoke of debt from our necks, they will also lower the burden on the next generation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer went on to say that the Government would secure for Australia an inflation rate of 3 to 4 per cent in 1990. There is no need for me to tell members of this House or the people of Australia how untrue those predictions were, how a year ago the Treasurer led astray and confused the Australian people. He did not produce a Budget that would overcome any of the ills facing the economy at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Is there anything in this year's Budget that will improve the productivity of this country? Let me go back to what I said earlier: the people of this nation are most concerned about the debt of $7,400 on the head of every Australian. As Moody's said this morning, our national debt is now $108 billion. Let us look at those four or five things that the Treasurer said a year ago. He said that the balance of payments would be halved from its peak of just three years ago. He predicted that the balance of payments deficit would be about $9 billion. It is up to over $18 billion. Our inflation trend is almost double what the Treasurer said it would be. Our interest rates are 18 to 22 or 23 per cent. Can any country afford to operate under conditions like these? Again I come back to the fact that we, the members of this House and of the Senate, who have the responsibility to run the affairs of the nation are not measuring up to the expectations of the average decent Australian. We have seen this deterioration as the years have gone on and we will continue to see it while we follow policies such as those the Government currently is adopting. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Canning said, `We haven't seen the colour of your taxation policy'. I hope to goodness that nobody except the people who are drawing it up sees the colour of that for some months, or at least until an election is in the offing. I for one am concerned that at any time we can face a depression in Australia. I do not want to be a pessimist, but, when we compare what happened in the 1920s and what is occurring in the 1980s, there is no room whatsoever for complacency. What would have happened to this country if in the past six or seven years we had not had very favourable seasons? With decent seasons we have been able to sell our produce on favourable markets around the world. At the same time the world economy has been reasonably sound. Because of the interest rates available, millions and millions of dollars are flowing into this country at the present time to be invested for one day, two days, a week or six weeks. This keeps our fiscal policy going in Australia. So the Treasurer and, I am sure, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) have nothing to relax about. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we have to do as a country, as a government, as a parliament, to get ourselves back onto the track again? Firstly, we have to reduce taxation. I am not totally opposed to a consumption tax. I know the Treasurer has taken certain measures that have covered tax avoidance in many fields, for which I give him credit. I do not stand up here to advocate a consumption tax but the notion should be examined closely. It would have to be accompanied by a great reduction in personal taxation. Over the last five or six years total Commonwealth taxation revenue has gone up by over 105 per cent from $44.4 billion in 1983-84 to $91.3 billion in 1989-90. In that short time total individual tax revenue has gone up by a massive 107.7 per cent. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VF4">Mr COWAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that time personal income tax has increased by 107.7 per cent. Who is paying the majority of that? The pay as you earn taxpayer-the very person that this Government represents. It then turns around and gives them $4 billion back, as it did the other day. Then up goes taxation again. Over the same period fuel excise has increased by a staggering 186 per cent. Receipts from the Medicare levy have increased over 600 per cent since it was introduced in 1983-84. Under Labor company tax has increased by nearly 163 per cent. Those are facts. This is what has happened in the last six years. Australian people have been overtaxed. The incentive for them to meet their commitments and to increase productivity have been taken away from them. We have to be concerned about our balance of payments. We have to bring our national debt down and consequently bring our interest rates down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, we must look very closely at the deregulation of our work force. At present we have the accord-an agreement between the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government. We have talked about it on many occasions. The Government cannot deviate from that agreement, irrespective of the pilots strike or whatever. Today we saw the Prime Minister going frantic in this House. He took 20 minutes to answer a question because he was defending that accord. He knows that we must not depart from that accord, otherwise the unions will condemn the Government. What has happened? A person with ability, intelligence and a little bit of efficiency working in a factory does not get any incentive payment for whatever extra he has worked or for what he has produced on the factory floor. One can go to China, Japan and even Russia and Poland to see that the people surrounding machines who work harder to produce things are getting incentives. We have to look at this aspect of the deregulation of our labour force. </PARA>
<PARA> I for one am happy with the policies of the Opposition parties. We will address this mammoth problem in Australia. When we talk about that, we must look at the penalty awards and general awards such as the 17 1/2 per cent holiday pay. We have reached a stage where people will fall over backwards to support a political party that will stand up on decent principles. When I talk about decent principles I mean a party that will stand up and say that people receiving unemployment relief should do some work for their pay. I believe that there is a demand by thinking Australians for national service in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a demand for a change in our immigration policies. We have to make sure that the people we bring into this country can add to our economy. We have to bring in people with the techniques, with the technology and with the necessary knowledge-professional people and tradesmen who can add to our productivity generally. We should really examine our immigration policy. I have no objection to Asian people coming to Australia but I do object to our bringing into Australia people who are non-productive and people who cannot assist us with the great challenge that everyone in this land of ours faces. We have to think of this. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that Taiwan has increased its productivity over a 20-year period. It has increased its tariffs. We are asking the world for free trade. Taiwan put its tariffs up. It developed its industries and it is now producing and investing in other countries around the world. It is 100 times smaller than Australia with 20 million people. It is investing in China and in other countries. We should be welcoming-the Government has to realise this-foreign investment into this country, under certain conditions, to help build our technology and to help increase our productivity. We should be publicising ourselves and saying, `Here we are. We're willing to accept you'. We should bring them in here under conditions favourable to us. I know that it will take a lot of working out but it is possible to build up our production, as other Third World countries are trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA> This country should be on the make. The people of Australia must have more of a nationalistic outlook. We must be prouder of this country than we are. Recently I went to Russia and was amazed to see that there is no graffiti there. There is none in Japan. Its metro train systems are beautiful. Its trains are on time. One has only to look at our metro systems to see the graffiti problem that we have. This is all part and parcel of what is happening to this country of ours. It is the responsibility of government to turn this around. What opportunities do we have today in our closer economic relations (CER) with New Zealand? The people there are good salesmen and good marketeers. We should be taking the opportunity of availing ourselves of the CER agreement that we have made with New Zealand. We should find markets there to benefit our farming community and manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say something about our farming community. In this Parliament we are inclined to overlook it. It must not be overlooked because it provides the stability for this nation's future. </PARA>

They have not complained a lot about it but we must keep in mind that, as sure as history repeats itself, the day will come when those droughts and bad markets will turn up again. I know that the party that I stand here to represent-the National Party of Australia-will stand solidly behind those people to save the national herd and to maintain the fertility of the soil that will enable the farmers to produce in years to come. We will never be able to do away with those broad principles and facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Naturally there are other matters that I would like to talk about this evening but time does not permit me. Superannuation is a very important issue. I am pleased to see the Government embarking on the right path but I am sorry that it has not gone a little bit further. The scheme is built so as to allow people still to claim the age pension or part age pension. At this point in time a superannuation scheme must be designed that will alleviate the situation over a number of years. It is very important that people in our work force from the ages of 20, 30, 40 and up to 50 years, and sole employers, even in private enterprise, have the right to be part of a superannuation scheme that will cover their costs of living after their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue that we have to embrace and look at very closely is a four-year term for the Federal House of Representatives. This is very important. I hope that the Opposition parties and the Government will embrace this. At present, under three-year terms, Treasurers-I do not care what side of the House they happen to come from; no matter who is in power, on the right of the Speaker-always come up with budgets to suit an election. That is not in the interests of Australia. That is why I advocate four-year terms. Parliamentarians can then settle down and do their jobs and governments can plan the economy the way that it ought to be planned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my contribution tonight on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 I would like to turn the attention of the House to a very significant advance that has been made by the Government, and I refer of course to the injection of funds from this Budget and subsequent Budgets to sport in Australia. For too long now unfortunately there has been a tendency for governments of varying persuasions not to be fair in their dealings with sport, sporting people and sporting organisations in this country. If one takes for example the estimates that were contained in the Forward Estimates which accompanied last year's Budget Papers one can see quite clearly what I mean because at that time there were estimates given over the next four years which I thought were quite relevant and which were worthy of consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During 1988-89, for example, we saw an amount of $27.1m spent on sport. It was projected in the Budget Papers of last year that the amount for this year would be $23.6m; for 1990-91, $23.6m; and for 1991-92, $23.6m. Therefore we can say that we were keeping the amount at constant dollar values and not in fact increasing it. That was to be a great concern to a number of people. However as a direct result of a number of significant events that has now changed. During the past six to eight months the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) has conducted a survey amongst Australia's sporting organisations to ascertain their views as to what was required by this Government-the Federal Government-and the ways in which this Government could assist Australian sport, Australian sports men and women and Australian sporting organisations in the development of sports facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the Minister gave a commission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration to investigate this whole question of the funding and administration of sport in this country. On 31 May this year all honourable members will recall the tabling of a report entitled Going for Gold which was the first report into this very subject by the aforementioned Committee of this Parliament. It is interesting at this time just to reflect on the work that committees of this place perform and the results that can be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of today's proceedings in the House for the election of the new Speaker mention was made of the contribution of the honourable gentleman in his former capacity as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure and a report that was done-that Expenditure Committee was the forerunner of this Committee-called In a Home or at Home: Accommodation and Home Care for the Aged-A Follow-up Report. It subsequently led to the development of the Government's home and community care program. I think that again indicates the role that committees can play in the development of policy and the enactment of policy in Australia through this Parliament. Exactly the same thing can be said about this report Going for Gold. Whilst I am not claiming that everything that was contained in this report has been adopted by the Government, certainly the most important recommendations have been involved in preparing the report hope that some of the other recommendations will be embraced by the Government in time. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that we concluded in this report was in fact that the Forward Estimates that I mentioned just a moment ago were totally unacceptable. The Committee was unanimous. Those people from the other side and members of the Government were unanimous in the view that the allocations for sport in this country as proposed in the Forward Estimates were totally unacceptable. The result of that has been quite staggering. There will be an enormous boost for sport over the next four years totalling some $230m. Those revised estimates now read as follows: For 1988-89, $27.6m was spent; 1989-90, $42.9m; 1990-91, $54.7m; 1991-92, $58.4m and 1992-93, $63.6m. (Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA> As I was saying, the Forward Estimates clearly demonstrate the commitment of this Government to sport and show quite clearly the massive increases in funding that will go towards Australian sport over the next five years. I was also saying that this has largely been as a result of pressure brought to bear by Senator Richardson and, as I understand it, a great deal of support that was lent to him in his deliberations at the Expenditure Review Committee by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Therefore on behalf of all those people who do enjoy sport in this country and who want to see it get a fair go I congratulate both of those gentlemen and, of course, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), whose interest in sport is legendary, on the work that they did on behalf of the people of Australia in respect of the allocation of the funds. But how are those funds to be spent?</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that we take a moment of the House's time just to go into that because it does show up some very interesting statistics. For example the Australian Sports Commission-a creature which in fact grew out of the Opposition when it was in government but which has prospered under this Government-is now going to receive $42.9m in 1989-90 compared with $27.5m in 1988-89. This is a quite incredible increase in funding. It will be offset to some extent by a reduction in staff numbers, but there will be an injection of funds into a number of the residential programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Elite sports are also the subject of special consideration by the Government in this package which the Minister released over a week ago. The Australian Sports Kit was launched with that package, and ushered in a new era for elite sports in this country. Elite sports can look forward to an additional $27m to be allocated to 25 sports which are currently under consideration for inclusion in the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), controlled by the Australian Sports Commission. Those honourable members who participated in the inquiry which led to the publication of the report entitled Going for Gold will recall that evidence suggested that the Commonwealth Government's responsibility for funding 108-plus sports in this country was quite nonsensical. In fact, the amount of money needed to fund the elite sports men and women involved in those 108 sports is also quite nonsensical. We recommended that between 17 and 25 sports receive special assistance from the Government in order to develop elite talent in this country. What was envisaged was that the Australian Sports Commission, through the Institute, would foster those particular sports and moneys would be allocated accordingly. I am pleased to see that the thrust of the report has been picked up by Senator Richardson in the package that he has announced. He has suggested that up to 25 sports be funded. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter that members of our Committee would find heartening is accountability. Audited assessments will be made of those sports and how the money is to be spent. That goes to the heart of accountability and will improve the credibility of those sports because, if they do not perform and succeed, they cannot expect to get continued Government assistance. We have allocated an extra $51.7m over the next four years to help elite athletes. A new elite athletes assistance scheme will provide direct grants of between $2,000 and $10,000 for up to 315 of our top athletes. In addition, the sports talent encouragement plan is to be revitalised-that is, the old STEP program-to provide encouragement grants of between $1,000 and $2,000 to 3,000 potential elite athletes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very pleasing to see this new elite scheme that will offer up to $10,000 to our elite athletes. The life that they lead, the effort that they put into their sport and the financial drain on them are absolutely incredible. Our Committee, in order to get evidence for its report, listened to hardship stories told by elite athletes such as Duncan Armstrong, Debbie Flintoff-King and others. These stories go to the heart of the problems of these people. It is very interesting that in this country people are quite willing to support struggling artists or people involved in cultural pursuits. They say that it is appropriate to throw money at those people-and rightly so-because they contribute to our society. By the same token, one should be prepared to fund the training of our elite athletes so that they can participate in a Commonwealth or Olympic Games, represent their country and go for gold. Yet people say, `Perhaps we don't really have to look after them; they will just get by'. </PARA>
<PARA> Elite athletes have to struggle to train and there are certain requirements in terms of training routines, food supplements and all the rest of it. If one talks to some of the athletes-I refer particularly to the cycling fraternity in Adelaide and Charlie Walsh-one will hear the real story. These people do not have the opportunity to undertake full time employment. If they are in receipt of some form of grant from either the Commonwealth or State governments there are limitations on getting additional assistance. They cannot apply for the unemployment benefit, for example. So it is appropriate that the Government has seen fit, in its sports package announced by the Minister, to look after the needs of those people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pleasing that an Athlete Advisory Service has been established. An amount of $300,000 over each of the next four years will be made available to assist our elite athletes in seeking employment and education. That is an extremely important point. With regard to that issue, I think it is about time that people in the community recognised that Government has done its part to assist sports men and women by implementing this package, and it is about time that the private sector did something along those lines. Our Committee is at present investigating the very difficult and vexed question of sports sponsorship by tobacco companies and breweries, which presently amounts to $50m annually. Unfortunately, if that amount is eliminated there does not seem to be anyone in corporate Australia who will come forward to look after our elite sports men and women or, indeed, sporting teams that have done well. I refer continually to one example which I find absolutely staggering. The Australian women's hockey team won gold in Seoul. Within two weeks of returning home their sponsor, Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd, decided that the team no longer met its corporate requirements and it gave the team the flick. Fortunately, Telecom Australia offered a much healthier sponsorship which is very good for the sport. This example shows the problems that are faced even by our champions. Debbie Flintoff-King, who won a gold medal in a hurdles event, was also in difficult circumstances. Her husband worked and also trained swimmers after work. He did all sorts of things to raise money so that his wife could continue in athletics-her chosen field of excellence. Of course, she succeeded; but it was a long time before anyone came along and said, `You've done well, so we'll give you something for your trouble'. This Government has made some advances in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also done something about assistance for travel for elite athletes. We have increased the amount of subsidy available for travel from 10 to 20 per cent of travel costs to over 40 per cent. That must also be welcomed. It is time that the private sector did its bit. I congratulate, as I have done in the past, Australian Airlines for taking that initiative. It has employed four of Australia's elite athletes. It has given them the opportunity to learn a skill and earn a wage, and at the same time it has given them the opportunity to train and to travel overseas to compete in top competitions, which our athletes desperately need to do in order to succeed. Of course, it will also give them time to compete in Commonwealth and Olympic Games in the future. Those athletes will have a future after sport. I think that is appropriate. More people in the broad community sector should be looking at that aspect. For example, I heard the other day that Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd, which has sponsored country rugby league in New South Wales ever since Adam ran around in a No. 7 jumper, has decided this year to give it away. One must ask why it has done so. Why are some private enterprises not already taking advantage of the tax incentives offered through the Australian Sports Aid Foundation? Is there a need to revamp that scheme? Our Committee made some recommendations on that point, which I hope the Government will look at in the not too distant future. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given an indication of the amount of money that will be allocated to some of these programs for elite athletes and elite sports men and women. One of the other pleasing aspects of the Government's announcements on sport in the Budget related to coaches. We understand, from looking at the figures that are contained in the Australian Sports Kit, that about $15.6m will be provided over the next four years for coaching. I think that is most appropriate. One cannot develop talent, identify talent or promote it unless one has properly trained coaches. The only way that one can attract them is to give them some incentive. We found that some coaches were not getting reasonable remuneration for the hours that they put in and the devotion that they offered their sport. Our Committee recommended that, where a national coach is not the AIS head coach, the Commonwealth accept responsibility for funding that position. That has also been accepted by the Minister and funding has been made available. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most significant and personally satisfying part of the package announced by Minister Richardson related to Aussie Sports. Aussie Sports has been developed to modify the rules of some of the more important sports in our program to make them more appropriate for children. We have seen a massive increase, a doubling to $1.41m, in the forthcoming budget for Aussie Sports. Over the next four years $5.8m will be made available. To top that off, the Government has also committed some money for a national sports fund program, youth sports. Several thousand young people from high schools will be trained in basic activities along the lines of the model in Western Australia. I commend the Western Australian Government for its particular activities in that regard. Young people will be taken after school and trained in basic sporting activities to develop their skills, confidence and ability to compete. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, the package that is before us for consideration as part of this Budget for sport is welcomed by the sporting community, and by those members of this House who have an ongoing and abiding interest in sport, the promotion of sport in Australia, healthier life-styles, encouragement of competition and improved living standards for our children and for those involved in sport. The Minister, Senator Richardson, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are to be congratulated for their support. I suggest that honourable members should keep tabs on this for the future because it will provide major benefits for this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given the indulgence of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the pretence that he has as much time as he likes to secure his place in history by desperately clinging on to power, he runs the grave risk of taking the economy of Australia down with him. The political virtues of this Budget from the point of view of the Australian Labor Party are clear enough for all to see. Every interest group or section of voters has something there to appease it. No-one is greatly offended by the obvious new imposts-or so the Prime Minister's wish list leads him to believe. But, despite these apparent virtues, Labor cannot cover up the reality of its flawed judgment in almost every area of its stewardship of economic policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has one credit to its name: the Budget surplus, albeit a tax driven surplus. It has latterly presented budgetary policy as the only area of policy for which the Government accepts responsibility. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) presents the largely spurious argument that the Budget surplus will solve such economic problems as high interest rates, high inflation and the current account deficit. To demonstrate what a silly argument that is, I remind honourable members of the economic situation as it prevails in the United States. It has a large Budget deficit and a diminishing but large balance of payments problem. However, interest rates and inflation in that country are a fraction of those in Australia. The reason for our failure in those two key areas is the Government's failed monetary policy. Contrary to the protestations of honourable members opposite, high interest rates are not an indication of so-called tough monetary policy or brave, disciplined economic policy to counter the external imposts on the economy. Interest rates as high as those in Australia at the moment are confirmation of failed monetary policy. The inevitable fall-if it is not a collapse-of interest rates from their present levels will not be an indication of the Government's success in overcoming difficulty; it will be the signpost of failure accompanied as it will be, by a rapidly declining demand for credit as the economy moves into an unnecessary recession. </PARA>
<PARA> For too long the Government maintained a loose monetary policy to avoid making the tough decisions which will now be forced on it or, if Labor continues its responsibility, will be forced on the next Government. Inflation has been maintained in Australia at ridiculously high levels. These policy failures have led directly to the increases in Australia's foreign debt to over $108 billion net in just a few short years of Labor rule. This cannot be blamed on the private sector. The private sector's share of gross foreign debt has remained fairly constant throughout recent economic history. The private sector is simply reacting to the economic incentives provided by the Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> All debt is made to look attractive by the Government's taxation policies by a comparatively high inflation rate and by artificially high economic growth. Foreign debt is made to look attractive by high domestic interest rates. None of these factors is the fault of the private sector, which is now struggling under the weight of interest rates which are well over 20 per cent for most borrowers. For some reason, honourable members opposite seem to envisage wicked businessmen sitting down and deciding to go heavily into debt just to deprive Labor of nice sounding economic statistics. Debt decisions are made on the basis of many factors and of those, Government taxation policy, inflation levels, general economic conditions and interest rates either flow from, or are all closely related to, government policies. The combination of all these factors in Australia under the Labor Government has mandated the rise of corporate and private debt. Nor are high interest rates the fault of the banks, which are desperately trying to compete for diminishing funds. When normal deposits are earning 17 per cent and more, is it surprising that home loan interest rates are at the same level and above? There is nothing in these high interest rates for banks, which earn profits on the spread between the interest paid for deposits and the interest charged for loans. Those spreads are not high at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The utter disgrace of the dishonest campaign by certain Labor Party members opposite to blame the banks for the failings of their own Government has demeaned themselves, this chamber and those unfortunate people who they egged on in their tirades against the banks. The way they focused their campaign on particular individuals whose only crime was to tell the truth as they saw it is reminiscent of the worst propaganda efforts of governments in countries less free than our own. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the present Treasurer, the Budget Speech itself has become more than ever an exercise in propaganda. A cosy chat with television viewers about the economy, which no longer informs the listener about departmental allocations that have to be searched for in the Budget Papers, and hides more than it discloses, has become the Treasurer's forte. This year he spent nearly as much time criticising the Opposition and indulging in insecure self-justification as he did outlining solutions to the very grave problems facing this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to some of the detail of the Budget. There are three matters in particular which I want to raise if time is available to me. The first is the taxation measures in the Budget, which represent an enormous drain on businesses and individuals. Then comes the nature of the Budget surplus and the Treasurer's false claim to have reduced the size of government. Finally, there is the hypocrisy of the Government's approach to indexation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible to assess the record of the Hawke Labor Government without looking at its record in the area of taxation. New, complex and increasingly onerous taxation laws have been the hallmark of legislation deriving from successive Budgets for the past six or seven years. This Budget continues that tradition. In 1989-90, the Treasurer will impose a greater burden on corporate businesses. Last year the brunt of his assault was borne by superannuants. In earlier years investors, employers and pensioners have all suffered. Throughout this time, the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer has been subjected to the increasingly onerous collection efforts of the Australian Taxation Office of tax levied on income at very high marginal rates. Based on the figures in this Budget, the boom in government revenue over Labor's time in office will see total tax revenue up by a massive 123 per cent; personal taxation will also be up by 123 per cent, company tax will be up by 143 per cent, and indirect taxes will be up by a massive 200 per cent. The rapid rises in revenue from indirect taxes are often characterised as the Treasurer's consumption tax by stealth. What could be more appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to corporate taxation payments and unpaid corporate collection of pay-as-you-earn tax for the Government represent another example of the way that this Government does not understand or care how business operates. Last year the Government brought forward the collection of revenue with its changes to the taxation of superannuation. This year it will attempt by the same sort of trick to bring forward 85 per cent of the company tax payments which would otherwise have been due some months later. It is estimated that this will bring forward $885m in the 1989-90 financial year, $150m in the following year, and estimated continuing so-called savings of $330m in interest on Commonwealth Government short term debt. This money does not come from thin air. Most of the longer term revenue gains will come from the pockets of shareholders in Australian companies. The new arrangements will be both costly and difficult to adhere to. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's rationale for this change is entirely spurious. Company revenue is not like a taxpayer's salary and should not be treated in the same way. Payments to companies often are not regular. They can fluctuate significantly with economic conditions and the uncertainty of receiving and fulfilling contracts. Lists of trading creditors are often long. But the Government now expects companies to pay 85 per cent of their so-called notional tax, which is calculated on the basis of the previous year's income, within 15 days of the end of their accounting year. At that stage the companies will still be collecting the income which they are expected to pay tax on and much of that income will still be outstanding. Again, at that stage, companies will only have a general idea of their full year's profits and will not be in any position to claim for variation of the 85 per cent rule to be imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The early payment will impact directly on the cash flow position of all companies. It will undermine an ability to plan for the future. It will have a particularly harsh impact on companies which are just setting up and have little idea about how likely the income from the early years' operations is to change. It will hit a declining company so hard that some will not be able to survive. This new impost will come in a year when cash flow has already been depleted by ruinously high interest rates and declining sales as the Treasurer tries to reduce economic demand. Any so-called saving by the Government on its own interest bill will be offset by the necessity for companies to borrow at very high interest rates to meet their earlier tax obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> The cumulative effects of this change and other government policies on Australian businesses should not be underestimated. On top of this silly new imposition the Government adds insult to injury by suggesting that companies effectively receive some sort of interest-free loan from the Government. What absolute garbage! The Government does not view the overpayment of tax to the Commonwealth, which is later refunded, as an interest-free loan to the Government by taxpayers. If it does, it is quite willing to take advantage of the situation and rip off those taxpayers by denying them interest on those funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential problem with the Treasurer's argument is that company tax is not levied on income but on profits and is affected by a range of non-cash and other considerations such as depreciation. Companies do not declare their annual profits until they have completed the detailed accounting for the year and have a clear idea of what their profits actually are. Usually, final accounts are subjected also to lengthy audit. Shareholders do not get their interim dividends or their reports of profits until well into the next financial year, and final dividends come later still. </PARA>
<PARA> What morality dictates that the Government get in for its chop before shareholders? What precedent is there for that? Under this proposal the shareholders of companies will have to lose out once again so that the Treasurer can con people into believing that his mildly expansionary Budget involves some expenditure restraint, while a still larger surplus of money is taken from the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The other taxation change in the Budget which affects companies is the doubling of the number of times each year that larger companies will have to pay instalments of pay-as-you-earn tax on behalf of their employees. This will also have effects on the cash flow of the companies concerned and will increase the administrative and cost burdens imposed by the taxation system. The Government is bringing forward $550m in revenue through this ruse. It is a counterproductive change which is in keeping with the Treasurer's efforts to squeeze every last drop he can out of taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget surplus is the Treasurer's greatest pride. Indeed, it is good that the Federal Government is no longer mortgaging the future by running up debts to pay for current consumption. However, the honourable member for Blaxland, the Treasurer, has spoiled his good work by claiming that the Budget surplus is what it quite clearly cannot be. Public sector savings are not the same as, or as desirable as, those of private individuals who must pay for the surplus through their taxes. The surplus is not a replacement for tax reform which will remove disincentives to save. The money saved by government-to use the jargon of the Treasurer-is money not available for those who earned it to save, to invest, or, for that matter, to spend. If the surplus is used to pay off government debt, as the Treasurer claims, it is not really a saving; it is meeting an obligation earlier than otherwise possible. The only real saving is the money not spent in later years on interest repayments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has made it clear that he sees the surplus as a treasure chest, available to dig out of the ground on a rainy day in case the Australian Labor Party needs more tax cuts to buy a few more votes. The Government has slowed the rate of growth of government spending from the highs which it reached in its early years in office and which, by 1986, had brought Australia to the very brink of economic disaster. However, the growth in taxation has contributed most to generating the Budget surplus. This year the taxation measures that I have already referred to will account for $1,765m of the Budget surplus. On top of that the Government deferred revenue from asset sales last year to boost further the surplus in the current year, by just over $1 billion. These referrals were made possible by larger than forecast revenue from imposts such as sales tax which, incidentally, were predicted by many commentators at this time last year. </PARA>
<PARA> A large increase in revenue from the fringe benefits tax is another bonus from the hidden wages explosion which the Government will take its share of. Cuts in government expenditure have, in large part, come from payments to the States and to other levels of government. Few programs have been axed although, admittedly, some have been made more efficient. Despite the mirage of stringency over the Government's spending programs, the Treasury is predicting further growth in public sector demand greater than that of last year. The surplus is a good thing and will remain so until government debt has been repaid, but we should not make too much of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point that I want to raise is the inconsistent attitude of the Treasurer when it comes to indexation. He has argued with some force that there is a danger that universal indexation can institutionalise inflation and cause major distortions in the economy. That is the standard Treasury argument. However, it bears little relevance to the proposals for inflation adjustment that are being considered by the Opposition. The type of indexation which is most damaging to the economy and to efforts to reduce inflation is precisely that which has for so long been the favourite of the Labor Party. Wage indexation is foremost amongst these examples of economic folly. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the stewardship of the honourable member for Blaxland the Government has indexed every revenue measure possible so as to increase government revenue in line with inflation. Similarly, Labor has claimed it as virtuous to index government benefits and pensions which are largely spent on consumption. The effect of Labor's indexation of everything which is convenient to it has been to provide an incentive for the Government to continue its inflationary policies. Taxation of real rather than nominal interest gains would not only provide an incentive for individuals to save but also remove an incentive for government to inflate. The coalition's proposal is not to introduce distortions but to reduce the distortions from years of inflation. Similarly, a properly grandfathered proposal to allow tax deductions for the real component of interest payments on debt need not introduce undue distortions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's argument is fine if the Government is serious about reducing inflation and if the Government had always eschewed inflation. However, this Government has done nothing to tackle inflation. It institutionalises it by promising to index whatever will increase government revenue and whatever will neutralise people's concerns about inflation. All of these measures are themselves inflationary in their economic effects. The proposals that the coalition is now considering are not. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite have talked about difficult times and trying circumstances. These have been the good times. Throughout the life of the Hawke Labor Government the world has gone through a long economic boom which has produced an increased demand for raw materials and processed goods, increased the value of capital and fixed assets, and produced greater prosperity throughout the Western world. Sadly, Australia has missed the opportunities of this boom. The Labor Party might be marching towards the light on the hill, but that hill always turns out to be a false crest on the mountain which hides a steep incline before the march upwards can be renewed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has indulged itself in the Weimar solution to Australia's economic problems. It has tried to inflate its way out of massive debt producing a massive increase in revenue, penalising those who are prudent creditors and, ultimately, threatening to cripple the economy. If we are to avoid the same fate as the Weimar Republic the Government has placed us in the position where some type of recession is almost essential--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address the House tonight on the threat to our pharmacists, who are the backbone of our pharmaceutical benefits scheme and who for years have actually given free service to our community in terms of advice. They have saved the health system millions of dollars with their free advice. What thanks do they get? They get a government which is trying to run them out of business, and doing a very good job of it.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1K4">Dr WOODS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, I have read the report. I wish I could say the same for him. Just to notate the cuts briefly: firstly, there is to be a reduction in the professional fee from $4.55 to $3.50-a $1.05 cut, or 26 per cent effectively, bearing in mind that there was a 12 per cent cut last year. On top of that, of course, there is to be no mark-up on drugs dispensed by the pharmacist. Currently the mark-up is 25 per cent. Let me just explain what is going on here, because there is an extra problem on top of this which the Tribunal clearly has not addressed. The wholesalers actually impose a surcharge, currently about 5.6 per cent, on the cost of the goods, which is borne by the pharmacists. So if a pharmacist dispenses a $60 item at present, he pays a surcharge of some $3.64. That means, in fact, that he gets $3.50 back from the Government: he actually pays 14c to dispense that item. No tribunal in its right mind could have planned that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No mark-up, of course, means no stocks. It means that delays for consumers-and these are sick consumers we are talking about-may be prolonged and it may cause them some inconvenience. What other business in Australia has no mark-up on its goods? How can the Tribunal make such an amazing miscalculation? The answer to that is, in fact, quite simple. It was very largely calculated on a data base to which only 0.3 per cent of the pharmacists in Australia responded. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen as a result of this Remuneration Tribunal decision is that a number of pharmacies will close. They will have no choice. They will be run out of business. We are talking conservatively about 1,500 of the 5,600 pharmacies in Australia. One may say that will not make any difference, that market forces will prevail, et cetera. The truth is, of course, that some of those pharmacies will be in isolated areas. It may be the only pharmacy in a country town. It may be the only pharmacy that is accessible to a group of pensioners. There certainly will be a reduction in the number of pharmacies offering after hours services, which by their very nature are expensive. When one is in a situation where one's costs are threatened, as they are now by this Government-inspired decision, then the first thing that is cut back is the expensive part of the operation. After hours services will become a luxury that none of us will be able to have access to in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that there are other aspects of this decision which are absolutely amazing. There is no encouragement whatsoever for professional training. Even though the Government got it wrong in terms of the details of its attempt to provide training for general practitioners, at least it did have the sense to try to encourage professional training to improve the standard of GPs. It has done nothing at all to encourage the same amongst pharmacists. There should be a recognition of training and expertise. The Government should make sure that they receive an appropriate remuneration because they will then be able to give better quality advice, which in turn will mean that fewer people will need to go to their physician, whose fees are more expensive both to the community at large and in particular to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened is that, rather than there not being any encouragement, there is a positive discouragement. When a pharmacist is pressed financially he tries to increase his turnover. If he increases his turnover he does not have time to sit down and chat to his patients and explain to them about the interaction of drugs, when they should take them, whether they should take them with meals, whether they should mix them with alcohol, et cetera. What happens is that the service gets faster and therefore, unfortunately, gets worse. The pharmacists have no choice in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The public of Australia is recognising this. I personally have received almost 200,000 signatures from members of the public complaining about this attack on the pharmacists. I think this is a record number of signatures for a single issue such as this from a single member of this House. The pharmacists, I should point out, have actually been penalised entirely inappropriately because, amongst all the groups in our society, they have very clearly increased their productivity. With most groups, if they increase their productivity they get paid more. This Government believes that when somebody increases his productivity he must have been earning too much to start off with, therefore it cuts back his income. So although the pharmacists' productivity has markedly increased, quite clearly they have been singled out.</PARA>
<PARA> There are two groups which have been singled out at present. We discussed the airline pilots earlier today. Quite clearly, this Government is attacking all employee groups which do not fit in with mainstream trade unionism. Neither the pilots nor the pharmacists are mainstream trade unionists in the sense in which the Government recognises this word. I understand that, according to the Tribunal handout, it actually proposes a further inquiry into the structure of pharmacy. The problem with that, of course, is that if these recommendations are allowed to progress there will not be any community pharmacies for the inquiry to inquire into. It is a very sad reflection upon the Government, which has already destroyed our medical system. It has given us a two-tiered medical system under which the rich each year look after themselves but the poor suffer, and there are enormous waiting lists and poor service. The Government has already destroyed our medical system. Why is it now destroying our pharmaceutical benefits system via the destruction of the backbone of that system, our community pharmacies?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ten days ago I was privileged to represent the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) at the Adelaide opening of the Ancient Macedonia exhibition. This is a magnificent exhibition of ancient Macedonian art which was presented to this nation as a bicentennial gift by the people of Greece and funded by the Federal Government through the Australian Bicentennial Authority. The opening was attended by hundereds of Adelaide arts lovers and history buffs and also present were a number of members of parliament, both Federal and State and from all parties, who lent their support to the exhibition and shared in the general enthusiasm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of those present was my Federal colleague the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). It was appropriate that he should be there, not only for the obvious reason of his Greek background but because he was instrumental in bringing the exhibition to Adelaide. Originally Adelaide was not on the exhibition's itinerary and the people of Adelaide were going to be denied the pleasure of seeing these works. Because of the urgings of the honourable member for Calwell, among others, the exhibition did come to Adelaide and the people of that city are now coming in droves to view it. It was obvious from comments made by both Greeks and non-Greeks that they greatly appreciated the efforts of the honourable member for Calwell in bringing to Adelaide this exhibition, which depicts the ideas and aspirations of an ancient culture that helped form the foundations of modern culture throughout the world. I have to say, Mr Speaker, that with the congenial company and the delicious Greek food and wine, it was one of the most pleasant evenings I have ever spent. I do not think that the word `multiculturalism' was mentioned at all that night, but it did not need to be. This was multiculturalism at work naturally and unselfconsciously. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not mentioned the role of the honourable member for Calwell in this in order to promote the merits of that honourable member.

I will not comment on the intrinsic stupidity of that comment as it is obvious for all to see. The honourable member for Adelaide, of all people, was questioning the comprehensibility of one of the most eloquent and forceful speakers in this chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak about the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) that has been a vital part of Australia's health care system, providing stability, reliability and safety. However, this scheme has been under constant attack by this Government and pharmacists are becoming desperate in an attempt to maintain viability to meet the demands of their clients effectively. This concern is genuine and warranted. Their frustrations have developed over a long period, as can be exampled by the addition of 53 frequently prescribed drugs to the authority only list and also by the extraordinary increases in the patient contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also know about the theoretical reduction of wholesalers' margins and the doubling of the maximum quantities of a considerable number of frequently prescribed items, with resultant loss of remuneration to pharmacists by way of professional fees. There was also the further reduction of remuneration of pharmacists by the reduction of the professional fee from 1 February last year. We have seen the demand for price reductions by manufacturers who are already supplying drugs for the Australian market at about half the price charged in comparable countries, to the extent that products of original research by these companies have been removed from the PBS since 1 April. The ability of the manufacturers of the cheap copies of these drugs to cope with the increased demand is questionable. In fact, many pharmacists have so far been unable to obtain stocks of certain necessary tablets. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent Budgets there have also been further changes to the remuneration to pharmacists, meaning a difference of up to 26 per cent. The effects of these changes to varying degrees will mean a loss of income for pharmacists with a consequent loss of taxation revenue. It will mean replacement of senior staff with lower paid junior staff or a reduction in the number of employees. It will bring about the closure of some pharmacies in small country towns, thus contributing significantly to the decline of such towns. Already in my electorate the pharmacy at Natimuk has closed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In towns such as Balranald, in the electorate of the honourable member for Farrer, pharmacies have also closed. It will create a wastage problem which has already been recognised by Government Ministers, involving the expenditure of further funds on a campaign to try to prevent this wastage. The Government is enlisting the aid of the people whose incomes are being eroded by its mismanagement to help with publicity. It has already precipitated the costly preparation and distribution of pamphlets giving a biased account of the generic changes and bearing a photograph of an actor who pretends to be a doctor. Further wastage of public money on this campaign has been made on media advertising and on the mailing of a small communication in a gimmicky capsule which must have cost more than an envelope to produce and post.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also express concern at the eligibility criteria of the essential pharmacy allowance (EPA) based solely on prescription volume and location. There seems to be an underlying assumption in the overall proposal that the decrease in mark-up will in part be compensated for by the benefits of future amalgamations and closures of pharmacies and that this rationalisation would benefit the remaining pharmacies by providing them with a greater share of the market. Such benefits would not flow to isolated rural pharmacies as distance precludes any chance of capitalising on this benefit. Surely location and isolation are sufficient criteria for the payment of an allowance to an isolated essential service, not the volume of work done, particularly if the service is limited by a low population base. Any inclusion of prescription volume, profitability or any other economic indicator denies the very purpose of recognising an essential service in its own right. The old isolated pharmacy allowance failed on this ground as the cut-off point was too low. It failed to acknowledge the effort, investment and risk of establishing and maintaining pharmacies in isolated areas of Australia. The financial viability of pharmacies in such communities will be seriously threatened by the changes proposed. These communities are under economic and social pressures and are undergoing acute structural readjustment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government must restructure the EPA so that it recognises the essential nature of pharmacy services. I ask this Government to stop its confrontationist attitude to our professional groups who have good reason at times to challenge the veracity of policies and inappropriate change in attempts to patch up a chaotic health delivery service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Along with other members I was pleased that the statement on the environment that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) delivered on 20 August covered the areas of waste management and recycling. I was pleased that the statement proposed the establishment of a working group to develop standards for recycled paper, that it also proposed the removal of sales tax on certain products made from recycled paper, and that the Government will sponsor a study of recycling plastics litter. This is important action at the national level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This evening I want to refer to action on recycling at the local neighbourhood level. In this respect I wish to commend two Penrith women, Mrs Francine Tyson and Mrs Carol Byrnes, who, in their respective neighbourhoods, have coordinated door to door collections of recyclable goods. In this very worthy effort they have had the support of a local firm, General Recyclers of St Marys. Mrs Byrnes has provided data on her project, which operates in Fragar Road in Penrith. It originally began as a four-week trial of collections, but because of its success over those four weeks the effort is continuing. The project consists of door to door collections coinciding with the regular garbage collection night. Of 103 homes in her immediate area, 41 participated. The result over the month was that 1.557 tonnes of recyclable material was collected at a value of $117.86. This money was contributed to a local worthy cause. The Penrith City Council has expressed keen interest in each of these neighbourhood projects. Council officers are preparing a report on the possibility of extending the recycling effort within the city of Penrith. There are prospects at this stage for a greatly expanded effort within that city. </PARA>
<PARA> This evening I want to commend Mr Tyson and Mrs Byrnes. Their projects are worthy in two senses: first, they are demonstrations that recycling is a practical proposition; and, secondly, they show that ordinary citizens have the capacity to alter community behaviour and effect change. There is one particular statement that Mrs Byrnes has made in the attachment to her report which I think is worth repeating this evening. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>More and more people are becoming aware of the enormous problems our environment is facing and as individual householders and concerned parents they want to help ensure a brighter future for their children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When listening to the debate earlier tonight I heard the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) say that the Australian Medical Association seems to think that something is wrong with taking money from the Government. If ever there has been an example of where it is wrong to take money, it is the grubby way in which the Government has treated this country's pharmacists. I agree totally with that statement and we have seen the effect of that, of being tied to government. Other speakers in this adjournment debate have already detailed what has happened-that is, there has been a recommendation that pharmacists' remuneration be decreased by $1.05 per script.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What will be the effect of this? Today I received a phone call from a pharmacist just outside my electorate-someone I know very well. He is 30 years of age and is one of four partners in two pharmacies. He draws $32,000 a year from his pharmacy. If his wife works she gets paid the ordinary hourly rate of any other worker. He has no financial arrangements through the partnership other than what he draws in his salary. He works 48 hours a week and does not get loadings for his leave. He does not take lunch breaks or morning or afternoon tea breaks. Making allowance for the hours he works, on a 38-hour week he would get $22,600 a year, or $11.40 an hour. That is for a 30-year-old with a family who has done four years university training. Out of that $11.40 an hour he has to pay his expenses of buying into that pharmaceutical practice. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not deny that there is a problem with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS), but the problem is not where the Government is trying to hit it. On 12 April the Auditor-General's report was tabled in the Parliament. The report referred to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and made four specific points. It said, firstly, that the Department of Community Services and Health does not have enough detail to know whether overpayments are being made; secondly, that the Department is unable to confirm that people who receive free drugs are entitled to them; thirdly, that the Department does not record information about the people who receive the drugs; and, fourthly, that the Department is not able to verify automatically the entitlement of a patient to free or concessional medicine. What was the Government's response? It said that no overpayments were being made, although the Auditor-General had stated that even if they were being made no-one would be able to know. </PARA>
<PARA> As I see it, there are three specific problems with the PBS, none of which has been addressed by the Government. The first concerns the safety net. When the safety net was introduced into the Parliament the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) said that the arrangements were widely recognised as both cost efficient and directing resources to those most in need. The cost of those cost efficient resources was $143m last year, representing an increase of 25 per cent over the previous year. It went up because the resources are not being targeted. The safety net operates in such a way that a family of six living in Toorak or South Yarra can hit the safety net on its first overseas trip. For example, someone who has asthma and requires ventolin, which has a long shelf life, can get two years worth of ventolin in the first year and none the next year. By getting two years in one year he hits the safety net and comes in under the Government's scheme. That is why the costs have gone up. Secondly, significant capacity exists for fraud. That was stated in the Auditor-General's report and nothing has been done about it. Thirdly, there has been no determination that those who are getting drugs are entitled to them. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a problem, and the way to fix it is not by hitting this country's pharmacists in an attempt to reduce their income by 12 per cent last year and now 8 per cent this year. On top of that it is a decision which the Government cannot get away from because the decision was based on its own submission. This country's pharmacists deserve a better deal than they are getting from this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two weeks ago in Question Time I raised the issue of renewable energy sources, particularly wind and solar energy, because at the time I was concerned that the State energy instrumentalities which are in the business of selling energy would hardly be those in the vanguard leading the push for conservation and for those renewable energy sources against traditional sources. I thought at the time that it was a bit like putting an arsonist in charge of a fire brigade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A similar situation arises with road builders and the State Government's proposals for building roads. The issue in question in my electorate is the proposed Burswood Bridge and Northern City Bypass and comes out of a decision to relocate the Burswood Bridge in East Perth to a location near the Bunbury rail bridge and to connect that bridge with the Mitchell Freeway via roads through East Perth and Northbridge. The bypass road that would need to be developed within the proposal would cut dramatically through Northbridge and East Perth. While that proposal has been around for some time-it has been under consideration for many years and often postponed-it looks as though it may be gaining some credibility in the views of those who plan these things. However, many factors need to be considered. Indeed, we need to ask ourselves whether we really need more roads of this type. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the new factors relate to a decision by the State Government to electrify and upgrade the railways and to establish a new line to the northern suburbs, because in view of the environmental considerations all sensible planners would know that public transport in this country needs to be developed dramatically. There is also a suggestion that the new road will relieve traffic flows in and around the city. While that may have a temporary effect, one needs only to look at the Mitchell Freeway in Western Australia. I feel very sorry for all those people who drive up to the northern suburbs on the weekend and buy a house up there because when weekdays come and they have to travel by car to the city they have to sit in long queues waiting for many minutes, and sometimes as much as an hour, to make the journey to the city. Whether it would relieve the traffic flows is conjecture. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also important environmental considerations. It is clear that fewer cars, less congestion, less emission gases and less energy usage are all environmentally sound objectives. Perhaps the push for more roads, better roads and more cars driving on them is something which we should be fighting against. Perhaps as important as anything to those who live in the inner city area is the impact that the roads will have on the inner city area. The area has changed and been regenerated over recent years. It has become a vibrant and exciting area. Many of the attractive buildings which had been allowed to run down have been restored. It is an area in which there is great potential for business and residential development. Cutting it in half with these proposed roads is a matter of a great concern to those who live and work in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> There are alternatives, and they include upgrading the railway system, which the Government has already said it will do. Consideration needs to be given to upgrading the railway bridge so that a city shuttle can be developed. Bypass roads are already under construction. Recently I travelled from Karrinyup to Perth Airport by Karrinyup Road, Morley Drive and the Tonkin Highway. When the northern perimeter highway is completed it will provide an excellent route around the city. Many people in my electorate are concerned about this development. The inner city Residents Action Group, the State planning people, many city planners and even Perth city councillors are concerned about it. We need to stand back from it and take a long term view, because by the time the decision is made to build it we may find that it is not necessary. It is clear that within the provisions of Federal funding-much of the money for this road system will come from Federal funding-it is possible for road funding to be diverted to urban transport; so there is no need for the State Government to miss out on some revenue or capital, but there may be other more important priorities for the money to be directed towards. This issue needs careful consideration and examination and the concerns of local residents must be taken into account. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I have not been monitoring the adjournment debate but I do understand that some comments have been made in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT). I think it is important tonight to make a few comments to put the whole issue into some context. First of all I think the point needs to be made that the Tribunal has been through an exhaustive process of considering well over 600 submissions and the Tribunal itself is an independent body. I think, within that, it needs to be also considered that the Government tried in April and May of this year to put a joint submission to the Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That joint submission would have marked a level of agreement and understanding between the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Government in a way that would have shown a cooperation and a desire to work together to form a submission that would hopefully go on to be taken into strong account in the Tribunal's deliberations. But that was not possible; the Government's offer was rejected and hindsight, I think, and history will show that that was a very generous offer. Today, now that the Tribunal has come down with a determination which is in effect law, life has been made difficult it would seem, if we are to believe what some pharmacists would say for them all. But the decision is the determination of the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> As soon as the decision was released I contacted the Pharmacy Guild to offer to have discussions with it about some recommendations that were in the report. This is as distinct from the determinations that focus around the structure of the industry, such as the structure of retail pharmacy and the essential pharmacy allowance which was an initiative of the Government to take account of special circumstances, whether it be remote locality, small communities or different issues that makes a pharmacy in an urban environment essential. That could cover things like the need for a 24-hour service or the fact that, even in an urban environment because of the nature of the population and problems with transport, such a pharmacy is essential to that community. </PARA>
<PARA> The objective, of course, is to ensure that people get access to those pharmaceuticals and that the role of the pharmaceutical system and pharmacy as an intrinsically important part of the health care system is maintained. That offer was rejected. It concerns me that in the rejection of that offer therein lies the disaster for the community pharmacy. I would hope that in coming back to discussions with the Government the Pharmacy Guild and other interested elements of pharmacy would be able to develop, in conjunction with the Government, a constructive approach to some of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is another issue that is very important as far as I am concerned. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme is a much underrated scheme despite the fact that its cost was well over $1,000m last year and this year will be well over $1,200m. It is rising very rapidly for a variety of reasons: firstly, the general cost of some more expensive high tech drugs that are coming into the system as well as, of course, the number of people who are actually getting prescriptions. This is partly to do with our ageing population. So what we do have to is protect the scheme and ensure that it works. But it is not just simply a matter of selling drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is a very important role for pharmacists within the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and that role is to develop a much more proactive health care role for pharmaceuticals and the way in which they are used in our community. That is another issue that I hope to raise particularly with the pharmaceutical society which represents the ethical stream of pharmacy. But the problem is that we have to take into account that there is a lot of reaction in the community. It concerns me that a lot of the more moderate leaders and the more moderate people in the community in the past have been--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. Some of the more moderate pharmacists have been overshadowed in the past and I would hope, bearing in mind that the offer to the pharmacists back in May was rejected, that some of these more moderate elements may come to the party and show a different approach to the Government than has been there in the past. I say that sincerely because I do want to find a way to work with pharmacy, of course, in the development of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This is very importantly also in developing a broader role for community pharmacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we also have to consider that many things have been said, some of them simply not true and others simply misunderstandings and misinformation. As I said before, the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) is rising quite dramatically for those reasons, and the Government has tried on other occasions to find ways of dealing with that. Many pharmacists have put forward their ideas. But the sorts of things that have been put forward to offset the rising costs of the PBS such as altering safety net provisions and making pensioners pay-most of those suggestions coming from pharmacists, I might add-I do not think solve the basic issues. We are trying to develop a health care system, but not one that simply revolves around selling pills and the remuneration of pharmacists. I think that we need to pay a lot more attention to that issue than has been paid in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me that there are a lot of people who are currently being over concerned and frightened by what some pharmacists are saying. I think that that is a concern because there are many people who are old and frail and who depend upon those pharmaceuticals for their health care and they are unnecessarily concerned. They would probably be more concerned if they realised that many of the people who are trying to frighten them at this stage are actually the people who are suggesting at the same time that the cost of drugs to them be increased. The reality is that many pharmacists have had posters in their windows that say, `Pensioners to pay-The Government's next step'. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of pharmacists who have written to me. I think that if we went through the submissions to honourable members as well as to the PBRT we would see that that is exactly what a lot of pharmacists are saying. That is not the solution. The Tribunal has made its decision on the basis of costs and the fee in terms of dispensing is there. I make the offer to the Pharmacy Guild and to other national interested bodies to have discussions with the Government particularly around the recommendations and other elements that have been discussed. These are the structure of retail pharmacies in Australia; the guidelines for any essential pharmacy allowance; and very importantly the professional role of pharmacists. I want to make the point to people who are concerned that the Government considers the PBS is a most important element of the health care system and that Australians, no matter where they live, need not fear from any actions of this Government the loss of their entitlement or the loss of access to pharmaceuticals. The PBS protects very well in this country in a much underestimated way our frail aged and our sick, our chronically ill, those on low incomes and indeed all Australians. The availability of those best drugs at the best prices, on the basis that health is not determined by wealth, is fundamental to the PBS, and the Government will continue to have that to be the case. </PARA>
