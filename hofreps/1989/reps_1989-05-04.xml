<PARA> take the necessary action to reverse rising cost trends and provide positive incentives to encourage all health funds to share the cost of health care for sick and elderly Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to comment on the report of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation and, in particular, to praise the work of the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), who, in the course of the inquiry, managed to achieve something which I hope is not remarkable in this Parliament but which I suspect occurs too infrequently, that is, very harmonious and good working relations on a committee which comprised membership from all parties in this Parliament and representatives from both this House and the Senate. I suppose it would be fair in that regard also to express and place on the record my own appreciation of the work of the Deputy Chairman, Senator Jim Short from Victoria. He shared that responsibility and also made sure that the work of the Committee proceeded smoothly and without the kinds of internal difficulties that might have been thought possible for a committee dealing in an area of some controversy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe the ultimate outcome of the report has been very worthwhile. Notwithstanding that there is a rather half-hearted dissenting report saying that the national scheme should not proceed, the Committee's main work has been to put forward very sensible proposals when it comes to the terms of the Corporations Bill itself, proposals which I believe will substantially improve the package and will be broadly welcomed by participants in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible to deal effectively today with all the various matters that have been canvassed, but I should mention that a couple of aspects required particular attention and took considerable time of the Committee, particularly questions of fundraising and prospectuses and how they can best be dealt with. In that regard the Committee has made proposals which will involve some tightening up of the fundraising and prospectus areas, but without substantially moving away from the aims of the drafters of the legislation which are essentially to move towards a more efficient market approach. The Committee has, however, also been very conscious of the need for adequate investor protection and that has underpinned many of its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> There was one area where the Committee membership was divided on a matter of substance with respect to the draft Bill. The Committee divided equally on this issue, with five members supporting a particular view and five supporting the alternative view. The issue was resolved by the Chairman exercising his casting vote. I should say that the division was not one along party lines; it simply reflected different views as to the appropriateness of one particular matter, and that was the question of which body within the regulatory framework would be best fitted to make declarations as to unacceptable conduct. As the House would be aware, the Bill proposes to establish a corporations and security panel to decide whether particular corporate behaviour is to be condemned and regarded as unacceptable. Certain conclusions flow from such a declaration, and the Bill now gives enforcement powers to that panel. The majority of the Committee, that majority constituting of five members with the casting vote of the Chair, regarded that as an inappropriate division of responsibility and recommended that the power to make declarations of unacceptable conduct remain with the Australian Securities Commission (ASC)-the successor to the present National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). </PARA>
<PARA> I took the view that the original draft was quite appropriate and, in company with Senator Alston from the Liberal Party, Senator Cooney and Senator McMullan from the Australian Labor Party and Senator Macklin from the Australian Democrats, I expressed the view that it is desirable that the Australian Securities Commission should have only an investigative role and that matters of adjudication should properly be dealt with by the panel. The dissenting report concludes that the NCSC's submission to the Committee had greatly overstated the extent to which the ASC's capacity to police the securities market would be affected by the terms of the draft Bill. The minority report also noted that the overwhelming weight of evidence given to the Joint Committee by the business community favoured the power remaining with the panel. I stress that point. One of the reasons why the corporate world has given such strong support to this proposal is that it sees an end to its fears that an investigatory body would also be the policeman, the judge and the jury in relation to decisions which affect corporate reputations. </PARA>
<PARA> Our dissent concluded: `We have a fundamental objection to giving the same body the right to be both prosecutor and jury when other equally effective and convenient alternatives are available'. This was the one point of disagreement within the Committee and in a report of great complexity, a report which deals with great issues of substance. The issues are potentially controversial. All other issues were resolved without a dissenting report being tabled. It is a tribute to the Chairman-who is present in the House-who led that Committee so well. I also pay tribute to the cooperative attitude of all members of the Committee to the work of the Committee. The time available for its work was short. I also note the constructive contribution of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher), from the National Party, who is also present in the House. I conclude my remarks in order that he may place his views on the record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, I congratulate the Chairman, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), on its report. He had a very difficult role to play and he did it well. I thank our Secretary, Mr Andrew Snedden, and his staff for preparing such a complex report in the short time available. The Committee worked through almost all of the recess. For three weeks of February the Committee was totally involved in hearings. To allow the Chairman time to say something, I will express briefly a real concern I have about the nature and level of consultations that took place prior to the legislation we were investigating being produced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are serious reasons for questioning the membership of the consultative committee, particularly the fact that it was representative of the major players in the corporate sector in the eastern States. It was not until this Committee started its operations that the general community was aware of the extent and nature of this legislation. It was at that time that most of the submissions came forward on the various issues. I should like to speak about the transitional arrangements and the constitutional problems but, in view of the time, I will just read the conclusion brought down in the dissenting report of four members of that Committee in relation to the Australian Securities Commission Bill, Senator Richard Alston, Senator Jim Short, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and me. Our conclusion states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Co-operative Scheme has served Australia well since its inception nine years ago. In particular, the NCSC has built up an impressive record, and is widely regarded and respected both within Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> We recognise that there are improvements that can and should be made to the regulation of the corporations and securities industries in Australia. Many of these are contained in the Corporations Bill now before the Parliament. We generally support the views on this Bill outlined in the main body of this report. </PARA>
<PARA> In our view, however, no compelling case has been produced to support the need for major structural change to the regulatory framework as proposed in the Australian Securities Commission Bill. There are, on the contrary, strong arguments against such wide ranging structural change. </PARA>
<PARA> Any deficiencies in the present arrangements can be rectified without difficulty. To address these deficiencies by a totally new structure which is opposed by every State and the Northern Territory, and by many other organisations, and which detailed examination shows clearly to be found wanting, would be to embark on a legislative adventure of monumental folly. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, we recommend that the ASC Bill be totally rejected, and that the existing Co-operative Scheme be retained and strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA>Change is necessary. Anybody who reads the daily business papers will see the sorts of difficulties that so many of our governments and investors run into regularly with some of our corporate structures. We need change, but we do not believe the recommendations the Government is bringing forward are necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank my colleagues for their kind remarks. I simply make the observation that one's effectiveness as chairperson of a committee is determined by the skill of one's colleagues on that committee; that was always evident-their skill and commitment was excellent. I thank my colleagues for their remarks, and I believe that the success of this exercise really is a tribute to them and to the work of the secretariat of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that a couple of things ought to be said. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) referred to the question of the declarations power. Yes, there was a division in the Committee over that. It was the view of the majority of the Committee that the power to make declarations of unacceptable conduct should remain with the Australian Securities Commission (ASC), in order that that body have sufficient authority and stature in the business community, and also in the light of recent corporate activity, so that the Commission has sufficient clout to operate in a way that will improve the level of corporate behaviour and compliance in certain areas-obviously, this does not apply across the board, but to certain areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In the view of the majority of the Committee, and in my view, it was considered important that the power to make declarations of unacceptable conduct should remain with the ASC. However, as soon as it affects property rights-that is, the disposal of shares or other assets-the power to make orders should go to the panel. We believe that that is an appropriate division of the range of responsibilities and powers. I note that the Committee was divided over that matter, although the majority of members were of the view that the power to make declarations should reside with the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the question of Rothwells Ltd. The circumstance is this: the Committee requested a copy of the interim report on Rothwells, and I must say with some regret that we were denied access to that report until our report was concluded, because there is some evidence that the interim report on Rothwells contained information which would have enabled the Committee to be better informed on the compulsive powers of the current National Companies and Securities Commission vis-a-vis the Australian Securities Commission. In fact, some of the material in that report would have been germane to our considerations. However, the report of the Committee is not considerably deficient in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the following point in relation to Rothwells: what can clearly be deduced from the evidence that has been put before the Australian people and the Australian Parliament in the interim report on Rothwells is that we do need a very strong regulatory authority in this country to deal with business malpractice. It is very important from the point of view of investor protection. It is also important to protect the rest of the business community which, in the view of the Committee, has a very good reputation and conducts its business affairs in the best possible way and promotes an efficiently operating free enterprise economy in Australia. However, whilst matters such as the Rothwells matter are allowed to go on, clearly, the business reputation of Australia will be damaged. It is clearly a concern of the Committee as a whole that it is important to have a proper regulatory framework that will enable us to manage such corporate activity better in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other matter I want to refer to concerns the question of pre-vetting. The Committee as a whole believed that pre-vetting of prospectuses and part A statements should remain. The reason for that is that we could find no-one in the business community who was willing to take responsibility for these statements. In the absence of that willingness to take responsibility, it was the view of the Committee that the regulatory authorities ought to retain a role and, accordingly, we made our determination on this matter. As is evident, these matters are of some current significance. The Committee as a whole worked extremely well. I commend and compliment members of the Committee for their work, and I also compliment the secretariat. I believe that the report is worth serious consideration by this Parliament and by the Australian business community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this year some citizens demonstrating outside the front of the new Parliament House burnt an Australian flag as part of their protest. This quite despicable act guaranteed these people nationwide media coverage for their cause. Like many other Australian citizens-I do not overstate it by saying this-I was horrified and outraged at seeing our national flag destroyed in this manner, in a cheap, defiant and quite deliberate action calculated to gain the maximum publicity at the expense of our nation's symbol-our flag. I raised this matter with the Speaker in the House and, like many others, was surprised to find that no penalty exists for such actions. To rectify that deficiency I am introducing this private member's Bill into the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although relating to the Australian national flag and its ensigns, which are defined under the Flags Act, the penalties contained in this Bill-the Crimes (Protection of Australian Flags) Bill 1989-are described as an addition to our Crimes Act. If this Bill is implemented and passed, anyone who, from then on, desecrates or otherwise dishonours the Australian national flag or an Australian ensign or who, without lawful authority, burns, mutilates or otherwise destroys our flag shall be deemed guilty of an offence and subject to a penalty of $5,000 or imprisonment for two years or both. </PARA>
<PARA> Many other countries around the world have penalties for similar offences against their flag. The penalties proposed in this Bill are not inconsistent with penalties imposed overseas. Our soldiers fought under our flag in two world wars so that we might all live in freedom in this lucky country. The price paid for that freedom is one that we should not lightly forget. Those people who so insolently burned our flag outside Parliament House recently should realise that, whatever their grievance, they should never resort to such a treasonable insult. What other nation would allow its flag to be dishonoured with impunity? Such behaviour is totally unacceptable to most people. Are we to be treated, or do we want to be treated, with this sort of spectacle every time some unwashed, disaffected group of people who have probably contributed little or nothing to the welfare of this nation want a cheap publicity shot? When they burn our flag they mock every decent tradition and foundation in Australia-traditions, loyalty and pride that have been built up through the contribution of all Australians over the last 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, I and most others strongly and sincerely feel that any actions which desecrate or dishonour our flag are totally offensive. Unless we have respect for our flag we can have no respect for anyone, including ourselves. It is time that the line was drawn. I challenge anyone who disputes that penalties are needed for these actions to conduct a poll among the general population. If we claim to represent the people we much correct this oversight. If we care about our country and what it stands for, we will support what is proposed in this legislation. I ask for and I expect the unanimous support of all honourable members in this chamber for this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) supports the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) opposes the (a) stationing of nuclear weapons in Australia; (b) testing of nuclear weapons in Australia; and (c) acquisition or production of nuclear weapons by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Before this debate begins, it is important to put on record what this motion calls for. It calls on the House of Representatives, first, to support the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and, secondly, to oppose the stationing of nuclear weapons in Australia, the testing of nuclear weapons in Australia and the acquisition or production of nuclear weapons by Australia. I understand that the motion is to be seconded by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon). I would have hoped that a motion such as this, which captures so much of the aspirations of what we as a country represent, would have been supported by all the Parliament because it expresses revulsion and abhorrence of nuclear weapons and sends a signal to the world that Australia will not be a part of nuclear weapons. Regrettably, that will not be the case. The Opposition undoubtedly will oppose this motion in line with its newly adopted policy which recently has been actively promoted. It sends another signal, this time to the Australian electorate, to the effect that the coalition is prepared to countenance and support the stationing of nuclear weapons in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty was a very proud initiative, not just of this Government, but of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself. The Government took up the initiative as soon as it gained office and endeavoured to work to achieve consensus within the South Pacific nuclear free zone. Australia promoted the concept at the Fourteenth South Pacific Forum, which met in Canberra in August 1983. Ultimately, in 1986, that Treaty became a reality. If the initiative for the Zone was Australia's, the Treaty itself constitutes a genuinely collective effort by the countries of the South Pacific Forum. The Opposition will effectively attack those countries as well as this Government when it contributes in due course to this debate today. </PARA>
<PARA> The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty is not like other treaties that have been entered into by this Government. It did not become a part of the Australian legal framework by some simple executive act alone, some decision by the Government simply to sign the Treaty. I, together with a number of other people, including the present Governor-General and our Prime Minister, was present on the occasion of the signing of the Treaty. What we did as a government was something much more. We put into legislation, for the first time ever in the history of the world, a decision of the Government that, by law of the land, we would not permit the testing of nuclear weapons in Australia, the acquisition or development of nuclear weapons by Australia or the stationing of nuclear weapons in our country. Of course, that became a law passed by this Parliament, though opposed by the Opposition. It was assented to by the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Opposition brings forward its pro-nuclear policy it is suggesting that it is able to repeal that law of the Commonwealth Parliament. It will not be able to. Not only is the law supported by the Australian Labor Party but it is supported by independent senators and by the Australian Democrats, many of whom would seek to take this policy further. The important thing is that nobody-certainly not the Opposition-is going to be allowed to turn back the clock in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worthwhile to retrace briefly the history of the announcement of the Opposition policy. On 10 March 1989 the Opposition, led by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) as the shadow spokesman on this matter, distributed to coalition members and senators a draft foreign policy. On page 8 of that document there was a discussion of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>A Liberal-National government will renegotiate the Treaty-</PARA>
<PARA>for which we read `will tear up the Treaty'-</PARA>
<PARA>so as not to prohibit the stationing of nuclear forces of allies in Australia's land or sea areas. </PARA>
<PARA>As often occurs in the conservative parties, that draft document became widely available to the press before the official policy launch on 7 April. A number of stories were published which recorded that a coalition government would allow nuclear weapons to be based in Australia. For example, the Adelaide Advertiser of 6 April recorded in a banner headline:</PARA>
<PARA>United States nuclear forces could be stationed in Australia under coalition government, a leaked policy document has revealed. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the effect of that was to promote an incredible community backlash. I say to the Opposition that we are not living in the 1950s; we are not living in the Cold War era. We are living in a time when Australians, together with so many other people around the world, have realised that we have got to put an end to nuclear madness. In the same way that the Opposition is out of step with Australian public opinion in its concern for environmental preservation, so too is it out of step with Australian public opinion on this issue. I take the view, as I am sure my colleagues do-in particular, the honourable member for the Northern Territory-that this Parliament ought to be showing the way on issues like nuclear weapons and environmental preservation-issues which go to the very essence of the preservation of life on earth and the safety of our planet. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem for the Liberals was that there could have been incredible community backlash from this policy. This gave the Liberals one heck of a fright. They redrafted the sentence and in the final version of their policy, when it was eventually released, read a little differently. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> A Liberal/National Coalition Government will renegotiate the Treaty so as to overcome these restrictions on Australia's freedom of action. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for North Sydney, said in his press conference on 7 April that the coalition policy would not allow stationing of nuclear weapons, but this somehow left the impression that the option had not been ruled out. For example, the story written by the Australian Associated Press (AAP) after that press conference recorded:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia should have the option of allowing deployment of allied nuclear weapons to deter a threatened attack, Opposition Foreign Affairs Spokesman John Spender said today. </PARA>
<PARA>The AAP story went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In the final document released today the wording was changed but the meaning was the same. </PARA>
<PARA>We have a sleight of hand trick and an attempt to gloss over the precise meaning of the policy. But according to independent commentators and the Australian public the meaning is absolutely unambiguous-tear up the Treaty and allow nuclear weapons to be stationed in Australia. We in the Government totally reject that proposition. I might say, as I often do in this House, that this is not a sectarian issue. This is not an issue that is of total concern to the Labor Party. The Australian Democrats-to their great credit-issued a statement that condemned the Opposition policy. Senator Jean Jenkins said in her press release:</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties have foolishly chosen to identify themselves with the minority who would place the needs of the USA above those of Australia. This greatly increases John Howard's prospects of going into oblivion at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty is not objected to by the United States. It is perfectly consistent with the United States interests. Its Government has gone on record saying that. Senator Jenkins went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition proposed a course that would warrant nuclear attacks against Australia in the event of hostilities. </PARA>
<PARA>It is completely out of step with what the majority of the Parliament, including Independent senators, the Australian Democrats and the overwhelming majority of members of the House of Representatives, believe. It is not just on that issue that the Opposition is out of step with public opinion. I am going to stick very strictly to this debate but let me say by way of example that the policy it has on foreign investment-this free market, open slather approach to foreign investment-is rejected by the Government. We will not support the policy of abolishing the Foreign Investment Review Board. Again, it is a question of whether or not political parties place Australia's national interests ahead of the interests of other people. We on this side have absolutely no hesitation in saying where we stand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's foreign affairs policy, as it relates to these and related matters, was severely criticised by a number of prominent commentators. It was said, for example, that the United States Cold War attitude was very similar to the blinkered and very out of date policy adopted by the Opposition-the then Government-under the late Sir William McMahon when Gough Whitlam went to China in an attempt to build dialogue with the Chinese. At that time, when the now Opposition was in government, it condemned Labor leader Whitlam and said that his actions were an impertinence to the leader of the United States. As it turned out, as Gough Whitlam was in China speaking to the Chinese so too was Henry Kissinger. He was there establishing the same sort of relations that the Australian Labor Party was seeking to establish. The point of that is that it is the same problem. The Opposition is out of step; it is at least 30 years behind developments in this area. The honourable member for North Sydney has as much relevance to current Australian foreign policy and global strategic considerations as do FJ Holdens and 1950 Chiko rolls. His attitude is from a completely different era and is, of course, overwhelmingly rejected by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that is the case, far be it from me to offer political advice to the honourable member for North Sydney; but I happen to know that the former mayor of North Sydney, Ted Mack, who is widely respected by many Liberals and people across the political spectrum, has been rumoured as a candidate for his seat. I have absolutely no doubt that if one asked Mr Mack, who is a known environmentalist and a very sensitive and far thinking person, what he thinks about nuclear weapons and the idea promoted by the honourable member for North Sydney that they should be permanently stationed in Australia, he would say what we are saying-it is just not on. In response to what the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) said, I say that if I were the member for North Sydney, I would get his ambassador in his electorate to renounce this policy, because if he does not it will be an issue at the next election on which his constituents will pass judgment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to emphasise that the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty has been widely supported not just within Australia but at a number of important forums around the world. In a communique issued by the 46 Commonwealth Heads of Government in 1985 they welcomed the Treaty. They said that it was an important step in global and regional efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. The members of that organisation range across countries which include members of the Western alliance, non-aligned countries and a whole cross-section of world opinion. This Treaty and initiative has been a model for the world, as is the Act of Parliament which gives effect to that treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not standing here today in an attempt to make some short term political capital out of this issue. In my first speech in this House I made the specific point that this Government, of which I am a proud member, should not ever consider having nuclear weapons for Australia. Subsequently, I and my colleagues initiated a motion in the Federal Labor Caucus which was seconded by the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) as secretary. That motion was the genesis of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty Act. That idea of sending a signal to the world that Australia would not acquire nuclear weapons captured the imagination of the entire Government. So, we put it forward as an initiative which I believe captures the idealism which is synonymous with the Government to which I belong. I urge support for this motion and I am sure that my remarks will be strongly supported by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On most occasions I enjoy listening to the contributions of the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner), and today I have enjoyed listening to much of what he said. He brings to his contributions to the Parliament less of the personal attacks which characterise some of his factional opponents within his own Party. He tends to deal with issues rather than personalities, and this is a subject on which one can do that. Obviously, questions of nuclear proliferation, the stationing of nuclear weapons in Australia and the impact of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty should and can all be argued in a responsible way. Therefore, I am a little disappointed that the honourable member introduced a personal note into his remarks in relation to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In dealing with the proposition before the House, I think it is perfectly arguable that there can be a difference of view about the best policy to pursue in relation to Australia's security. That is something which is obviously of great concern to the national Parliament; it should be of great concern to individual governments. One of the great responsibilities facing any national government is to protect the security of the nation. How one goes about achieving that responsibility is, of course, of tremendous moment. What we have to do is to argue the merits of the propositions put before the House in relation to the absolutely fundamental proposition that the responsibility of any national government is to protect Australia's national security. If one looks at the arguments being put by the honourable member for Hughes in that light, rather than with the emotionalism which surrounds much of the debate about nuclear weaponry, nuclear-powered ships and nuclear power generally, then one can get a much more coherent, realistic and, in my view, a much more soundly based argument than is often the case when one allows rampant emotionalism about the horrors of nuclear accidents to cloud one's thinking. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of points that the honourable member for Hughes made which I would like to take up initially. In relation to my colleague the honourable member for North Sydney, he said `He has let it around that nuclear weapons should be permanently stationed in Australia', as though that were a direct quote from the honourable member for North Sydney and the position of the Opposition. I would like him to produce the evidence for that statement, because I have no knowledge of the honourable member for North Sydney or any other member of the Liberal and National parties saying that nuclear weapons should be permanently stationed in Australia. If he cannot produce the evidence for that statement, I believe he should come in and apologise to the House and certainly to the honourable member for North Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> When we are looking at the question of security we must face the fundamental question of whether we are going to continue with our defence relationships with Western countries in general and with the United States in particular. If we are going to continue with our defence relationship with the United States-and I think the vast majority of Australians would agree with that proposition-then we must have a look at the potential effects which could come into play should the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty be hardened up in any way or should there be a war. We are all terribly brave in peacetime-just as the honourable member for Hughes is at present-when there is no apparent threat or when people do not perceive an apparent threat. But if Australia were confronted with a significant direct threat, then people's thinking would become much more concentrated on the defence issue and would be led along the lines of supporting in a much more direct way the special alliance with the United States, that special relationship that we have under ANZUS. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why so many people in Australia are concerned with the virtual shredding of the ANZUS arrangements by New Zealand at the present time, exacerbated recently by the Prime Minister of New Zealand in a speech in the United States. It concerns thinking people in this country that this unique defence arrangement that we have with the United States could be put at risk. That is fine while we are at peace, but in the event of a major threat we would very quickly look to those countries, particularly to the United States, for assistance. Under those circumstances we must look at the effect of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty on the options that are available for Australian defence forces, for our allies' defence forces and for the proper organisation of any cooperative effort by those defence forces. That is what concerns the Opposition in relation to this Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> How did the Treaty come about? It really came about because the Labor Government wanted to make some sort of gesture which would pick up some of the concerns of the more left wing of its members. One has only to mention the word `nuclear' to left wing members of the Labor Party and they go into a sort of frenzy and lose the power of coherent thought. In many ways what has occurred is that the right wing members of the Labor Government have said, `What can we do that will settle down the boys on the Left for a while?'. One of the things they could do was to look at proceeding with the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. It is like those signs one sees when one drives around Labor dominated council areas in most of the major cities in Australia which state, `This is a nuclear free zone'. What a lot of nonsense! Of course it is a nuclear free zone; it always was a nuclear free zone; there will continue to be nuclear free zones in the major cities of Australia. Yet these councils erect signs depicting the atomic symbol and the pretentious statement that the municipality is a nuclear free zone. It is a load of garbage, but it makes them feel better. One of the statements that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has made in the past with which I agree is the one he made when he talked about the politics of the `warm inner glow'. He referred to the Balmain basket weavers. This is politics of the warm inner glow, if ever I have heard it-that a certain municipality is a nuclear free zone. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Government do? It says, `We will have a nuclear free zone in the South Pacific'. There are some major concerns about some incidents and particularly about some policies in relation to nuclear weaponry and dumping of nuclear waste. They are quite proper concerns and they should be, and have been, addressed. Nobody wants France to continue testing nuclear devices on Mururoa Atoll. Everybody is concerned about it. France is rightly being condemned for the continuation of testing on that Atoll and pressure must be maintained on France to prevent it continuing with that testing. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point which is of proper concern is the dumping of nuclear waste. There was a suggestion some time ago that Japan may be considering dumping nuclear waste in the South Pacific. That is quite properly of concern. Was a South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty needed to deal with those problems? Of course it was not. They could have been addressed directly in a way which particularised those issues and everybody would have been happy to support them. What has occurred with the bringing into place of this Treaty is that there has been a blurring of the issue at a time when the South Pacific, particularly, is not the tranquil, peaceful lake that we have known for so long. Some of the states of the South Pacific reluctantly signed the Treaty to go along with Australia. Others said that the Treaty did not go far enough and did not sign it. As I have already said, this has had the effect of complicating an area of concern at a time when political developments within the South Pacific region are of a more fragile nature than they have been for many years-and at a time, I might add, when the Soviet Union has directly expressed its interest in the South Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> Premier Gorbachev's speech in Vladivostok a couple of years ago was the first occasion on which the Soviet Union clearly and directly spelled out its interest in the South Pacific. At present Mr Gorbachev is enjoying tremendous support from a great number of people in the West. I can understand that and to a certain extent I support it. I fervently hope that the reforms in the Soviet Union are successful. I think that perestroika and glasnost at least offer the hope and opportunity for some worthwhile progress to be made in opening up that massive Soviet bloc, and I strongly support that. However, that does not mean that one should believe that just because these changes have started to take place the actuality of a proper result has been achieved: it has not. At the present time we have opportunities, we are seeing some worthwhile progress and we support and encourage that. However, that does not mean for a moment that we should relax our efforts, that we should undermine the potential that we have for a proper security arrangement simply on the hope and expectation that what we want to see achieved will be achieved. There is a tremendous distance to go before we can safely say to ourselves, `Well, everything has changed, we need not take these considerations into our minds in the future and we can be certain that the threat which may have been present in the past is totally dissipated'. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not undermine and put at risk Australia's security relationships. The fact of the matter is that with the present instability in countries such as the Philippines there is no long-term guarantee that the bases of our ally the United States will remain in the Philippines. Where do they go if they are not in the Philippines? If some aspects of the nuclear free zone are hardened up from the present situation-and some of the states in the South Pacific want to see that occur-it could restrict the opportunity of the United States properly to deploy its forces. I remind the House that those are the forces of our allies and they are the forces that we would rely on should Australia face a major threat. That is what the Opposition is saying. We are not in the nuclear proliferation business. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the motion of the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) is a nonsense. Australia is, and has been for some years, a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which prevents us, because of our signature to that treaty, from doing so many of the things that the honourable member for Hughes would have us believe the Opposition supports. We are not in the process of stationing nuclear weapons here and we are not in the process of testing nuclear weapons here. That suggestion is simply a nonsense and a political trick by the honourable member for Hughes to try to label Opposition members as right wing reactionaries; we are not. However, we are concerned about the maintenance of proper security arrangements and the maintenance of freedom of effective coordination and action with our allies should Australia's security be threatened in the future. That is not a right wing reaction. That is a proper concern for the fundamental responsibilities of any national government-the protection of the security of the people of this nation. Despite the attacks that the honourable member for Hughes has made on the position of the Opposition, the fundamental fact remains that we are concerned for the maintenance of Australia's future. We believe that that is best achieved by the strong maintenance of our security relationship with our major ally the United States, and we do not want to see anything done which will undermine our capacity to protect that relationship properly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support this motion, which I remind the House reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) supports the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) opposes the (a) stationing of nuclear weapons in Australia; (b) testing of nuclear weapons in Australia; and (c) acquisition or production of nuclear weapons by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I compliment the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) for his very erudite and precise explanation of the reasons why this motion is extremely important to the Australian Labor Party. But I am somewhat confused by the contribution made by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), someone who under normal circumstances takes a very logical approach to the issues before him. He seems to have confused the statements of his Party with his own intentions and desires. </PARA>
<PARA> There is absolutely no doubt that this Government has, as its foremost objective, the national security of this nation. Just as we have moved in a way in which the Opposition has never moved in terms of developing a unique defence and foreign policy, which is designed to make us self-reliant, the Opposition has taken what I believe is a very much head in the sand attitude to the issue of nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the honourable member for Hughes is right; that the Opposition is talking about the stationing of nuclear weapons in Australia. He was correct again when he pointed out that this is another example of the difference between the Opposition and the Government. The choice for the Australian community, as we approach a Federal election perhaps in the next 12 months, is becoming clearer. In major areas of policy there is a dramatic gap between the Opposition and this Government. The honourable member for Hughes mentioned the area of foreign investment, but there are other areas and I will mention them briefly to demonstrate the divergence in attitudes to those issues, which go along with the divergence in attitudes to the development of foreign policy and defence policy by the Government and the Opposition. They are, of course, the areas of Aboriginal affairs, immigration, social justice and, not least, primary production. We are seeing the benefits of that debate presently occurring within the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA> We have come to a period in Australia's political history where the choice has never been so marked, and that has been demonstrated aptly by the Opposition's attitude to the issue of a nuclear free zone in the South Pacific. This nuclear free zone idea is entirely consistent with Australia's position on the general question of nuclear weapons. We are opposed to nuclear weapons. We are opposed to the testing of nuclear weapons. We support disarmament, and we promote it in all areas of the international arena. As a signatory to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, that is consistent with our attitude as a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and it is consistent with our attitude as a signatory to the partial test ban treaty and our commitment to an effectively verifiable comprehensive test ban treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has taken a leading role in the area of nuclear disarmament and in the promotion of a comprehensive test ban treaty. At the United Nations we have done so through crafting a resolution, together with NZ, that in recent years has attracted overwhelming support; at the Conference on Disarmament we urged the establishment of, and demonstration of the capacity and reliability to monitor compliance with, a comprehensive test ban treaty; and domestically, we have established the Australian Seismological Centre and seismic cooperation arrangements with like-minded countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The record of this Government's commitment to nuclear disarmament is not in doubt. It is entirely consistent with that commitment that we should be a signatory to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. I remind the House that the Treaty is open for signature by all members of the South Pacific Forum. Eleven of the 15 members have signed the Treaty: Australia, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, New Zealand, Niue, Tuvalu, Western Samoa, Nauru, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. All of those countries, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, have ratified the Treaty. Vanuatu and Tonga have not yet signed the Treaty, nor have the federated states of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treaty entered into force on 11 December 1986 following the deposit of the eighth ratification-Australia's ratification-of the Treaty. Significantly, the Treaty has three additional protocols which are open for signature by the five nuclear states; that is, the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom, France and China. Protocol 1 provides that the United States, the United Kingdom and France provide key provisions of the Treaty to the South Pacific territories, and protocols 2 and 3 provide for all states to undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against parties to the Treaty and not to conduct nuclear testing in the Pacific. This Treaty in no way inhibits the operations of the ANZUS Treaty and in no way inhibits the present operations of United States forces. This is acknowledged by the United States, contrary to the views that have been expressed by the honourable member for Warringah. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time available to me I want to go back to the position which has been adopted by the Opposition. It is significant that on 10 March 1989 the shadow Minister, the honourable member for North Sydney, distributed to coalition members and senators a draft policy which was referred to by the honourable member for Hughes. That draft document was widely available to the press before the official policy launch. On the eve of the policy launch, on 7 April, a number of stories were published, as the honourable member for Hughes outlined, to the effect that a coalition government would allow nuclear weapons to be based in Australia. For example, Lindsay Olney wrote in the Adelaide Advertiser on 6 April:</PARA>
<PARA> United States nuclear forces could be stationed in Australia under a coalition government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On 7 April we saw this headline in the Canberra Times, `Coalition pledge on nuclear weapons'. This apparently gave the Liberals a bit of a fright and the sentence was redrafted, as the honourable member for Hughes said, to read:</PARA>
<PARA> A Liberal/National Coalition Government will renegotiate the Treaty so as to overcome these restrictions on Australia's freedom of action. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Hughes outlined the support this Treaty, and Australia's position on it, has been given by the independents in the Parliament and by the Australian Democrats and the way in which they have demonstrated their condemnation of the position which has been adopted by the shadow Minister on behalf of his Party. I emphasise that it demonstrates the rift, the difference, the chasm, that exists between the Government and the Opposition on the matter of nuclear weapons. It is very clear, despite the remonstrations of the honourable member for Warringah, that the coalition has decided to allow nuclear weapons to be stationed permanently in Australia. It has been frightened into trying to hide this policy for fear of adverse public reaction. It has tried to hide the policy behind talk of keeping Australia's options open. But why renegotiate the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, as it has suggested it will, to keep this option open if it has no intention of introducing nuclear weapons? Why should the Liberals wish to see nuclear weapons stationed in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> In a press conference of 7 April, the honourable member for North Sydney reportedly said:</PARA>
<PARA> The treaty prevents nuclear-capable forces being available for the purpose of deterring an attack on this country. </PARA>
<PARA>This shows that the honourable member for North Sydney wants US nuclear weapons based in Australia not to contribute to the US global strategic posture, as one might expect from his rhetoric, but to defend Australia. In other words, the honourable member for North Sydney sees Australian territory being defended by American nuclear weapons, not by Australia's defence forces. That is typical of the coalition's defence strategy. It has never taken self-reliance seriously. It has always preferred to be defended by others. Nothing has changed in its strategic policy since the 1950s. Mr Spender is wrong on a point of law. The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty does not prevent nuclear capable forces visiting Australia. The Treaty was carefully negotiated to ensure that. The Treaty fully protects Australia's interests and responsibilities under ANZUS, as former Secretary of State Shultz acknowledged. Lastly, Mr Spender's view of the diplomatic possibilities are hopelessly unrealistic. </PARA>

As the shadow Minister he reflects an opinion which was so clearly articulated by Laurie Oakes in the Bulletin, which indicated that he really has not changed his view from that which the Liberal Party had in 1951 while negotiating the ANZUS Treaty, when his father was Minister for Foreign Affairs. They have still not changed. The Opposition still has a Cold War McCarthyist approach to foreign policy and defence matters, and its attitude on the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty clearly articulates that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While listening to the ramblings of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) I was reminded of that wonderful widely acclaimed biography of our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) by Blanche d'Alpuget. Page 108 gives us an insight into the way the Australian Labor Party works and the chicanery involved in some of its more altruistic comments. She states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Brisbane Calwell announced that Labor's nuclear-free Southern Hemisphere idea had been misunderstood; that in a war the USA would ``give Australia nuclear arms''; and that ``we, the ALP, would use any weapon to defend Australia if attacked''. </PARA>
<PARA>This debate has an air of deja vu or, perhaps more accurately, onions-it keeps repeating itself. We have heard all these arguments before from the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) and from the honourable member for the Northern Territory. They are just as unconvincing and unrealistic this time as they were last time. The honourable member for Hughes reminds me of an anxious bridegroom who needs constant reassurance about his ability to satisfy, although, in this case, the bed is being shared with the Socialist Left. Nothing appeases their insatiable anti-American desires quite as well as another orchestrated opportunity to practise the well-worn collection of alarmist and extremist catchcries and cliches which form the basis of their ongoing and ill-founded campaign against our Western allies, a propaganda campaign that is based on the demonstrably faulty and totally unacceptable premise that we would somehow be better off if we ignored the realities of international politics, and that there are advantages in slamming the door in the face of loyal friends whilst at the same time opening windows of opportunity for those who are ideologically opposed to freedom and democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> That is, basically, what this exercise has been designed to achieve. No one on this side of the House is deceived for one moment about the objectives of the honourable member for Hughes in moving this motion. There is no real need, and no legitimate purpose, in rehashing issues which have already been debated vigorously and thoroughly in this House less than three years ago. But the honourable member is not motivated by need and legitimacy. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, since the matter was first raised there have been some significant changes-both political and economic-in the region in question. But these changes serve only to illustrate that the South West Pacific is both a dynamic and an extremely vulnerable area. In an article on Soviet Pacific-based strike forces, which appeared in Signal, the journal of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association in December 1986, Admiral R. J. Hays observed:</PARA>
<PARA> The southernmost Soviet prong, the South Pacific, is a recent development. Some economically disadvantaged independent nations are vulnerable targets. The Soviets offer attractive economic agreements that have the potential for conversion to economic dependence and then political and military advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Soviet inroads in the South Pacific already have occurred with a fishing agreement with Kiribati and subtle penetration of labour organisations. The next 12 months will likely result in additional fishing agreements, fish processing agreements, landing rights for the Soviet airline Aeroflot, and ship repair and servicing contracts. All the while, Soviet diplomatic activity is increasing throughout the region. </PARA>
<PARA>They are prophetic words. Yet it is against this background of obviously increasing Soviet activity and influence in the South West Pacific region that the honourable member for Hughes would have us agree to a motion that further undermines the security of the region. The honourable member wants us to agree to a proposition which will make the whole area more vulnerable and more unstable. In doing so, he threatens the whole basis of the future security of this nation. That fact, however, has either escaped him, or is of little consequence or concern to him. Unfortunately, I believe the latter is most likely the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty is an excellent example of a wolf in sheep's clothing. Those on this side of the House have no difficulty in recognising this fact. That is why we oppose this motion so vehemently, in the same way, and for the same reasons, that we opposed the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty Bill when it was originally debated in this Parliament in 1986. It may sound good. It may look good. But it is in fact a treacherous document with enormous and frightening implications for democracy, security, stability and freedom in our region. </PARA>
<PARA> In the recently released coalition foreign affairs policy, our unequivocal commitment to renegotiating the terms of this Treaty as they now stand is reaffirmed. I will quote from our policy for the benefit of honourable members opposite, who need to hear something several times before it sinks in. Our policy states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Government's sponsorship of the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty has undermined the Western Alliance, diminished regional stability, and furthered Soviet interests. It is not generally realised how restrictive this Treaty is on Australia's future options. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Treaty (relevant obligations of which have been enacted into law by the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty Act 1986) each party undertakes to prevent in its territory (which includes its territorial waters) the ``stationing'' of nuclear explosive devices. This includes ``transportation on land or inland waters, stockpiling, storage, installation or deployment''. Deployment would ordinarily be taken to include bringing forces into effective action. So understood, and regardless of adverse changes in the international environment, in the future Australia (unless it breached the treaty and repealed relevant provision of the Act) would be prohibited from allowing the stationing or deployment in Australia and its territorial waters of United States nuclear-armed air, sea or ground units. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the policy of the United States is neither to confirm nor to deny the presence of nuclear arms, the result is effectively to exclude from deployment in Australia or Australian waters all United States nuclear-capable forces. </PARA>
<PARA>The policy statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Treaty's prohibition on deployment in Australia or Australian waters of friendly nuclear-armed forces is contrary to our national interests and to our ANZUS obligations. Article 4 of the ANZUS Treaty states that in the event of an armed attack in the Pacific area on any of the parties to the Treaty, each would ``act to meet the common danger in accordance with its Constitutional processes''. Yet if such an attack took place, Australia would be bound to exclude United States nuclear-capable naval, air and ground units from deployment in Australia's land or sea areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's security options should not be so confined. </PARA>
<PARA>This significant section of the policy document concludes with the following commitment:</PARA>
<PARA>A Liberal/National Government will renegotiate the Treaty so as to overcome these restrictions on Australia's freedom of action. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that no-one, certainly not one of us on this side of the House, wants to see or promote any armed attack against any nation in the South Pacific region. We deplore the possibility of such an event happening anywhere in the world. But we have to be realistic. If such an event did occur, we would have to be ready. The honourable member for Hughes would have us unprepared and, therefore, unprotected. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, as a member of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee's South Pacific subcommittee, I had the opportunity to visit many of the South West Pacific nations. The report on this visit-entitled Australia's Relations with the South Pacific-was tabled in this Parliament last month. I would like to briefly refer to some of the statements contained in the report, because they help to clarify the real issues of concern to nations in the region. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Treaty of Rarotonga, establishing the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone, came into force on 11 December, 1986. It represented a significant degree of concern among Pacific Forum nations on a number of nuclear issues-French nuclear testing in the region, proposals for dumping of nuclear waste in the oceans and a wish to keep the region free of super-power rivalry and militarism. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The USSR was the first nuclear power to ratify the Treaty, although initially with some reservations, earning for itself much commendation in the region. Although China has also ratified the Treaty, the attitude of other nuclear powers in the region, Britain, France and the United States, was predictable in their opposition to the establishment of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone. The South Pacific Forum nations have been generally supportive, with two notable exceptions. Vanuatu has not signed the Treaty to date, believing it does not go far enough in its provisions; Tonga, on the other hand, has not signed because of concerns that the Treaty has gone too far and restricts unacceptably the operational ability of the United States and her allies. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to examine in some detail the issues and the concerns of the South-West Pacific nations, and the increasing involvement in the region of non-South Pacific countries, including the Soviet Union. It makes interesting reading. It highlights many of the reasons why the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty-and this also applies to the arguments offered in support of this motion today-is an inappropriate and unrealistic solution to the very real challenges now facing the South-West Pacific nations, and the future implications and challenges resulting from the continued expanding interest and involvement of the Soviet Union in this region. </PARA>
<PARA> During the original debate on this matter, several of my colleagues endeavoured to point out to the Government the obvious deficiencies in the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. The major deficiency is that a real nuclear free zone is not in the best interests of either the security of Australia or the small island nations on our doorstep. I am surprised that honourable members opposite are not able to appreciate or grasp this obvious truth. This ill-advised treaty compromises our national security, because it takes no account of the consequences of what might happen down the track. It limits our ability and the ability of our allies to respond to any adverse changes in the political and strategic environment of a region which is critical to our own security-changes which may pose a very real threat in the long term to Australia and our Western allies. </PARA>
<PARA> Is that what we really want? Do we really want to see an expanding and unchecked Soviet influence, hand in hand with measures which very effectively limit the role of the United States and our other Western allies in this sensitive region? That is what the Treaty of Rarotonga does. No wonder that the Soviets were first in line to sign. This treaty suits the Soviets-they recognise it for what it really is, namely, a method of minimising the role of the United States in the region, while at the same time providing an opportunity to expand their own. It is not really a treaty but a trick-a confidence trick of immense proportions and frightening implications. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion that we are debating today does nothing to prevent nuclear war in our region. It comes into the same category as those optimistic but useless little signs proclaiming various municipalities as being nuclear free zones. This motion is just as futile. It is misleading in relation to the things that will make for stability in our region. It does not guarantee peace; it simply threatens our security. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House of the words of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in regard to this matter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty does nothing now nor indeed into the future to prevent the Soviet Union locating missiles at or about the perimeter of the nuclear free area. Those who argue that in some way having a nuclear free zone in the South Pacific is going to insulate that area from any kind of nuclear incursion simply live in some kind of fantasy land or dream world. Of course, the Opposition condemns French nuclear tests in the South Pacific. That was the policy of the Fraser Government; it was the policy of the Whitlam Government; it is the policy of the Hawke Government; and it remains the policy of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> We have no argument with the opposition expressed by the Government to French nuclear tests, but we have all the argument in the world with the naivety of a government that pretends that, if we put a circle around part of the world and we declare that as a nuclear free zone, in some way we abolish the capacity of any country to intrude nuclear weapons or nuclear activity into that area. It is a complete fantasy concept. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this motion plays on fears and suspicions. It is not an honest or realistic response to the challenges that we are facing in the South-West Pacific region. It seeks to undermine the role of our allies and our own security. Members of the Opposition are in no way advocating the stationing or stockpiling of nuclear weapons in this country and in no way are we in favour of promoting nuclear testing in Australia or in the South Pacific region. We do not want to acquire or produce nuclear weapons. However, any move, such as that outlined in this motion, that seeks to compromise or restrict our obligations, responsibilities and future options in this regard must be totally rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the attitude of Australians to this issue, I quote from the article in Pacific Research as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Over the past three decades opinion polls have revealed a pattern of public support for increased spending on defence, a return to military conscription and even for Australia to have its own nuclear weapons . . . These attitudes remained remarkably constant throughout the early to mid-1980s despite the rise of an energetic peace movement. Ironically, in the late 1980s, when the peace movement is in a state of relative decline, support for peace movement positions has grown dramatically within the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>The table that has been incorporated in Hansard illustrates that point. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The latest polls still show strong (65%) overall public support for the ANZUS alliance but in the youngest group (16-24 years) only 50% support the alliance compared with 75% of the 55+ age group. </PARA>
<PARA>The article also points out how the younger generation is more radical and less defence minded than the older generation, on a wide variety of security issues. On this point, the article states:</PARA>
<PARA>On support for `US communication bases', for example, only 23% of the 16-24 year group wanted to keep the `bases', compared with 52% of the 55+ age group. Women also tend to be considerably more `dovish' on security issues than men. </PARA>
<PARA>That latter finding is no surprise to those of us who have been aware of the overwhelming concern of women on matters of peace and disarmament for a number of years. Generally speaking, their concern is logical and far reaching. It relates to both the present and the future and involves anti-war and pro-environmental components. It is apparent from the survey to which I have referred that Australians do not want to have nuclear weapons stationed in Australia. In other words, the people of Australia agree with the law that this Parliament has passed forbidding such stationing to occur. Australians neither want nor need testing of nuclear weapons in their country or their region. They have learned the lessons presented by Maralinga and they have also learned the lessons presented by the Monte Bello Islands. I whole heartedly support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House condemns the Government for its inept handling of the Wesley Vale issue which led to the abandonment of a $1 billion development and urges the Government to develop a comprehensive set of guidelines for industrial development as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>During the recent debate on the Wesley Vale issue and the development of a pulp mill at Wesley Vale, a great deal of misinformation was forthcoming and many misleading statements were made by a considerable number of groups and individual people. This has totally misled the people-not just in Tasmania but throughout Australia. Added to that confusion is the fact that the issue has been used for political expediency by a great number of people involved in the political processes. In saying that, I am accusing not just governments but a great number of people involved in the political process. </PARA>
<PARA> The end result of the misleading information and misinformation that has been peddled, the use of that issue as a political expedient and the demands that have been placed on the company for the development of a pulp mill at Wesley Vale is that no pulp mill will now be built there. The demands ultimately placed on the company for the development of that mill were simply unachievable and would have resulted in a production process that would not have produced a product saleable on the world market. On that basis, the mill and the resultant production were not economically feasible. As a result, Tasmania has lost a mill, 2,000 jobs have been lost, Australia will not have the development of its own resources and we will continue exporting raw material to the Japanese markets, where those Australian raw materials will be processed into downstream products. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that at the moment Australia exports in excess of three million tonnes of raw woodchips to Japan each year. The proposal for the Wesley Vale mill was that 1.8 million tonnes of those woodchips be processed in Australia into downstream, value-added products. This would still have left 1.2 million tonnes, or thereabouts, of woodchips to be exported to Japan. As a result of not having a mill, we will continue exporting three million tonnes of woodchips to Japan. That product will be used in Japan and ultimately will be processed into paper. We will then buy the paper back from the Japanese. I do not claim to be a brilliant mathematician, but to me that just does not add up. It is not commonsense. If we are to develop the economy of our country and produce jobs for future generations, we must process our own raw materials into downstream products. We cannot export jobs to other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> During this debate today I want to put to rest some of the misinformation and misleading statements made about the paper industry. First let me claim my credentials. At an earlier stage of my working life I worked for Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd (APPM) at its Burnie plant for six years. During that time I had three years working in the production process on the paper machines. For a further two years I worked in the control laboratory. At that stage I was involved in a wide range of technical matters related to the pulp and paper industry. On that basis, I believe that I have far more credentials to be able to talk informatively on this industry than any other member in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Wesley Vale debate it was claimed that APPM, or North Broken Hill Peko Ltd, whichever the proponent was, should be able to use techniques in production that are used in other countries such as in Scandinavia or Canada. Let me put the lie to that. There is a basic difference between what we do in Australia and what Scandinavian mills do. It must be different, because the raw material is different. Our timber is different from Scandinavian timber. The timbers used for the production of pulp and paper in Scandinavia are softwoods, in the main, although some hardwood birch is used. The main difference is the colour. When paper is produced for the world market the buyers of that paper do not care where the paper is produced and they do not care what the production techniques are, but they do demand the same specifications for the end product. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia's paper industry is to compete on the world market with other countries using different raw materials, we have to use different techniques to produce ultimately a similar product that meets the specifications of the world market. To compare our production techniques with those of other countries is simply not to compare like with like. It is totally misleading to say that we in Australia can use the same production techniques used in Scandinavia, Canada or any other country. The simple fact is that our timbers are different and therefore require different treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the techniques used by the Burnie mills. The main difference is that our hardwoods are short-fibred. We have heard some mention of short fibre. I doubt whether anyone in this House really understands what it means. When the components of the wood are broken down into its fibre content, the length of the fibre of our hardwoods is about one-third the length of the softwood timbers that come from Scandinavian countries. That is the first different characteristic. </PARA>
<PARA> The other different characteristic is the colour of the timber. Because the colour is different it requires different treatments to bring it to a comparable whiteness and brightness of the end product, the paper, required by the world market. During the production process the timber is broken down into woodchips about two inches square and about a quarter of an inch thick. Those woodchips are immersed in a solution of caustic soda under high temperature and high pressure. That breaks the fibres apart. The end result of that process is pulp. The pulp is dark grey or brown and totally unsuited to the requirements of the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to bring it to the whiteness and brightness that the world marketplace demands, it has to be further treated with chlorine. All paper mills do that. Even in Scandinavia that is done. I remind my friends opposite that even the Scandinavians use a chlorine bleaching process to bring their product up to the demands of the world market. The only difference in those processes is how much chlorine is used in the bleaching process. It is true that, because Scandinavia's raw material is whiter, the Scandinavian mills use less chlorine. But they still use chlorine to bring their product up to the requirements of the world market. We have to use more chlorine because our timbers are darker. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as APPM or North Broken Hill Peko is concerned, if the world market requires a product that is not as high in brightness and whiteness, if that is the specification of the market place, the company can easily produce it. It is no problem at all. It simply uses less chlorine in its bleaching process. That can be done now, using existing equipment. But there is little point in producing a product that simply does not meet the world specifications and therefore cannot be sold. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Wesley Vale debate all those factors were put on the table in negotiations between the proponents of the Wesley Vale mill and the State Government. At the end of the day, after all those negotiations had taken place, after all of the realities of the world marketplace had been considered, guidelines for the development of that mill and the protection of the environment were drawn up and agreed to between the State Government and the proponents. In the course of those negotiations, the State Premier, Mr Robin Gray, pleaded with the Federal Government to involve itself in and be part of those negotiations so that the agreed guidelines, at the end of the day, would have the approval and the support of both governments-Federal and State. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members might recall the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) sanctimoniously refusing to be part of those negotiations. They said, `No, that is between the company and the State Government. We will not have any part of that. But we will use our powers of export licensing to determine whether the project will go ahead', without anybody knowing what the Federal Government demands would be. What happened in the final result was that the State Government and the proponents of the mill did reach agreement. They did produce guidelines for environmental protection. When the guidelines got to the Federal Government, the Federal Government said, `No, that is not up to our standards; we want standards for this company'. The Government wanted it to use production techniques that would produce a product that is simply unsaleable on the world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The end result was that the company said, `This is impossible. We cannot meet those guidelines and expect to be able to make a profit, expect the mill to be economically feasible, because the product will not sell'. That was the position of the Federal Government. That position has not changed because the Federal Government still has given no indication to North Broken Hill Peko Ltd, Noranda Forest Inc. or to any other industrial proposer about the guidelines for environmental protection that this Government would want for any future proposal. All proposers are still in the dark. The Government still has done nothing about it. It does not matter what proposal is put forward; the proposers still would not know what the Federal Government would be demanding. Shame on it for that. Do not blame the State Government; do not blame the proposers. Blame Senator Richardson and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). They are misleading not only proposers for industrial development but also the entire Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue is being used for political purposes not only by this Government and by Senator Richardson, but also by the environmental politicians. I speak particularly of those people who are standing for the Tasmanian elections. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another midnight meeting, as my colleague says. We do not know what they discussed. We do not know whether any agreements were reached. We do not know what proposals are going to come from that meeting or what demands are going to be put on future development projects for Tasmania. One of the suspicions that has come out is that this Government is going to offer some form of contract to North Broken Bill to produce paper that does not use the chlorine bleaching process. That is fine. I am sure the company would accept that. The company would provide low brightness and low whiteness paper to the Commonwealth Government if the Commonwealth wanted to buy it. But I doubt that the Commonwealth could take up all the production of a new mill. The remaining production that could not be absorbed by the Commonwealth Government would have to go into the marketplace. In the marketplace, if the Commonwealth or anybody else wanted paper of a particular specification, it could be produced. It can be done now. It does not have to be done by a new mill; it can be done by the existing mills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the other furphies that is often thrown into the ring concerns the recycling of paper. We have heard a lot about that from the conservation movement and others on the opposite side of the House. They ask why we do not recycle paper in Australia. I wonder how many people understand that about half of the paper produced in Australia at the moment is from recycled fibre. Paper is being recycled. Recycling is a major industry right now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Politics is sometimes full of ironies and serendipities. It is one of the serendipities of politics that a motion that might have been thought timely and damaging when it was put before the House by the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) some weeks ago now will be a thorn in the side of the Government in Tasmania. The Tasmanian Government is desperately trying to keep the pulp mill issue off the front pages. It is squirming in anguish about the prospect of one or two pulp mills now being built in Tasmania. The prospect that the honourable member for Lyons suggests, that this issue is over as a result of Federal Government intransigence, simply means the honourable gentleman has not read a newspaper-state or national-for the past week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Weekend Australian of 29-30 April carried the headline: `Pulp mill revived in Tas poll shock'. Whose poll shock is it? It is a poll shock that must be sending shivers down the spine of any Liberal Party voter in the State of Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because the Liberal Party has destroyed its credibility. It has been shown consistently to be incompetent and deceitful. It is not just me or the Labor Party which makes that judgment. An editorial in the Australian of 28 February 1989 on this issue prior to the decision being made said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>If Tasmania does, in the end, get a pulp mill that provides new jobs . . . it will be despite, not because of, the Gray Government. </PARA>
<PARA>It was speaking about the backflip on the guidelines that might have had some respectability before they were watered down and turned into the white flag of retreat. Speaking of the Gray Government's bowing to industrial pressure and its complete sell-out of the environment in the State of Tasmania, the article said:</PARA>
<PARA>Evasion and lack of candour, if not downright shiftiness, have been the hallmarks of the Government's actions on the mill. It has created confusion where clarity about the choices involved would probably have won speedy consensus in favour of the mill project. </PARA>
<PARA>The article than proceeded to dismiss, point by point, the kind of shallow nonsense that we have been hearing today. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go through this exercise. The methodology was wrong from the outset. Tasmania has a timber resource. It is a resource that is often overestimated. It has fragility. It has areas which need to be preserved on the National Estate Register, areas which are important on a world scale for the environmental sensitivity. If those areas were taken out, Tasmania would still have a significant resource but it is a resource that has to be tended carefully so that it is not overexploited. </PARA>
<PARA> But what do we have? We do not have a situation where the Tasmanian Government says, `Look, we need some sensible plan for downstream processing'. What happened was that a proposal came along, the Tasmanian Government latched on to that proposal and then admitted no criticism of it. The Tasmanian Government did not offer the resource in any way to the most productive tendering process. It did not look at alternative uses. It did not expose the process to public scrutiny. It rammed through legislation in the State Parliament, taking the proposal out of the normal environmental and planning appeal processes. It then enacted its own set of guidelines. When the companies jacked up and said, `Look, we don't like what you have done; you have given us a bit of a hard time on the environment', the Government did a 180-degree backflip. It caved in. It made substantial revisions of the guidelines but deceitfully maintained that it had made no changes. It said, `There has not been a backdown; there has been no cave-in to the commercial interests involved'. That is implausible nonsense. It then had the cheek to send along to this Parliament spokespersons like the honourable member for Lyons to plead a case on behalf of those very companies. It is really a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> We can see why the electors of Tasmania in all the polls that have been published recently are repeatedly saying that they are fed up with the Gray Government. They are unfortunately being pushed into a position where it is possible that Independents will hold not only a balance of power but many seats on the simple basis that the Government has so confused this issue that the basic sensible position of the Opposition in Tasmania has been inadequately understood. This issue really goes right to the core of Tasmanian politics. We see here a gambler's mentality. Tasmania has economic difficulties. When the Gray Government went to the polls in the last election it said that job creation was its No. 1 priority. That is what it was about-job creation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tasmania is the only State in Australia which has gone backwards, where there has been a net loss of jobs. It is the only place in Australia where economic performance has been in reverse. This Tasmanian Government, like the gambler that keeps on losing, is looking for the one big win-the one win that will fix it, the big fix. It was looking to dam the Franklin and have hydro-electric power. It wanted to sell out the environment and sell off its assets. It does not give a damn about those things. The gambler lost on that. The gambler says, `Look, after three years of failure in economic policy we are going to throw the dice again. We are going to invest it all in a project of dubious environmental soundness. We will throw the dice on the mill'. Gray does it and he loses again. But who is really losing? It is Tasmanians who are losing and we have only to look at the sorry statistics to see why.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Tasmanian unemployment rate stands at 9.7 per cent, 3.1 per cent above the national average. Twenty per cent of our young people cannot find work. Employment continues to fall in contrast to the national trend. Tasmania has the lowest growth in building approvals of all the States. In 1988 motor vehicle registrations in Tasmania grew by only 3.9 per cent, compared with a national rise of 15.5 per cent. Tasmania's population grew by only 470, or 0.1 per cent, in 1987-88, compared with a national increase of 1.7 per cent. The State experienced a net loss of 3,434 jobs in 1987-88. In the year to September 1988 Tasmania received only 2.18 per cent of national private investment. This is the mark of an economic strategy which does not exist. The gambler throws the dice and sends his representatives into the Federal Parliament to say, `Look, if we had only got this one up it would all have been all right'. What nonsense! The Tasmanian Government talks about its non-existent economic strategy. But, like a desperate gambler, it is prepared to risk what does not exist and it wants to sell off the house and clothes and hock the future on a project that it hopes will somehow bring home the bacon with a spin of the wheel. That is nonsense. That is not an economic strategy; it is fairyland. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the Wesley Vale mill was a project that the developers pulled the plug on. In negotiations after the Federal Government said that the Tasmanian guidelines were not adequate, Noranda said it could live with tighter guidelines but it was not going to negotiate. Why? Because in Canada the pressure is on Noranda. What sort of company is Noranda? Again, I do not want to use my words to describe the Noranda company, so let me quote from an editorial in the Canberra Times. It says. </PARA>
<PARA> But before they get too excited they would do well to consider Noranda's track record which is not quite as white as the paper pulp it hopes to produce at Wesley Vale. . . Noranda has the distinction of having one smelter that is North America's second-largest contributor to acid rain. It has also been linked to the technique known as `job blackmail' which involves threatening to close mills and put people out of work if environmental guidelines are considered too rigid. </PARA>
<PARA> The consortium's actions thus far have done little to help its case, and where the Tasmanian Government has wilted under its corporate pressure the federal Government should not. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course it should not. The other point is that Noranda kept on saying, `In Canada we do it well; we do not have any impact on the environment'. It wrote letters to people in Tasmania saying this. But in another irony three fisheries where its effluent is discharged were closed, again, just before a decision was going to be announced in the Tasmanian Parliament. This is the shameful record that the honourable member for Lyons seeks to glorify and say that we have acted improperly in regard to. What nonsense! The reality is that the Labor Party in Tasmania has an economic strategy that will give Tasmania new directions through the creation of a new area of community involvement in economic development, the development of a dynamic enterprising economy, new export orientation to put more quality Tasmanian products on to the national and international markets, new training and employment initiatives designed to lift the skill level of Tasmanian workers, and better use of control of our financial and government resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The important programs that have been announced by Labor leader Michael Field include a Tasmanian economic partnership with strategies involving all aspects of the community and based on better and more effective relations with the Federal Government. There is one thing that should be plain-in this whole debacle the Gray Government's incompetence and its bullying tactics and inability to know that it had to work out a constructive relationship with the Federal Government contrasted with previous successful Labor governments in Tasmania. By contrast I remember Eric Reece. In the times when there was a Liberal Government nationally Eric, as leader of the Tasmanian Labor Party, would always give credit when it was due and he could always work with the national government. Tasmania benefited. We now have small-minded, shamefully deceitful leaders in the State of Tasmania, refusing to be cooperative, refusing any partnership with the Federal Government and determined to go on their way but doing it to the great detriment of the State of Tasmania and the people of Tasmania. There is no doubt that in the State election that is forthcoming the Gray Government will lose savagely. Seats will be slashed from it. We have only to look at the seat of Lyons to see the predicament the Federal member would be in if the polling figures that are now being published were reflected in national elections. There will not be a Liberal member for Lyons after the next Federal election if those polling figures are reflected. </PARA>
<PARA> We should look at the knocking and the lack of imagination as to what might happen. Tasmania does have a forest resource that needs downstream processing. The idea has been floated by the honourable member for Lyons that the Hawke Government might issue contracts and could use some unbleached paper. But he even knocks that proposal. He knocks anything that might mean the Tasmanian environment could be put compatibly in a picture with sound economic development. Instead he is looking backwards; trying to defend the indefensible. He is looking to support industrial development that savages the environment while thinking that this is in some way an economic or development strategy. It is not. These days we must balance environment and employment. The world is our environment. If we defile it and allow it to be ruined, our generation and future generations will be the losers. There are sensible ways through it. We need to look sensibly at downstream processing of our economic timber resources. To put forward the nonsense motion with which the honourable member for Lyons is seeking to criticise the Government, which has been right and has protected the environment and ultimately will be seen to have also protected jobs, is just the kind of backward-looking negative nonsense that this Parliament should absolutely condemn. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You sit in the Cabinet, Minister. Let us not forget what happened on the day that the Wesley Vale pulp mill came to an end. It went to the Cabinet room and it was thought by Cabinet that the company would agree with the suggested guidelines and that it would proceed. Senior Ministers said afterwards in the corridors that they could not believe it, they thought the mill would proceed. They were totally surprised when the company turned around finally and said that those guidelines could not be met economically. It was a matter of economics. The Cabinet knew that this pulp mill was needed, not just by Tasmania but by Australia, and that is why editorial writers of the time described it as a debacle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is all right for people to stand up in this place and say, `You are at fault'. I think that the blame can be shared in a couple of quarters and those members who have been objective about what happened will have to agree with me. But do not let us hear Tasmanian representatives saying that it is all the Tasmanian Government's fault. What has happened is a tragedy for Australia-that is the starting point and it ought not to be forgotten. This was the largest single manufacturing project ever contemplated in Australia-and it is lost. Australia is on an economic slippery slide-let no-one try to convince us otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania has a population of 450,000 people. I can quote figures which I have quoted in this chamber ad nauseam. Tasmania has taken a disproportionate amount of cutbacks under Commonwealth funding than has any other State, by about 3 per cent across the board. Tasmania does not have a rapid increase in population. Do honourable members know how many people we get under the business migration program? Very few-one or two. Tasmania is a very small island yet its contribution to the wealth of this nation since Federation, as the figures show, has been as a net exporter. It has constantly added to the value of this nation. The Wesley Vale pulp mill would have been a gain-it would have added value, something which all of us in this place want to do; but it fell apart at the last moment. So do not say that it is the Tasmanian Liberal Government's fault, because it is not. Anyone who says otherwise is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there has been a little bit of premature rejoicing in the current political situation. In the sober dawn of just before the election, honourable members will find that people will realise that they have to make a choice. It is a difficult choice-no-one would deny that-of which direction Tasmania should go. Should it go towards sustainable yield policies and a balanced development of resources, which is what the Liberal Government puts forward? I might add that even the Labor Party in Tasmania says the same thing, in part. There is not as great a difference of opinion as some speakers in this debate would indicate. Should Tasmania go down that path, or should we turn our backs on that type of development? If Tasmania wants balanced development and sustainable yield policies, and if it wants economic growth-and all of us are driven by the need to continue economic growth in times of very difficult economic circumstances-then there has to be development. The question is: how does one go about managing that development? The management of balanced development and a balanced approach is the nub of the argument about the Wesley Vale pulp mill, environmental issues and the role of the independents. </PARA>
<PARA> My view is that the balance has shifted too far towards embracing issues of the environment. Honourable members in this place know that environmental issues are difficult. One has only to look at the difficulties faced by the Government in relation to the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities. We all want mining in Antarctica not to take place. There are two paths to that situation: one is to say `no convention', and the other is, `Yes, have a convention'. The Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) supports it and there are people with different views on this side of the House as well. However, this indicates that the issue of finding a balanced way to meet environmental needs and development needs requires some complexity of argument; it cannot be embraced by simplistic approaches. I fear that in Tasmania simplistic approaches have been embraced by the independents. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it not interesting that only yesterday in Hobart standing shoulder to shoulder with the leader of the Labor Party was Senator Richardson, the noted knee-capper of the Labor Party. What did he say? He said the very thing that I have just said: that this problem does not lend itself to simplistic approaches. There needs to be a balance and, above all, there needs to be stability, so do not vote independent, vote for either of the major parties. That is what will happen, and the balance of the numbers will come out in favour of the Liberal Party, because other issues need to be addressed; primarily, the issue of stability needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a nation which is on an economic slippery slide, where the national debt is rivalling that of Mexico. Unemployment is high and Tasmania is suffering. Exports need to be increased and import substitution needs to be improved. The Wesley Vale pulp mill would have provided us with that opportunity. Interest rates are three times those of our major trading partners and they are impacting on family budgets. If one talks to families one will realise how difficult they are finding it in conjunction with the blow-out of health costs. These are the issues that the people are concerned about. When they see that there is a possibility of instability, that there will be more elections and when the hard decisions about these matters are not being addressed because of diversions, they will come back and vote for stability. Mark my words-it will happen. There will not be a hung parliament in Tasmania; there will be a clear majority. </PARA>
<PARA> It is recognised by this Government's own polling and by its own Party-Federal and State-that this will not happen. Their left wing trendies stabbed Neil Batt in the back. They ditched the former president of their Party and I predict that he will lose his seat in Hobart. The former Leader of the Senate in the Whitlam Government, Ken Wriedt, who was also a former Leader of the State Labor Party, will also lose his seat. Unfortunately, Ken Wriedt is a tired person. Those two people took the approach of balanced development. They did not go the trendy route and grab the latest headlines and the latest feeling in the community; they wanted balanced development. They are pragmatic men who could see what was needed, and they knew that Tasmania was suffering economically. Unfortunately, their arguments were not listened to. The community will not listen now to their arguments because the Labor Party in Tasmania will not allow them the opportunity to put those balanced views. That is a tragedy for the Tasmanian Labor Party because Michael Field will be defeated and Patmore will come through and take over. He will take the Labor Party into the wilderness for a long time, and for the Labor Party that must be a matter of regret. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, the Wesley Vale pulp mill could be a turning point for Australia. There is some uncertainty as to which way Tasmanian voters will go. I have my view and those on the other side of the House have their view. But let me say this: this country, which is, as I said, on an economic slippery slide and which knows that it must respond to those pressures-which, after all, is the role of the Federal Government-is now confronted with the twin dilemma of maintaining growth and of adding value to resources, and it must do this on a sustainable yield basis and protect the environment. In my view, and I think that of the Federal Government, this can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at what happened in this place yesterday. The Government introduced the Resource Assessment Commission Bill. I cannot pre-empt debate on this matter, but this commission recognises that there was a failure at Wesley Vale. It recognises that the Federal Government failed to publish guidelines in advance. It recognises that people were going in a hundred different directions. This Bill may be an advance-it recognises a glaring gap in the development of balanced resources in this nation. For people on the other side to say that it is all Tasmania's fault when only yesterday this Bill which recognises a major failure was introduced, is hypocritical in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other points I want to mention before resuming my seat. At Question Time yesterday there was a disgraceful response from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, and the Minister for Employment and Education Services, Mr Duncan. I have never heard anything so destructive and inaccurate since I have been in this chamber. An attack was made on the unemployed in Tasmania-on people who are suffering. I was in Launceston recently when the Minister for Employment and Education Services opened up the new employment agency and the new employment programs. He recognised then, in a sober moment of proper reflection, that all over the nation we needed to develop programs that could help young people to get into work. But yesterday we saw cheap political point scoring from him and from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who again referred distortedly to retention figures. He said that in getting young people to stay longer in school, Tasmania started from a lower base than anywhere else. If one has a close look at the figures, one sees that Tasmania has achieved more in a shorter period than any other State. For him to say what he did and to decry Tasmanian youth and the efforts that they are making was a deplorable display and a blatant exercise in stupid political point scoring that showed no sensitivity to the people and the programs that he, as a Minister, is trying to help and administer. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that if Tasmania's young people heard those two points they would be appalled. To make flippant remarks about Tasmania exporting apples and about its future was a deplorable response to complex problems which require a sincere and long effort from governments and parties on both sides. The Minister really was debasing the whole issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, to go back to Wesley Vale-it was a tragedy. Tasmania was the major loser. We hope to recover that ground and see a mill proceed at some time in the future. More importantly, we are not the only ones who hope that it will proceed; most of the Federal Labor Party hope it will proceed because our balance of payments problems and our economic problems are monumental. The people who have been in the driving seat and are leading us down that economic slippery slide are on the other side of the House. A bit of genuine concern about Tasmania would not go astray at this time from Ministers in the Hawke Government. </PARA>

<PARA> We have had a bit of electioneering here today in the speeches of a couple of honourable members from Tasmania. One has only to contrast what is happening in Tasmania with what has happened in Victoria. Things have changed dramatically. In Victoria, we have a tremendous growth. One has only to look around the city of Melbourne. Buildings are going up; there is work. We cannot get enough people in Victoria. It there are any Tasmanians listening to this who need a job-if the Gray Government has not found them a job-they should come over to Victoria because we need as many people as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> It was mentioned that Ken Wriedt, one of the members of the Tasmanian Parliament, looked tired. The Liberal Government down there is so tired that its members cannot wake up to what is happening; they just do not know what is going on down there. Tasmania is a very beautiful island. I have visited it many times. It is magnificent; it is of world importance. It must be protected. The national parks have been set aside, and they are something that future generations from all over the world will come to look at. The people of Tasmania also have a very pleasant and relaxed lifestyle-different from some of the conditions here on the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems with the Gray Government and the problem of Wesley Vale started with Lake Pedder. That was the first environmental issue in Australia. That greatly raised the profile of the environment, which is now one of the top three issues of concern. It is more important to many people than how many dollars a particular opposition party can offer them or bribe them with. We must not forget that the Gray Government wanted to dam the Gordon below Franklin. The all-up cost of that particular effort would have been about $1.4 billion. The new head of the Hydro-Electric Commission in Hobart has said that not one watt of the power that would have been provided by the Gordon below Franklin dam is needed. Events since 1983 have proved that correct. The Gray Government wanted another great project, costing $1.4 billion. I cannot remember how much Wesley Vale would have cost, but it was a lot of money. </PARA>

<PARA> I would like to look at a little of the history of Wesley Vale. What we have heard this morning is not correct. The honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) and the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) said that the Federal Government had set no guidelines. But in February 1988 North Broken Hill Peko Ltd officials met with Federal Ministers to outline plans for a pulp mill. In May 1988 North Broken Hill wrote to the Federal Government saying that it had found a partner-Noranda Forest Inc.-and that agreements were needed from State and Federal governments. In July 1988 the Federal Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT) officials met with North Broken Hill. On 12 July 1988-this is just a couple of months later-30 pages of draft guidelines for preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS) were sent to the Tasmanian Department of Environment. The guidelines were sent on 12 July 1988. It is wrong to suggest they were never sent. On 25 July 1988 DASETT officials met with Tasmanian departmental officials, the joint venturers and their environmental consultants to discuss the details of the guidelines for the preparation of the EIS. The whole premise of the argument of the honourable member for Lyons was that there were no guidelines. The guidelines were drafted back in July 1988. These are the facts. I just cannot believe that honourable members can get up here and misrepresent these facts so greatly. </PARA>
<PARA> On 18 August 1988 the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, announced a package of financial incentives to assist the development of the mill, including accelerated depreciation, et cetera. On 23 August the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wrote to Premier Gray referring to previous discussions between Commonwealth and Tasmanian Ministers. On 17 October 1988 the Tasmanian Government signed a contractual agreement with North Broken Hill to allow the mill to be built. On 24 October 1988 the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, visited the site and met with the companies. He said that he would only recommend approval if he was satisfied that the mill was environmentally sound. On 27 October the EIS was released to the public. On 24 November the Tasmanian Government put through the fast-tracking legislation concerning the Northern Pulp Mill Agreement. This removed the appeals procedures from the EIS process. The Tasmanian Government said, in effect, `We are not going to have anyone speak out against what we have said'. It intended to gag everyone who wanted to appeal against the decision. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a bit of movement over Christmas and then on 5 January 1989 the Tasmanian Government's environmental controls and guidelines were made public. However, North Broken Hill was critical of them and wanted them changed. On 6 January 1989, Tasmanian Environment Minister Hodgman said that the guidelines were `fit and proper'. On 10 January 1989, the Tasmanian Government introduced guidelines for the environmental management plan. On 31 January 1989, North Broken Hill and Noranda said that they would shelve the project unless the guidelines were changed by 3 February. The companies said that the guidelines contained requirements which were not technically possible to meet. In other words, they were saying. `If you do not do what we want you to do and what we tell you to do, we will not build this $1 billion project'. It is called blackmail. </PARA>
<PARA> On 1 February 1989, Premier Robin Gray said that according to technical advice that he had received the guidelines could be met. Surprise, surprise! On 3 February 1989, there was an announcement on a North Broken Hill letterhead-not from the Tasmanian Government, but on a North Broken Hill letterhead-that Parliament would be recalled `early in the week commencing  13 February' to `approve legislation designed to clear the way for the project to proceed'. The legislation was to be `jointly agreed to by the companies and the Government'. Just who is running Tasmania? Is it the Liberal Government or is it North Broken Hill? It appears that North Broken Hill wanted Parliament to meet, so it sent out a letter over its letterhead telling everyone that Parliament would be recalled. I do not know what the Speaker of the Tasmanian Parliament had to say about that, but obviously he must have concurred. </PARA>
<PARA> On 8 February 1989, the Department wrote to North Broken Hill seeking clarification on issues, and it mentioned dioxin emissions, chlorine, and so on. On 16 February 1989, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories met with company representatives to discuss concerns. On 21 February 1989, the Tasmanian Government signed a new pulp mill agreement incorporating more than 40 changes. On 6 March 1989, the head of Noranda said that the project would be shelved by the companies if any changes were made to the guidelines-another billion dollar blackmail attempt. On 9 March 1989, the Tasmanian Parliament ratified the Doubts Removal Bill, which incorporated new interpretations. This is a saga of pure and unadulterated blackmail of the Tasmanian Government by Noranda. On 15 March 1989, Senator Richardson, Senator Button and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) met with the companies who then announced the withdrawal from the project. This is the sort of thing that has been happening in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> People seem to have forgotten the history behind this issue and they tend to forget the amount of leverage that this company was applying to the Tasmanian Government. It would not happen to any other government in Australia, but it happened in Tasmania. Why? It happened because the Tasmanian Government has done nothing for its industries over the years that it has been in power. In fact, Tasmania is losing its people to the rest of Australia and it cannot build up any industry. Why? It is because it is weak. Tasmania needs a new government and a premier who can stand up to these large companies, someone who has a bit of forethought, who can look to the future a bit and who will balance these things. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A chap called Field, the Tasmanian Opposition Leader. In a couple of weeks, when he becomes Premier of Tasmania, he will do a good job. I can assure the honourable member for Braddon of that. In the short time I have left I will give the house an example of the type of reply that came from North Broken Hill to questions asked by the Federal Government. The Tasmanian Government wrote to North Broken Hill outlining 85 matters set out in environmental impact statement guidelines which were either inadequately addressed or not addressed at all in the EIS. For example, studies were requested and the company was told that the outfall site must be specified and mapped and the dilution and dispersal of effluent must be predicted. In reply, the company supplied an addendum to its EIS, but it was far from satisfactory. For example, the company said that it would not carry out some studies until approval was given for the project-another nice little bit of blackmail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The company has since said that environmental issues should have been cleared up earlier in the process, and it simply disagreed with some of the queries and criticised the government departments which made them. A detailed question was asked about the design and location of the outfall site, which I would have thought was pretty important because it incorporates the pipe that will spew out into Bass Strait dioxin, chlorine and the combination of chemicals that come from paper mills. I have seen pictures of these sites and they are pretty horrendous. As I said, in answer to one detailed question relating to the design and location of the outfall site, the company provided a seven-word statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that the outlet pipe from a huge complex like this, which will put millions of litres of all sorts of chemicals into Bass Strait, deserved a bit more than a seven-word answer. That is the sort of disdain some of these huge multinational companies from overseas have for Australia, which they think is still part of the frontier. They think they can rape and pillage the environment and get away with it, but I am glad to say that that is not the case. I am glad to say that the people of Tasmania have woken up to this. But there are many things still happening in Tasmania that need to be looked at, for instance, the woodchip freight trains that travel through the back of Burnie in the middle of the night at midnight and 1 a.m. These sorts of things still happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision by Noranda not to build, I think, was brought about by the Gray Government. It just did not know what to do. I believe that the Liberal Government of Tasmania advised North Broken Hill and Noranda incorrectly. In fact, I think that this has been stated by some key North Broken Hill people. The turning, weaving and twisting of the Liberal Government in Tasmania over this Wesley Vale issue and what it has come out with lately is all about trying to stop Christine Milne and the other green party people from winning a seat in the district of Lyons. This situation is occurring in the Lyons district, which is where the Premier has his seat. I trust that when the Tasmanians go to the polls in a couple of weeks time we see a change in government. I do not know why some members of this Federal Parliament support Robin Gray, because he has never supported them. People should look at the history of this type of issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tenth of February this year marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of one of the worst disasters in the peacetime history of the Royal Australian Navy. I speak of the collision between the destroyer HMAS Voyager and the aircraft-carrier and flagship HMAS Melbourne off Jervis Bay on the New South Wales south coast, claiming 82 lives of all ranks in Voyager, including the commanding officer, Captain Duncan Stevens. Once again I take the opportunity to highlight on the public record this historic, albeit black, event. On that fateful night it is now clear that for those involved there was a mixture of understandable fear, of disregard for personal safety, of mutual trust of shipmates, of bravery and, regrettably, of personal sacrifice and death-characteristics we have come to respect and honour in the great and proud traditions of the thousands of men and women in Australian naval service in peace and war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today I pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the service of their country that evening, to those who survived and continue about their everyday lives, and very specially to their families. Regrettably, many of those survivors and their families still bear the scars of the tragedy-scars of psychological trauma, of persistent nervous shock, of domestic instability, of financial strain and, importantly in this parliamentary setting, of misplaced confidence in, and neglect by, a government which espouses social justice, but demonstrably fails in this instance and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I wish to draw the attention of the House to the case of one survivor, Mr Bernard Verwayen, a totally and permanently incapacitated pensioner of Buderim on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, whose fight for justice has already cost him $100,000 and has placed him on the verge of bankruptcy. Late last year, after a lengthy battle, Mr Verwayen gained approval of the Full Bench of the Victorian Supreme Court to sue the Commonwealth for damages resulting from the Voyager disaster. Many in the legal profession considered that the decision would provide a precedent for other survivors, totalling about 100, to follow. </PARA>
<PARA> I would remind the House of the history of the Voyager damages claims since this self-satisfied Government took office. Firstly, in 1985 the Government, through the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley), admitted liability in relation to at least six, and arguably all, survivors, to waive the statute of limitations to allow common law action. After two successful common law actions, involving damages pay-outs of nearly $500,000 it did a rapid about-face and moved to reapply the statute of limitations which prevents action being taken if seven years or more has elapsed since the accident. This was used as a defence against the claim of Mr Verwayen. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1986, the Government altered regulations to facilitate the imposition of the statute of limitations in relation to Voyager claims. About the same time it took certain psychiatric examination measures with some of the claimants but did not continue when the results were clearly in favour of the claimants. In December 1987, Mr Justice O'Bryan of the Victorian Supreme Court, although critical of the Government's behaviour, ruled that the Commonwealth was entitled to rely on the statute of limitations to bar the claim of Mr Verwayen. I also refer honourable members to the Hansard record of this place on 9 December 1987, in which the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) defended the Government's change of mind in 1985, at the same time imputing ulterior motives of those involved, including legal counsel. Of the latter he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Is it not a fact that a firm of lawyers in Melbourne decided that it might be an opportunity to ginger up a bit of business?</PARA>
<PARA>He also said that the Government had not admitted liability, whereas the court record and correspondence on the matter shows that this is untrue. I strongly reject those imputations on behalf of the people concerned and specifically on behalf of legal counsel, who are present in the Gallery today. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1988 the Full Bench of the Victorian Supreme Court overturned Mr Justice O'Bryan's decision, clearing the way for Mr Verwayen to continue his claim. In handing down this decision, Mr Justice Kaye and Mr Justice Marks said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The facts of the case disclose effectively a promise by the respondent not to seek to have Mr Verwayen's claim barred under the Victorian Limitation of Actions Act. There can be little doubt that the promise was made deliberately and with the knowledge and intention that Mr Verwayen pursue his claim and have his damages assessed. </PARA>
<PARA>In March 1989 three members of the High Court of Australia granted the Commonwealth leave to appeal to that court against the Victorian Supreme Court ruling. I understand that this will take about a year to decide. In April 1989 the Government introduced into this House the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Bill-which we will support in this place later today-allowing a twelvefold increase in maximum compensation for loss of life or personal injury to passengers, including ships' companies of naval ships, on the surface a very commendable initiative by the Government but seemingly at major odds with its persistence in its appeal to the High Court in the Verwayen case, where the same principles are at stake. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government appears to be alarmed that this Voyager case will cost it some money-money which it should properly pay, and without further delay, if it desires to return any vestige of honour and of decency as regards its handling of these matters. The public feelings in these matters are best demonstrated in the words of a letter to the Melbourne Sun on 26 April from the brother of one of those lost, which concludes with the words:</PARA>
<PARA> `I ask the people of Australia to let Voyager and her lost crew finally rest in peace by pressuring the Government to stop its scandalous behaviour and allow the survivors the opportunity to put their case before the courts, so that justice can finally be seen to be done. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to assure Mr Verwayen and the Voyager families that the next coalition Government-and that is not far away-will not hide behind the statute of limitations as the Government has chosen to do. We will allow those damages claims to proceed in the courts and provide the long overdue justice for those concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance this afternoon concerns the ridiculous situation where we have the Opposition criticising this Government on the subject of tax policy. The Opposition does not even have a tax policy. It keeps promising to outline where it stands on taxation, and never does. Who can blame it? Its record is nothing to be proud of. The only growth industry that the Opposition ever fostered was that of tax evasion-the bottom of the harbour schemes. It allowed the taxation system to deteriorate over a number of years to the point that it was unfair and open to abuse. The Opposition nurtured a tax system which encouraged its mates to earn their income in forms that went untaxed. While the average wage and salary earner sees only what is left after the tax man has taken his share, the Opposition felt that paying tax should be optional for its mates. These weaknesses in the tax system meant that ordinary taxpayers were asked to shoulder an unfair share of the nation's tax burden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Howard-Fraser Government not only left this country with a tax system which was riddled with loopholes and tax havens, and thus was not effective in gathering its tax, but it burdened pay as you earn (PAYE) taxpayers, that is, the ordinary working class people, with high marginal tax rates. Treasurer Howard crippled the lowest income earners with a lowest tax rate of 30c in the dollar, which then jumped to 46c in the dollar at a salary level of only $19,500. Then those who earned above $35,788 were required to pay 60c in every dollar earned; what is more, because the tax system was riddled with holes people in these higher tax brackets could find ways simply not to pay their personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This Labor Government, in comparison, has reformed the tax system over its period of office, making it both more efficient and more equitable for everybody. This Labor Government has restored some equity to marginal tax rates. People earning less than $20,600 will have to pay only 29c in the dollar from 1 July 1989; people earning between $20,600 and $35,000 will pay only 39c in the dollar; and the top rate has been slashed from 60c to 49c, soon to be 47c in the dollar. Not only have we provided these honest taxpayers with some relief from their tax burden but also we have placed an enormous amount of resources into catching the tax cheats. By making everyone pay his fair share we can reduce the load previously placed solely on the shoulders of PAYE taxpayers. Let me remind the people of Australia that by the taxing of capital gains and the taxing of fringe benefits, an attack on the exploitation of entertainment expenses including the free lunch, we have recouped another $1 1/2 billion in taxation each year from stopping these rorts-$1 1/2 billion that has been redirected to the most needy in our communities. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the other measures we have put in place to tackle those tax cheats are: a series of legislative measures that have stopped the proliferation of bottom of the harbour schemes; the general anti-avoidance measures contained in part IVa of the Income Tax Assessment Act; a series of changes in relation to retirement lump sums and superannuation that broadened the tax base and removed avenues for avoidance and deferral; the introduction of the anti-evasion prescribed payments system; substantiation requirements that curtailed the allowance of deductions for expenditures not incurred and aided the process of self-assessment; the imputation system that, by removing the effective double taxation of company profits, removed distortions in the system, including pressure for business to operate through non-corporate forms; the anti-evasion upgraded tax file number system; and the strengthening of mechanisms for the collection of tax, increasing the level of penalty for breaches of the taxation law, and modernising provisions for the prosecution of such breaches. </PARA>
<PARA> This Labor Government has also given the Commissioner of Taxation additional staff and funding to assist him in his efforts in combating tax avoidance and evasion. The Tax Office has dramatically increased its auditing efforts in order to catch tax avoidance and evasion. There are audit teams set up to check every level of the taxpayer community equally. No section of the community, large or small, can afford to think it can escape the gaze of the Tax Commissioner. Companies trying to avoid paying their fair share of tax now run a much greater risk of being caught, thanks to determined action by the Hawke Government. In 1987-88 there were between 300 and 400 Tax Office auditors working on the company audit program. Over the next three years, this number will grow to nearly 1,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The expanded company audit program will concentrate initially on Australia's 100 largest company groups. Some large companies now have Tax Office auditors permanently located in their head offices, going through the books, making sure that the right amount of tax is paid. By June 1990 there will be 100 large company group audits under way. The increasing emphasis being placed on company audits under this Government has already produced spectacular results. While company tax revenue has doubled under this Government, extra tax collected from companies through special audits has increased 4 1/2 times to nearly $400m this year. This increased effort on the part of the Commissioner of Taxation has brought him under attack from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). The Leader of the Opposition proposes to replace the Commissioner of Taxation with a board of five people who would be drawn from the private sector. That is wonderful! The Leader of the Opposition wants the tax system to be run by a group of corporate tax experts whose interests lie in defending the interests of that very sector. How can the Opposition consider that to be an impartial set? Nobody would agree to that. No-one in his right mind would place any confidence in such an arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> The money we have collected in tax avoidance has been used for social justice. Since coming to power in 1983 this Government has done much to implement its commitment to achieve a fair and just society, a society in which economic resources are distributed fairly. The taxation system has been central in allowing the Government to carry out these promises. The tax system enables the Government to collect the levels of revenue considered necessary to provide the services that the Australian community needs and deserves. All this extra revenue, which is collected by the diligent Tax Office, has enabled remarkable progress in areas such as family assistance and age pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to age pensions, this Labor Government has allowed the full indexation of pensions in comparison to the restraint being exercised by the rest of wage and salary earners. It has allowed an increase in the single pension rate from 22.7 per cent of average weekly earnings in 1983 to 24.7 per cent in December 1988. The 12 April economic statement announced increased pensioner tax rebates so that age pensioners with earnings within the earning test free area of $40 for single pensioners and $70 for married couples pay no tax at all. When fully phased in by July 1990, this major reform will mean that 80 per cent of Australia's 1.8 million age and service pensioners will be exempt from tax. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, major improvements have been made in assistance to low income families under this Government. The family assistance supplement (FAS) was introduced in 1987, benefiting some 550,000 low income and pensioner and beneficiary families, with a total of over one million children benefiting. There is also increased assistance to low income families renting privately, including large increases announced in the 1988-89 Budget which will, for example, double current maximum levels of assistance with those with three or more children by 1990. The family allowance supplement increases will provide, as part of the social wage, major improvements in assistance for most families. A two-child family, for example, will receive an additional non-taxable $5.25 a week assistance-an increase of 41 per cent-from this measure alone. This Government will also, for the first time ever, index FAS each January so that the Government's major commitment to assisting all families with children is maintained over time. </PARA>
<PARA> One needs guts, discipline and determination to succeed in government. It is not easy, but we have had the courage to accept the challenges and make the tough decisions. I am proud to be part of this Australian Labor Party Government. I say to the cynics who say that the Labor Party has changed that it has not; it is the same Labor Party that Chifley talked about when he gave his `light on the hill' speech; it is the same Labor Party that gave us the great reforming Government of the 1970s under Gough Whitlam; it is the same Party that Australians have always called upon in times of difficulty: the Australian Labor Party. It has not had to change its name; its history goes back to the last century. All members of the Party are important. They are the people who keep members of parliament like me going; they keep the Government in office. As long as they believe in the Party and the things we stand for and as long as they are prepared to keep giving their time, energy and loyalty to this great cause of ours, Australia is in good hands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to comment on the treatment of Tasmania by the Federal Labor Party in regard to taxation revenue sharing arrangements. I take issue with one or two of the comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil). I point out that this is the highest taxing government that Australia has ever had. In the last few weeks, of course, the Government has said that it will hand back $5.9 billion to Australians. I point out to the people who are listening to the broadcast of this debate that in the Budget brought down in August last year the Government took $7.9 billion from our pockets. Then, six months later, it decided to hand back $5.9 billion. So we are still out of pocket to a substantial extent-by about $100-odd for every man, woman and child. Whatever is being said in this Parliament, let us keep the record straight: this is the highest taxing government; it is a government that presides over a record inflation rate at the moment, compared with that of the rest of the world, and the highest interest rates in regard to housing that we have ever seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to address my comments to the state of affairs in Tasmania at the moment. In regard to taxation revenue, I point out that over the last few years taxation revenue collected by the present Commonwealth Government since it came to office has gone up by approximately 75 per cent. But general revenue grants which are given back to the States have gone up by only 55 per cent. Overall, this Government is increasing the amount of tax taken from Australians' pockets and pay packets and it is keeping greater amounts of that money at the Commonwealth level than ever before. It is not increasing funding to the States. What we find is that those services for which the States have responsibility-health, education, police departments, and so on-are short of financial assistance from the Commonwealth, even though the Commonwealth is increasing its tax take from Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, on average, the percentage of taxation revenue returned to the States has gone up by only 55 per cent in the last six years. But the figure for Tasmania has increased by only 46 per cent. That is having a devastating effect on the Tasmanian economy and on employment rates in that State. The Commonwealth is gradually withdrawing more and more money from the States and it is withdrawing money from Tasmania at a much faster rate than for the other States. In real terms, it means that that State has lost about $440m in a year-that is the effect-and it is no wonder that the unemployment level in Tasmania is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to look at the rate of the increase in the unemployment level since the Hawke Government came to power. Until 1978, Tasmania had exactly the same average unemployment rate as in the rest of Australia. The rate then started to drift marginally until about 1982-83. Since that time the difference between the average unemployment rate in the Commonwealth of Australia and that in Tasmania has actually doubled. That is largely due to the withdrawal of Commonwealth services from Tasmania and the withdrawal of funds for capital works in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982 Tasmania had been led by a Labor government for approximately 40 consecutive years. There had been a government of a different political persuasion for only three years during that period, and that was a government in which the independents held the balance of power. It led to a considerable amount of instability. During 1978-82, the Labor Government that was in power could best be described by the words, `procrastination', `dithering', `lack of leadership' and `indecision'. We had a large debt-$34m at that stage. That has been reduced by the present Government, under the firm leadership of the present Premier. There has been strong, stable and progressive government in that State for the last seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, when the election is held on 13 May, I have no doubt that the Tasmanian people will elect the Robin Gray Government to a third historic term because they do not want the instability of having independents hold the balance of power in that State. They do not want to go back to having a Labor government which shows a lack of leadership and which is indecisive. That can be seen no more clearly than in the present debate on the Wesley Vale issue. The present Leader of the Opposition in that State has been described by one of his colleagues in the Senate as having `two bob each way'. That has been said not by the Liberal Party, but by one of his own Party colleagues, who has said, `The Leader of the Labor Party in Tasmania is trying to have two bob each way'. </PARA>
<PARA> There has certainly been a lot of debate about environmental matters in Tasmania. I certainly welcome that, because Tasmania is one of the most beautiful States in Australia and certainly has maintained its forests in much better condition than those in any other State. I want to point out a few matters in regard to the environment that we are facing in Tasmania. When were the big mills established? Who established them? They were established under a Labor government. There were very few controls in regard to effluent. It has only been since the Gray Government came to power that controls have been gradually imposed on all those big companies. That has not occurred before. The Gray Government has tackled the environmental problems positively. I applaud that Government for its very positive approach to its tree planting program, for the cutting back of urban effluent into the Bass Strait area and also into the rivers, and for reducing the number of exemptions from companies that are allowed to discharge effluent into the environment from 109 to about 56. That has all happened in the last few years. No Labor government tackled it. It was left to the Gray Liberal Government to take a strong, positive, commonsense approach to environmental matters, as well as to development. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wesley Vale debate, of course, is interesting. The Wesley Vale mill was lost because the Federal Government thought it could play one-upmanship. It thought it could go one better than a State government. That is what it was all about. What really happened was that it lost one of the biggest industrial development projects in Australia's history. A lot of nonsense was talked about dioxin. I say to the people listening to the broadcast of this debate that dioxin is also produced when one has a barbecue; and 98.5 per cent of dioxin is produced from car emissions, the burning of plastics in garbage tips, et cetera. There should be greater concern in that regard than in stopping the construction of any pulp mill. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal for the safest pulp mill in Australia was ditched. It would have been the safest pulp mill of that type built in the world. We are now left with other pulp mills in Australia which will put out effluent which is much more dangerous than anything put out by that new pulp mill. It would have employed the best technology in the world. I trust that it will not be too long before that new pulp mill will be built. That will certainly help alleviate the unemployment problems which Tasmania faces. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a recent paid advertisement in the Weekend Australian of 1-2 April, the South African Ambassador accused many newspapers of putting out disinformation about South Africa. He concluded his article by urging readers to beware of giving any credence to this alleged disinformation about his country. It is my contention that the same warning must be given about information coming out of the South African Embassy, especially through paid newspaper advertising. I did answer the points made by the Ambassador in a letter to the editor of the Australian but, no doubt aware of the likely loss of advertising revenue from the Embassy, the newspaper declined to publish my letter. I raise this issue in this Parliament today so that I can refer to the crux of the matters that I raised in my letter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his paid advertisement the South African Ambassador claims that there is no evidence to support the claim that South Africa is supporting the vicious Mozambican resistance movement known as Renamo. He claims there had been no assistance `of any kind' after the Nkomati Accord. There are many well documented accounts of South African involvement in Renamo raids. In 1985 Zimbabwe troops in Mozambique captured a base where documents where found which showed continuing South African support even after the Nkomati Accord. Some of these documents were published and the South African Foreign Minister went so far as to concede `technical' violations of the Accord. </PARA>
<PARA> At the trial of an Australian missionary, Ian Grey, in March 1988, evidence was given of South African involvement with Renamo. The report by Robert Gersony to Ambassador Moore, Director of the Bureau of Refugee Programs, and Dr Chester A. Crocker, the United States Assistant Secretary of African Affairs, entitled `Summary of Mozambican and Refugee Accounts of Principally Conflict-Related Experiences in Mozambique' provides a graphic account of Renamo brutality. When Assistant Secretary of State Crocker appeared before a United States Senate subcommittee on 24 June 1987 he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The evidence clearly indicates a continuing relationship of communication and support for Renamo from the Government of South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA>No doubt the South African Ambassador would likewise dismiss this as further disinformation. Despite these reports emanating from the United States, apologists for the racist South African regime still cry, `Where is your evidence?'. The evidence lies in the many documents captured from Renamo. On a recent visit to Mozambique I spoke with the United States Ambassador and there was no doubt in her mind of South African support for the rebels. Likewise, there was no doubt in our Australian officials' minds or in the minds of the aid workers there. Margaret Thatcher, not renowned for supporting left wing governments, has, since 1986, permitted British Army personnel to train the Mozambican Army. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, Chester Crocker, in testifying to the United States Senate subcommittee hearing on Renamo's activities, put the blame well and truly on South Africa. In fact, throughout the world people of all political shades agree on the destabilising activities of the South African Government in Mozambique; that is, except for the apologist, of racist South Africa. Some of those, unfortunately, sit on the Opposition benches in this House. I refer especially to National Party members. It is no wonder that they invited the South African Ambassador to address their conference late last year. Indeed, he must have felt very much at home. </PARA>
<PARA> People might ask: Why would South Africa wish to destabilise one of her neighbours? Would it not be in South Africa's own interest to have a peaceful, prosperous neighbour reaching its full potential? But Mozambique, like Zimbabwe, is a multiracial country. If there were a successful multiracial country next door, even people in South Africa would ask, `If it works in Mozambique and Zimbabwe, why not in South Africa?'. The racist regime in South Africa therefore is determined to see that a multiracial country cannot exist as its neighbour. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia can assist Mozambique more. We must bring diplomatic pressure on South Africa to stop its destabilising activities. We can give more aid, especially technical aid. We can better understand the situation in that country. Many Australian-owned organisations and our Government are distributing food, clothing and tools to the distressed and displaced people of Mozambique, yet time and again these efforts are being destroyed by vicious Renamo attacks. Farming projects are ransacked, food convoys ambushed, and development workers murdered. </PARA>
<PARA> I have recently been involved in two campaigns directed at the South African Government, urging it to stop the killing and maiming in Mozambique. How, I wonder, would the South African Ambassador react to the fact that, according to a United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) report published in Harare just a few weeks ago, more that one million people have been killed and 11 million displaced by South African wars in Angola and Mozambique since 1980? The report, Children on the Frontline, written for the United Nations agency by outside experts, doubles cautious estimates of the economic costs to the southern African region of war and Pretoria's destabilisation during this decade. The new estimate, using United Nations, Economic Commission for Africa and World Bank statistics, puts the cost at $60 billion for the nine countries of the Southern African Development Coordination Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The UNICEF report highlights the tragedy that continues in the region as a result of war and terrorism perpetrated by South Africa. The costs comprise direct war damage, particularly in Angola and Mozambique, higher defence spending by all the countries, loss of economic production, boycotts and embargoes imposed by Pretoria, and caring for the tide of refugees and internally displaced people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Namibian section of the report-one of the first detailed analyses of the social conditions of the territory's 1.7 million people-reveals a shocking situation, according to Mr James Grant, Director-General of UNICEF. Mr Grant pointed out that in the first edition of the UNICEF report on children in southern Africa two years ago, his organisation had forecast a worsening situation. The report states that in 1988 alone, 150,000 infants and young children died in Angola and Mozambique from the direct and indirect effects of war. Two years ago, the figure was 140,000 child deaths. This will be the legacy that South Africa will leave in Mozambique: an infant mortality rate well above the world figure, after a period of destabilisation perpetrated by the Pretoria regime. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent article in the Australian Financial Review gives some indication of the activities of the South African Embassy. I stress that it operates within the law, but there must be something wrong with one's message if it cannot be conveyed by normal means. We are told that the Ambassador appears to have been adopting a two-fold strategy. The first is aimed directly at the media; the second at the public. The South African Embassy, according to the article, has set out to woo journalists by hosting lunches and parties at a rate unequalled by other embassies. There are even a number of apologists for the racist South African regime within this House who are frequent visitors to the Embassy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make some comments today about the relationship between the Tasmanian Government and the Federal Government. I am sure that all members of this House are aware that an election campaign is under way at the moment in Tasmania. During the course of that election campaign, and in the lead-up to it, a great many misleading statements have been made in this place and in publicity given by other people, particularly those representing the Federal Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the constant claims that is made is that the Tasmanian Government, led by Mr Robin Gray, has been incompetent in the way in which it has managed the Tasmanian economy. Very often, figures are cited about the level of unemployment and other economic activity that is taking place in Tasmania. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there is a great deal of concern about the level of unemployment in Tasmania and the lack of job opportunities for young people. The effect, of course, is to force young people to move to other States in order to seek employment and other opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to the constant accusations that are made in this place and in other places by people representing the Federal Government, the cause of that blame does not lie with the Gray Government in Tasmania. I want to put on record today some of the facts about what is happening, and what has happened in recent years, in Tasmania, that has caused considerable anguish to the people of Tasmania and restricted very greatly the opportunities available for Tasmanians to advance their own economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me begin by mentioning the funding that is available through the Commonwealth to the Tasmanian Government. As we all know, it is a feature of economic distribution in Australia that the Commonwealth is the major tax raiser in the country. It then distributes, through the Premiers Conference and the Loan Council, a great deal of those taxes to the States for them to spend on behalf of the community. As a result of actions taken by the Hawke Government, grants to Tasmania have now been reduced in real terms by $440m a year. In other words, had the financial arrangements that were in place under the Fraser Government still been in place today, Tasmania would be receiving an additional $440m from the Commonwealth. That equates to $1,000 per head of population-per man, woman and child-in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand the difficult economic circumstances facing the country as a result of the mismanagement of the economy by the Hawke Government. We understand that there have been cutbacks to all States. But while the cutback to Tasmania has been at the rate of $1,000 per head, the average cutback to all the other States has been $500 per head. Clearly, this Federal Government has been much more savage in the way in which it has treated the Tasmanian Government than it has in regard to any of the other States. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer now to the Commonwealth's own activities-the capital works program and other activities that the Commonwealth undertakes. In the period 1988-89 to 1990-91, the projections for capital works activities in Tasmania will amount to a meagre $17.3m. In other words, on a per capita basis, that equates to $38 per head of population in Tasmania. The average for all other States is $145 per head. We have here two avenues in which the Commonwealth is attacking the Tasmanian Government and the Tasmanian people: firstly, the way in which it has cut back the direct grants to the State Government-Tasmania has suffered twice the severity of treatment of any of the other States; and, secondly, the lack of activity in Tasmania by the Commonwealth through the Commonwealth's own capital works spending programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is also, because of its lack of activity in Tasmania, continuing to cut back on the spending and employment opportunities that it can create. The most recent reduction can be seen in the Australian Taxation Office, a further 72 jobs in Tasmania having been withdrawn. The Commonwealth continues to take this type of action in Tasmania, yet the response we get from the Commonwealth is to blame the Gray Government for its mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA> What I have so far referred to on the one hand is direct inaction on the part of the Commonwealth in Tasmania which, clearly, is not within the control of the Tasmanian Government. On the other hand, the Gray Government has made numerous proposals about the way in which it can develop the resources and economy in Tasmania. Those proposals continue to come forward as a result of the initiative of the Gray Government. What happens when those proposals reach Canberra for the final stamp of approval from the Commonwealth Government? Repeatedly, the Commonwealth Government overrules the Tasmanian Government and refuses to allow those initiatives to be undertaken which would lead to new industries and new economic activity in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> I have now referred to three methods by which the Commonwealth constantly attacks and retards development in the State of Tasmania. Yet, for political expediency, the Commonwealth Government and Ministers of the Commonwealth constantly criticise the Gray Government and Ministers of the Tasmanian State Government for the fact that there are economic difficulties in that State. I put it to the House that much of the reason for the economic difficulties in Tasmania is not as a result of actions by the Gray Government but as a result of actions taken, or actions not taken, by the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal, for the sake of some equity for the people of Tasmania, to the Commonwealth to change its policy directions and at least give the people of Tasmania a fair go. Even if it will not match its own direct spending in the State of Tasmania and bring it up to par with what is being contributed to the other States, it should at least let the Tasmanian Government get on with developing our resources, our industries and our economic future, without being constantly overridden by the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest and most widely publicised of those actions in overruling the State Government involved the proposed Wesley Vale mill. The mill, which was to cost $1,000m, was to be the largest industrial development in Australia recently. There are significant national implications for the contribution it could have made to the national economy, yet the Commonwealth Government overruled the State and prevented that development from taking place. The Tasmanian Government is still very keen to develop the natural resources of Tasmania so that those resources can be processed and value-added. If that is done, it will not only contribute to the economic prosperity of Tasmania but also make a significant contribution to the national economy. But because of the way in which the Commonwealth Government has treated Tasmania in the past there is considerable apprehension as to what might result if new proposals are brought forward. There are still discussions about development of our resources, but nobody really knows how the Commonwealth will react, whether it will simply overrule the State of Tasmania once again, as it has done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Commonwealth Government to stop using the State of Tasmania for its own political expediency, to have some compassion for people in Tasmania, and to allow the development of our resources in that State, so that we can enjoy the prosperity of our own possibilities by using our resources for our own development. While it might be doing this for its own political expediency, it is the young people who are suffering most bitterly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this grievance debate today I will speak on behalf of my constituents, as distinct from speaking on behalf of the Government. I am going to talk about an issue that is of enormous significance to my constituents, and it is a matter on which, I believe, thus far the Government has made an incorrect decision. It is a decision which I intend to try to see is never implemented. I refer, of course, to the decision to give in-principle approval, subject to an environmental impact statement (EIS), for a third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I and some of my colleagues who have also expressed strong public opposition, have been accused of looking after our own political backyards and disregarding the broader national interest. That is an assertion which I reject absolutely. I believe that if a proper evaluation is undertaken of the decision that has been taken, and of the basis and criteria which led to that decision, our position clearly is not contrary to the national interest; in fact, it is very much in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision, as I said, is to give in-principle approval for a third runway, subject to a favourable environmental impact study. So that whole area of environmental assessment must be undertaken, and it is obviously critically important that that be done objectively. One of my main concerns at the moment is to ensure that there is some sort of proper, objective environmental assessment and that local community groups and local residents have a genuine opportunity to have an input into that process. Most importantly, the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC)-which, under the legislation as it stands, is responsible for conducting the EIS-which has shown itself time and again to be a strong advocate of a third runway, should not be able to get away with a Claytons EIS. I believe that that is a very real danger. I was approached by one of my constituents who had contacted the Federal Airports Corporation and had spoken to one of its environmental staffers about this matter, and who was told by that staffer that the thing was a non-event and that it was a foregone conclusion. I think that is absolutely outrageous. I will be doing everything in my power to ensure that there is a proper and genuine EIS. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is highly desirable and essential that community groups receive some support from government in the development and presentation of their case, and I will certainly be pushing for that. I also believe that there needs to be a quite separate parallel process involving those in the local community who collect information during the period in which the draft EIS is being prepared, so that they are in a good position to offer a critique of the draft EIS, to be produced by the Federal Airports Corporation, which should be available in about a year's time. That is a terribly important issue, and I intend to take the Government very much at its word when it says that there will be a genuine and proper EIS. I had discussions with Senator Richardson about this matter and I will continue to press this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question of the so-called cost benefit analysis which underpinned this decision. A few weeks ago, before the decision was made, I and a number of my colleagues in the Labor Party had an opportunity to question at length representatives of the Federal Airports Corporation when they appeared before a Caucus committee. Their opening comment was that, on their assessment of the costs and benefits, the third runway was the right way to go. It was very interesting because were were able to query them about that. The reality is, of course-and this became clear from questioning-that they had not anything which remotely resembled a proper or genuine cost benefit analysis. What they had was a variety of costings for the third runway, on the one hand, and various development options for Badgerys Creek, on the other. They also had an estimate of the capacity gain that would be provided by a third runway at Kingsford-Smith; they cited a figure of 40 per cent or so. </PARA>
<PARA> The interesting thing was that they had no estimation of the capacity gain that would flow from the building of any of the Badgerys Creek options. In other words, they had an estimate of the costs of the third runway versus Badgerys Creek; they had an estimate of the added capacity provided by the third runway; but they had no estimate whatsoever-and they could not give any answer at all-about what capacity gain would flow from any of the development options from Badgerys Creek. That fact makes an absolute nonsense of their opening suggestion that they had done a genuine cost benefit analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the decision was taken by Cabinet I have been able to glean quite a bit of information about the basis on which the decision was taken. I believe the decision is fundamentally flawed and wrong. I think that an awful lot of gold plating has gone into the proposal for the development of Badgerys Creek. I understand that there was talk of the need for not one but two high quality road links between Badgerys Creek and the central business district. There is a huge disparity between the costings provided by Bechtel-the American construction company that prepared the costings for the Federal Airports Corporation-and the costings prepared in a report submitted in July last year by the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors, which, one would imagine, would have some expertise in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a huge disparity, in regard to what has been allowed for associated roadworks that would be required if the Kingsford-Smith proposal were to proceed and traffic at Kingsford-Smith were allowed to grow, between what the Cabinet, I understand, has allowed for, and what the Wran Government in 1981 estimated would be required. In 1981 Neville Wran wrote to then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, estimating that the cost of additional roadworks required if Kingsford-Smith continued to expand and traffic continued to grow would be $300m. The Cabinet, I gather, has allowed for a fraction of that amount. </PARA>
<PARA> The most glaring deficiency in the so-called cost benefit analysis is the complete absence of any attempt to put a monetary value, or any value, on the noise and suffering endured by people under the flight path. The fact is there is no doubt that the building of the Badgerys Creek airport would be, environmentally and from a noise point of view, a preferable option to building the third runway. That seems beyond dispute. The Government has argued that some reconfiguration of the noise pattern will result from building the third runway. The fact is that on noise criteria grounds there is no question that Badgerys Creek is the correct way in which to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> Some analytical work has been done as to how one quantifies the inconvenience and stress suffered by people living under flights paths. During the major airport needs of Sydney study, over 10 years ago, quite a bit of work was done on how one quantifies those aspects-by seeing how they are reflected in property values, and so forth. There was no attempt to incorporate that sort of analysis into this so-called cost benefit analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that one must take into account the fact that the Government was relying on one set of costings prepared by an interested party, that is, by a consultant commissioned by the FAC. One must take into account the clear disparities that exist between the costings-particularly as they affect Badgerys Creek but also Kingsford-Smith-claimed by the FAC and those claimed by various credible sources of information. One must take into account the failure explicitly to incorporate in the cost benefit allowance any allowance for the effect of the impact of noise on people. One must take into account the other environmental effects that are impossible to quantify in monetary terms, such as the effect on Botany Bay. One must take into account another intangible, that is, the risk that at some stage over the next few decades there will be a major accident involving a large aircraft, and the consequence of a major aircraft falling into a densely settled area. When all those considerations are taken into account, I do not believe for a minute that the national interest is best served by the decision to build a third runway. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the right way in which to proceed is to build the second airport at Badgerys Creek. That involves more upfront expenditure, but one must look at these things over a longer time-say, 20 years. That is the only proper way in which to evaluate public investment. If one looks at it from that point of view and from the point of view of the longer term issues concerning the urban and regional development of Sydney, the benefit of moving a major piece of infrastructure away from the densely populated central areas, I believe the airport decision the Government has taken is wrong. I will be working to ensure that that third runway is never built. I will be working in conjunction with all interested parties who are prepared to work towards that objective, including trade unions and local community groups. My parliamentary colleagues who have expressed a similar opinion will be working in a concerted way to that end. I conclude by saying that I think it is a disgrace to suggest that the consideration of the third runway proposal be taken out of the purview of the Public Works Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin) pointed out that he was going to speak on a matter which was of enormous significance to his constituents. I respectfully submit that the matter that I am about to discuss is of enormous significance to Australia, its future and certainly to the survival of everything that is, or was, best in the Australian character. Before I do so, I apologise in advance for one or two very personal comments which I may be obliged to make. The subject that I want to discuss-and, good heavens, it has been aired time and again in this House, particularly over the last 24 hours-is the legislation dealing with the deregulation of the wheat industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The aspect that I want to discuss is a little different from what has already been aired in this House. What I want to say is that the National Party, right back in the days of Sir Earle Page, was based on a very fundamental rural principle-orderly marketing. It has been said that the wheat industry is possibly the flagship of primary industry. I would not argue with that for a moment. In fact, I point out-this is one of the personal matters that I want to mention-that my daughter's husband is a member of the O'Brien family, who were perhaps the earliest wheat growers on the Darling Downs in Queensland. They later switched to the production of flour, but that is another story. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) is a wheat grower from way back, as was his family before him. We heard his very emotional address in the House, and I agreed with everything he said. </PARA>

Let me tell honourable members one thing: a wheat grower, someone who raises cattle or a person involved in the pastoral industry or the agricultural industry, inevitably--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. I wish to draw his attention to one of the Standing Orders.

I am conscious that the honourable member mentioned that he did not wish to canvass the debate, but I would sanction him against canvassing speeches that have been made in that debate or issues that arise from that debate and would encourage him to address matters largely outside the ambit of the wheat legislation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1V5">Mr KATTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I presume that I will be credited with the one or two minutes of my time which have elapsed. The primary producers of this country, be they wheat growers or whatever, are usually regarded as people who can afford to run expensive cars, and that sort of thing. If one lives among them, one will know how totally mythical that is. They contend with drought; they contend with diseases and the use of agricultural products; they contend with adverse market conditions; they contend with the ever present penalty of distance. There is a close affinity between any genuine member of the National Party-and the coalition as a whole-and genuine land-holders particularly the second, third and fourth generation producers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, there are always people who stand on the sidelines-this relates to each of the major parties and perhaps the minor parties-and look for some particular way in which they can accentuate factional differences in the Labor Party and differences that may or may not exist within the coalition. What they do not understand is that if one has to weigh one thing against the other-this is the guts of what I have to say-there could be an intrusion into other areas. The article in the Australian today which quoted me was reasonably accurate. I do not think I am intruding into the areas that you mentioned, Mr Deputy Speaker, when I say that it was suggested that a fundamental view of my Party is that there should be orderly marketing. My comment was that the wheat industry is efficient and well controlled, so why is anyone interfering with it? It is one thing to seek protection, and to try to look at the whole spectrum of trade, but when an industry is going along very nicely, why should there be this sudden intrusion?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to my main point. These people stand on the sidelines and work out ways of doing what they have never been able to do, they never participate in the political arena themselves; they set themselves up as God, pass judgment on members of the various parties and want to bring them down, and do not realise that there is always a pro and a con. I am a coalitionist to the death. One might say, `Why, do you love the Liberals? I have many very close friends in the Liberal Party. I do acknowledge one particular reality, that is, if one feels, as I do, that the Future Directions document that was introduced recently by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair) sets the pattern and is the bible, which outlines what one wants for Australia, one would be terrified at the proposition of the coalition breaking down. </PARA>
<PARA> With all due respect to some of the most honoured members of the Labor Party, I know that some members are uncomfortable and unhappy with one or two of the things I am about to mention. We stand four-square for the old times. I will never forget what the Leader of the Opposition said when he was interviewed by one of these smart commentators-one wonders what they are all about; one wonders what their principles are-who said, `After all, Mr Howard, you are going to turn back the clock 25 years'. What did the Leader of the Opposition say? He said, `What is wrong with that?' Twenty-five years ago we did not have the drug scourge that we have in this country at the moment'. Some parents say `Jenny is like all the young people these days, she is living with a fellow but they are friends'. Where are the standards? Can any parent say that he would be satisfied with that?</PARA>
<PARA> What I am getting at is that we stand for the family; we stand for the traditions of the flag. People say, `There goes Katter. He won't be around for much longer'. Do not bet on that. My nomination form is half signed. In my view, and in the view of those who sit down and think about this, many of the principles of the Australian Labor Party are devastating to this nation. This is the national capital, and everything good and healthy should come out of here. It is now regarded as the pornographic capital of Australia. Am I preaching? A halo would look particularly silly above my head. I do not claim to have the great sanctity that I envy in other people. I conclude on this note: if I have to make a choice, I will stand firm to see that the coalition is maintained because it is the only way out for the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> Unfortunately, the relationship between the police and Aboriginals in inner Sydney is not pretty. There have been numerous instances of allegations of police misconduct, of brutality against Aboriginals in custody, Aboriginals in the street and Aboriginals in their homes. These allegations have, on occasions, been sustained by the New South Wales Ombudsman. I am particularly aware of one instance, where, in a police raid on a hotel, a young woman was savagely beaten about the head, sustained injuries which were disfiguring, and only after a lengthy and opposed investigation by the Ombudsman was it ultimately found that this woman had suffered these injuries at the hands of a police officer. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of this background an incident like the death of David John Gundy could be the trigger for a breakdown in what had been, I believe, improving police relations with the Aboriginal community in the inner Sydney region. What it does point to is the need to respond quickly so that there be no suggestions of a cover-up in this instance. I would entirely endorse the call by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), for there to be an independent investigation into Mr Gundy's death. I accept that some might take the view that the ordinary processes of coronial inquiry could be adequate to deal with such a death, but I think that this overlooks the important point that in this case there is a deep wellspring of suspicion and a real concern amongst Aboriginals living in inner Sydney, that they have been the victims of cover-ups, of violence, and of police oppression in the past. They fear that any inquiry other than one which is expressly independent would be possibly tainted. If that feeling is allowed to grow, damage to community relations would be very great, so, I think it is most important that the New South Wales Government accepts the wisdom of establishing a special independent inquiry to investigate David John Gundy's death. He was an innocent man, shot to death in his home following a police raid by the Special Weapons and Operations Squad. It is not a situation we as a community should take lightly; it is one which calls on us to express our deep feelings of grief towards this tragedy, our deep feelings of concern for his family. We should say that there must be an independent investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who has been reading the sad, trammelled history in the reports that have so far been published by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Deaths in Custody would have the conviction reaffirmed that we are looking at an area in which social policy has failed. We have witnessed through the Royal Commission instances in which young blacks have been abused; have been taken from their families; have suffered the most appalling deprivations; have been mistreated in custody and have ended up taking their own lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The raid that caused the death of John Gundy, of course, is in an entirely different category, but I think it needs the same response-to have these matters thoroughly investigated and no stone left unturned in making sure that the Aboriginal community, which has so many legitimate grievances, does not have yet another, that is that the system is in some way locking out the process of proper inquiry and not looking into their legitimate grievances. This raid also points to some difficulties with the way in which police have been dealing with the problem of major crime. There is no doubt we are living in a time when weapons are not infrequently used in crime and police responses have to take into account the fact that criminals may be armed. But there have been a number of instances where police conduct, and that of security forces, to say the least, has been questionable. Most of us will remember the raid in a Victorian hotel when security forces knocked down a door and terrorised guests. The Gundy case, of course, brings to mind the situation in New South Wales, and a few days later, in Queensland, when the Special Operations Squad in that State stormed premises looking for a wanted man and, in the process, fired a stun grenade which landed in a baby's bassinette. </PARA>
<PARA> All these instances suggest that we do need to look very seriously at the problem of police self-management and how they conduct their difficult job in these areas. I strongly support the call by the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties for a judicial inquiry into police use of firearms so that we can look at these questions. They are ones which are important to our community as a whole and touch us in a fundamental way. Nothing could be more frightening to all of us as civilian members of the community than to find, because of a mistake having been made, our homes broken into in the middle of the night by a police raid, guns pointed at us and, as in the tragic case of Gundy, an accident occurring in which somebody dies. It is no good saying that this could not happen to us. It has been shown at least on two recent occasions that it does happen to somebody; there are innocent people in the community who are facing this terror. Whilst the police must have proper avenues to respond to armed crime, I think that there is a need to look at the way in which the armed response of the police force has been conducted, particularly given the large list of deaths that have occurred in recent times. Some years ago Professor Harding wrote a seminal book entitled Police Killings in Australia. That book has been overtaken by time. I think there is a need for some public inquiry, perhaps at a national level, with the cooperation of the States, to look at the way in which our armed police forces operate--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has become customary for the Hawke Government, under seige for the failure of its economic policies, to set great store on the increase in employment of the order of 1.3 million since the Government came to office. But this outcome needs to be seen in proper perspective. Firstly, employment growth has always been much higher in Australia than in most other Western countries. Over the 20 years from 1968, job growth in Australia averaged 2.5 per cent annually, compared with an average of just over one per cent for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. One factor in this has been the relatively faster rate of population growth in Australia. Secondly, the growth in employment has not been confined to the years of Labor's overrated accord. Apart from the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, I cite the robust growth from 1979, with the economy generating some 530,000 jobs over the Fraser Government's period in office to the cyclical peak in September 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, under the Hawke Government we have had a large measure of `growth on tick'. When we note the resulting build-up in overseas debt we might say that each extra job from this forced-feeding cost upwards of $350,000 in overseas debt. Finally, unemployment-the true measure of an effectively functioning labour market-has, except very recently, been stuck at the relatively high figure of seven per cent. So, in sum, continued unemployment, the massive increase in Australia's overseas debt, the abysmal growth in productivity and lower standards of living for most Australians heavily qualify the employment growth outcome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At Loreto House in my electorate today a great celebration is taking place. I wish I were there. It is the 109th birthday of Miss Mary Hurley, a really marvellous lady. Mary Ellen Hurley was born on this day, 4 May, 1880, that is, 109 years ago, near Young on the Lachlan River. Her parents had a sheep property. Her father was Robert Hurley and her mother was Elonora Ryan. Mary's working life was spent at Lewisham Hospital and later at David Jones. She loved the shops. I asked her when she was 105 whether she had seen much change in the shops over all those years, and she said `Not much. They still will not let you have the goods if you have not got the money for them'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> She was 35 when the First World War broke out and for her war efforts she was crowned Queen of Allies Day in January, 1915. A beautiful photo records that event. She became very ill when she was about 30 and her doctor warned her that she may not survive. It was for that reason, it is said, that she did not marry the man that she knew during the First World War. She thought she was a little too delicate for marriage. She is 109 today and is a great tribute to staying single. She has a sherry every day and eats extremely well-a snack before breakfast, breakfast, morning tea, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner and supper. She has a great sense of humour. Her eyesight and hearing are no longer wonderful but she still loves to read, she is very perceptive and has a good sense of humour. I am sure that the whole Parliament congratulates Mary Hurley. </PARA>

Its obverse side paid tribute to William Farrer and the wheat industry, whose 1988-89 gross production value was $2.37 billion.

In 1986, in an historic decision, the International Whaling Commission banned all commercial whaling. Japan, in 1987, agreed that it would abide by that decision. But what has the Japanese Government now announced? An article which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 18 March stated that `Japanese officials' had `vowed to kill more minke whales next year'. A Mr Katsu Shima, of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, is reported as saying: `It is no-one else's business what we eat', condemning people who criticise Japan's decision to increase the number of whales it intends to kill this year as `glorified Japan bashers'. I believe that the Japanese Government cannot simply announce that it is going to increase the number of whales it intends to kill by a factor of five. Next year it is expected that Japan will catch 1,650 whales. The Japanese say that they wish to conduct scientific research.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is no doubt that those so-called independents who are, in effect, an organised political party and campaigning as such, cannot bring political stability; they cannot govern in their own right; they are only a single issue group, a protest group; and they cannot in any way lend political stability and direction to Tasmania.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to talk about some of the more important aspects of the April economic statement, particularly in so far as they relate to the question of the amount of income that can now be earned by pensioners without affecting the amount of tax payable and without affecting their pension. I believe that many of our pensioner community still are not aware of reforms that have been made in this area. For instance, a single pensioner, as at July 1989, can have $10,500 invested at 12 per cent and not pay tax and not have to worry about his pension being affected. As at July 1990 a single pensioner can have $16,000 in a bank account earning 12 per cent interest without his pension being affected. As at July 1989 a pensioner couple can have up to $30,000 plus in the bank earning 12 per cent interest without their pension being affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Accordingly, I strongly urge those pensioners who may have taken some notice of the old Fraser adage in 1983 of putting money under the bed, to get the money from under the bed; get it out from under the mattress; get it out from under the biscuit tin and put it in a bank account where it will earn realistic interest rates. If their investment is in a no-interest bearing deposit, they should get it out. The banks do not need any favours from the pensioner community. They should get it out, improve their standard of living and not be scared about the money that they will earn, because their pensions will not be affected. Single pensioners can earn up to $40 a week in extra income; the figure for couples is $70. I strongly urge them to follow this advice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The monopolistic charges imposed by Telecom Australia under certain circumstances have been highlighted in two recent cases in my electorate. They apply with regard to charges imposed on residents in homes for the aged. In both cases, the residents of the aged homes were moved to a different room from the one they had formerly occupied. Each of those original rooms in which they had lived had a phone connected. Each of those new rooms had no phone, but there was a point for a phone connection. In each case, the outside Telecom connection had to be rejoined because the line had previously been allocated to a new subscriber. Not satisfied with charging a $45 transfer fee, Telecom also charged $13 for every quarter of an hour required to make the connection outside the room. In one of those cases the total charge came to $225. This Government's record of looking after our aged is not one of which it can be particularly proud. Telecom's service to the aged can now be added to that record. In the financial year 1987-88 Telecom spent $20m on advertising. This expenditure, much of which would have been used to extol the virtues and advantages offered by Telecom, does not equate with its handling of residents in aged homes seeking Telecom connections. The Liberal Party's commitment to privatise Telecom will address these inequities.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Leader of the Opposition uses the word `rebuke'-that is his language. I repeat what I said in this House yesterday and what I had the opportunity to say recently at a press conference: I believe that, in the terms that I put to this House yesterday, there was a lack of balance, which I regret, in the statement that was made. I have explained the terms in which I think there was a lack of balance, and I have indicated that to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and he has accepted that. The Leader of the Opposition now says that I have rebuked the Ambassador to the United Nations. I prefer to use the language that I have used. I trust that, as a result of the observations that I have made, any future statement that is made on behalf of Australia by our Ambassador to the United Nations will have the appropriate balance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Leader of the Opposition has gone to the matter again, it is appropriate that I emphasise again-as I did yesterday in this House-the fact that I say that there was that lack of balance, which I think was regrettable, in no way changes the substantial position which was covered by Australia at the United Nations, and that is, that our vote was cast in the way that it was in support of the resolution. In those circumstances we were in company with 128 others. The total number voting was 129, with two against-the United States and Israel-and one abstention, Liberia. The Leader of the Opposition, in his frantic attempt to divert attention from his own troubles, which are very considerable by any measure, may go on for as long as he likes in trying to beat up this matter. He will not have any success, because he will not divert this Government from the view that we have taken that the vote was correct, albeit that in the brief explanation of the vote and in the limited time available there was the regrettable lack of balance in the statement that was made.

<PARA> The spokesman for the Canterbury-Bankstown group attempted to justify this behaviour by saying how GPs were financially disadvantaged by Medicare. Of course, as one might expect, the figures quoted were wrong. In New South Wales the Medicare fee for a standard GP consultation has risen in the past six years by 40.9 per cent-increasing from $13.20 to $18.60-and the honourable member can check these figures. In Victoria, the fee has risen by 50 per cent in the same period, from $12.40 to $18.60, and there has also been a 50 per cent increase in Tasmania. In Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia, the fee has risen by 60.3 per cent. That is because of the effects of our courageous decision in relation to uniformity.</PARA>
<PARA> The contention is that somehow GPs have been disadvantaged, but all those percentage increases are greater than have been increases in average weekly earnings in that period and greater than the rise in the consumer price index. It is true that they have been only marginally greater in New South Wales, but they have been much greater in the remaining States. I accept that in this country there is a very great gap between the average fees paid to specialists and the average fees paid to GPs. I accept, too, that at the moment there are probably too many GPs chasing too few patients. But those things have nothing to do with Medicare. They are the result of historic problems which have long been a characteristic of the health system in this country. They do not provide a justification for GPs treating pensioners in this way. They may have some quarrel with the Government but, if so, they should take up the matter with the Government and not seek to penalise patients such as pensioners, the poorer elements of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that the vast majority of GPs-who put the health and welfare of their patients above all other considerations, whatever objections they may have to government policy-will reject this proposed boycott as contemptible. I am sure that most GPs will continue to direct bill patients who are most in need and that they will continue to adhere to the Medicare schedule fee for the rest of the patients. We should look at that adherence, which amongst GPs is very high. In New South Wales, 71 per cent of all GP services are direct billed, and 80 per cent of GP services in New South Wales are charged at or below the schedule fee. In Victoria, the figures are slightly lower, at 54 per cent and 66 per cent respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> Given the number of GPs on the ground, my advice to any patients affected is that they shop around for one of the majority of Australian GPs who will provide the service they want at a reasonable price which they can afford. I think it is true to say that the fact that most ethical doctors in this country are more interested in the quality of care that they provide to their patients than how much money they can squeeze out of the system is evidenced in that historic agreement reached between the Government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. That package of measures, which revolutionises general practice and which further strengthens Medicare, will address some of the historic problems that, I admit, have persisted in the GP area. That agreement was the result of negotiation; it was not the result of the efforts of a few GPs to blackmail patients.</PARA>

In relation to the point he makes about my statement many months ago, I indicated earlier this week that circumstances had changed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As is known, the question of legal aid is dealt with through independent commissions which comprise representatives of the New South Wales Government, in this case, representatives of the Commonwealth and other people. The funding of those commissions is on the basis of the Commonwealth providing 55 per cent of the funds and the State 45 per cent of the funds. That is the New South Wales arrangement. The funds provided are substantial. For some reason best known to the members of the New South Wales Commission, they decided in 1988 to impose limits on services to veterans such as the honourable gentleman has mentioned, particularly the Vietnam veterans. They said that those services would not be provided unless there was a means test and also, perhaps, a contribution requirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The agreement that we entered into with New South Wales before 1988 was on the basis that the same types of services would continue to be provided as were provided by the independent Commission of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission prior to that arrangement. At that time, when we were directly handling legal aid, we were providing services to veterans free of charge. There was no means test and no contribution test. In 1988 that arrangement was revoked in a decision made by the Commission-a decision which, on vote, the Commonwealth representatives were against but which, regrettably, the New South Wales representatives were in favour of. At that stage the Commission decided that in future veterans would be subject to a means test and also, perhaps, a contribution requirement.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth opposed that position and made it very clear, through a ministerial colleague, that if the Commission continued to act in that way the Commonwealth would, through its own office, provide service but would deduct the cost of those services from the contribution formerly made on a percentage basis to the New South Wales Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> That decision agitated the honourable member for Dobell, who made speeches in this Parliament about what the New South Wales Commission had done and asked whether it was acting in accordance with the dictates of the New South Wales Government. That must have embarrassed the Commission, because at its meeting on 26 April last it decided to revoke the former decision. In future, assistance will continue to be granted to war veterans free of any means test and free of any contributions. We owe a debt to the honourable member for Dobell. We are very appreciative of the fact that the Commission has seen the light of day. Regrettably, the decision was not unanimous. The representatives of the New South Wales Government still continue to oppose the decision.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that on 2 May the Bush Administration announced a new initiative under the export enhancement program for 1.5 million tonnes of wheat for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Australia's sales to the USSR have declined considerably over recent years, largely as a consequence of the export enhancement program. What makes this sale even more perplexing is that it is made at a time when the wheat market is so buoyant. It is presently very much a seller's market for wheat; so subsidised wheat sales at this time make absolutely no sense at all. It is not in the United States' interests and it is not in Australia's interests to force down artificially the world price of wheat below the level that it should otherwise be. It will undermine Australian farmers' returns from international wheat sales. It further highlights the fact that the United States export enhancement program does have an effect on countries such as Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was pleased to see this morning that the United States agricultural attache here in Canberra is reported in the press as accepting the fact that the United States export enhancement program does have an adverse effect on Australia. While I would continue to debate with him the extent of the effect on Australia, he is reported nevertheless as at least acknowledging an effect of the EEP on world prices and Australia. Further, he is reported as saying that Vice-President Quayle also understands that there was some impact by the EEP on Australia. That is also welcome news. I can only hope, and I think all honourable members would agree, that, as more people in the United States Congress and the Administration realise that the export enhancement program is not securing market share for the United States from the European Community-which is what they intended it to do-but is taking a share of markets from countries like Australia, they will re-assess, on that basis, the use of the export enhancement program, especially with the present world market conditions for wheat.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will look again at the honourable gentleman's question. As I understand it, we have actually released the basic statements about the number of operational pilots filling operational slots. There are 426 operational slots across the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) for pilots and there are about 439 pilots filling those operational slots. The persistent suggestions by the honourable member opposite that we do have a shortage of pilots in operational slots and that their operations are therefore in a state of serious deterioration, like most of the claims he makes in this place, are false. I am not certain whether previous governments have released that level of detail. One can go into a much greater level of detail than that which I have discussed here. As I recollect it, that is what the honourable gentleman was attempting to do in his question on notice to me. I would have thought that, very sensibly, the detail that he asked for was a security sensitive matter. I do not believe previous governments have treated the issue any differently. I will make some inquiries as to whether they have treated those points differently in the past. It seems to me that Air Force advice to me that it ought to be kept as a matter that is security sensitive is sensible advice. Whether governments have followed that advice in the past, I do not know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My attitude certainly does not arise out of any embarrassment of this Government. On the question of operational pilots in the Air Force, I can state that we do have sufficient numbers of operational pilots in the Air Force. There are some shortages of pilots but the shortages that we are taking in that area we are taking in the area of desk jobs. Increasingly, we are utilising people from other branches of the RAAF to fill those desk jobs. It has been a matter of some conjecture in the RAAF for some time as to whether in the past all those jobs were appropriately classified as for pilots only. That has always been a matter of substantial debate. A degree of necessity is starting to resolve that debate in a different direction from the way it has been resolved in the past. That again is simply a sensible way, I would say, of handling the problem. Our Air Force, like every other air force in the Western world, largely as a result of the burgeoning domestic and international civil aviation market, is experiencing a substantial call upon its pilots. We have a slightly worse situation in terms of calls but a slightly better situation than some in terms of actual losses, largely as a result of the great success of the Government's tourism policy-but combined with, until very recently, a shameful neglect by the airlines of their responsibility to train pilots, for which we have to carry the consequences.</PARA>
<PARA> Our loss rate for pilots is now going down. The year before last the figure was 120-odd. Last year the figure was 99. We are beginning to return to something like a normal loss rate. Nevertheless that is not to say that the situation could not dramatically worsen if a sudden additional requirement came upon the trained pilot community from the civil airlines. I do not rule that out by any means. The Air Force is doing a fine job plugging those gaps; it is a really excellent performance. In the course of this very difficult time it is bringing new aircraft into service and bringing pilots up to speed, so it ought to be supported.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following the recent Premiers Conference regarding the introduction of supply side measures to help the housing situation in this country I have set up an implementation group within the Australian Property Group of the Department of Administrative Services. Following that I sent a letter to the State Premiers seeking bilateral discussions to determine the attitudes of the States and their various housing departments to the offers that we are about to make. I am pleased to report to the House that we have already instigated discussions with four States-Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. Despite the public attitude of the Premiers after the conference-that in their view there did not seem to be much in this process-I am pleased to report that since then they have changed their attitude. The procedure that I am adopting, following the bilateral discussions, is to make the offers to the States within a firm time frame and if the States are not interested in the particular property, we will immediately test the private sector on the open market. That is what we are doing. I think that within the next six or eight weeks-in fact, probably within the next four weeks-I will be making firm offers to the States and to the Defence Housing Authority, possibly with regard to several properties, and will then test the open market with regard to the disposal of surplus Commonwealth land for housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The bilateral discussions with the States have produced a very interesting result. Despite what the Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner, said after the Premiers Conference New South Wales has indicated interest, through its Department of Housing, in a number of properties. The first one is a 90-hectare property at Silverwater, some eight or nine kilometres from the central business district (CBD). This 90-odd hectares, as a first stage, would produce something like 700 medium density housing lots. That is a significant contribution to the Sydney housing scheme. The New South Wales Department of Housing is very interested and I expect to make a firm offer soon. A bit further out from Sydney, at West Menai, we own a major property of about 177 hectares. Similarly, the Department of Housing is interested and I will be making an offer to that Department within the next few weeks.</PARA>
<PARA> In Perth there is a major property at Bushmead, of 200 hectares in size. I think Homeswest intends to take advantage of the firm offer that I will make within the next six weeks to purchase that property to provide housing for first home buyers. Even Mr Ahern, the Queensland Premier, who was most critical of our propositions at the conference and after the conference, this very morning forwarded a letter to me in which he made a firm offer for a very important property close to the Brisbane CBD, at Coopers Plains. The Queensland Housing Commission would like to build public housing on this particular site.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with a quick report on the Victorian Cain Government's attitude to the major property in question in Victoria-the ex-Defence property, Albion, comprising 500 hectares. We have looked at a major plan supplied by a steeering committee of State, local council and Federal Government officials. We have offered it to the Cain Government but it is not going to accept the offer. On 20 May we will test the private sector interest in Albion. I expect that I will have that transaction tied up by the middle of November.</PARA>
<PARA> All in all, these five properties that I have described, plus several others, would produce about 1,100 hectares of housing. I am firmly of the conviction that the housing divisions that will emanate from these firm proposals will make a very positive contribution to the supply side of housing policy. I trust that the disposals can be completed within the next six months.</PARA>

<PARA> Our training infrastructure has been bedevilled in the past, as it is at present, by inconsistencies as a result of different skill standards being established in each of the States and Territories. If there are different skill standards, it is difficult to have curriculum development and proper assessment and accreditation of skills developed on a national basis. The point is, however, that award restructuring will proceed on what we imagine will be a nationally consistent basis driven in the first instance by Federal awards. It is therefore important to develop a greater degree of national consistency in the training infrastructure of this country. This is part of the thoughtful and constructive approach which the Government is taking in all areas of education and training. I think that this decision to establish the board will be seen as a very important development.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that in the April statement the Government announced additional funding to assist areas such as curriculum development, skills audits in various industries and so on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for your protection, Mr Acting Speaker. It is very interesting that when Opposition members ask a question in relation to veterans' affairs they never want to hear the answer. They are not interested in the answer. The honourable member for Farrer well knows that the limitation in certain cases is $300, but any veteran with a dental problem can have every tooth in his head filled. The Government does not discriminate against veterans for that dental care. But the honourable member knows as well as I that there is a $300 limit. As I said yesterday in this Parliament, when Bob Hawke became the Prime Minister of this nation the Budget was $2.5 billion. It is now $4.5 billion and going up. The Government is proud of its record in veterans' affairs. It does not neglect the veterans of this country and the honourable member for Farrer knows that. He misrepresents the facts all the time. It is a shame because he as a Vietnam veteran should be caring for veterans and not trying to scare them all the time. The Government looks after the veterans of this nation more than anybody else in this country. Yesterday the Leader of the National Party of Australia asked what the Government was doing about merchant mariners.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Attorney-General aware that so-called games are still being used to rip-off unwary ordinary Australians, sometimes for very large sums of money?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pyramid selling is prohibited by section 61 of the Trade Practices Act. The honourable gentleman talks about pyramid games, which come within the ambit of that section. In pyramid games very few people win and most lose their money. Accordingly, the Trade Practices Commission has been obliged to take action in the Northern Territory because regrettably the Northern Territory does not have any legislation on this matter. It is a pity that the Northern Territory does not have mirror legislation as do most States, which would prohibit pyramid selling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, the Trade Practices Commission, in accordance with its responsibilities, is publishing all information to schools and community groups in the Northern Territory, has written to over 2,000 individuals advising them of the dangers of pyramid games and the law in this regard, and is using all sorts of questions in the media-whether it be radio or community groups-to advise them of the liability and responsibility of the Northern Territory not being able to adequately cater for this problem. The Commonwealth is working with local groups. I add that there have been a number of prosecutions solely by the Trade Practices Commission as a result of some joint investigation by local consumer authorities. But we hope that in view of this outbreak of outrageous consumer rip-offs, the Northern Territory will do what other States are doing and introduce its own legislation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Chair and the Leader of the Opposition. I am sure that all honourable members on both sides of the House would wish me to draw the House's attention to a notable even which will occur on Saturday 6 May 1989. It concerns our most distinguished friend and colleague the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Lionel Bowen. On that day our colleague will become the longest serving Minister from the ranks of the Australian Labor Party in the history of the Australian Parliament. It adds lustre to that achievement, and for honourable members on this side of the House a very special significance, when I say that that record of service will then surpass that of our great and beloved leader Ben Chifley. For the record book, our colleague will have served a total of just over nine years-to be precise, 3,307 days-as a Minister of the Crown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is certainly not an occasion for me to say anything in the nature of a valedictory. A few more records may be chalked up before the Parliament expires. But I cannot let this occasion pass without placing on the record our deep appreciation of our colleague's service-his unsurpassed service to our Party, the Parliament and, above all, to Australia-and, in particular, expressing my deep personal appreciation and my indebtedness for the magnificent partnership we have had over the past six years. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the only record to his credit. I suggest that no Australian in active public life would have had a longer period of public service-42 years in all. He was an alderman at 25, Mayor of Randwick at 27-I might say that they seem to catch them young around Botany Bay-a member of the New South Wales Parliament from 1962 to 1969 and a member of this Federal Parliament for nearly 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I point just briefly to the range of Lionel Bowen's ministerial service. In the Whitlam Government he was Postmaster-General, Special Minister of State, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister and Minister for Manufacturing Industry. In my Government, he has been Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Trade, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, Vice-President of the Executive Council and, of course, Attorney-General, the office he currently holds. He has been Acting Prime Minister on more than a dozen occasions in my absence, and in that post had indeed been a model of competency, efficiency and dispatch. At this time there is no need to list all the measures with which he has been associated over the years-Federal grants to local government, the Remuneration Tribunal, the National Archives, the Maritime Museum and his monumental work in relation to the national companies and securities legislation. I should particularly mention his immense personal commitment to constitutional reform, a commitment that I am convinced will ultimately bear the fruit that it so richly deserves. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one achievement I especially wish to mention. I believe it a great personal achievement and, importantly, an enduring achievement for Australia. In November and December 1973 our colleague, Mr Bowen, was Acting Minister for Education in the absence through illness of Mr Kim Beazley Senior, the father of our Minister for Defence. In that capacity of Acting Minister for Education he had the carriage of the Schools Commission Bill and the States Grants (Schools) Bill-I believe properly described as two of the most historic pieces of legislation ever before this Parliament, the foundations of the process by which this nation has been enabled to put behind it the sectarian divisiveness on education which disfigured our country for more than a century. These Bills were in grave jeopardy in the Senate, but there was a ray of hope. Quite remarkable as it may seem in terms of the sweetness and light which prevails today, there was at that time a difference of opinion between the Liberal Party and the then Country Party, at least about electoral tactics, and it was in very large measure due to the negotiating skills and the political acumen of Lionel Bowen that commonsense prevailed and these historic Bills became law. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Speaker, to end on a completely bipartisan note, let me quote from a quite impeccable source. In his memoirs, Jim Killen, writing on his own period as Leader of the House, says:</PARA>
<PARA>My dealings with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Lionel Bowen, who handled matters for his party, revealed a person of conspicuous integrity and fair dealing. Once an arrangement had been made it would take the most unusual happening to disturb it and he would put his cards frankly on the table and say, `Look, I'll make up the time somehow.'</PARA>
<PARA>It is just these qualities-integrity, fairness, frankness, honest and open dealing, and to which I shall add loyalty, staunchness, steadiness and wisdom-that have made Lionel Bowen so great a colleague, a great Minister, a great mate and a great Australian. I am sure that all honourable members will join me in congratulating him not so much on this record of tenure that he has set but on his whole record of achievement in the service of this Parliament and the people whom we all represent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had mine. I would just like to say that despite our political differences quite a lot of us over here rather like the Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen). We think that some of the things he has done in this place over the last few months have been pretty good. We liked his referendum proposals. We particularly liked the outcome of them. I think Lionel Bowen has made some interesting contributions to the political history of Australia. He has brought a particular style to the post of Acting Prime Minister. It has been one of the interesting features of politics over the past 10 or 15 years that we have had two fairly frequent Acting Prime Ministers. We had Doug Anthony in the former Government, and Doug was different from the bloke he replaced on occasions. Apart from anything else, when Doug was there you could get on with your work and there were not interminable meetings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other great quality that I think Lionel Bowen has brought to the job is that he has an unerring deadpan capacity to deal with the most outrageously insistent armada of pressmen. I remember one very celebrated occasion, which the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) would remember even more than I, in December 1987. It was the morning that the Sydney Morning Herald had published a leak from whatever department it was which was a bit of a problem for the honourable member for Parramatta. The Herald was calling loudly for his head and others then took up the refrain. The spotlight switched to just outside the Acting Prime Minister's Maroubra office. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith was striding towards his office when he was stopped. The pressmen said, panting, `You've heard all about it. What are you going to do? The Herald is demanding that he resigns, he has misled the Parliament'. The honourable member looked them straight in the eye and said `That's very interesting, I'll have to think about that.' They had no answer. It was a fairly effective put-down, but the sigh of relief of the honourable member for Parramatta was fairly short-lived. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Prime Minister is a special kind of Labor man. He has some attitudes that are not so prevalent in the Australian Labor Party these days; he represents some of the old values of the Labor Party. He has a fine punting reputation and, in the years that he has served the Labor Party, he has brought a very distinctive, low-key, laconic sense of humour to his task. I can very genuinely say on behalf of the Liberal Party that we enjoy knowing him and will be sorry to see him go, because we think his term as Attorney-General has been pretty beneficial to us. We think his referendum legislation in particular falls into that category. </PARA>

I commend the Deputy Prime Minister for his record and length of service. It is a remarkable achievement to survive both the days of Whitlam and the days of Hawke. It is more remarkable that he has been able to bridge the various gulfs that have emerged within his own ranks and in the Parliament over that time. I know that in his service to the community as Mayor of Randwick in local government, as a member of the Legislative Assembly in New South Wales and subsequently here, both on the front bench in opposition and on the front bench in government, he has rendered, according to his lights, great service to his party and to this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one notable thing that I remember from the contributions that he has made, and that is his remarks at the time of the late Frank Stewart's funeral when he commented that every good Catholic boy from the eastern suburbs had three aspirations: to go to mass on Sunday, to go to rugby league on Saturday and to join the Australian Labor Party. I suggest that things have now changed and that, instead of joining the Labor Party, he would probably join the conservative parties. I think that that is probably one of the differences between the period that Frank Stewart and Lionel Bowen entered politics and now, when people enter the political fray. Lionel, I congratulate you on behalf of the National Party of Australia for your very fine record and wish you well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Government has decided that the twelfth national census of population and housing will be conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 1991, as required by the Census and Statistics Act 1905. Regulations specifying the topics to be included in the census in accordance with section 8 of the Census and Statistics Act were tabled earlier this week. In order that the Parliament and the general public should be fully informed on the questions to be asked in the census, I shall table, at the conclusion of this statement, an Australian Bureau of Statistics information paper entitled 1991 Census of Population and Housing: Content and Procedures which describes the topics to be included and the procedures for conducting the census. Final wording of questions and definitions and the sequencing of questions will be decided once all testing for the census has been completed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The census is the most wide-ranging collection undertaken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as it involves contact with every household in the nation. It provides a considerable amount of information used extensively for planning, administration, policy development and evaluation. It provides a statistical snapshot of the whole population in terms of number, age, geographical distribution and a range of other characteristics. Users of census statistics include Government agencies at the Federal, State and local level; social service organisations; churches; research institutions; businesses; and private individuals. The vast statistical output from the census is available to everyone in the community through the Australian Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that the 1991 census will cover seven topics about the household and 24 topics about people in the household. Topics included in 1991 represent a reduced content, compared with the 1986 census, with five topics in the 1986 census not considered sufficiently justified on cost-benefit grounds for inclusion in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the ethnic origin topic will not be included in the 1991 census, comprehensive information on the ethnicity of the population will still be available. Questions will be asked on birthplace, birthplace of parents, year of arrival in Australia, citizenship, Aboriginal-Torres Strait Islander origin, language use and religion. The inclusion of additional topics was requested by users, but the topics selected by the Government are considered to represent a reasonable balance between the need for information, the appropriateness of the census as a means of collecting particular kinds of data, the cost of the undertaking and the need to ensure that completing the forms does not impose too great a burden on the public. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that asking questions of householders in order to obtain statistical information involves a degree of intrusiveness and places a workload on the community. The Government has aimed to minimise both load and intrusion but nevertheless recognises and accepts that some degree of each is necessary to support the information required for efficient planning and administration. For most households the completion of census forms requires at the most half an hour every five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The population census affects every household in Australia and it is essential that public cooperation and acceptance be obtained in order to achieve the high quality response that has been a feature of recent censuses. For this reason a public awareness campaign will be conducted prior to and during the census. The aim of the campaign will be to maintain high quality response to the census by convincing the public of the usefulness of the statistics obtained and the confidentiality of the information provided. The availability of assistance for those who may, for language or other reasons, experience difficulty in completing the form will also be made known. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government places great significance on the census as a means of collecting important and social and economic data which is of primary concern to a wide range of users. It is recognised that to be of maximum utility such data must be both accurate and timely. Consequently the Government has decided that the census will be conducted without sampling and that all forms collected at the 1991 census will be processed fully and without delay so that detailed information will be available to users as soon as possible. A number of organisations and individuals have requested that information on identified persons and households not be destroyed, but be transferred in some form to archives with access after a specified period. The Government rejects this request. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the census is to gather statistical information and the legal power of the Statistician to direct people to answer census questions, except one relating to religion, is accompanied by strict measures to ensure the confidentiality of the information provided. The Government believes that it would be inconsistent with that purpose and with that guarantee of confidentiality to retain information on identified persons or households. The decision not to retain information on identified persons and households was reached after arguments for and against their retention had been carefully weighed. A relevant factor was the very real fear that public confidence in the census, and hence the willingness of individuals to provide full and accurate information about themselves, could be undermined. A further consideration was the substantial costs which would be incurred in storing and accessing the records. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, as a measure of the importance which the Government places on protecting the privacy of Australians, it has been decided that the past practice of destroying all records of names and addresses of persons and households and of not storing these names and addresses in computer files will be continued. The destruction of records will be carried out in accordance with authorisation under the Archives Act. The Australian Statistics Advisory Council has devoted a considerable amount of time to considering plans for the 1991 census and its conclusions have been of great assistance to the Government in reaching its decisions. I now table the information paper to which I referred earlier. I also present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance before the House today is indeed a very important one. It reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The deliberate attempt of the Government to deceive the Australian public regarding price increases. </PARA>
<PARA>It follows on from the matter of public importance that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) moved yesterday on the same subject, carefully documenting the extent to which pressure was brought to bear by this Government on the Australian Statistician to lower the consumer price index (CPI) artificially by changing the treatment of housing costs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to look at this issue against the background of where we are as a country at the present time. We are at the top of the league table in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in terms of wages and inflation outcomes. Even at the sorts of price increases given on the most favourable measure of the Acting Treasurer, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), we are still sitting at around twice the average of our major trading partners. The point is that this Government has never had an anti-inflation strategy, and not once in six and a bit years has it brought inflation under control. Its record on this speaks for itself. It is a record of disinformation, it is a record of cosmetic adjustment and fiddles and it is a record of unjustified claims and of intellectually dishonest argument. It prefers constantly to shift the goalposts rather than address the problem of inflation. It is a record of incessant rhetoric and absolutely no substantive action when it comes to dealing with inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> We can take, as a few examples, three recent statements-and I emphasise the word `recent', as there have been literally hundreds over the life of the Government-by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). On 26 July last year, in his press conference on the consumer price index for the June quarter, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The long and short of it is that the Government's policies have dealt and are dealing with inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>In his speech to the British-Australian Chamber of Commerce in October, he said, in relation to a wage-tax trade-off:</PARA>
<PARA> The prospect of such a trade-off means that Australia has within its reach a level of inflation at the start of the 1990s in the 3 to 4 per cent range, fully in line with that in the rest of the world. That is our clear objective.</PARA>
<PARA>At the end of January this year, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>I remain convinced that Australia has before it the very real prospect of securing a substantial fall in its inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA>None of that bears any relation to what was going on in the economy at that time. Over the last nine months we have seen inflation break away well above the forecast level, and even at the artificially low level that it appears to be at today it is still substantially above that forecast of 4.5 per cent. The Acting Treasurer is obviously being trained in these ways, as in evident in today's statement on the CPI-which again is a very dishonest representation of the facts. In this first paragraph he refers to the fact that today's outcome:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . confirms that Australia's underlying rate of inflation is running at a lower level than had been indicated by the previous statistical series. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement designed to create the impression that inflation is falling, but all he is doing is acknowledging the fact that the CPI has been artificially lowered by that adjustment. Similarly, he talks about how the calculation of the annual rate of inflation is complicated by the statistical change in respect of the treatment of housing prices. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . however, on the two bases presented in today's release it is running at approximately the same rate, 6.8 or 6.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>He forgets to admit that he left one of the key bases out, the old basis, so that we cannot make a comparison and determine the full extent of the fiddle that has been rorted by bringing in a new housing cost element to the CPI. It is that sort of dishonest and inflationary rhetoric that characterises this Government's performance on inflation-no substantive action. The electorate will not be fooled by this. Every time people go to the supermarket, pay their mortgage or do their own assessments of their cost of living, irrespective of what this Government says, and irrespective of the extent to which this Government tries to deceive them about price increases, they have a very clear idea of what is going on. We have heard about the rate of inflation in this country. We heard today an admission by the Acting Treasurer that the Government is quite prepared to carry on cheating the average pensioner and all those who have entered contracts based on the CPI by tying contractual arrangements to the lowest outcome rather than anything like a realistic inflation number. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is instructive to go back over the life of this Government, consider its record on inflation, and focus on some of its so-called anti-inflationary strategies so as to explode the myth it perpetrates. I guess there have been three major fiddles over the life of the Government. There was the Medicare fiddle, then there was the cut in the beer excise in last year's Budget, explicitly said to be the purpose of artificially lowering the CPI by 0.5 per cent, and now this year we have the adjustment with mortgage costs and housing price increases being put into the CPI. The facts are that as a result of that sort of process, even on a most favourable, fudged basis, inflation is still stuck at around 7 per cent and has been since the December quarter of 1987. It should not be forgotten that this has happened over a period in which the Government claims it has had substantial wage restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> On a more appropriate basis, if we were to exclude the effect of some of those favourable fiddles, I believe the current inflation rate probably would be in excess of 8 per cent. We would have to add back about 0.7 or 0.8 per cent for the housing cost adjustment and add back the 0.5 per cent for the indirect beer excise. So we are looking at an inflation rate well in excess of 8 per cent. Contrary to the Acting Treasurer's suggestions, the inflation rate is accelerating away and not falling. The impression that is constantly being created by this Government is that inflation is on the way down. The three quotes I identified from the Treasurer are consistent with that sort of line, but we know that not to be the case. If we look closely at the Acting Treasurer's press release today in relation to the March quarter CPI, we see that he draws attention to a number of factors which will in fact, if we look at them objectively, serve only to further increase the CPI in the months to come. In this sense he is damned entirely by his own mouth, for he admits explicitly or implicitly that the inflation rate in the next several quarters will be higher because of the price effects of recent devaluations; because of a seasonal pick-up in clothing costs, which were seasonally low and in fact made a negative contribution to the CPI this quarter; the effects of the floods, such as the effect they will have on fruit and vegetable prices in the next couple of quarters; increases in State government taxes and charges; and, of course, because of the prospective increases in wages and the continuing stronger than anticipated domestic demand. They are the ones referred to in his press release, and they do not mention the effect of abattoir strikes on meat prices, rising world inflation, possible further increases in petrol prices and so on. Inflation is not under control, it is nowhere near the artificially low level of 7 per cent that has been suggested, and it is accelerating away and will continue to accelerate away this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The key point is that this Government has never had an anti-inflationary strategy. In every single year since 1984-85 it has overshot its Budget forecast, and in some cases quite significantly. It has never been anywhere near the mark. Indeed, an objective observer would say that it comes out with an inflation forecast which it knows to be low and then just lets the passage of time see it overshot, and repeats the process next year. Government members, of course, talk about their claimed success in bringing down inflation in 1983, 1984 and 1985. They would pin a lot of that on the so-called magic document with which they came into government, the accord. We all know that any objective assessment of the fall in inflation over that period was principally due to flat domestic and world activity, and that it was largely due to the Fraser Government's wage freeze that broke the inflationary expectations of that time, and there were some favourable effects of an appreciating currency beyond the end of 1983. The fact is that despite what they said, they did not have any policy to control inflation through that period. </PARA>
<PARA> It is instructive to recall the statement that was made at the time of the accord which was repeated at the National Economic Summit. The Government said that its prices and incomes policy `offers by far the best prospect of enabling Australia to experience prolonged higher rates of economic and employment growth and accompanying growth in living standards without incurring the circumscribing penalty of higher inflation'. It claimed that with inflation control being achieved in this way, budgetary and monetary policies may be reasonably set to promote economic and employment growth, thus enabling unemployment to be reduced and living standards to rise. Nothing could be further from the truth. The accord did nothing of the sort. It did not control inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given the House the reasons why inflation fell in 1983, 1984 and in early 1985. It had nothing to do with the accord. The Government's stimulatory fiscal and wages policy ultimately came through and had a substantial stimulatory effect on inflation, which blew out in the course of 1985 and into 1986. We know what happened. There were major exchange rate crises in 1985 and in 1986 as a direct consequence of the fact that it lost control of this economy and its inflationary forces. It abandoned money targets and monetary and policy discipline. The accord document was an absolute failure at that point. Inflation accelerated, as I said, throughout 1985 and into early 1986. It only started to slow in late 1986 and early 1987 as there was a substantial tightening of policy in late 1985 and into early 1986. It was forced on the Government by the exchange rate collapse and, in particular, through monetary policy which precipitated, as we will recall, a recession in the latter part of 1985 which carried into 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government did not learn anything from the experience, because it did the same thing again in 1987. It stimulated the economy, this time, essentially, for political reasons. It eased monetary policy, overheated the economy and, of course, blew us out of the water. Since that time we have seen no new anti-inflationary strategy brought down. Last year's Budget referred to the fact that inflation was the No. 1 economic disease in this country. When we looked for the things that would bring it under control, we saw, firstly, its CPI fiddle by reducing beer excise by 0.5 per cent, and, secondly, it had this wage-tax deal, this tax trade-off, that was going to do the job. We now know what that was. There was no wage-tax trade-off. Look at what we have got. The possibility that the Treasurer argued for-zero wage increase in return for a $20 tax cut at the time of the Budget last year when his forecasts were on track-ended up being something like $50 to $70 a week across the board, unrelated to productivity, in terms of a wage increase, as well as the $20 tax cut. </PARA>
<PARA> In those terms, that wage-tax deal was really the surrender terms of economic management in this country for the second time in six years. The first surrender terms were summarised in the Treasurer's press release in late January 1985 when he abandoned money targets. The second set of surrender terms is this wage-tax deal. It has nothing to do with controlling inflation and promises to stimulate inflation significantly from here on. So the Government has never tried to deal with the inflation problem. Generally, it has tried to ignore it. The best example of how much it can ignore a problem of such significance is shown in the 12 April statement just a few months after the Treasurer said that inflation was the number one economic disease in this country. Inflation gets one line in the document. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>And with demand running too strongly inflation has not fallen as we had hoped.</PARA>
<PARA>Inflation is running at about 8 per cent against a Budget forecast of 4.5 per cent. It has not fallen as the Treasurer had hoped. There is absolutely no suggestion of an alternative anti-inflationary strategy. The bottom line is that this Government is quite happy to rip off the average Australian. It cynically gives tax cuts and promises wage increases, yet it knows that in doing that it is giving back only part of what it has taken. It knows that in time any temporary relief from those tax cuts and wage increases will be clawed back through higher interest rates, bracket creep and higher inflation. It is prepared to sit in this House and go around this country blatantly cheating the average Australian, many of whom live in very difficult economic circumstances, people such as pensioners and people who have a host of contractual commitments linked in one way or another to the CPI. In terms of my question today, those who bought government indexed securities have been conned by this sort of behaviour. It goes on as though there is no problem with any of that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) has given an impassioned speech which, as an economist, he should be absolutely ashamed of. I presume that it was impassioned because the content was so vacuous. Let us examine more reasonably what he had to say. For a start, this was the second matter of public importance on the consumer price index (CPI). Therefore, it was redundant. The issue was debated yesterday. The new basis for calculating mortgage interest rates in the CPI was outlined then, and that should have been quite enough to explain it to Opposition members, who obviously are not careful in understanding what is going on; I would even say that they are not particularly intelligent in understanding what is going on. It should have laid to rest any remaining doubts about the nature of the improved method of calculating the CPI which is now being used. Most of the comments by the honourable member for Wentworth were irrelevant to the allegations he made in the motion. Most of them were historic and were not to do with the subject matter about which he was supposed to be talking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members are trying to create a sense of distortion which does not exist. Perhaps they think that by raising the issue a second time their views will be reinforced in the public's mind. But just because a charge is repeated a couple of times does not mean that it is correct. It simply means that the Opposition has some reason for wanting to spread around their falsehoods. It is not difficult to guess their motives, of course. They want to inflame a sense of economic crisis so as to hide the good news-and the good news is that today the inflation rate has come down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those honourable members do not like the truth, either, Mr Deputy Speaker. Using the debt profile method for calculating the impact of mortgage interest changes on the inflation rate, the inflation rate fell from 9.4 per cent in the March quarter of 1987 to 6.9 per cent in the March quarter of 1989. There has been a fall of 2.5 percentage points in two years. The present inflation rate is 6.9 per cent-not 8 per cent as the honourable member for Wentworth says. This fall has occurred partly because of the appreciation of the Australian dollar. It is good to see that the impact of that appreciation is now feeding through to prices. The prices of imported goods increased by 0.7 per cent in the March quarter-less than half the overall increase in the CPI. The fall has also occurred because of the effect of petrol discounting and the seasonal fall in volume costs, which normally happens in the March quarter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inflation rate is certainly higher than the Government would like, but it is higher because the economy is growing strongly, because we have substantially faster economic activity-faster than the Opposition appears to want-and because we have a faster growth of employment. The effect of that increase in national income, economic activity and employment is that average incomes are rising-and that is good news. Of course, that has allowed the increases in after tax incomes that were announced in the April statement. A wage-tax trade-off was announced in the April statement, and that allows for a modest increase in before tax wages and a significant reduction in taxation, so that after tax wages will rise substantially. </PARA>
<PARA> The inflation rate is not above that which exists in all the other Western countries, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Wentworth, suggested. In fact, I am surprised by his lack of information. He is an economist, and I would have expected that even a cursory reading of the Australian Financial Review, let alone the other newspapers which I would hope he would be consulting, would have indicated to him that the inflation rate in a number of Western countries is now higher than that in Australia. So, at present three major economic improvements are occurring: we have an increase in after tax income, an increase in employment, and a reduction of the inflation rate. That is the good news which the Opposition is trying to hide. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look again at the changes to the CPI, on which changes the Opposition has based its false claim. Mortgage interest changes were first included in the CPI in December 1986. Therefore, that is a quite recent development. It is an improvement in the index, but it was clear that, technically, it was going to be quite difficult to include mortgage interest rates for the first time. Two methods were considered at that time. The first, the simple revaluation method, operates as though all home buyers had increased the size of their mortgage each quarter in line with increases in average housing prices. Clearly, that is a nonsense, because people do not go out and increase their mortgage every quarter to keep in line with other changes in housing prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that the assessment of the mortgage increases by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) must reflect both interest rate changes and changes in the quantity of debt on which that interest is paid. The alternative method, the debt profile method, which the Australian Bureau of Statistics has always preferred, goes further than the simple revaluation method, by recognising that mortgage interest changes paid by households depend on the age of the mortgages. That is obviously a more realistic assumption. The debt profile method therefore answers the question about the changeover time in interest payments required to finance a stock of housing identical in terms of the age of the mortgage relative to that being financed in the base period. The debt profile method involves calculating debt price indexes for mortgages entered into in each of the previous eight years and a single price index for mortgage interest rates. It is therefore a much more realistic method of calculating the impact of interest changes. This method is much closer to the reality of what actually happens, as well as being suitable for the requirements of a statistical index. In its information paper on the treatment of mortgage interest changes, the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicated:</PARA>
<PARA> The ABS considered the debt profile method was conceptually superior but that the simple revaluation method was easier to understand and to explain. </PARA>
<PARA>It is difficult enough to explain either of the methods, I must say, but the ABS chose the simpler of the two. That is why the simple revaluation method was first introduced; it was easier for the community to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of public importance seems to be based on a completely false assumption. It suggests that the Government has been trying to deceive the community about the CPI. However, the Government makes quite clear that it is using the underlying rate of inflation for the quarter. In the statement which was made by the Acting Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), and which was repeated in the House, he made quite clear that he accepts that the underlying rate of inflation is 1.6 per cent-not one per cent as the revised index would show. This underlying rate compares prices over the past couple of years, using the debt profile method for evaluating the effect of mortgage interest changes. The government is not using the quarterly CPI, including the change of method, which gives a price increase for the quarter of one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) put out his statement about the CPI on the assumption that the Government would attempt to mislead, but it has not done so. It is quite impossible for the previous CPI to be revised, so the effect of the change in method has to occur in one quarter, and that is why we have a one per cent increase in the index itself. The underlying rate, the rate which compares price changes on the same basis, quarter by quarter, indicates, as I said, a fall of 2.5 per cent in the annual inflation rate during the past two years, and a small 0.1 per cent fall during the last quarter. That underlying inflation rate is 1.6 per cent. The Opposition appears to have been expecting a misleading emphasis from the Government in this matter of public importance-but that has not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Experience with the two methods has shown that, for most of the period since the mortgage interest rates were introduced into the calculation, the CPI varied little, whichever method was used. However, in the last couple of quarters a significant diversion began to emerge. The Australian Statistician, Mr Castles, has said that the change had been made because of the inadequacies of the simple revaluation method. He said that it was simplistic, gave a distorted impression of what was happening to mortgage interest rates and therefore had to be abandoned. Mr Castles said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bureau's decision has been taken solely on the basis of statistical considerations, and in the interests of providing the best possible CPI. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Castles said that the Bureau was aware of a serious problem when a 0.4 percentage point divergence in the CPI opened in December between the use of the relatively unsophisticated, simple revaluation approach and the more conceptually sound debt profile method. The debt profile method has the effect of reducing volatility in the series. Both methods lead to the same result, over time. </PARA>

However, I will refrain from responding to these childish, schoolboy interjections. The honourable member for Mayo is well known in this House as a pretentious public schoolboy. The debt profile method involves much smaller variations in the consumer price index, slower increases and slower reductions. However, both methods lead to the same result over time. The only debate is about the method and timing of the introduction of the change. The change is being made now because of demonstrated defects in the simple revaluation method. Surely, it is important to get the greatest accuracy possible. The debt profile method is a more accurate method; it presents a true picture of the impact of mortgage interest changes on prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To charge the Government with attempting to mislead is to attack the integrity of the Statistician. The Opposition is saying, in effect, that the Statistician would change the index just to please the Government. I know Ian Castles, the Statistician, well. I know that he would not do that. He is clearly a man of integrity. As well as being a man of integrity, he is a highly professional statistician. His professional position depends on acting in a rigorous, sound way. He has to use methods that other professional statisticians accept as being the best available. His change has been checked with the tripartite Australian Statistics Advisory Council. It has been checked with the Confederation of Australian Industry, with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and with other departments. All people consulted have agreed that the change is justified and statistically sound. Commentators and the business community accept that the change is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wentworth is a professional economist. In his heart of hearts he must know that this change is entirely and completely justified because of the greater accuracy it will give to the CPI. I was rather shocked with the shallowness and hollow rhetoric of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Wentworth. His arguments really do not stand up to examination. He is simply attempting to inflame an artificial dispute. That is not the essence of sound or reasonable debate. He should be concentrating on policy issues which are really debatable rather than concentrating on an esoteric issue with no foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wentworth claimed that this change would lead to lower indexation of pensions. Of course, the reverse is actually true. Pensioners will be better off than they otherwise would have been because the pension increase for the September and December quarters will be higher than it otherwise would have been. The indexation for the September-December six-month period is 4 per cent. If the debt profile method had been in place at that time, the indexation increase would have been 3.4 per cent. So, pensioners will benefit from this change, rather than the reverse. Of course, later changes will be lower, but that lower increase will be on a higher base. Eventually, there will be no difference in the impact of the two forms of CPI change over time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has a vested interest in bad economic news. It appears to want to give the impression that the inflation rate is higher than it really is. It does not seem to care that that comes from wrongly calculated figures. This motion, therefore, amounts to another of its attempts at economic sabotage. It thinks that it will be easier to get into government if the news is bad and it tries to create that bad news. The Statistician has, in fact, acted professionally. The CPI is now more fairly based, more accurate and more reliable. Let us welcome this structural improvement in the index and the improvements in inflation which it indicates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am always interested in listening to the speeches of the Acting Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating). What we have here today is the latest great fiddle of this Hawke-Keating Government-a desperate last ditch stand of a failed government, a government that is out of touch, out of control and out of order. The Treasurer forecast that in 1988-89 we would have a 4.5 per cent inflation rate. Some forecast! It is just as well that he does not give any tips for the races, because if we followed them we would all be down the drain, just as the Government has gone down the drain by following the Treasurer's crystal ball and just as the Australian economy has gone completely down the drain by following the Treasurer's mental meanderings through the field of prophecy. But we have to forget the fantasy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is all right for the Treasurer to tip toe through the tulips, but the people of Australia have to face the facts-and the facts are very compelling. Fact No. 1: the Treasurer said that the inflation rate in 1988-89 would be 4.5 per cent. Fact No. 2: the December quarter rate was 2.1 per cent, just in one quarter. Fact No. 3: that gave an annual inflation rate of 7.7 per cent. Fact No. 4: the Treasurer then decided to change the rules. He did not like the answers, so he had to change the rules. If one does not like the results, one can just move ahead and cook the books. We know what he is like and now-it has taken some time-all Australia knows what he is like. Come the next election, the people will demonstrate that knowledge because they know that it is not the Keating method; it is the cheating method. Fact No. 5: that is why the inflation rate announced today has the March quarter at only 1.6 per cent with an annual rate of 6.6 per cent. This still does not compare too well with the 4.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Fact No. 6: because the Australian Bureau of Statistics was forced by political pressure to change the rules, no figure has been provided on the previous basis of calculation. Why? Because the Government wants to hide the truth. It does not want any comparisons. The reality is that on a comparative basis, on the best estimates, the real rate is between 7.4 per cent and 7.7 per cent per annum. And that does not compare too well with the 4.5 per cent either. Fact No. 7: even based on the Statistician's analytical series, inflation is stuck at nearly 7 per cent for the fourth quarter in a row. Where does that leave Mr 4.5 per cent? He is up the creek without a paddle, and Australia is sinking. </PARA>
<PARA> Fact No. 8: the Acting Treasurer not only is confused, as usual, but also appears to have set out to confuse the Australian people. He has succeeded. Just look at his press release issued today. In the first paragraph he says:</PARA>
<PARA> Today's March Quarter Consumer Price Index figure of 1.6 per cent is at the lower end of market expectations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then says:</PARA>
<PARA> The published quarterly CPI increase of 1.0 per cent reflects the one-off step down . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Is it 1.6 per cent or one per cent? The Acting Treasurer does not even know himself. I quote from what he said on the World Today program:</PARA>
<PARA> First of all, we are not saying that the one per cent is the correct figure. </PARA>
<PARA>We know that. All of Australia knows that. At last the Acting Treasurer knows it, too. </PARA>

<PARA> . . . we are saying the correct figure is 1.6 per cent on the basis of the new method of calculation. </PARA>
<PARA>In one way I am fairly similar to the Treasurer. I am not an economist either, but I know one thing-and that is what Disraeli said: `There are lies, damn lies and statistics'. That is the trouble with this Government. It is so consumed by statistics that it is out of touch with the people, the economy and reality. Honourable members opposite are so busy sliding up and down their J-curves and getting shiny backsides that they have forgotten why they are here. We are here for one reason-for the people of Australia. The `p' in politics stands for people. This Hawke-Keating Government has forgotten that, if it ever knew it. </PARA>
<PARA> How will this change affect the people of Australia? Once again, those in the front line are those least able to suffer or to take the blow-the pensioners and the unemployed of this country. The artificial cut in the consumer price index (CPI) will reflect directly on the pensioners and the unemployed. The Government says that it is a oncer-a one-off for this quarter. That would be bad enough, but it is not true. The fact is that the Government's move has reduced the base rate not for one quarter, not for one year, but forever. There has been a cut in the spending power of the people of Australia, of those on pensions and the unemployed, and those people will start hurting from October. There is a very real cut in spending power. </PARA>
<PARA> The cuts could cost the 770,992 single age pensioners up to $12.3m in just one quarter. The cuts could cost the 557,822 married pensioners up to $14.5 in just one quarter. There are total cuts for age pensioners of up to $26.8m for one quarter. Veterans and war widows are always in the front line too with this Government. Up to $4m a quarter or $16m a year has been cut from their benefits. With the age pensioners the total possible cuts for the year amount to $107.2m. At the end of June 1989 there were 389,000 invalid pensioners. Their benefits are going to be cut by up to $7m in one quarter-$28m in one year. At the end of March there were 550,000 unemployed people in this country. They are going to be slugged up to $5.5m in one quarter, up to $22m in a year. We have a total of up to $173.2m being cut from the poorer people of this country just by this one despicable, absolutely disgraceful playing with the figures-cooking the books so that expenditure can be cut back. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The unemployed, the invalid pensioners. The honourable member can say it is a disgraceful speech but that is camouflage. The Government is trying to hide it. What has happened is that this Government-and I will repeat it-is going to take from single age pensioners up to $12.3m a quarter. Their pensions are indexed to the CPI. Surely the honourable member for Fraser can understand that. Even an economist could understand that. If one reduces the increase in the CPI, one reduces the amount of income for pensioners. For most of these people the pension is their sole income. Their spending power is being cut by the amount the increase in the CPI is reduced. That means that their pensions or unemployment benefits do not go up. The honourable member must be able to understand that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What will the position be for these people? For veterans and war widows there is a cut of up to $4m a quarter or $16m a year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is most appropriate that the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) bases the matter of public importance on the concept of dishonesty. That is what he gave the House this afternoon-one great dose of dishonesty. The reality is that this matter of public importance was written and submitted prior to the Government's announcement of its reaction to the consumer price index (CPI) increase. It is predicated on the assumption that the Government was going to claim that the rate of increase for the quarter was one per cent when the reality was that the Government accepted, due to change in calculation method, that the appropriate figure was 1.6 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having been caught out on this assumption, which was proven to be terribly wrong, what we had was a pathetic attempt by the honourable member for Wentworth to simply rehash the matter of public importance from yesterday. Unfortunately the arguments have gone terribly stale over the last 24 hours. The matter of public importance is supposedly based on three factors concerning the Government's dishonesty in relation to the calculation of the CPI. The honourable member for Wentworth mentioned three. They included the most recent one concerning the cost of new housing and how it is calculated. The second argument he put forward was the change in the Budget in relation to beer excise. The third was the change in relation to the Medicare levy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us deal with each of those three factors in turn. As the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) quite adequately pointed out, this furphy floating around about changing the housing cost component is nothing but a furphy. The Australian Statistician himself, Mr Castles, has made it quite clear that the method which is now being adopted, that is, the debt profile method, is vastly superior and is a far more accurate reflection of the true cost of housing than the method that was in place, the simple revaluation method. The revaluation method was introduced by the Statistician in December 1986. At the time, Mr Castles quite readily admits, the method now in place, the debt profile method, was the superior method. But due to the fact that the simple revaluation method was a simpler concept to explain to the public and that an analysis done over the preceding nine years showed that there had been no great difference in the end result when applying either method, he decided to adopt the course he did. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, as events turned out, that proved to be a mistake in that we have had over recent years unprecedented demand in relation to housing. We have had a very buoyant housing sector with record new building starts. We have had difficulties in the Sydney region in terms of land supply and the added costs being imposed through local government and State government practices. There is also the high level of interest rates operating at this time. A combination of those factors meant that new housing prices and the cost of new mortgages are significantly higher than one already in place. </PARA>
<PARA> That was giving a false picture in terms of the total housing cost across the Australian community because we were only looking at new housing purchases. Clearly the debt profile method being now adopted by the Statistician is a superior method. There is no suggestion that this is some bodgie method and not an accurate calculation. If any honourable member of the Opposition is suggesting that and saying that the Statistician is a liar in claiming that the method is superior and that he was not leaned on by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to change the method, he should go outside the safety of this House and make that statement publicly so that the Statistician can challenge its veracity through the courts. Really, what it boils down to is that the Opposition is calling the Statistician a liar. There is no ducking from that particular point. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter simply flows on from a series of attacks the Opposition has made on high-ranking statutory office holders in this country. We all remember the attacks on the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Boucher, in relation to his stand against corporate tax evasion and on the Statistician in relation to householders' surveys conducted last year and this year. It is simply a campaign to try to kill the messenger because the Opposition does not like the message it is being given. That is all it boils down to. </PARA>
<PARA> The second argument is that somehow reducing the excise on beer is really some sort of fiddle in relation to the calculation of the inflation rate. It may surprise the honourable member for Wentworth because I doubt whether he ever buys a beer. I would be surprised if anything but the finest cabernet sauvignon or the dearest bottle of French champagne ever passes his lips. If the honourable gentleman actually goes out into the real world, gets out of his red sports car and goes to the bottle shop in his local hotel, he will find-surprise, surprise!-that the cost of beer actually has fallen. He might also find-again, surprise, surprise!-that average Australians do not mind buying a beer. In fact, beer is an important component of expenditure in a lot of households. To say that a reduction in the price of beer in some way is a false indication of the level of inflation and should not be taken into account is ridiculous. It is an absolute furphy. So much for that argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The third argument concerns the Medicare levy. One would think the Opposition would give up beating a dead horse. We are talking about something that occurred five or six years ago and has been widely accepted by the Australian community and by economists in the business sector. No-one is now seriously arguing-if anyone ever did seriously argue-that the decision to discount the introduction of the Medicare levy was not a legitimate calculation in determining Australia's inflation rate. We have these three hollow, weak arguments put forward by the honourable member for Wentworth who is suggesting that there has been dishonesty in calculating Australia's inflation rate. He then went on to point out what is self-evident-that is, that the Government would like inflation to be lower than it is. Of course we would like that. The reality is that we have in place the policy framework which will achieve that end. Unlike when the honourable member was the adviser to the then Treasurer and present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), Australia does not have double digit inflation at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> We have now the famous troika trying to get control back on the treasury bench-the former Treasurer and now Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth, who was his adviser, and the former head of the Treasury, Senator Stone. Those three famous Australians who gave us double digit inflation are back for a second go, saying, `We can do it better'. They still do not have the fundamentals in place or any wages policy. They decry the accord, saying, `The accord has led to an increase in wages; isn't this a terrible thing?'. That is not a terrible thing. Wages should increase and through the accord we have had the sacrifice which the Australian community has needed to make in recent years in order to spread successfully and evenly the burden of economic change. As a result of the accord there have been increases in wages, especially to those most in need. There has been a large increase in the social wage and government assistance to those most in need, but at the same time in terms of business the accord has led Australia to have a competitive wage situation. That has resulted directly in 1.3 million more Australians now being in employment than was the case when the honourable member for Wentworth had something to do with the way Australia was managed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has no alternative. It has no policy framework in place for dealing with inflation. If it has any policy at all it is simply to throw Australia into recession, to throw hundreds of thousands of people out of work. It tries to destroy union power and at the end claims that this may lead to decreased inflation. The present Opposition had its chance in put its policies in place. It attempted to do that. It had huge levels of unemployment. Business confidence was at an all time low while bankruptcies were at an all time high. We had double digit inflation. It simply did not work. The Opposition talks about our learning nothing over recent years, but over the last decade it has gone nowhere. It has gone backwards. That is the reality of the situation. The Government has in place a suitable inflation policy. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides an additional weapon against potential corruption in the Australian Federal Police, increases the functions of the Australian Federal Police and improves the administration of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in a number of significant respects. The Bill proposes the inclusion of a new part Va in the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 which provides for existing and former members of the AFP to lose certain superannuation rights and benefits if convicted of an offence involving corruption and sentenced to life imprisonment or a term of imprisonment longer than 12 months or, if a member is found guilty of a relevant disciplinary offence and dismissed from the AFP, as a penalty for that offence. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments provide that all contributions payable by the Commonwealth under a superannuation scheme in relation to a relevant member or former member of the AFP shall cease, or cease to be payable, when the appropriate court makes a superannuation order. In such cases, the Commonwealth is not liable to pay any employer contributions or benefit under the scheme in respect of that person. The amendments entitle a member or former member of the AFP to payment only of a sum equal to the employee contributions plus the accrued interest on those contributions. Similar provisions apply where a member is found guilty of a relevant disciplinary offence and dismissed from the AFP for that offence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations do not apply to the Commissioner or the deputy commissioners. Amendments to section 17 will enable the Governor-General to determine terms and conditions about superannuation in relation to the Commissioner or deputy commissioners having a comparable effect to proposed subsection 49 (2) and applying where that person's appointment is terminated because of misbehaviour involving corruption, an abuse of office, or the perversion of the course of justice, or an attempt to pervert the course of justice. The loss of superannuation rights and benefits are penalties for dishonest service and breach of obligation to the Crown. They are not and should not be seen as penalties for committing certain criminal offences. Part Va is not retrospective in operation. Division 2 only applies to existing or former members of the AFP convicted after the commencing day for part Va while division 3 will only apply to members found guilty of relevant disciplinary offences and dismissed from the AFP as a penalty for that offence after the commencement day. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is adamant that it will not fund superannuation benefits of any kind for corrupt members of the AFP. This should be a major financial disincentive to any member of the AFP or to any person who may attempt to corrupt any member of that police force. Whilst this Bill applies only to existing and former members of the AFP, it is this Government's intention to introduce similar legislation in the Budget sittings of the Parliament which applies to officers of the Australian Public Service, other government employees and persons holding statutory offices. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also provides for the repeal of the cumbersome redeployment and retirement provisions currently in the Australian Federal Police Act and the inclusion of streamlined provisions. The proposed redeployment and retirement provisions will enhance the efficient administration of the AFP to the mutual benefit of the community and members of the AFP alike. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also gives effect to the Government's decision, in light of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee, that a national witness protection program be established. It is to be administered by the AFP on a cost recovery basis. Section 8 of the AFP Act is being amended to enable the Commissioner to enter into arrangements with a Commissioner of a State or Territory police force, the Chairman of the National Crime Authority, and a prescribed authority of the Commonwealth, State or Territory-other than the Australian Capital Territory (ACT)-to facilitate the provision of appropriate services. The AFP Act as currently drafted allows the AFP to provide protection for witnesses in relation to Commonwealth and ACT offences. </PARA>
<PARA> The national witness protection program will not be fully operational until a substantial number of Commonwealth, State and Territory laws are amended to facilitate the effective operation of the program. It is an important and necessary tool in the fight against organised crime in Australia, and the Government is determined to ensure its early implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also contains amendments to the AFP of a minor policy nature relating to the appointment of fixed-term senior executive officers, superannuation for fixed-term senior executive officers, prescribing fees for certain police services, the making of regulations for the advancement or accelerated advancement of a member within a rank and for arrangements between the Minister and the Administrator of an External Territory for the provision of police services in relation to that Territory. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Horticultural Legislation Amendment Bill amends the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987, the Horticultural Export Charge Collection Act 1987, the Horticultural Levy Collection Act 1987 and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987. The purpose of the Bill is to provide additional charge and levy collection arrangements under which horticultural industries are able to participate in the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation through product levies and export charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Two problems have arisen with the current arrangements. Firstly, some industries, such as the nursery industry, have confirmed their willingness to participate in these corporations. However, their proposed levy and charge collection arrangements cannot be accommodated under existing legislation. Secondly, more cost-effective collection arrangements have been identified for some industries already participating under the corporations but again these cannot be implemented under existing legislation. At present, in order for the better securing of levies and charges on horticultural products, amounts are paid to the Commonwealth on behalf of the producer or owner of prescribed horticultural products by the first purchaser, selling agent or exporting agent as the case may be. This arrangement is satisfactory where there are a relatively few first purchasers and agents. However, this structure is not the case for some horticultural products and alternative cost-effective collection arrangements have been developed in consultation with industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Under these proposed arrangements, amounts on account of levy and charge will become payable at the point of purchase of prescribed goods and services used in the production of horticultural products prescribed under the amendments. The point of collection will be moved forward in the production and marketing chain to a point before the product being levied has been actually produced. The sellers of these goods and services will be obliged to pay the amounts on account of levy and charge to the Commonwealth, but only after they have in turn received payments of the amounts from the purchaser. If, however, the purchaser does not intend to produce leviable or chargeable horticultural products with the goods or services purchased, it will be possible for them to seek an exemption from the requirement to make payment. Refunds of amounts paid will also be possible under certain conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The nursery industry has advised that it wishes to participate in both the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Research and Development Corporation. Its proposed collection arrangements will be based on the purchase by industry members of containers such as plastic pots used in the production of potted plants, which will be prescribed as the leviable or chargeable horticultural product. The blueberry industry has confirmed that it wishes to participate in the Australian Horticultural Corporation only and has suggested a similar collection arrangement involving the purchase by blueberry growers of cartons in which fruit is packed for sale. The operative rates of levy and charge applicable to nursery products and blueberries and other administrative matters regarding the manner of payment will be set down in regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly pleased to see that these industries have decided to join these corporations, which were established principally to assist horticultural industries to develop their potential in export markets. Exports are fundamental to the further development of the horticultural industries. These industries will come under increasing pressure as production rises above the capacity of the domestic market to absorb it, and as competition from imports increases. This competition will occur as a result of such factors as the development of quarantine protocols, and the Government's commitment to the freeing of agriculture and other trade through multilateral trade negotiations. It is therefore imperative that horticultural industries develop a commitment to export, through marketing; through the development of quality produce; and through a commitment to sustain long term production for export. </PARA>
<PARA> While the response needs to come largely from industries themselves, the corporations are well placed to act as catalysts in this process. The Government is to contribute $7.1m over five years to assist the corporations in their early operations. The apple and pear and citrus industries have participated in the corporations since their inception and the addition of other industries will assist in the longer term industry funding of them. It is expected that the amount raised under the nursery industry levy and charge will be approximately $750,000 per year, rising to $1m within the first few years. Amounts equal to half of the total raised are expected to be directed to the Australian Horticultural Corporation and half to the Research and Development Corporation. The Commonwealth will match expenditure of industry moneys identified for the latter body dollar for dollar, up to a limit of 0.5 per cent of the average gross value of production of the nursery industry. Amounts raised by the blueberry levy and charge are expected to be approximately $150,000 per year. This will have no financial impact on the Commonwealth as all proceeds will go to the Australian Horticultural Corporation. This body is to be fully funded by amounts by levy and charge, and fee for service. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the second main purpose of the Bill, that of providing alternative collection mechanisms for industries already participating in the Corporation. These amendments will provide for the Commonwealth to enter into an agreement with a State or Territory in order to provide for State and Territory authorities to collect horticultural levies on the Commonwealth's behalf. This arrangement will have particular application to the citrus industry, where it will lead to significant reductions in the cost of collecting levies and charges. Levy and charge payers will, under the proposals, be able to make payments to State citrus boards at the same time as they make payments of State levies. This will provide for substantial economies of scale in the administration of levy collections. In areas where there are no State boards or where a State elects not to enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth, the present arrangements whereby payments are made directly to the Commonwealth will continue to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, provisions in the Bill will allow persons having responsibility for levy and charge collections to receive payments from the corporations to offset costs borne by them in the collection process. The corporations will be able to enter into agreements with these persons on payments of costs. It is expected that they will first need to consult with individual industry bodies on the payment of levy collectors for that particular industry levy or charge. Funds for such payments would be expected to be drawn from the relevant industry accounts of the corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill amends the search warrant provisions of the Horticultural Levy Collection Act and the Horticultural Export Charge Collection Act. These amendments refine the powers of authorised persons in relation to entry of premises and provide for seizure of evidence of the commission of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill is to amend the Horticultural Levy Act 1987 to increase the maximum rate of levy. The Horticultural Levy Act 1987, together with the Horticultural Levy Collection Act 1987, provide for the imposition and collection of a levy on prescribed horticultural products produced and sold or used in Australia. Currently, the Horticultural Levy Act 1987 sets the maximum rate of levy at 2 per cent of the annual average unit gross value in relation to the classes of horticultural products covered by these Acts. The funds raised are to finance the operation of the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. These corporations are an essential element in the Government's strategy to enhance the capacity of the horticultural industry to expand exports. They provide the mechanism for this sector to realise its full export potential through coordinated and sustained activity both in horticultural products marketing and in research. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry, notably the apple and pear sector, have requested the maximum rate of levy be increased from 2 per cent to 5 per cent with a view to possibly increasing levies to support these corporations' future activities. This Bill reflects industry's wishes in this regard. Operative rates will continue to be set by regulation under the Horticultural Levy Act. Total amounts of levies to be collected will rise over the next few years as the number of participating industries increases, and as the rates themselves rise as determined by the participating industries. Funds raised through increased levy receipts in respect of the Australian Horticultural Corporation will have no financial impact on the Commonwealth. This is apart from the $5.85m to be contributed by the Government over its initial five years of operation. All operating and administrative costs of the Corporation are to be fully funded by levies from industry fees-for-service. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional funds raised through the increased levy receipts in respect of the Horticultural Research Development Corporation will be matched by the Commonwealth, on a dollar for dollar basis, up to a limit of 0.5 per cent of the average annual gross value of production of groups of products. The extent of the Commonwealth's contribution to research will thus depend on the number of industries which agree to participate in the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation and the rates, up to the maximum, at which they are prepared to fund Corporation research activities. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of the Horticultural Export Charge Amendment Bill is to amend the Horticultural Export Charge Act 1987. The Horticultural Export Charge Act 1987, together with the Horticultural Export Charge Collection Act 1987, provides for the imposition and collection of a charge on the export of prescribed horticultural products.

<PARA> This Bill is the companion of the Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill 1989 dealt with earlier.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, which is now before the House, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Firstly, clause 3 of the Bill amends section 26 of the Act to complement changes made to the beer provisions of the Excise Tariff Act; and changes set out in Schedules 5 and 7 to this Bill. Schedule 1, operative on and from 1 January 1988 contains the following amendments: a change to reduce the rate of duty on embroidery kits from 25 per cent to 15 per cent as part of the new textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) arrangements; minor technical changes to rules 5 and 6 of the general rules for the interpretation of the harmonised system; and a change to item 42a in schedule 4 to accord with the tariff classifications set out in schedule 3 to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 2, operates on and from 1 July 1988, and contains an amendment to remove the 2 per cent revenue duty applying to chemically pure fructose; and amendments to the rates of duty applying to certain wallpaper and similar wall coverings, yarn of jute and certain textile hosepiping and similar textile tubing. These amendments reflect the Government's decisions on the chemicals and plastics industries, the post-1988 TCF arrangements and the 1988 May economic statement. Schedule 3 restores assistance arrangements to local production of certain spray heads. The new rate results from an Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) recommendation on these goods and came into operation on 14 October 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 4 operates on and from 25 January 1989 and implements the IAC's recommended rate of free for transport containers. Schedule 5 clarifies the Government's policy that topped crude oil for use other than as a refinery feedstock is subject to duty at a rate equivalent to that applying to fuel oil. Topped crude oil used as a feedstock remains duty free. This clarification is necessary following a recent decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and operates from 15 February 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 6, operative on and from 1 March 1989, contains minor adjustments to the assistance arrangements for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. These have been made following consultation with the industries. They allow concessional entry to certain carpets and floor coverings made by non-powered tufting machines held in the hand; and facilitate the importation of non-certified industrial crafts imported before 1 September 1989. The schedule also reduces the rate of duty applying to industrial overalls of New Zealand origin from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. This latter action is necessary to comply with the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement. Finally, schedule 7 which operates on and from 1 July 1989, contains amendments to provide a free rate of duty for gaseous hydrocarbons of heading 2711. This amendment arises out of the IAC's report on certain petroleum products and taxation measures; restore the rate of duty of 15 per cent to coated kraft paper and paperboard of subheading 4810.3 in accordance with the Government's decision on the pulp, paper, paper products and printing industries; implement the Government's decision on the tobacco growing and manufacturing industries, announced in November 1988; and provide a new concession for certain imported goods used in the production of excisable goods. This change complements amendments to the Excise Tariff Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Anticipated revenue losses from the changes affecting transport containers are minor: approximately $300,000 in a full year; and approximately $165,000 for the balance of 1988-89. However, this will be more than offset by the substantial reductions in costs to the shipping industry. Savings are estimated to be in the order of $9m for a full year. The measures relating to topped crude oil clarify existing Government policy and as such should not increase or decrease revenue. Without the proposed amendment potential exists for revenue erosion exceeding $14m per annum. The remaining measures in the Bill are expected to have minimal financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of the amendments contained in this Bill have been included in an explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Today I bring into the House legislation establishing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). This legislation, the principles of which I first talked about 17 months ago in this place, has undergone the most extensive process of consultation and examination of any piece of legislation in recent times. It fulfils the commitments first given by me in this House on 10 December 1987 and reaffirmed, by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and me, in our statements to the Parliament on 11 April this year. The Government will proceed with ATSIC, which provides for an overdue and radical restructuring of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. We will proceed with ATSIC because of the urgent need for change, because of the urgent need to streamline the current administration and, above all, because of the urgent need to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people a real say in the decision-making process. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three Bills-the ATSIC Bill which I have just presented, the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill, and a Bill to amend the Aboriginal Development Commission Act 1980. The first two of these replace the Bill which was passed by the House last year but which the Senate set aside for report by a select committee. The changes being made today to the proposals put to the Parliament in that Bill do not affect the essential features of ATSIC. The Government has decided, however, that it would be more convenient to the Parliament and to the public generally, and in particular to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, to present new Bills which can stand on their own rather than to amend the 1988 Bill, which is being withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA> The third Bill amends the Aboriginal Development Commission Act in ways to make the operations of that Commission-the ADC-consistent with the way in which ATSIC will operate. Although the ADC will cease to exist when ATSIC comes into existence the Government considers it desirable to make these changes to address the problems that recent inquiries by the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance have brought to public attention. The ATSIC Bill I have introduced today is further evidence of the Government's willingness to consult on our original proposal. We have listened to the views and suggestions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and have made the relevant changes. We have accepted the overwhelming majority of recommendations made by the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs and included them in this new Bill. And we have taken on board the comments of the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance and have acted on the very important questions of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have a Bill which has had extensive input from a range of people. It is a piece of legislation which will give effect to Aboriginal and Islander self-management and it will do this through a structure which will be effective and accountable. I will now highlight the main features of the ATSIC proposal, as contained in the original Bill of August last year, and then outline the main changes. The 1988 Bill provided for-</PARA>
<PARA>the Commission to replace the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC);</PARA>
<PARA>a system of 60 regional councils, elected by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander residents, which would determine priorities, develop regional plans, and generally represent the interests of the regions;</PARA>
<PARA>a Commission of 15, of whom 12 would be elected by regional councillors grouped in zones for this purpose;</PARA>
<PARA>programs administered by Commission staff in line with regional priorities, with funding direct to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and individuals;</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal Hostels Ltd (AHL) and a renamed Institute of Aboriginal Studies to retain their independent existence, but with three Commissioners on their governing bodies;</PARA>
<PARA>staff to come under the Public Service Act;</PARA>
<PARA>ministerial powers balancing the requirements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-management with those of accountability to the Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA>a new body, the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation (AEDC), providing finance and services on an independent commercial basis for major Aboriginal enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus ATSIC is to combine, in the one organisation, the means for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to have a real say in the management of their own affairs with an administrative structure that eliminates existing overlaps. It will be more responsive to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wishes and attain appropriate standards of accountability for public funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Main Changes Arising from Recent Inquiries</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> My statement of 11 April this year and the Government's response to the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee contain the main elements of the proposed amendments to the legislation before the House today. The first group of these changes deals with issues relating to accountability. We have sought to balance the objective that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should have greater control over matters affecting them, with the principle of ministerial accountability for the correct and efficient use of public funds. The new Bill therefore-</PARA>
<PARA>establishes within ATSIC an Office of Evaluation and Audit, to undertake evaluations and internal audits on programs, projects and procedures, and to report at least quarterly to the Commission and the Minister. The head of the Office will have senior rank, and will be appointed by the Minister;</PARA>
<PARA>requires ATSIC to observe financial guidelines determined by the Minister;</PARA>
<PARA>requires ATSIC to keep the Minister informed about specific projects that are encountering difficulties;</PARA>
<PARA>specifies that a corporate plan will be prepared, and the Minister will be consulted about it; and</PARA>
<PARA>clarifies the distinction between commercial and non-commercial activities-a problem which has bedevilled the ADC. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's consideration of the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee has also produced a second set of changes, including-</PARA>
<PARA>an increase in the number of zones, and hence of elected Commissioners, from 12 to 17. This will achieve a better population balance between zones;</PARA>
<PARA>a sliding scale of numbers of Regional Councillors, commencing at 10 for regions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations of under 1,000 and rising progressively to 20 with populations of 10,000 or more;</PARA>
<PARA>a separate Bill, as mentioned at the beginning of this speech, for what is now to be called the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies;</PARA>
<PARA>a strengthening of provisions in such areas as eligibility for elected or appointed office, pecuniary interests, requiring full written assessments before substantial expenditures are approved, acting appointments and employment of consultants. </PARA>
<PARA>Voting System</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> One matter which had not been settled at the time of my statement to the Parliament last month was the system of voting for regional councils. I made it clear then that the Government would prefer to have a system which did not involve the establishment of a separate role based on race, and that it would explore certain possibilities with the Australian Electoral Commission. I can now inform the House that it is proposed that the electoral system will have the following features:</PARA>
<PARA>Voters fill out a `voter card' which is printed on an envelope. The voter will certify that he or she is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person, enrolled on the Federal Electoral Roll at an address within the region. </PARA>
<PARA>Each polling booth will have at least one Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Liaison Officer. If the Senior Liaison Officer is of the view that a person is not eligible to vote, he or she must note that fact on the voter-card envelope. </PARA>
<PARA>Those people whose eligibility to vote has been challenged will have seven days to produce evidence of their Aboriginality. If they do so their votes will be included in the count. Those people whose votes are not counted will be able to have the matter heard in the Court of Disputed Elections. </PARA>
<PARA>Completed ballot papers are sealed inside the voter's `voter card' envelope, and are opened only if the vote is not rejected, and once the count begins. </PARA>
<PARA>Postal votes close off six days after the poll. Postal votes will be witnessed by a person on the electoral roll in the normal way. The sealed `voter card' envelope will be endorsed by a second person who is either an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person who is an office-bearer of an Aboriginal Corporation active in the region, or a member of the staff of ATSIC. The endorsement will certify that the person voting is in fact an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. A false certification of Aboriginality will be an offence under the electoral rules. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Electoral Commission will satisfy itself that all voters are enrolled at an address which is in the relevant region. </PARA>
<PARA>The vote of any person not on the federal electoral roll at an address within the relevant region will be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission will prepare for each region a statement showing the particulars of all cases where voter cards have been set aside on the grounds that the voter was not an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person. The statement will be available for inspection by interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA>This system will ensure that Aboriginality or Torres Strait Islander status is open to challenge and determination on an open and fair basis, and will avoid the negative factors associated with the establishment and maintenance of a special public roll for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The system outlined will be part of the election rules to be gazetted under part 3 of the Bill, and could be disallowed by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The Preamble</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The House will recall that in my statement of 11 April I explained why the Government was not accepting the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee in relation to the preamble to the Bill, and for the transfer of certain functions of the ADC to the proposed Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation. It is clear that concerns that have been expressed about the preamble are not well based. The majority report of the Select Committee confirms this. Note, for example, paragraph 3.7 which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a preamble is of no legal force by itself. It is generally treated by the courts as an aid to ascertaining the intent of the Parliament in making a particular piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>And later, in paragraph 3.16, the Committee says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . some may be misled into thinking the Preamble has some force in law which it does not. </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 3.9 the Committee notes that the preamble does not relate to the content of the Bill, and expresses the belief in paragraph 3.12 that the legal position of a preamble as set out in the Acts Interpretation Act, combined with my second reading speech, would tend to ensure the legal neutrality of the preamble. Such views support the Commonwealth's carefully considered position. I remind the House of what I said about the preamble in my second reading speech last year. I shall repeat it all, because of its importance in interpreting the Government's intentions:</PARA>
<PARA> In my statement of 10 December-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, of 1987-</PARA>
<PARA>I indicated that it would be fitting, particularly in this our bicentenary year, for the legislation establishing the Commission to contain a declaration, in the form of a substantial preamble, which sets down the Australian people's commitment to the recognition and protection of the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and to measures to overcome their disadvantage. In addition, I made it clear that the preamble would contain a significant and historic recognition by the Commonwealth Parliament that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia were the prior occupiers and original owners of this land. Since making that statement, much has been said and written about the proposal to have the Commonwealth formally recognise what the vast majority of Australians have been prepared to acknowledge for some time as historical fact. There has been considerable discussion amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups, and between them and the Government, about the wording of the preamble. In particular, I wish to inform the House of consultations which have taken place on recital three of the preamble and the role of these consultations in the formulation of recital three. </PARA>
<PARA> During the consultations some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups expressed concern about the Government's original formulation of recital three. They feared it could lead to certain Aboriginal and Islander groups being disadvantaged in current litigation. The Government's intention has, by contrast, always been that the language of the preamble would be neutral and have no legal consequences for present or future litigation in relation to land claims. The language was, and is, in no way intended to recognise land rights claimed to exist, to create new rights for land or compensation or to remove or qualify rights under existing law. Nor was it, or is it, intended to restrict any future developments in the law. Accordingly, the Government was prepared to agree to amend the original language of recital three to meet the perception by some groups of a possible negative impact upon current litigation. I emphasise the neutrality of recital three, conscious of the fact that courts can, in certain circumstances, have regard to second reading speeches and other extrinsic material to assist in ascertaining the Parliament's intention with regard to relevant legislation. Recital three, as now written, is intended simply to record the historical fact that up to the present time the Australian courts have not recognised Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander property rights in land except in relation to title granted by Federal, State and Territory governments. When endorsed by the Parliament in the name of the Australian people, the preamble will stand as an historical expression of philosophy and principle. The intention that the preamble has no legal consequences in no way detracts from its importance as a statement of those facts. I am happy to state that the preamble has the support not only of the vast majority of the indigenous groups of this nation but also will, I am confident, enjoy the support of the wider community throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>This Parliament has already passed a resolution affirming its commitment to Australia's indigenous peoples. It should therefore not shrink from recognising, in a symbolically significant way through this preamble, the facts of history, and of the Australian people's commitment to the recognition and protection of the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and to measures to overcome their disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>The Development Corporation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation-which was previously titled the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation-is intended to operate on a totally commercial basis. To transfer to it functions of the ADC, containing as they frequently do concessional elements such as grants and lower interest loans, would jeopardise the commercial standing of the Corporation in the marketplace. In addition, such a transfer would be at odds with a prime purpose of ATSIC-to achieve better coordination of portfolio programs and administrative efficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA>Implementing ATSIC</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed in my 11 April statement, the Government's preferred position is that the legislation be passed by the Parliament in the current sittings, and that ATSIC commence, on an interim basis under five appointed Commissioners, on 1 October 1989. I remind the House that the Bill it passed in 1988 allowed for the possibility, in clause 221-replicated as clause 202 in this Bill-that ATSIC might need to operate on an interim basis with appointed Commissioners only. The interim Commission arrangement will allow the administrative machinery time to shake down and to prepare for the vital tasks for servicing regional councils and the full Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also recognises that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people need time to understand the changes that are being made and, more broadly, to get to know more about ATSIC and how it will work. They need this information before being asked to make the important decisions of electing their regional councillors and then those regional councillors electing commissioners. Following passage of this Bill the Government will provide adequate resources to assist in these processes. It has always been envisaged that only three commissioners would be ministerial appointments. For an interim Commission, however, this would result in unacceptable heavy burdens for commissioners; accordingly, for the interim period only-which cannot exceed 12 months-the number will be increased to five. It is the Government's intention, however, that the regional council elections be held as soon as possible after 1 October. </PARA>
<PARA>Detailed Provisions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the main elements of the Bill itself, focusing particularly on those elements that are changed from the 1988 Bill. Full details are, of course, included in the explanatory memorandum. I have already referred to the preamble, and the Government's firm resolve that it should remain in the Bill. The text of the preamble, I should say, is unchanged. Clause 2 provides for the Bill to commence on proclamation or, failing that, at six months from the date of royal assent. The objects of the Act in clause 3 have been expanded, consistent with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee, to include reference to past dispossession and dispersal of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. These words, I remind the House, are taken from the similar section of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of clauses relate to questions of accountability and administrative priorities. Clause 11 requires the Commission to prepare a corporate plan and to consult the Minister about it. Clauses 14, 17, 18 and 19, dealing with the Commission's powers in relation to grants of interest in property, enterprise loans and grants, grants for specific purposes, and guarantees, have been substantially tightened, and clause 20 requires repayments where conditions of grants or loans have not been met. Clause 27 provides for the establishment of the interim Commission of five members, while clause 57 deals with the estimates of ATSIC during the life of the interim Commission. Clause 73 requires the Minister to give ATSIC written directions about financial administration. Clauses 74 to 77 establish the Office of Evaluation and Audit; in clause 70, the Commission is required to include in its annual report a report by the Director of the Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Part III of the Bill establishes the system of 60 regional councils, comprising elected representatives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in those regions. Functions of the councils include: formulation of regional plans; proposals for ATSIC expenditure in the region, including the preparation of regional budgets; and generally to advice on the views, and interests, of the residents of their region. This part also deals with regional council elections, though as noted earlier in my speech the detailed provisions will be contained in electoral rules made under clause 109. As I mentioned earlier, the numbers of regional councillors will vary, as recommended by the Senate Select Committee, between 10 and 20 according to population; this is covered by the definition of `prescribed number' in clause 4 of the Bill. There are to be special provisions for the Torres Strait Regional Council, and these are enabled by clause 112. I inform the House that I have reached agreement with the Islander Co-ordinating Council for a regional council of 20 members, to comprise the chairpersons of the 18 Islander councils established under the Queensland Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984, plus representatives of two other communities in the region who do not have Council status under that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Part III also establishes zones for the purpose of elections of commissioners. As I have mentioned, the number of zones is to be increased from 12 to 17. The new zone structure is set out in schedule 1 to the Bill. The additional zones will be: one each for the Sydney, Brisbane and Perth regions; for the Darwin, Tiwi Islands and Daly River regions in the Northern Territory; and for the existing Aurukun and Doomadgee regions in Queensland, combined with two new regions-Yarrabah-Palm Island, and Woorabinda-Cherbourg. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 136 and schedule 4 provide for disputed elections. Such disputes will now be taken before a Court of Disputed Elections. The previous Bill provided for a system involving application to the Minister for an inquiry which, if agreed to, would have been considered by a suitably qualified person. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IV of the Bill establishes the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation-the Corporation-which would have Commission representation on its Board of Directors. The Corporation would concentrate wholly on commercial activities, and thus provide a focus for the commercial and economic development of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through the accumulation and utilisation of a substantial capital asset for those people. Apart from the change of title to the proposed Corporation, the main changes in this part relate to strengthened administration and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> Parts V and VI deal with a range of miscellaneous, consequential and transitional provisions. Included in part V is the provision, in clause 198, that the staff of Aboriginal Hostels Limited will come under the Public Service Act. Apart from this change, and the intention that three members of the Company's Board be drawn from the numbers of ATSIC Commissioners, the operations of Aboriginal Hostels Limited will not be affected. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> For the last 16 months the Government has been consulting with interested groups about this legislation. We have extensively examined our original proposal as well as the first ATSIC Bill introduced into this place last year. We have listened to people's concerns and we have followed their recommendations. We have been extremely flexible on this piece of legislation because we wanted to get it right. We wanted to ensure that the new structure we put in place was an improvement on the current arrangements. We wanted to ensure above all else than any new administrative body would work to the benefit of Aboriginal and Islander people. The Government believes that this Bill will achieve all of these aims. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been some people who have criticised the proposal to involve Aboriginal and Islander people in the decision making process. The main argument used against ATSIC by these people-and in the main they are political opponents-is that the new Commission will `divide' Australia. They tend to justify this by alleging the Government is setting up a separate Black Parliament. ATSIC is not a parliament. It has no powers to make laws. Its own power is derived from legislation and it is accountable to the Minister and to this Parliament. The Opposition knows this. It uses the term only to distort the debate and to attempt to do exactly what they accuse us of doing-divide Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been no critical analysis of ATSIC by the Opposition. Opposition members have never offered anything constructive, nor have they come up with any viable alternative. Their only contribution has been to say that the existing system is fine and does not need changing. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate on this legislation provides an opportunity for the Opposition to make some contribution on the future directions for Aboriginal Affairs. The Opposition's response should be closely examined by all of us to see whether it really is interested in the improvement of delivery of service and in Aboriginal and Islander self-management. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I stress again what I said in this place in my speech in August last year. The establishment of ATSIC will lead to a very significant change in Aboriginal Affairs and in the way the portfolio will be administered in the future. It is important, however, that this change be looked at not in isolation but as part of a series of changes aimed at bringing about long overdue reforms. These reforms can and should only occur with the proper participation and involvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The implementation of reform in Aboriginal Affairs depends largely on how governments, the bureaucracy, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and the broader community tackle the challenges that now confront them. </PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal and Islander Studies Bill</PARA>
<PARA> At a government level it is important to maintain the political will to follow through the changes. The challenge for the bureaucracy is to adapt positively to changes in their roles in a responsive and constructive way. It is equally important that the broader community builds on the understanding and support that currently exists in society to bring about far-reaching reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in order to realise the philosophy of self-determination and self-management-demands Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been talking about since well before the 1967 referendum-it is crucial that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people take up the challenge and provide the direction for all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum and I have great pleasure in commending the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence of a recommendation of the Senate Select Committee into the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, the Government has agreed to introduce this Bill as separate legislation, rather than as a component part of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989. The Bill establishes a new body to replace the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS) established by an Act of this parliament in 1964. In large measures, the legislation enables the new Institute to operate very much as the AIAS currently operates, but with a new emphasis on the participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons with an interest and involvement in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the Institute's functions are to undertake and promote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies, to encourage and train research workers, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers, and to undertake research in its own right. The Institute also has a role in encouraging greater understanding in the general community of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies. </PARA>
<PARA> Membership of the new Institute will be made up of those persons who are now either full, associate, or corresponding members of the AIAS, plus such other persons appointed by the Council to be members. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council of the new Institute will consist of four persons elected by the members of the Institute, one person who is a Torres Strait Islander appointed by the Minister, and four other Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders appointed by the Minister, of whom at least three will be members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. As a consequence, the Council will henceforth comprise a majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander members. As at present, the Council will determine the policy of the Institute with respect to all matters. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a research advisory committee with a majority elected by the membership of the Institute. The functions of the Committee will be to advise the Council in relation to research matters, applications for research grants, and applications for Institute membership. </PARA>
<PARA> The staff of the new Institute will be engaged under the Public Service Act 1922. Provision will be made for the Institute to engage research fellows as consultants to undertake research as at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in formulating this Bill, consulted with representatives of the Council, and has attempted to meet the various concerns articulated where consistent with its overall objectives. For example, in response to concerns regarding the status of information held by the Institute, the legislation now provides that the Institute, in providing advice to the Commission or the Minister, is not required to disclose information which is either held sacred by Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders or which infringes the privacy of particular persons. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's firm intention that the provisions of the Bill maintain the scholastic excellence and independent research capability which is very much a part of the operation and history of the AIAS. The Government is confident that the new Institute will remain an internationally recognised focus for study and research related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill was foreshadowed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his statement to this House on 11 April, when, in referring to the recommendations of the various inquiries, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We have, moreover, considered to what extent the thrust of those recommendations should apply to the ADC while it continues to function in the lead up to ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA>The main elements of this Bill, which I will outline, will ensure that the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), during its remaining life, operates on a similar basis to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and in a manner that properly reflects the Government's priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The functions of the Commission will be amended to enable the Commission, upon request, to provide information or advice to the Minister, including information regarding the Commission's expenditure. This will clarify the Minister's right to request information from the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The business enterprise provisions in section 24 of the principal Act will be modified to take into account the concerns identified by the Auditor-General in his recent report. In particular, the Commission will be required to satisfy itself that the enterprise is likely to become, or continue to be, commercially successful. This criterion replaces the previous criterion which merely referred to the capability of the Aboriginal persons involved to engage in the enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> The capability criterion is inadequate, because it leaves open the possibility that an enterprise may be funded notwithstanding that it has no prospects of commercial viability. In the Government's view, the commercial viability criterion is much more appropriate, focusing as it does on outputs rather than inputs; in effect, it encompasses the capability criterion without the paternalistic undertones. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for a number of changes to the financial provisions of the principal Act. The Minister will be given the power to approve the Commission's estimates of expenditure and to issue financial administration guidelines and directions. This will ensure that appropriate ministerial oversight can occur, and that the Commission operates within the parameters of government policy. The Bill also extends the potential role of the Auditor-General to the audit of subsidiary companies controlled by the Commission. Section 24 (4) of the principal Act already provides for the recovery of business enterprise loans and grants where the terms and conditions of funding are breached. This provision is to be extended to cover all grants-loans of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, a number of changes are proposed to staffing arrangements. The Commission currently determines terms and conditions of employment in consultation with the Public Service Commission under section 33. In fact, the approved terms and conditions are almost identical to Public Service Act terms and conditions. The amendment Bill will formalise this by providing that all ADC staff be engaged under the Public Service Act 1922. Staff currently employed will be transferred into the Public Service under section 81b of the Public Service Act 1922. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment Bill will also provide for the appointment by the Minister, after consultation with the Commission, of a General Manager with responsibility for managing the day to day administration of the Commission. The ancillary provisions relating to appointment, remuneration, leave of absence and so on are consistent with those provisions proposed for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, let me state once again that this Bill is directed toward remedying the administrative defects in the legislation which established the Aboriginal Development Commission, while maintaining an appropriate balance between accountability and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-management and self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill authorises the Commonwealth to enter into a new five-year agreement with each State and with the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory for the provision of services for homeless people in crisis under a new supported accommodation assistance program (SAAP). </PARA>
<PARA> When this Government came to office in March 1983, it identified homelessness as a major priority for urgent attention. At that time, there were no clear policies or directions to remedy youth or older age homelessness and there was no co-ordination of emergency accommodation services for women and children. Some programs were administered and funded by the Commonwealth and others were administered and cost shared by States. There was no overall planning and programs were uncoordinated and unnecessarily complex. Needs were not being met due to lack of planning and due to restrictions on the assistance which could be provided. Funding of approved projects under existing program guidelines was often inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> On coming to office, we established, in 1983, a major review of crisis accommodation programs. The review found that there was no logical basis for the existing arrangements. As a result of the review's recommendations, the Government established the supported accommodation assistance program-or what is known as the SAAP program-in January 1985, bringing together existing services under a common funding and policy auspice. </PARA>
<PARA> SAAP is a joint funded Commonwealth-State program administered by the States. Under the program, non-government organisations and local government authorities receive recurrent and non-housing capital funds to provide supported accommodation and related support services to homeless people in crisis and who need help to move towards independent living. </PARA>
<PARA> A wide range of services are provided including refuges, drop-in centres, half-way houses, meals services, counselling in daily living skills and referral and advocacy services. The program's operation is governed by a Commonwealth-State agreement, which will expire on 30 June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> A jointly funded national evaluation of the SAAP program was conducted by an independent consultant, Colleen Chesterman, in 1987 to examine the program's effectiveness and to advise on ways of refining its design and focus. In the course of the review, virtually all SAAP service providers were consulted, as well as numerous organisations supporting the homeless in every State and Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The SAAP review report, Homes Away from Home, was publicly released in February 1988. The report noted the program's major achievements to date. It concluded that SAAP was well targeted, providing vital emotional and material assistance to the most disadvantaged people in Australia-people who are poor with insecure housing, many of whom having suffered physical abuse, addiction or institutionalisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The review noted that there has been a marked increase in the level of resources allocated by both Federal and State governments since the introduction of SAAP, which has resulted in greatly expanded assistance for homeless people in crisis. There are now some 800 SAAP services operating in a co-ordinated fashion from some 1200 outlets. </PARA>
<PARA> Data from the national SAAP client data collection indicates that, on any one day, more than 11,000 people throughout Australia are assisted under SAAP, of which 1,500 are in youth refuges; 2,500 are in women's refuges; 4,200 are in general crisis accommodation services; and 3,100 receive non-accommodation services such as meals, counselling and advice. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, the introduction of SAAP has placed many services on a secure financial footing for the first time. This has enabled providers to improve the quality of accommodation and the appropriateness of services provided, particularly through the provision of non-institutional client focused services. The SAAP review recommended the continuation of SAAP as a jointly funded Commonwealth-State program, supported by a new five-year agreement with each State and Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent report of the National Inquiry into Homeless Children undertaken by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission-known as the Burdekin report-reinforces the need for a supported accommodation assistance program. Clearly, responses to the complex web of issues related to youth homelessness cannot be confined to one policy area or level of government. However, the new SAAP program will provide major improvements to the Government's reponse to the problem of homeless young people. Some States have already increased the emphasis on medium and longer term alternatives to youth refuges, and this trend will continue under the new program. The development of a range of types of services with an emphasis on moving to independent living as soon as possible will be encouraged, consistent with the recommendations of the SAAP review report. </PARA>
<PARA> A draft Commonwealth-State agreement was presented to social welfare Ministers at their meeting on 20 March 1989. State Ministers endorsed that agreement but the Commonwealth was concerned to ensure that the position on young children was clarified. To this end, a definition of young people has been included. The agreement, which forms a schedule to this Bill, covers the joint arrangements for a new jointly-funded Commonwealth-State program administered by the States and Territories which would operate for five years from 1 July 1989. The agreement takes account of the experience of the current program, the views of States and community groups expressed through the operation of the program and its advisory processes and the SAAP review's findings and recommendations. The objective of the new program will be the provision by non-profit organisations and local government, with financial assistance from the Commonwealth and the States, of transitional supported accommodation services and related supported services to men, women and children who are homeless and in crisis to help them move towards independent living, where appropriate, or other alternatives, such as long term supported housing, as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary principle of the new program is to ensure that homeless people in crisis in Australia have access to adequate and appropriate transitional supported accommodation and related support services. In implementing this principle, assistance provided will also reflect the following detailed principles. </PARA>
<PARA>The focus of the program will be on transitional assistance. Services will be designed to be of varying duration and levels of support to meet the needs of individuals to move towards independent living or other appropriate alternatives; the emphasis will be on ensuring individuals retain maximum independence; there will be early assessment of clients' needs, referral to more appropriate services or programs where required and available and assistance to secure long term housing alternatives; services will be available to all sections of the community; services will be sensitive to the problems of homelessness, domestic violence and personal crisis and will actively work to enhance the dignity, self-esteem and independence of clients; services will assist clients in ways which recognise the individual needs of clients, develop clients' independence and enhance their own support network; and priority will be given to services involved in direct service provision for homeless people in crisis and whose focus is on assistance for individual clients. </PARA>
<PARA> The new program will cover a range of service models of varying duration, type and level of support. It will include services designed to meet the particular needs of women who are homeless and/or in crisis as a result of domestic violence as well as services for Aboriginal people and people from non-English speaking backgrounds. Services for chronically homeless people with limited capacity for independent living will continue to be eligible. It is important that SAAP not be used as a substitute for other programs of assistance by State governments for homeless youth. State governments have responsibility for children under 16 years and the Commonwealth is concerned to ensure that SAAP does not become the easy way out for States. For this reason, the agreement provides that new services-and I stress `new services'-which cater exclusively for children under 16 years will not be funded under this program. As well, the agreement provides that SAAP will not be used to replace or duplicate services and assistance already provided by, or which are the responsibility of, other government programs or services, such as substitute care and aged care. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new program all people who are homeless and in crisis are able to be assisted. However, for some groups, such as young people under 16 or the frail aged, SAAP cannot provide the specialised services required. The program embodies the principles that for all groups helped under the program there is to be early assessment of clients' needs and referral to more appropriate services or programs where required and available. No existing SAAP services will be disadvantaged by the introduction of the new arrangements. Services currently funded under SAAP will continue to be funded under the new program, subject to normal accountability and performance standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Financial assistance to the States shall be by way of grants. The Commonwealth and the States will continue to provide base funding equivalent to the level of their annual contributions to the program as at 30 June in the year immediately preceding the relevant financial year, indexed on an annual basis. At 30 June 1989, Commonwealth base funding for SAAP will be $64.1m and the States' base funding will be $40.3m. This represents a real increase of 240 per cent in Commonwealth-State funding for SAAP since the commencement of the program in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the very great increase in Commonwealth-State resources devoted to homeless people in crisis, there is an urgent and increasing need for additional services. Accordingly, the Commonwealth is providing $5m per year for new and expanded services for the first three years of the new program on the basis of equivalent forward commitment and dollar for dollar matching by the States. Commonwealth and State growth funds accepted in one year would be incorporated in the program base for the following year and the total base indexed. In total, this represents an increased Commonwealth commitment of $40m over three years. These additional Commonwealth funds will bring the total Federal Government commitment to the program, including maintenance of current expenditure, to about $240m over the three years to 1992, which represents real growth of some 20 per cent over the three-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> An important new feature of the SAAP program will be the development of Commonwealth-State and Territory plans which will set out the operation of the program for each year in the State or Territory. The plans shall include:</PARA>
<PARA>An assessment of existing service provision and distribution; an assessment of unmet need; the agreed Commonwealth-State priorities for the year, including identified target groups; program finances for the year; the timing, content and process of major program reviews; proposed research and data collections for the year in relation to the State program or on national issues; and the timetable for planning and approval processes in the current and the subsequent financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Feedback and advice from SAAP service providers and relevant community groups are a vital element in the development of the Commonwealth-State plan. Accordingly, the new program provides for the development of new and enhanced advisory structures. A ministerial advisory committee will be established in each State comprised of members drawn from service providers and other parties with relevant expertise-forming the majority of the Committee-and Commonwealth and State government officials. The ministerial advisory committee shall provide advice to Ministers on priorities to be taken into account in the annual planning processes, levels of unmet need and matters such as program accountability requirements, service standards and data needs. The plan itself will be jointly approved by the responsible Commonwealth and State Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the current SAAP program, there are three subprograms for homeless people in crisis relating to women, youth and general services. The SAAP review found that the current SAAP subprograms have played an important role in the establishment phase of SAAP but suggested that the subprogram focus had created unnecessary complexity, led to restrictions which disadvantaged certain high need groups-for example, single homeless women and families-and hampered flexibility in planning and referral. It recommended the replacement of subprograms with target groups. Accordingly, under the new program, funds will be allocated within States each year according to priority target groups rather than subprograms. Planning for the development of services and the allocation of resources will be on the basis of priority target groups identified in the planning process. The new program covers a range of measures which will lead to improved program effectiveness and efficiency. Apart from the plan, these include service agreements between all SAAP services and State governments incorporating agreed nationally consistent provisions, and regular review of service performance. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important feature of the proposed agreement is in the area of user rights. The Commonwealth and States will agree within two years of the commencement of the agreement on mechanisms for resolving breaches of individual rights. Such mechanisms will include principles and strategies for the protection of users' rights, which may include such matters as participation in decision-making. Mechanisms will also include internal grievance procedures for the resolution of breaches of user rights at the service provider level and external review procedures. SAAP has been to the forefront in involving clients in decisions about issues which affect them. These proposals will continue to provide protection and dignity to people at a traumatic time of their life. </PARA>
<PARA> Assistance for homeless people in crisis is a shared Commonwealth-State responsibility and an area which requires close cooperation in order to achieve the best possible outcome from available resources. Both the Commonwealth and States have vital but different roles to play. To ensure that there is no duplication of effort, the Agreement clearly sets out Commonwealth and State roles and areas in which joint action is required. While the States will continue to be responsible for administration of the new program, joint ministerial approval will continue to be required in respect of matters such as the funding of new services and variations to, or defunding of, existing services. </PARA>
<PARA> Capital funds for SAAP services will continue to be made available under the crisis accommodation program (CAP) within the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. In 1988-89 the Commonwealth will provide $19.5m under CAP. SAAP and CAP will be dealt with by the same advisory committee in each State to provide a coordinated approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from authorising financial assistance to the States, this Bill seeks authority for the Commonwealth to use up to 2 per cent of Commonwealth growth funds each year for the purpose of national research and development. This will provide scope for Commonwealth initiatives in program development and national research. Access to adequate and affordable housing for all is a major priority within the Government's social justice strategy. The new supported accommodation assistance program will build on the experiences of SAAP over the last 4 1/2 years and will provide a more coherent and effective approach to the problems of people who are homeless and in crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Through this Bill, the Commonwealth, in partnership with the States and Territories, is continuing its commitment to the funding of supported accommodation and related services. I thank the State and Territory Ministers for their cooperation in the formulation of the new program. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House. I now present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 is to amend the Banking Act 1959 and other banking legislation to reflect a number of developments in the past several years. The major changes proposed are to provide the Reserve Bank of Australia with formal authority for the prudential supervision of banks; to remove the distinction between trading banks and savings banks; to replace the statutory reserve deposit requirement on trading banks with a new non-callable deposit requirement on all banks; and to make the arrangements for collection and publication of banking statistics more flexible. </PARA>
<PARA> The banking system is central to the operation of the financial system and has an important contribution to make to the wider economy. It is therefore important that the stability of the banking system be promoted through the observance of high prudential standards by banks. The Reserve Bank has a statutory obligation under the Banking Act to protect those who deposit funds with banks. In keeping with this obligation and its general responsibility for the stability of the financial system, the Reserve Bank has developed arrangements under which each bank is encouraged to keep itself in a sound financial position and to conduct its business in a prudent and professional manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The prudential requirements observed by banks in Australia, like those applying in other developed countries, relate to such matters as the adequacy of capital, the structure of assets and liabilities, management of exposures to risk, the capacity of its directors and senior management, and the representation of shareholders by directors. These arrangements for prudential supervision have relied heavily upon the cooperation of individual banks. This system has worked well but, in the light of the increased number of banks now operating in Australia, changes in banking activities and the more competitive and demanding environment in which banks operate, it is desirable for the Reserve Bank to have a clear statutory basis for its prudential supervision of banks. The Government considers that prudential arrangements for banks should be related to specific powers within the Banking Act and that the role of the Reserve Bank as prudential supervisor of banks should be recognised formally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will amend the Banking Act in a number of ways to achieve this. In particular, it will provide for the Treasurer (Mr Keating), having consulted with the Reserve Bank, to recommend that the Governor-General establish requirements in relation to prudential matters by way of regulations. This power will be supplemented by an increase in the scope already permitted in the Act for the Governor-General to place conditions on banking authorities. The Bill will also establish formally the role of the Reserve Bank in the prudential supervision of banks and transfer to the Reserve Bank the powers currently resting with the Auditor-General to conduct investigations of banks. As a consequence of the Reserve Bank's continuous conduct of prudential supervision, and the publication of its prudential rules, its present requirements are well known and understood by the banking sector. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not the Government's intention that the amendment of the Act should alter the prudential standards being met by banks or the way in which they are administered. Rather, the Government considers that the power to make regulations relating to prudential requirements should be seen as a reserve power to be used when circumstances require it. The amendments proposed in this Bill will also give legislative effect to the Treasurer's announcement in the Budget last year of the removal of the distinction between savings banks and trading banks. The general nature of these amendments is to make the provisions currently applying to trading banks apply to all banks, and to repeal specific provisions relating to savings banks. The maintenance of a distinction between savings banks and trading banks no longer serves any policy purpose. In recent years most savings bank subsidiaries of banks have existed not as distinct physical or managerial structures but as different sets of accounts within banking groups. From a customer's viewpoint there is no effective difference between savings and trading banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Removal of the distinction between them will enable banks to have better use and allocation of funds, more simple funding and accounting arrangements, and greater flexibility in servicing customers. These gains ultimately will benefit bank customers through a lower cost of bank services. As a result of comments which have been received from the banking industry consideration is being given to some further amendment of the Banking Act to facilitate the integration of the accounts of savings banks and trading banks. This change will not change the extent to which banks now lend money to customers for housing purposes, nor will it affect the price of housing loans. </PARA>
<PARA> The third major change proposed in this Bill is the removal of the statutory reserve deposit (SRD) requirement on trading banks. Both the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System and the Martin Group recommended that this outmoded measure should be modified. The SRD requirement has had distorting effects on the financial system because it has increased the cost of trading bank lending, diverted business to savings banks and other non-bank financial institutions, and encouraged banks to fund their operations through sources other than Australian dollar deposits, such as commercial bills, offshore borrowings and foreign currency deposits. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer announced at Budget time, the SRD requirement is being phased down over a three-year period and replaced with a system of non-callable deposits which banks will be required to maintain with the Reserve Bank as part of their obligations as authorised banks. By the end of the transitional three-year period all the banks affected will hold non-callable deposits with the Reserve Bank equivalent to one per cent of their liabilities. The effect of the new arrangements will be to remove the distorting effect of the SRD arrangement and generally reduce the burden on banks and their customers. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements represent a further and significant step in the process of financial deregulation which the Government has brought about with a view to raising the overall efficiency of the banking sector and thereby increasing the scope for it to contribute to the broader economy. The change is estimated to involve a cost to revenue of $100m each year, or roughly half the SRD revenue in 1987-88, by the time the transitional period is completed in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> Precise costs will of course depend on a number of variable factors such as the level of interest rates and the rate of growth in banks' assets and liabilities. The Government proposes to review the non-callable deposit arrangements before the end of the transitional period and, in particular, to consider adopting a lower maximum rate than that currently proposed in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes a number of other changes to the Banking Act and to related legislation with a view to ensuring that the legislative framework is relevant to the present banking system and flexible in its administration. The Bill proposes that arrangements for the collection and publication of statistics about banks should be simplified and made more flexible by allowing the details of these arrangements to be determined through regulations rather than spelled out in the Act as at present. The latter arrangement has proved to be inflexible in the light of the significant and rapid changes which have taken place in the nature of financial markets and the types of financial instruments used by banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's ability to monitor the financial sector will be improved by the scope which it will have under the amended Act to adjust the form of statistical returns which banks are required to make. We shall, however, keep in mind the continued need for consultation over such changes and for minimising reporting burdens. There should be some resource savings both for the banks and the Government from these amendments, since unnecessary requirements will be able to be dropped more rapidly and the obligation on the Australian Statistician to receive and publish banking statistics, which duplicates work undertaken by the Reserve Bank, will be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> The first schedule to the Act, which lists authorised banks, will be updated and a procedure will be introduced to allow the Treasurer to amend the first schedule through publishing information in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. These changes will allow the public to be better informed as to those financial institutions which are authorised as banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision has been made in the Bill for a banking authority to be revoked by the Governor-General where a bank requests it and the Governor-General is satisfied that there is no objection on grounds of national interest. The new provision will allow greater flexibility since, in contrast to the present section, it will allow an authority to be surrendered or removed where a bank has not ceased to carry on business but wishes to continue as a financial institution without having the status and obligations of a bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 66 of the Banking Act, which requires that consent be obtained from the Treasurer for the use of the word `bank' in a business name or as a descriptive expression in relation to the business of a financial institution, has been revised in the Bill to clarify the meaning and scope of the provision. The purpose of the more detailed provision would remain as before-to avoid confusion on the part of the public between banks authorised under the Banking Act and non-bank financial institutions. The Bill proposes that a new provision be introduced into the Banking Act to provide a clear legislative basis for regulating the establishment of representative offices by international banks. Under the new provision it is intended that such banks should be required to seek the Treasurer's consent to open a representative office and to observe any conditions which he may establish. This provision would formalise arrangements which now operate on an informal basis. It would not imply any change in the Government's policy of welcoming the establishment of representative offices to undertake purely liaison activities on behalf of international banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes some proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Banks Act and the Reserve Bank Act. The proposed changes to the Commonwealth Banks Act would widen the board's power over the Commonwealth Bank's capital structure in line with the revised definitions of capital announced by the Reserve Bank in 1988, and streamline the Commonwealth Bank's reporting requirements. The proposed changes to the Reserve Bank Act are to simplify its internal accounting arrangements by abolishing the artificial separation between the note issue and central banking functions, and to remove some redundant reporting obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill addresses the fact that penalties for offences against the Banking Act have been unaltered since the Act came into force in 1959 and provides for them to be revised. It is intended that the relevant sections of the Act be amended to establish penalties for breaches of the Act or of its regulations which are consistent with penalty levels imposed on corporations in other significant legislation. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill, and a complementary Bill I shall introduce shortly, essentially bring to completion the Government's tax reforms in the superannuation arena. The first ingredients of the reform package where brought before the House in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1988 which I introduced on 30 November last. That Bill puts in place the framework of the new tax regime for superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. The present Bill complements those measures. Broadly, it effectively reduces for recipients of superannuation benefits and related amounts the tax they pay on eligible termination payments, superannuation pensions or annuities. This compensates them for the tax being imposed at that earlier point on employer contributions to superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the Government's undertaking at the time of the May 1988 economic statement, the Bill ensures that recipients of end benefits are not worse off because of the earlier taxing point for affected superannuation contributions. It also places the tax treatment of the superannuation business of life assurance offices, including State and Territory government insurance offices-known as SGIOs-and registered organisations-that is, friendly societies and employee associations-on the same footing as general superannuation funds, at the concessional rate of 15 per cent, allowing full franking rebates for dividend income under the imputation system on the same basis as for individuals. Associated measures in the Bill modify in various ways the deductions available to life offices to make them more compatible with the new tax treatment of superannuation business. </PARA>
<PARA> To complete the new rules for the taxing of entities conducting superannuation business, the Bill gives wide-ranging capital gains treatment to disposals of assets held in superannuation funds or in connection with the superannuation business of life offices and other entities. This gives them the benefit of the capital gains indexation concession which ensures that only real gains, rather than nominal ones, are subject to tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Following discussions with industry, the Bill also proposes several modifications to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6). A number of concessions sought by industry are being provided and there are some practical adjustments to the ways in which tax liabilities are determined. There remains to be put in place a tax instalment payment arrangement for superannuation funds that is to apply for the 1990-91 income year. Legislation to achieve this will be introduced later in the year. New legislative arrangements, also to apply from 1990-91, for the limiting of superannuation benefits under rules applied by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner are also to be included in later legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move on in more detail to the features of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Superannuation and other Retirement Benefits</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> With effect from 1 July 1988, lower tax will apply to eligible termination payments, known as ETPs, superannuation pensions and roll-over annuities. This will balance the taxing of contributions to superannuation funds and rolled-over unfunded ETPs. The new measures-which were announced in the May 1988 economic statement and expanded on in later announcements-will generally reduce the tax payable on superannuation and other retirement benefits in three ways. First, they will reduce the rates of tax for post-June 1983 components of ETPs by 15 percentage points to the extent that such a component is attributable to a taxed source. Secondly, a 15 per cent rebate of tax is being introduced for superannuation pensions and roll-over annuities taken from age 55, or as a death or disability benefit. Thirdly, by authorising tax reductions in appropriate cases, the Bill gives effect to our commitment that no recipient of a superannuation benefit will be worse off because of the tax on superannuation contributions. Transitional measures will phase in the tax reductions on end benefits to fit the gradual impact of the new tax arrangements on amounts being paid out under superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxation of Life Assurance Companies</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the treatment of superannuation funds generally, the Bill will give effect to the decisions announced in May 1988 to tax the superannuation and roll-over annuity business of life assurance companies from 1 July 1988. The assessable income of a life assurance company will include investment income from its superannuation and roll-over annuity business. It will also include post-30 June 1983 components of lump sum retirement benefits taken in the form of `golden handshakes' that are invested with the company. Also in the Bill are rules for apportioning the taxable income of a life assurance company between complying superannuation and roll-over annuity business, non-complying superannuation business, other life assurance and accident and disability business, and non-life assurance business. This break-up will allow the separate tax rates applicable to each class of business to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> With effect from the 1988-89 income year, all expenses of life assurance companies will be apportioned between exempt income and assessable income. Again lightening the effective tax burden, expenses incurred in bringing in superannuation premiums are to be made fully deductable even though those premiums are not taxable. In keeping with the taxing of superannuation funds, including State and Territory government superannuation funds, SGIOs are to be subject to Commonwealth income tax on income derived from their superannuation and roll-over annuity business in the same way as life assurance companies from 1 July 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill extends entitlement to franking rebates under the imputation system for franked dividends received by the insurance funds of life assurance companies on or after 1 July 1988. Surplus rebates from the taxation at 15 per cent of dividends received as part of their superannuation business will serve to reduce these companies' overall tax burden. The inter-corporate dividend rebate will no longer apply to dividends on shares forming assets of the insurance funds of a life assurance company. The Bill also safeguards against any technical argument that a life assurance company may be entitled to deductions as general management expenses for items of expense which are expressly not deductable to other categories of taxpayers, such as expenses incurred on entertainment or in paying fringe benefits tax. This amendment operates with effect from 26 May 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> In the May 1988 economic statement it was also announced that a life assurance company would be taxed on an overall company basis rather than on a fund-by-fund basis. This was to prevent life assurance companies from manipulating transfers of assets between statutory funds to gain undue tax advantages. In response to industry requests, life assurance companies will continue to be taxed on a fund-by-fund basis. However, the Government is committed to preventing life assurance companies from transferring assets between statutory funds solely for the purpose of reducing taxation liabilities. This matter is to be addressed further in consultation with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Non-resident Life Assurance Companies</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Dividends derived from assets included in the Australian insurance funds of a non-resident life assurance company are to be exempt from dividend withholding tax and instead taxed on assessment. The non-resident assurer will become entitled to a franking rebate in respect of the franked proportion of those dividends. These changes will apply to dividends paid to a non-resident life assurance company on or after 1 July 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>Rebate on Short Term Life Assurance Bonuses</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also implement the proposal announced in the May 1988 economic statement to increase the rate of the rebate of tax on bonuses received on or after 1 July 1989 in respect of certain short term life assurance policies. The rebate is to be increased from 29 per cent to 30 per cent in the case of friendly society policies and from 29 per cent to 39 per cent in the case of life assurance company policies. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxation of Registered Organisations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The comprehensive coverage of the superannuation tax reforms extends to the superannuation and roll-over annuity business of registered organisations. The new arrangements which apply to such business of life assurance companies will apply similarly to registered organisations from 1 July 1988 on the basis of the May 1988 economic statement. They are to apply to all registered organisations-both to friendly societies and to any other registered organisations that engage in relevant superannuation or roll-over annuity business. </PARA>
<PARA>Gains or Losses on Disposal of Assets</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes amendments that will extend generally the application of the capital gains and capital losses provisions of the income tax law to disposals of assets by complying superannuation funds, complying approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. The special capital gains rules will also extend to disposals of assets refer- able to the complying superannuation and roll-over annuity business of life assurance companies and registered organisations. All assets owned by such entities as at the end of 30 June 1988 will be taken for capital gains purposes to have been acquired on that date. This allows the capital gains tax provisions to apply regardless of the actual date of acquisition of the assets. </PARA>
<PARA> To prevent any retrospective application of the capital gains provisions to gains or losses that accrued on or before 1 July 1988, the acquisition cost of an asset will be taken to be either its market value or the amount of costs incurred on it to that date, whichever produces the smaller gain or loss on disposal. A major benefit of this capital gains tax treatment is that entities engaged in superannuation business will attract the indexation advantages of the capital gains provisions, including on dealings in some assets that would otherwise have been treated as trading transactions not subject to indexation. Further, the Bill provides for an exemption from tax for gains on disposals of units in a pooled superannuation trust by a complying superannuation fund, a complying approved deposit fund or a pooled superannuation trust. This exemption also extends to certain disposals of assets by a life assurance company or a registered organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>Superannuation Funds, Approved Deposit Funds and Pooled Superannuation Trusts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill modifies in several respects provisions dealing with the taxation of superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts that were introduced in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6). These modifications will provide a number of concessions and options that have been developed after consultation with the superannuation industry. One will provide an alternative optional method for calculating the tax exempt income of a superannuation fund which segregates some of its assets solely for use in meeting the fund's current pension liabilities. Income derived from the segregated assets will be exempt from tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Vicarious exemption from tax is being provided for pooled superannuation trusts, life offices and registered organisations on such part of their income derived from complying superannuation fund business as would have been tax exempt current pension income had it been derived by relevant funds. Another alternative method is being introduced for calculating the deduction available to a superannuation fund in respect of the cost of providing death and disability benefits. At their option, funds may claim a deduction for a portion of any death and disability benefits actually paid in a year of income. </PARA>
<PARA> A special deduction will enable tax exempt death benefits paid by superannuation funds to be paid at the same levels as before the changes taking effect from 1 July 1988. This deduction acknowledges that the contributions tax cannot be compensated for in such cases by the 15 per cent reduction in tax rates applicable to taxable ETPs. A provision that allows a superannuation fund to transfer its contributions tax liability to a pooled superannuation trust, life assurance company or registered organisation has been redrafted to ease the requirements to be met before such a liability may be transferred. It will now allow a fund to transfer contributions tax liability to the relevant entity up to an annual limit based on the highest value of the fund's investment in the transferee in the year of income concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also allow the Commissioner of Taxation to anticipate that certain compliance notices will be given by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. The provisions being inserted will allow an assessment to be made on the assumption that the relevant notices will be given but will also permit those assessments to be amended if it subsequently transpires that the relevant notices are not given. To ensure that non-reversionary bonuses-that is, cash bonuses -paid on life assurance policies are not effectively subject to tax twice when paid to a complying superannuation fund, a complying approved deposit fund or a pooled superannuation trust, such cash bonuses are to be exempted from tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Exemption from Tax for Contributions to Superannuation Funds</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill gives effect to two measures announced on 11 August 1988 to exempt from tax certain employer contributions to superannuation funds. Some superannuation funds had unfunded liabilities related to benefits accrued prior to 1 July 1988. Contributions subsequently made to meet these liabilities are to be excluded from assessable income. The Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner will be permitted to consider applications for recognition of a pre-1 July 1988 unfunded liability and, as appropriate, to issue notices specifying an available pre-1 July 1988 funding credit. Broadly, such a pre-1 July 1988 funding credit may be transferred to another fund or the fund trustees may, within specified limits, elect for an amount of employer contributions to be excluded from assessable income. Outstanding unapplied pre-1 July 1988 credit balances will be indexed. </PARA>
<PARA> The second measure covers cases where an employer does not fund benefits until retirement. An exemption from tax for these late employer contributions to a fund will be given for amounts not exceeding `untaxed' benefits paid in a year of income. As I indicated when introducing the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6), the changes in the tax arrangements applying to the superannuation industry completed by the measures in this Bill are expected to generate $980m in additional revenue in 1989-90 and $1,400m in 1990-91 but the net gains will be smaller after taking account of the proposed reductions in tax on end benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum, which contains more detailed costings and explanations of the provisions of this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 complements the measures in the Bill I have just introduced. It will amend the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to declare the rates of tax payable on the various components of taxable income of life assurance companies and registered organisations. For the component referable to policies held by complying funds or in respect of roll-over annuities the rate is to be 15 per cent. A rate of 47 per cent is to be set in respect of the component referable to policies held by non-complying funds. The rate set for the component referable to other life assurance and accident and disability insurance is 39 per cent where the insurer is a life assurance office and 30 per cent where the insurer is a registered organisation. Finally, a rate of 39 per cent is to be fixed in respect of the non-statutory fund component of the taxable income of a life assurance company. </PARA>
<PARA> The new tax rates for life offices and registered organisations will generally have effect for the year of income commencing on 1 July 1988, but the 47 per cent rate in respect of non-complying fund income is to apply from the income year commencing on 1 July 1990. The rates to apply to non-complying fund income for the income years commencing 1 July 1988 and 1 July 1989 are to be 49 and 48 per cent respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also reduce, in two stages, the rate of tax applying to the taxable income of non-complying superannuation funds and approved deposit funds and the special component of the taxable income of a complying fund or pooled superannuation trust. The existing 49 per cent rate is to be reduced to 48 per cent for the income year commencing on 1 July 1989 and to 47 per cent for the year commencing 1 July 1990 and later years. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After listening to some of the preceding speakers in this debate one would not know that the Wheat Marketing Bill 1989 and associated Bills are all about achieving a more efficient and effective marketing system. I recall the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) telling me in a private conversation just after he was elected that there would need to be a very strong look had at all the statutory marketing authorities and other authorities of government while we were in government. I see this measure as further progress in his long overhaul of some of the authorities that come under his portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation is not some blind fervour about deregulation, though it is welcome that the Government has had the courage to deregulate the dollar, take action in the telecommunications area and free up services to compete more. It has also enabled government bodies such as the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation to market better, compete more and take advantage of opportunities: in other words, they have been removed from restrictions. Nor are the wheat Bills an attempt to split the National and Liberal coalition apart, although that is happening. On the one side, we have the Liberal Party, which has all the courage in the world in opposition but not very much in government, proclaiming deregulation. On the other side, we have the Nationals, who regard farmers as lame ducks for whom crutches must continually be found. Wheat farmers are not lame ducks. They are perfectly capable of operating in a competitive environment. Australian farmers have the greatest record in the world as initiators, as marketers and for being open to change. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor is the legislation anti-State, although one would think it from reading some of the newspaper reports. For instance, on 28 April the Sydney Morning Herald stated that the New South Wales Government was considering a legal challenge to the Federal Government's controversial plans to deregulate the domestic wheat market, claiming that the proposed legislation would override the powers of State-based agricultural marketing boards. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The State Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Armstrong, said he had received legal advice that the Federal Wheat Marketing Bill would allow the Commonwealth to ``effectively neutralise'' statutory authorities such as the Grain Sorghum Marketing Board. </PARA>
<PARA>On 19 April the Melbourne Age said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government is considering legal action over Federal Government plans to deregulate the wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland had sought senior legal advice on the issue the state's Primary Industries Minister, Mr Harper, said in a statement yesterday. Queensland would take all appropriate legal action, he said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``We will be seeking the advice of senior counsel and, unlike the Commonwealth, any action we take will be after consultation with the industry,'' Mr Harper said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``In the meantime, I believe the federal Opposition should show some fortitude and stand up to the Commonwealth,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>While States like Queensland and New South Wales are considering legal action, their Federal colleagues agreed that it was only fair to wheat farmers to ask them to free up the transport regulations in those States. If wheat farmers are to be competitive through deregulation, then the transport system ought to be much more competitive. I agree with the Federal members of the Liberal Party who proclaim that view against the State Ministers' views. </PARA>
<PARA> There are strong reasons for believing that this legislation will provide additional competition in the transport area. I believe it will lead to a ceiling on rail freight charges which have formerly been able to blow out in some States. I believe that road substitution will not be extensive when deregulation of the transport industries throughout the States comes about. This is because most wheat is transported long distances. The average distance is about 380 kilometres. As well as that, the volume of wheat transported, which was 14.9 million tonnes in 1988-89, is considerably higher than most other areas of freight transport. In addition, we have to take into account that if the rail systems want to be competitive then they can have a very low cost structure. The cost of transporting wheat over 100 kilometres is about 4.51c per tonne kilometre. It is 3.03c per tonne kilometre over 300 kilometres, which is much less. It is 2.76c per tonne kilometre at 500 kilometres. The cost of a six-axle articulated truck making a 300 kilometre trip would be 6.3c compared, as I said, with 3.03c for rail. That is twice the cost. So 84 per cent of total grain traffic should be kept by the rail system, because it really can compete if it is forced into quoting competitive prices. There is certainly no reason why wheat farmers should have to cross-subsidise city train users. If this legislation is a means of forcing rail systems into being competitive, that is all the better. The rail authorities should be forced into being competitive. There will be some increased road use, largely between farms and major central receiving terminals. However, we should not ignore a major cross-subsidy that is happening here. </PARA>
<PARA> Light vehicle users are subsidising the much higher level of damage caused by heavier vehicles, which is an issue that must be tackled. It is good that the Inter-State Commission is investigating registration charges throughout Australia. As well, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Department of Transport and Communications have established a group to progress further the introduction of a more reasoned system of registration charges to take account of the damage done by heavy vehicle traffic on roads. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I point out that like the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) I believe that Australian wheat growers are intelligent men and women who are perfectly able to accept innovation and change. Since my first job after leaving school, which was as a wheat and flour tester at James Malcolm and Co. in St Arnaud in Victoria, I have seen a lot of changes in the wheat industry. The wheat industry has been able to adapt its production systems to a changing environment. Its method of adaptation has been impressive, and I believe that it will endeavour to see that marketing arrangements are not the factor which limits its future prosperity. I have every confidence in the wheat industry and I believe that this legislation stresses the confidence that the Government has in the industry to develop a much more competitive environment. </PARA>

<PARA> Traditionally, in conjunction with the Commonwealth, the States have passed complementary legislation to allow for a viable and strong Australian Wheat Board. This is legislation which, over the course of the nine months since the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) first announced at a meeting of State agriculture Ministers in Cairns that initial negotiations had taken place, has been progressively manoeuvred to drive a wedge between the National Party of Australia, the Liberal Party of Australia and the wheat growers. It is not designed to assist wheat growers. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, there are still fundamental concerns in respect of this legislation which the Government has ignored and, in fact, the Government itself has found it necessary in this package of Bills to foreshadow more than 45 amendments. I think that that is an indication that, instead of giving the legislation proper foresight, consideration, care and concern, the Minister has been rushing around from day to day, ideologically determined to introduce a position which he believes is in the best interests of the Labor Party and Labor members while totally ignoring the quite critical plight of many people who produce wheat in this country. There are four fundamental concerns of the Opposition in respect of these Bills. I will refer to the first concern briefly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has totally failed to consult and to maintain consultations with State agriculture Ministers, the Grains Council of Australia and grain growers. The consultations that have taken place have been between only the Minister and his cohorts in the Department to try to find some vehicle which the Minister thinks might divide the coalition and might be politically advantageous in the presentation of the Labor Party to the electorate. The Minister has failed abysmally because, in ignoring consultation, he has put at risk the continuation of a very effective marketing arm of one of Australia's major export industries. </PARA>
<PARA> My second concern is that, in the process of the Minister's toing-and-froing and shuffling around the campus, he has finished up prejudicing the ability of the Australian Wheat Board to be a strong domestic trader from 1 July. There is absolutely no excuse for a Minister to allow that situation to develop. Since last July, the Minister has been talking about the necessity for complementary legislation, and he has known that it is necessary to provide legislation which will ensure the continuation of the Australian Wheat Board as a major marketing arm for the wheat industry. The fact that within Australia there are individual States that have rejected the legislation is something that I regard as a condemnation of the Minister. It is not satisfactory that after all these consultations no State, even those with Labor governments, has seen fit to introduce and pass complementary legislation. If the Australian Wheat Board is no longer a strong domestic trader after 1 July, it is the Labor Party and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy who will be responsible. No-one in Australia should fail to understand that that could be to the quite significant price disadvantage of the Australian farmer. Indeed, Clinton Condon, the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, said on 7 July last year:</PARA>
<PARA> If you are looking at further deregulation of the domestic market, bearing in mind that the feed wheat market is deregulated now, farmers have asked me what would happen to the price. The price on the domestic market for milling wheat under deregulation will fall. There is no question about that because at this time we sell on the domestic market at a price we sell to our best export markets. </PARA>
<PARA>In a situation where the Wheat Board itself will be able to trade only uncertainly, the impact will be even worse. So my second concern is that the Minister and the Labor Party have left every Australian wheat trader in a position of significant uncertainty because of the failure to allow States to pass complementary legislation and the failure to address the difficulty of that significant part of the wheat trade that reflects the domestic trade, both interstate and intrastate. With the intrastate trade comprising about 80 per cent it is particularly significant that there is no complementary legislation, and there are doubts in the minds of the Wheat Board and every trader as to the position of the Wheat Board after 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA> My third concern is that the legislation will have a significant impact on other grains. I know that as far as the Wheat Board is concerned there is reason for incidental trade with respect to a whole range of other grains. Members on this side of the House accept that as necessary and desirable. However, we certainly do not accept that the powers of the Wheat Board should be so extended that they prejudice the continued viable operations of State marketing authorities. Those State marketing authorities have been constituted across a whole range of products of the soil, many of which the Minister can incorporate by regulation as commodities to be traded by the Wheat Board. There is no reason whatsoever why the powers of those State marketing authorities, which have traded effectively and well on behalf of their producers, should be threatened by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to ginger, for example, which is way outside the normal responsibility of the Wheat Board. It would be ridiculous if this Bill were to intrude on the authority of the Queensland Ginger Board. It might apply across the whole range of commodities, including rice and soya bean. It is of concern to us that in that third area there are significant doubts. Therefore, my colleague the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) will be moving amendments to address that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> My fourth area of concern relates to the arbitrary manner in which the Government, yet again, seeks to override the responsibilities of the State governments. The States of Australia have prime responsibility for production and distribution of all produce within their own boundaries. It is not of concern that the Government has moved, for the first time, to deregulate the labour market to the degree it has in proposed section 7 of the Bill which provides powers in respect of the storage, handling, loading and unloading of wheat, including such facilities at ports; and to arrange for the provision of storage, handling, transport and other marketing services for wheat. Nor is it of concern that for the first time legislation will reflect some measures of micro-economic reform. The concern relates to the way in which the Government has deliberately ignored the continued responsibilities of the States and said, `We do not really care what you want to do; we will pursue this course and proceed with this legislation because we think it is in our political interests'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition sees those four concerns as quite fundamental in respect of the failure of the Government to address the problem which, as I have said, the Minister first suggested needed to be considered way back on 14 July last year. As far as the National Party is concerned, we are glad that the Minister has at least moved away from some of the arbitrary measures that are included in that first statement. Honourable members will recall that he reversed his position on the export of feed wheat. On the coalition side there is a total acceptance of the need to preserve the powers of the Wheat Board as the sole export marketer. </PARA>
<PARA> There is concern among members of my Party at the impact that the changed domestic arrangements will have, particularly in the light of that advice from Clinton Condon, the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board. It is very important for those growers that in the changes there be sympathy for the preservation of the Australian Wheat Board as a strong domestic trader. When even that authority is at risk, the attitude of the Minister in trying to play this Bill for politics and not for the interests of the wheat growers becomes paramount. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go beyond that to what the Government is trying to do. Over some little while it has not just been because of the fundamental and arbitrary changes that the Government is introducing into this Bill that I have taken difference with the Government, but because of the way it is saying that everybody else is responsible for the present condition of the wheat industry. Any- body knowing and looking at the wheat industry should remember that it is not an industry which is necessarily always prosperous. In an analysis I made a little while ago of the situation of wheat growers, I found that in the 1987-88 financial year 50 per cent of Australian wheat growers earned less than $130 a week. This is the industry that is being arbitrarily changed. It is this industry that the Minister is saying does not need the protection of the Australian Wheat Board as far as the domestic market is concerned. Between 1982-83 and 1987-88, the wheat price per tonne declined from $151 to $102. Of course the Minister says that it is all the responsibility of those big bad Americans, and I will come to that in a moment. The reality is that prices have declined and more than 50 per cent of wheat growers earn under $130 a week, far less than the basic wage. Over the period 1983-84 to 1986-87 wheat growers' terms of trade fell by 10 per cent, while real net farm incomes declined by 75 per cent. So we have an industry with a lot of very marginal producers who are affected by drought and the decline in the wheat price and whose real net farm incomes have declined by 75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics estimates that average real net farm incomes in 1977-78 dollars for Australian wheat farms, classed as family farms, fell from approximately $71,000 in 1981-82 to $12,200 in 1986-87. From the beginning of the Australian Labor Party's period in office to 1986-87 net farm income fell by 83 per cent. This is the industry we are talking about. It is not an affluent industry. In an electorate such as that of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher), where seasons have been adverse, many wheat growers are in a parlous state. Over the period 1977-78 to 1985-86 farm debt doubled in nominal terms and increased by 40 per cent in real terms. Here we have an industry that is, and has been, in an extraordinarily difficult circumstance. While the prospects in the international market might presently be bolstered by bad seasons, predominantly in the United States, the situation in Australia has been deteriorating and it is in that climate that the Minister has been imposing his arbitrary change on the industry. If people think this is in respect of only the wheat grower, they need only to look at the papers this morning to see that John Shearer Ltd, Australia's largest agricultural machinery manufacturer, is going to shut its doors. It is not only the wheat grower who will be affected, it is also those involved in producing agricultural machinery. If we look at the statistics for purchases of new machinery, we see that they too have gone down. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that seasons and markets are unpredictable for agricultural producers and there has been and is significant uncertainty for the wheat growers, against which in the past they have looked to the Wheat Board to provide them with some form of insurance. If we look at the Australian wheat industry and the export scene, we also see a picture somewhat different from the rhetoric that has emerged from the Minister at the table and other Ministers in the Government. Australia is not a major exporter in comparison to other countries. It is true that our exports are significant; they totalled $1.71 billion last year, or 4.2 per cent of Australian exports, produced by about 38,000 farmers. The reality is that our seasons, and the attractiveness of producing wheat, have meant a significant variation both in the number of hectares sown and in the volume of production. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns me, as a farmer and somebody who has been involved initially as a wheat lumper and in subsequent years in various forms of agricultural production, is that there has always been in the Australian wheat industry a guarantee that through the Wheat Board there would be at least in one agricultural industry a fundamental base structure, a floor if you like, in the market. From that, farmers have been able to make some assessment of their future. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty in the Minister's proposal with respect to the United States is not that we disagree that the export enhancement program (EEP) has been anything other than disastrous for world wheat prices, but that the Government has concentrated excessively on that one source of influence and ignored, in at least its recent rhetoric, so much of the impact of the common agricultural policy (CAP) of the European Community. The reality is that in 1977-78 the European Community was a net importer of 18.2 million tonnes. As a result of the CAP, by 1988-89 the European Community was a net exporter of 25 million tonnes. In other words, it had swung from being a net importer to a major exporter, and that is distinctly a product of the CAP. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course there are problems as far as Australia is concerned, with our dependence upon being able to set a price structure. We need friends in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to help us, and in relation to that the members of the coalition totally endorse the actions of the Government in establishing the Cairns Group. But as an Australian, I felt sad that the Minister persistently undertook, even on a personal level, attacks against the American Vice-President. The reality is that we have to argue the cause by virtue of fact and not emotion. One does not go about damning the Vice-President of the United States; one tries to ensure that the facts presented to him are accurate. If the advice given to me is correct, then I understand that the figures shown to the Vice-President reflected only a relatively short period of years. In relation to that period the argument of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was correct but, if we go back to a few years before, Australia was a much smaller exporter and, according to the American briefing for the Vice-President, Australia's case failed because we did not go back to that earlier period. If that is so, we have to ensure that everyone knows that there is a demonstrable impact on Australian wheat returns not only from EEP but also from the European Community's price support program, which for so long has made life difficult for us. The reality is that the European Community and the United States have borne down on prices to a very significant degree. If the advice of the American Vice-President or of anybody in the European Community suggests that they have not done so, one need only turn to some of the information that is available in official publications in both arenas that shows something of that. For example, the General Accounting Office of the White House in a brief of March 1987 said:</PARA>
<PARA> In retrospect it appears that Argentina, Australia and Canada have all been adversely affected by the EEP. </PARA>
<PARA>On 28 April this year I understand that the President of the North American Export Grain Association, a Mr Steven McCoy, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The United States could better achieve its goal of competitiveness by lowering loan rates, reducing acreage set aside for major crops, realigning target prices and giving farmers more flexibility in what they can plant. </PARA>
<PARA>My concern at some of the emotional rhetoric about the Vice-President is that instead of our going back to him and setting out the facts and explaining to him the impact on Australian exporters and on those of other countries-as mentioned in that article quoted from the General Accounting Office it has impacted on Argentina, Canada and other exporters-the Government has failed because it has not done that. Because of the rhetoric, and in part I suspect in a reaction to what the Americans saw as an unusually personal attack on their Vice-President, we have had another wheat sale today to the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no argument on this side of the House about the effect of EEP. There is argument as to whether sufficient facts were presented before the Vice-President and whether the rhetoric against the common agricultural policy of the European Community has been sufficient. Particularly when one sees the extent to which both in the US and the European Community there is to be a significant increase in acreage and tonnage for the future, the situation is critical. It is in that climate of a corrupt world market, of uncertainty in the ability of the Wheat Board to trade domestically, that the Minister comes into the House with an inadequate Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard it as a tragedy for wheat growers that no member of the Labor Party when speaking on this Bill has highlighted the uncertain predicament of the domestic Australian wheat producer. Most Australian wheat producers are family farmers. Most of them do not have the expertise or the ability to engage in marketing. Since the late 1940's the Australian Wheat Board has been the major marketing arm. It is critical that the Minister and the Government accept responsibility to ensure that the Wheat Board remains a strong domestic trader. It is critical that the Government understand that with the present corruption of the world market-place, unless the Wheat Board is allowed and encouraged to maximise the price received for Australian exports the Australian wheat grower will suffer. Sadly, given the climate, and the variations in the climate, so much depends upon whether the United States has a good season. We all know that the demand from the Soviet Union and China tends to set world prices. It is not only the EEP and CAP that effect prices, but they certainly serve to bear down on world prices. I am disappointed to hear from my American contacts that Vice-President Quayle has not been satisfied with the arithmetic presented by the Australian Government. If that is so, I blame the Government for its inadequate presentation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has to understand that this legislation has serious deficiencies. We seek to amend it. I hope the Government will accept those amendments because they are proposed in an effort to present inadequate legislation in a more adequate form. Above all, the Minister must go to the State Ministers and attempt to get some complementary legislation, otherwise the Australian wheat industry will be totally disadvantaged in the domestic market after 1 July this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say, with great regret, that I did not hear one mention of micro-economic reform in the speech made by the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). There was no debate about why the legislation should not proceed. We heard much about the Vice-President of the United States of America for nearly 10 minutes and the United States of America's subsidisation program, which has nothing to do with this legislation. There was much discussion about the income of wheat farmers, the effects of drought on wheat farmers, the effect of the subsidisation program on the European Community, and the effect of the United States policy on our wheat farmers' incomes, but there was no discussion of micro-economic reform or the fundamental principles of deregulation. So the National Party does not have a view of micro-economic reform. It does not have a view on what this legislation is about. It was not discussed at all by the Leader of the National Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is important legislation because it reveals fundamental differences in economic management between the Government and the Opposition. It discloses the fact that those on the Opposition benches who want to call themselves monetarists, free marketeers, the Friedman theory carriers in this House, do not believe their own rhetoric. It discloses that the Opposition, when it comes to micro-economic reform, is a very shallow and hollow Opposition. It discloses that if it should ever be in government in this country, should its members ever grace the treasury bench, the shallowness and hollowness in opposition would be carried forward. In fact, members of the Opposition would be too frightened to make any decent micro-economic reform. They are, after all, the people who admire Margaret Thatcher. They are the people who admire what Ronald Reagan has done to America. They are the people who run on that kind of rhetoric. Yet when we place before them a proposal to deregulate the domestic wheat market-not the export wheat market-they shy away. They cannot get their act together as a coalition, yet they want to talk to us about their togetherness and their lying in the same lovely bed. We know that to be a nonsense. A headline in the Sun Herald  last night throws that idea right out the door and makes a mockery of what the Opposition is saying. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition likes to support the concept of perfect competition, that wonderful economic theory that tacitly assumes that there is a perfect world where there are many buyers and sellers, where there is perfect knowledge in the market-place, where there are educated consumers and no product differentiation, and no interference with prices by governments. That is the theory that the Opposition runs with-perfect competition. From its rhetoric, it would like to see a market-place where there is no government at all. That is what Opposition members say. They want Australians to believe that that is their economic philosophy. That is the nonsense they go on with all the time, but the reality is that no such market exists, has ever existed, or is ever likely to exist. Governments need to regulate and, through legislation, to force a level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the regulation of our domestic wheat market mean? In the first place it is a nonsense, because it does not exist. The 20 per cent of the Australian wheat market which is called the domestic market is mostly a black market. Anyone who knows about Australia's wheat industry-and it is obvious that the National Party does not; it is very ignorant because it does not seek the facts-would know of certain practices in that industry. When I lived in Cohuna in the Murray Valley for many years, trucks would come from Victoria during the wheat season, cross the Murray River and travel to Koondrook and into Barham. There they would then stop and put a new prime mover on and bring the wheat back across the river and sell it on the domestic market under section 92 of the Constitution, the free trade section. That is the domestic wheat market. That is what is happening now. It has been going on for years. There is no regulated market. Victorian farmers are laughing on television at the nonsense the National Party is going on about. Farmers there have said that they cart by truck now. They do not really care whether this legislation goes through because they are doing it. </PARA>

<PARA> The legislation is very simple. The provisions include a continuation of the monopoly export powers of the Australian Wheat Board. That has been the main element of our export wheat marketing program for many years. Other features include the enhancement of the commercial base and powers of the Wheat Board which will thereby boost domestic and international competitiveness. It will remove the remaining restrictions on the private market, most of which have been whittled down over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the so-called de- regulation of the transportation of wheat by rail. I am not frightened to express that concern in this House because I am concerned about the increased transportation of wheat on rural roads by heavy transports. I do not believe that transports pay their fair resource cost on the use of the roads. I do not believe that if there were a massive move of wheat onto roads that our roads would stand the extra traffic, or that the users of the roads would pay their fair share of the cost and the cost of the damage done to those rural roads. If the playing field were, in fact, level, if road transports were paying their fair cost of that road resource and were competing fairly against rail, my concerns would be somewhat mitigated. However, I believe the Government is on the right track in its attitude to opening up the market-place. The Government is on the right track in suggesting to the State rail authorities that they need to have a good look at the way they are currently running their organisations in order to get extra efficiencies in them. It is for that reason that I support the Government's legislation, although I have that concern. I hope that there will be further discussion when the tripartite body is established-Government, unions and rail organisations-about the Government's intention on the rail transportation issue. Tonight, four or five members of the so-called coalition will vote against this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> Before dinner I was discussing the wheat deregulation legislation. I referred to the great disruption that this legislation is causing in the Opposition parties in this country. I note that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) will be following me in this debate, and I will be very interested to hear his views, because I know he is a member of the Opposition who does firmly believe in deregulation across the board and I know that he is not intimidated by the agrarian socialists-members of the former Country Party, now the National Party of Australia. The honourable member for O'Connor is prepared to voice his views. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the honourable member for O'Connor and I might have our disagreements from time to time-probably more often than not-I am pleased to say that on this occasion he and I stand in the same position. We understand the benefits that will flow to Australian wheat growers from what I regard as being probably a very minor deregulative program and a very minor micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the Industries Assistance Commission report in fact called for much more deregulation than the Government is proposing. One could argue in this House that perhaps the export monopoly should be deregulated. Those of us who believe in a deregulatory market could well argue that we should not be satisfied with pretending that we are deregulating a market which, de facto, through the black market, has been deregulated for many years indeed. The fact that the Opposition Parties are so disrupted by this legislation is indicative of their inability to provide a unified front-should they ever win government-in relation to the hard decisions which governments must make from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> I note with great interest the suggestions in Victoria that there has been some sort of a marriage between the National Party and the Liberal Party in Victoria. I watched with interest the Leader of the Opposition wandering around Victoria saying that there was a wonderful new relationship between those two conservative parties, that they now had a joint Senate ticket. In relation to the recent National Party conference in Warrnambool, I read with interest the comments made about Pat McNamara and Jeff Kennett walking out almost arm in arm, saying that the two parties were now married, that there were no problems and that they could now put forward policies because they had agreed on major issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the sort of exercise that we have before the House today absolutely shatters that concept. Certainly, in the north-east of Victoria, I do not believe that the National Party members will not field candidates. I happen to have good close contacts with the National Party in my electorate, and the National Party branches in my electorate are making it very clear that they will not accept a suggestion that National Party members cannot stand in rural electorates against other candidates-whether from the Liberal Party or the Labor Party. Those National Party members in my electorate have made it very clear to me, and very clear to other people in the electorate, that they will field candidates against people from any other political party whenever they see fit to do so. For that reason, I do not believe that the so-called marriage will hold; in fact, it is one of the great jokes of Victorian politics at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Before dinner I expressed my concern about the potential for increased road traffic due to haulage of wheat. That is the only concern that I have with the entire legislation. I do not criticise the Government for the level of road funding, as some members in this House have done. As to my electorate, with the Hume Highway running up through the centre, in three or four years time, due to the efforts of this Government, we will see the completion of the Hume freeway. This is due to the Government's commitment to build a major national road network. The Hume Highway will be a freeway from the outskirts of Melbourne to the Victorian border. Only several sections are left to be done. One of those is around Euroa, which is in my electorate, and work is currently under way there to complete that section of the freeway. Another section that has yet to be completed is the Wangaratta by-pass, but that work is currently under way and I hope that it will be com- pleted in the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as to the secondary roads in my electorate, residents are very concerned about the increase in articulated vehicle traffic which is now occurring, with many owner-drivers trying to avoid the weighbridges on the Hume Highway. The damage that those vehicles are doing to our road network systems, particularly the Melba Highway and the Kinglake-Flowerdale Road, is quite severe. It would be very worrying if those so-called B-doubles and larger sized articulated vehicles, carrying quite heavy tonnages of wheat, started tearing up rural roads, with the drivers of those vehicles not putting back into the system the necessary funds to compensate for the damage caused. With insufficient resources being provided by the users of those roads. The Government will have to monitor the position to ensure that roads are not thus damaged. I certainly have some sympathy with those people who have raised this concern. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this legislation should not be rejected simply on those grounds. We should not forget that only last week the State Rail Authority of New South Wales successfully tendered for the cartage of the entire New South Wales grain crop for 1989-90. The Authority tendered successfully against five major road hauliers. That indicates very clearly to the House that the proposition that the proposed deregulatory program would mean that all grain would be transported on the roads is a myth and a nonsense. It was demonstrated quite clearly only last week that rail is obviously the preferred method of bulk transportation of grain. I do not intend to speak at length as I know that there are many speakers who wish to follow me. I suspect that we will have a rather late night in trying to get through this legislation. </PARA>

The present situation shows quite clearly that when it comes to making hard decisions members of the Opposition cannot take it. They will not make such decisions. It is typical of their whole policy approach. They talk in rhetoric about policy but never put the facts or figures on the table for debate. For that, as always, they stand condemned. This legislation, as I have said, exposes once and for all their inability as a group to have a marriage and the inability of the Thatcherites and the Friedmanites in the Opposition-the new dries of the Liberal Party-to cope. They cannot cope with the agrarian socialists of the National Party. In the Liberal Party the Peter Costellos and Professor Kemps are rolling long-standing Liberal Party members of this House. Possibly this will happen at the weekend and new dries will be coming in. They are extreme right wing Thatcher fans, and the agrarian socialists just cannot cope with that. They will not sit back and be part of a marriage with a party which has within it these dries who, if they are serious, would undertake much deregulation in rural areas and go further down the deregulatory path in the major rural areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The wheat marketing legislation which is before the Parliament today has been introduced to replace the expiring Wheat Marketing Act of 1984. If this legislation does not pass the Parliament before June 1989, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) will have no legislative base and although it can continue for a limited period there will be no obligation for government to provide the guarantees necessary to allow the Board to make the large borrowings it needs to make to fund the first advance payments, which are fundamental to the Board's performance and attractiveness to wheat growers. Consequently, this legislation can be viewed both in philosophical terms and from the standpoint of the practical effect it will have on wheat growers' incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In philosophical terms, the debate revolves around the degree of regulation and government business activity which is appropriate for Australia in the 1990s. The Liberal Party of Australia recognises that any regulatory activity that artificially increases the costs of the goods we produce is bad and will contribute further to the phenomenon of our international debt, which at $120 billion now exceeds that of most banana republics. Whether it be the regulation of our labour markets, which creates wage increases which are not related to productivity, thus inflating our cost structures and reducing our standards of living, or the controls of our waterfront, airlines and coastal shipping, the results are always the same. Cost increases and inefficient and sometimes fraudulent work practices arise. Both management and the work force, secure in the knowledge that they have no competition, continue to pass costs on to the captive consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, this philosophical point is not remote to wheat growers' incomes. Wheat growers are the traditional consumers. It is they who stand at the end of the income queue and must measure their profits after all these other regulated sectors take their share. When in recent years Australia's economic activity went into upturn as the result of increases in rural returns, it was the trade unions and their manufacturing employers who were first in the queue, using the arbitration system to share in those returns. Before bank managers could be repaid, farmers were confronted with massive inflation to the cost of all their production inputs. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Hawke Government recognises this situation and consequently announced its third term of office as the term of micro-economic reform, its successes have been few and far between. It has failed to privatise such government institutions as Qantas Airways Ltd, Australian Airlines and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. It has failed to introduce meaningful competition within the operations of Telecom Australia and Australia Post. It has failed to deregulate the labour market, the waterfront and coastal shipping-all areas which directly affect the cost of production of wheat growers. </PARA>
<PARA> All the Government's success in deregulation has been in the area of our-the conservatives'-constituency, such as financial services and agricultural marketing. All the claimed success of this Government has been because the coalition has stood by its beliefs and been prepared to assist the Government with its limited program. This is in stark contrast with the Australian Labor Party's performance in opposition. When led by the present Treasurer (Mr Keating), it opposed every attempt by the Fraser Government to proceed in these areas and even cancelled some of those Fraser Government decisions when first in government. </PARA>
<PARA> This Opposition-the Liberal-National Party coalition-accepts its national responsibility. In this legislation we have even drawn the Government screaming to the barrier by insisting that deregulation of the sales component of the domestic wheat industry be accompanied by deregulation of freight and handling in terms of both competition for State government institutions and the labour they employ. When the inevitable change of government occurs at the next election, it will be interesting to test the resolve of some people in the Labor Party to support our mandate for deregulation and privatisation which will similarly affect the Labor Party's constituency of labour and the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the member representing the largest wheat producing electorate in Australia and as a wheat grower myself, my responsibility has been to ensure, as much as a member of the Opposition is able to, the protection of my constituents from any harmful effects of this legislation. I made that judgment not on the basis of people's prejudice but on the basis of where I genuinely perceived they would be at a financial disadvantage. It was therefore my responsibility first to identify their problems in order of priority, hoping that I could correct the most important, if not all of them. Consequently, in considering the press announcements of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), I decided that his intention to dilute the Australian Wheat Board's sole export power by approving of certain private stockfeed export sales was a very large threat and a matter of great concern in my electorate. It was considered the thin end of the wedge. There is no doubt in my mind that a total export monopoly is essential to protect our wheat exports, in the present world market conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> I was delighted, therefore, to be a member of an Opposition select committee that set, as a condition of Opposition support for this legislation, that the Australian Wheat Board maintain its existing export monopoly. I was therefore gratified when, in introducting the legislation, the Minister indicated that the AWB would retain this power and, what is more, will never again be confronted with a sunset clause which would put the AWB's export monopoly at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I concerned myself with the guaranteed minimum price (GMP) and underwriting arrangements. The 1984 legislation calculated the guaranteed minimum price by using a moving three-year average based primarily on historic prices. The Government then provided what was effectively a 95 per cent underwriting guarantee. The use of historic prices ensured that in falling markets there was a possibility that the GMP would exceed the actual pool returns and government would then be called upon to provide its guarantee. Such a contribution occurred as a result of the 1986-87 season at a cost to government of approximately $176m. This money was of great assistance to farmers in those difficult times, yet over the decades it was the first government contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1989 legislation removes the three-year moving average and the 95 per cent underwriting, replacing them with a single year estimate and a initial 90 per cent underwriting which will reduce to a 80 per cent level over five years. I have constantly argued in all forums for retention of the 1984 guaranteed minimum price underwriting arrangements and warned my constituents of the implications in the new proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to join with grain grower representatives in supporting Opposition amendments to increase the underwriting level to a flat 95 per cent and to remove the 1993 sunset clause on this underwriting commitment. The Minister is obliged by the legislation to take account of the advice of the AWB and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) in regard to this estimate. I can only conclude that he will maintain the estimate at fair and reasonable levels. The immediate effect of the removal of historic price data in the present rising market is that the first advance will be much higher. Using the ABARE forecast of a net pool return of $207 per tonne, the first advance calculated on the 1984 formula would be $139 per tonne and under the new 1989 formula $167 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is no doubt that the GMP and the first advance will now be much more volatile. Falls will be as abrupt as rises. This gives much better market signals than have previously been received. I believe that the prospect of underwriting payouts is dead. It must be obvious that a single-year ministerial estimate made in October, just before harvest, is unlikely to be 10 per cent or even 5 per cent incorrect before most wheat is sold. I do not think the Minister has too much concern in conceding that point. In his second reading speech the Minister-and I want him to take close notice of this-said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that the averaging arrangements in the previous GMP scheme provided support to growers in circumstances of extreme market downturn such as in 1986-87. If such a crisis were to occur again the Government would need to give close consideration to special support arrangements for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I really believe that that is a matter of great concern and one we should address in the legislation. If this is the Minister's considered view, I believe he should include a clause in this legislation to provide legislative effect to his observations, thus guaranteeing some financial support after a precipitous price reduction. I am not suggesting for a moment that there needs to be any proposal that affects other than the sort of crash that occurred in 1986-87. But during the 1982-83 drought the Fraser Government saw fit to introduce massive fodder subsidies to protect the Australian breeding stock. This was to the great benefit of the Australian economy, and also the Hawke Labor Government, which came to office shortly before the drought breaking rains and was able to benefit from the immediate economic advantages to Australia of our rural industries being able to get back into full production because farmers had breeding stock on their properties. </PARA>
<PARA> There is need for legislative protection of our wheat industry in a crisis such as occurred in 1986-87. Furthermore, confidence must be maintained to ensure the maintenance of national export income. It is easy to say that market indicators will survive but if we drive too many people out of the wheat industry we will miss out on our regular clientele and our export income. I hope the Minister will consider such a proposal. I do not think in the very near future it would be a great cost to government; it would just give some security for the very bad year that pops up once in a while. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter of considerable interest to me, as a resident of the most remote wheat growing State, is the actual membership of the Australian Wheat Board. During debate on the 1984 legislation I took a strong stand on wheat grower representation. I believe I contributed to the eventual decision to create producer selection committees, which I still think is a very good approach. The current legislation provides for the appointment of eight of the board's eleven members by a selection committee which the Grains Council of Australia will appoint. </PARA>
<PARA> To better guarantee the representation of wheat growers, the Opposition has proposed an amendment that five of those eight, and the chairman, who is a ministerial appointment, be wheat growers. It will be up to the Grains Council to decide from which State these representatives are appointed. However, considering the longevity of this legislation, I would have preferred that direct representation be given to each State. Nevertheless, I accept the decision that has been made on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The next issue of importance to me is the issue that has stood head and shoulders above all others in terms of public debate-that is, domestic deregulation. The prospect for the continued credibility of any political party or organisation which calls upon the workers of Australia to accept substantial deregulation of their protected centralised wage fixing system whilst it is prepared to support a price fixing mechanism for the principal component in the manufacture of bread, is of course beyond consideration. Any party that put forward the deregulations proposals that have been put forward and then demanded that its constituencies not be harmed would have no credibility at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Forgoing this philosophical point, this issue did not warrant the level of exposure it received, for two simple reasons. Firstly, this legislation is not a proposal to deregulate the 80 per cent of national wheat production that goes to export. It is not 1935 revisited. As I have already described, due to the successful efforts of the coalition the Wheat Board's export monopoly is even more secure than in the past. Secondly, the domestic market was deregulated to all intents and purposes in the 1984 legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the introduction of that legislation wheat growers have had the right to trade directly in both stockfeed and human consumption wheat. There have been no controls on the quantity traded or the price negotiated. Stockfeed wheat has been traded purely with the constraint that purchasers must buy, for approximately $2.50 per tonne, a permit to cover the collection of levies covering matters like research. What is more, as a consequence, farmers have voted with their feet and 90 per cent of stockfeed wheat is now traded privately. Sale of human consumption wheat was more constrained inasmuch as that, although wheat growers could negotiate privately, the proceeds of the sale were then processed through the Wheat Board on normal pooling conditions, with the Wheat Board deducting charges notwithstanding that it had provided no services. </PARA>
<PARA> Persons wishing to process their own wheat for such purposes as organic flour were forced to repurchase their own wheat at a direct net cost of approximately $40 per tonne. That is no encouragement for people to go out and develop the niche markets that are needed. In the terms of the 1989 legislation, deregulation means that wheat growers who choose to deal privately with flour mills will in future get the cheque in the mail. That is hardly an earth shattering move. That the previous arrangements were not supported by farmers is evidenced by the fact that only 11 per cent of human consumption wheat has been traded privately while 90 per cent of stockfeed wheat has been traded privately during this period. </PARA>
<PARA> Many claims have been made as to the effect on pool proceeds that will result from the Board's loss of revenue in this area. In my electorate these claims at times have been as high as $50 per tonne. The Minister's second reading speech clearly identifies that the worst one-year effect was $2.93 per tonne in 1986-87. I have seen the calculation sheets for that, and they are correct.</PARA>
<PARA> When one checks the legislation and understands the principles of the formula for calculating the regulated domestic human consumption price, which is also a historic price formula, it is clear that in a falling market the domestic price lags above the export price but in a rising market, as at present, the domestic price lags below the export price. On 25 April 1989 the domestic price was $20.69 below the world export price. In other words when the Wheat Board sells a tonne of wheat domestically at present it loses approximately $20 compared with selling the same wheat to an overseas customer. Over time the pool proceeds have won and lost but the result has probably been neutral. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, partly because of this perception, the Opposition was not prepared again to see the Government further impose its one-sided approach to micro-economic reforms upon the rural sector. Another condition which the coalition imposed was a demand for the further deregulation of the domestic market to be accompanied by de- regulation of freight and handling within this industry. I have been a long-time proponent of that. It is not by any initiative of this Government or this Minister that wheat growers for the first time will see competition in that component of their industry which represents 22 per cent of their costs based on free on board values or 45 per cent cost, insurance and freight. Even the cost of overseas shipping are greatly inflated by the intransigence of our waterfront unions. Overseas shipping companies price Australia as though it was a war zone. One shipper once said to me, `Up in the Red Sea we lose our ships; down in Australia we never know if we are going to get them back'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Opposition which caused the Government to put its micro-economics where its mouth is. The coalition welcomes the inclusion of sections 7 and 88 which give the Wheat Board the power to grant contracts and give immunity from State regulations to private transporters and grain handlers who can provide these services more cheaply. In my electorate there are numerous examples of price differentials between the cost of regulated rail and road transport. A classic example involves the centres of Kojonup and Broomehill, towns some 25 miles apart. Kojonup is served by road and the freight rate is $8.60 per tonne. Broomehill, which is on rail, must pay $11.60. Yet both are the same distance to port. There is no theory in these prices, just plain facts. I could give many more examples. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia we have been extremely fortunate that our Main Roads Department has a very innovative approach to truck configurations. From my own farm I am entitled to cart-and through the highways of Perth-40-tonne loads. In fact, they go up and down those highways without trouble. An ordinary truck contributes 30 per cent of its revenue in one tax or another. On a 1,000 mile journey loaded one way on 2,000 mile round trip some years ago I calculated the sales tax on my tyres at 50 cents a tonne. The fact is that if they chose, as has occurred in New South Wales, the railways can compete, but the price has to be right and the farmers must be the beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome this legislation in general. I want to see the alterations made that the Opposition proposes. In general, we have achieved something in the long term for farmers where the profits will certainly be with them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation marks a further step by this Government to free up Australian primary industries on the domestic market. In his second reading speech the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) indicated that whilst some farmers might be determined to resist the change, the wheat industry has been undergoing significant changes in response to influences and pressures in the market-place at large anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation continues the Government's micro-economic reform program. The process of mircro-economic reform is aimed at developing the industrial structure which best utilises Australia's resources of labour, land and capital. However, it is not done without affecting the status quo. It is not done without affecting the perceived status quo. We contend that in general this will be beneficial, even though the initial response will always cause some reaction. There is nothing particularly strange about this. </PARA>
<PARA> While there is a fair degree of acceptance of the advantages to accrue to the wheat industry from this legislation, there is nevertheless some disquiet among some sections of the community about some feared consequences of the deregulation of the transport of grains. As the House would know, the situation with respect to the transport of wheat varies from State to State. Transport costs, even where related to rail, also vary from system to system. As the Minister has indicated, the Wheat Marketing Bill contains measures which will allow traders and the Australian Wheat Board to operate without the constraint of State laws. The Federal Government has already removed restrictions on the Australian National Line's South Australian operations. When the transport of grain was deregulated in New South Wales the State Rail Authority won the tender and was therefore able to move the entire New South Wales wheat crop. </PARA>
<PARA> While the report of the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport recommended a freeing-up of grain transport, it is seen by some rail unions to be flawed. It may well be that there will not be a significant shift in the transport of grain from rail to road, but the rail unions remain unconvinced. This is especially so in Victoria. I happen to believe that this matter will need to be kept under very close scrutiny. There would be no merit, in social terms, in large quantities of grain being moved to export terminals by road. For one thing, this would increase the wear and tear on the road system, with a consequent rise in the cost to taxpayers and ratepayers of the burden of maintenance and construction. The Minister assures us that on the evidence available to him this circumstance is unlikely to occur because of the cost savings of rail over road. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Ararat Advertiser of 2 May 1989 the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker)-I notice he is in the House-is reported as rubbishing the arguments put forward by rail unions that job losses would result if the wheat industry were to be de- regulated. He is reported as saying that the rail unions had indirectly forced the loss over the last decade of the livelihood of thousands of wheat farmers and employees. He is further quoted as saying that the railway unions have bled the wheat farmers through their cosy transport monopoly. </PARA>
<PARA> I happen to know that in recent years V/Line has undergone a marked series of changes in the transport of wheat. These changes have benefited the wheat industry. For instance, the number of wagons used for grain haulage in 1981 was 5,437. These were GYs; they were a small, inefficient unit. Since 1988 this has been reduced to 730. Those are the VHGYs. The number of locomotives used in 1981 was 77. In the post-1988 period it has been 33. Whereas in 1981 the largest train sizes were 22 VHGY wagons, they are now 50 VHGY wagons. The crew size has been reduced from three persons to two. Cartage in hopper wagons has grown from 51.8 per cent to 100 per cent. The percentage of grain dedicated to VHGY wagons jumped from 61 per cent in 1981 to 100 per cent currently. </PARA>
<PARA> Extensive use is made of integrated road usage. In Victoria during this time there has also been a marked decline in the labour usage in State rail. From 1971-72 until 1985-86 labour productivity in V/Line has doubled. According to the Victorian State Minister for Transport, the Hon. Jim Kennan, there will be a further reduction in the work force and an expected increase in productivity. As one who has a large body of workers in Ballarat and Ararat I know how painful these changes have been, but I also recognise that they are proud men. They are proud and dedicated rail workers. They have not bled farmers dry. Instead, they have been prepared to modernise their industry. They also happen to believe in it-and this is something union knockers, such as those on the other side of the House, just do not understand. If there is resistance to change by the rail workers, it is not unique. Why would it be? They try to preserve their jobs. That they would sometimes like to defend their territory and established practices makes them no different in principle from the wheat farmers. It is a terrible pity that the kind of understanding shown by the National Party to some wheat growers could not be balanced by an equal concern to understand the feelings and concerns of rail workers. In the upshot of the deregulation of the transport of wheat, convenience and cost will be the deciders. Rail is still more efficient. I believe farmers and my local government leaders will bear this in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to the slap in the face that Australian farmers have received from the United States Administration by its quite unjustifiable decision to use export subsidies with the sale of 1 1/2 million tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union. In the wake of the recent visit to this country of the Vice-President of the United States, Mr Dan Quayle, during which he denied the export enhancement program (EEP) was resulting in any damage to Australia, this decision of the United States shows Vice-President Quayle to be either an ostrich or a goose. Perhaps he ought to take gander at the facts. As has been pointed out by the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy), there is simply no justification for this United States action. We know what happens when the sale of 1 1/2 million tonnes under the EEP precedes a sale of 1 1/2 million tonnes at the going rate. The effect of putting the two together is that Australian farmers and farmers in the leading export countries are the ones who suffer. As the Minister pointed out, there is no justification for this action. </PARA>
<PARA> The buoyant state of world markets indicates a healthy demand for wheat. All this has done for some years is to cause damage to us and other wheat export nations. It may be true that the US is using the export enhancement program to apply pressure to the Europeans to force them to reduce their practice of subsidising primary industry products; a practice which grossly distorts world trade in these goods and causes havoc in the economies of smaller exporting countries. However, we, along with other members of the Cairns group, are caught fair and square in the crossfire. It is the major commodity exporters, our producers and economies which suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> As has already been mentioned, Australia's share of the world markets has decreased by 45 per cent while the US share in the market of wheat has increased by 48 per cent. It is no surprise that this can be attributed to a large degree to unfair trading practices, such as the EEP. </PARA>
<PARA> Change in any industry, as I said, is not achieved without the onset of misgivings and often resentment and resistance. Those of us who were here during the heady days of the changes to the dairy industry-the Kerin plan-will recall most vividly the heat generated by that debate around the country. The Minister was subjected to long and bitter attacks with emotion and rancour running high. He knew at the time that the situation was unsustainable, that maintenance of the then existing structures would result in disaster for the industry. The present situation attests to the wisdom of those changes for at least the dairy industry is just that-it is an industry, and a very good one, which is assured of a sound and profitable future. </PARA>
<PARA> I happen to believe that the decision to deregulate the wheat industry by opening up the domestic market to enable growers to choose to whom they wish to sell their wheat will result in a more dynamic industry with better returns to growers. These Bills are designed to introduce competition and efficiency in the marketing of wheat. Those farmers who do not wish to sell directly from the farm gate to a buyer may continue to use the pool. Changes to the AWB will enable it to function more commercially. It has been said that farmers will be at the mercy of a few large agribusinesses. I believe that the effects will be quite the contrary. After all, what farmer is going to sell his wheat for the cheapest price? With more takers the competition is between buyers. The seller will be the beneficiary. After all, it is not as though there has been no selling of wheat on the private market. Currently, 40 per cent of wheat sold on the domestic market is sold by the permit system. This comprises primarily stock feed wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> It has to be admitted that a number of growers have bypassed the Australian Wheat Board and sold outside the system. It should also be recognised that 80 per cent of Australia's crop is sold solely by the AWB for export and that will continue. It will not change. Protective devices are available for farmers. As I said, they can still use the pool system if they wish. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been argument that the quality of wheat sold will suffer when we move away from an AWB controlled monopoly. I believe that this argument is not sustainable because the monopoly pricing power of the AWB does not govern its power to influence the quality control of the industry. Such important functions as control, grading and classification will still be possible under the statutory marketing authority of the AWB. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to continue my remarks further except to say that I support wholeheartedly the measures taken by the Minister in introducing this legislation to put the wheat industry on a far more commercial basis. I caution the Minister and the House to recognise that other people in the community have a concern. They are concerned that the benefits may damage their industry. I refer to the rail unions and the rail workers. I hope that there will be continuing negotiations and discussions with them so that they will be assured that their interests are being taken into consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity tonight to participate in this debate on the Wheat Marketing Bill and cognate Bills. I welcome also the opportunity to follow the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and compliment the reasoned and persuasive approach which he used in the House tonight in reference to these Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my opening remarks I want to refer to a couple of closing remarks by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Mildren). Not surprisingly, the honourable member has called for some measure of negotiation to be entered into with those people indirectly affected by this legislation. He referred particularly to the railway unions. If the honourable member for Ballarat's plea for negotiation had been echoed by the Government in mapping out this legislation and if the Opposition had enjoyed a little more the confidence of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), and more negotiation between parties perhaps some of the discomfort that has been experienced by the Opposition in this debate would not have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Thankfully, all of us have childhood memories. We all have memories which for some inexplicable reason stay with us. For some of us they are memories of particularly momentous events; for others they are memories of things which we simply cannot shake off. I have long had a boyhood memory of feeding a winnower. I do not know why. The property I grew up on was not a grain growing property. My father always had a paddock which he turned into wheat so that he could cut some hay for the house cow and some wheat for the chooks-an experience with which the Minister can identify. I recall my father for some reason-perhaps simply because he wanted to instil into the family some measure of appreciation of what our forebears had gone through-taking my grandfather's stripper and winnower and turning part of the crop into hay and putting the grain from the stripper through the winnower. </PARA>
<PARA> As I listened to the debate last night I thought that a measure of winnowing would have done a great deal of good because there was an awful lot of cocky chaff caught up in the grain. I suspect that this has been a problem with this debate for the past 12 months. It has been very difficult in all of our electorates to separate the grain from the cocky chaff. I was distressed last night that in this chamber-which is the premium debating chamber of the land-we should be dealing with one of the nation's finest industries and treating it with scorn and derision. I was particularly distressed that the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) used the opportunity simply to pour scorn on the action being taken by the Opposition as it endeavoured responsibly to deal with the legislation before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not critical of my colleagues in the National Party who may have difficulty, for sincerely held reasons, coming to terms with this legislation. Not only am I not critical; I welcome the fact that on this side of the House they are able to exercise whatever they feel their conscience bids them to do without recrimination. What I am critical of is that that freedom was treated so lightly by the Government last night. As I said earlier, it seemed to me that the husk, the kernel, of the debate was lost in the cocky chaff, as so often it has been around the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I rise representing one of South Australia's major wheat growing electorates. I have to say to the House, and to my electorate, that I will be voting for the Opposition amendments but will also be supporting, with the Liberal and National parties, the deregulation of the domestic market that has been so much the focus of this debate. Why? Because I believe that in voting for this legislation I will be voting for my wheat growers and for the new opportunities it will give them. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition, in opposition in this House, has much to be proud of for the way it has dealt with this debate. As a result of our insistence and the assistance of such bodies as the Grains Council of Australia, the Minister has been forced out of the export market when earlier he had entertained the idea of exporting denatured feed wheat. As a result of our insistence and the assistance of the Grains Council, a more realistic level of guaranteed minimum price (GMP) is being offered to the industry than was originally intended. If the amendments, constructively and responsibly put to this House by the shadow Minister for primary industry-the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd)-are passed or supported by the Australian Democrats in the Senate, the realistic level of GMP that we believe ought to exist will be able to be legislated for.</PARA>
<PARA> The only real difficulty in this legislation for us has been in the level of domestic market deregulation. The problem has been that so many of our farmers have merely seen the cocky chaff of the word `deregulation' and failed to see the grain of the opportunities that deregulation would give them. The debate is about the domestic market, which is only 15 per cent of the crop. The Opposition parties have been prepared to entertain this level of deregulation not because we are enchanted with the word `deregulation' but because we see opportunities for grain growers in taking this particular course of action. The difficulty is that as soon as the cocky chaff word `deregulation' is thrown up into the wind everybody imagines that the proposal is to return the wheat industry to the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty is even more insurmountable in my electorate of Wakefield, which is an area well known by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Pratt) because he has farmed and continues to farm there-and in order to be even-handed, the same description applies to the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), who is sitting alongside him-since an industry known as Gulf Industries, pea grain purchasers, went broke. So Wakefield farmers immediately see deregulation as taking the wheat industry back to the 1930s or, alternatively, leaving them facing the same sort of uncertainty as the pea industry currently faces. Of course, that is nonsense; that is the cocky chaff. </PARA>
<PARA> The grain reality is that the Wheat Board continues to be in place, will be the sole exporter and will have 80 per cent of the crop locked up no matter what happens. I put it to the House that in the electorate of Wakefield the vast majority of my farmers will use the Wheat Board as the principal domestic seller of wheat because they prefer the security of the Wheat Board to the uncertainty of the free market. The point is that they will now have a choice. The Opposition's preparedness to support much of the Government's legislation is not in any sense an attack on the Wheat Board. We have nothing but commendation for the Wheat Board and for the capacity it has shown to be a successful grain exporter in the face of what have been cruelly corrupted world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 40 years from 1944 to 1984, the production of Australian wheat has gone from 1.4 million tonnes to 18.6 million tonnes, all of it sold successfully by the Wheat Board in markets that over recent years have been corrupted to the tune of $50 a tonne. That is no mean achievement, and the growers and honourable members on this side of the House gladly recognise it. Furthermore, not only has the Wheat Board had to deal with an unpredictable world marketplace; it has also had to deal with the unpredictability of droughts, fires and floods which have meant that it did not know what it was going to be marketing from one year to another. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the House, and our support of that legislation, far from being an attack on the Wheat Board, is merely, from our point of view, accepting what is being offered by the Government as an opportunity for farmers to have a choice in the way in which they go about their domestic marketing. I repeat that I am confident that the majority of Wakefield farmers will continue to market through the Wheat Board and not notice any difference at all. But there will be those-and I call them the niche marketers-who will say, `Here is an opportunity to get a premium out of the domestic market and this legislation will allow us to do so'. Of course, I am well aware that farmers can currently do that, but in order to do so they have to enter into a rather complicated and convoluted grower to buyer permit. Under this legislation, such a permit will no longer be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> In the north of my electorate, in the Orroroo-Peterborough area, where farmers have sandy paddocks and a dry climate, they can choose to plant a variety, not necessarily recommended, that will grow with a premium protein level wanted by a particular flour miller and command from that miller a premium price for it. Alternatively, I could use the illustration of a chemical free grain producer I currently have at Tarlee in the centre of my electorate. Frankly, he is bit of an embarrassment to the Wheat Board, even though he supports the Board. We have sat down and talked to the Chairman of the Wheat Board about this very instance. He will now be able to do as the Wheat Board wants him to do and go about industriously developing the chemical free grain market within the domestic market, so making sure that more and more Australians are consuming wheat grain on the domestic market and not being locked into a Wheat Board obligation that he does not particularly want to have and the Wheat Board does not want him in any sense to feel. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise, and I think it should be said that everyone on this side of the House recognises, that one cannot have the opportunities that this legislation provides without also exposing the industry to some risks. The Minister has conceded that the card price, the premium export price, the domestic price, could be eroded to the average export price. That risk is not likely to apply in the next two seasons, given that the world wheat reservoir is currently empty. Even if the worst possible situation were realised-and the Minister ran through this in his second reading speech-the difference between that premium price and the average export price need not be any more than, and let us be generous about it, $3 or $4 a tonne. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the interjection from the honourable member for Wannon, who is even better informed than I. He has been a little premature with his interjection. I attended the Grains Council meeting in South Australia under the auspices of the National Farmers and Stockholders and at that meeting the Deputy Chairman of the Wheat Board, Mr Michael Shanahan, a farmer in my electorate and not one particularly fond of the action currently being taken by the Liberal and National parties, was specifically asked by the farmers there, who were also unhappy about the proposal, what the disadvantage to South Australian farmers would be if this legislation were passed. He said that it would be between $1 and $2 a tonne, to reinforce the point being so eloquently made by the honourable member for Wannon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the light of the opportunities presented, that is hardly an enormous risk. Because the risk is minimal and the opportunities great, the Opposition has been in support of much of the legislation and will be moving some amendments that will make the Bill even more effective. Frankly, I am sorry to say that because there is a long list of speakers the Whip has asked me to prune my remarks and, as I am under somewhat more of an obligation to be obedient to the Whip than anyone else in this chamber, I do not have an opportunity to run through all of the amendments. However, I note that the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the honourable member for Wannon and the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), and I have no doubt other honourable members-and, of course, one must concede, the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray-have extensively addressed the amendments, anyway. So I will skip over the amendments and simply plead with the Minister to look at what the Opposition is prepared to do to make this legislation more meaningful. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of some concern to me that legislation that we have known for five years had to come in has been introduced in such a shoddy form. It is a matter of great concern to me that this legislation needs such extensive amendment. How does one excuse a situation where the Opposition finds reasonable cause to introduce 41 amendments and the Government finds reasonable cause to introduce 28 amendments in respect of its own legislation?</PARA>

<PARA> I conclude at the point at which I began. I began by reflecting on the process of winnowing grain, which separated the cocky chaff from the wheat. Australia generally, and South Australia in particular, has been noted for the innovative way it has gone about inventing the machinery needed to make our grain harvesting techniques more efficient. One of those most involved in developing agricultural machinery successfully in Australia was Arthur Cliff Howard. As a result of Howard's work, particularly in developing the rotary hoe, agricultural practice in Australia was turned around. Now, under another Mr Howard, the opportunity exists for agricultural practice in Australia to be again turned around. I suggest that, just as my electorate of Wakefield led the way in the development of agricultural machinery, so we have an opportunity in cooperation with the Grains Council and in support of the constructive parts of the Government legislation currently before the House to see that new opportunities are presented to Australia's wheat growers. The Opposition finds itself practising a great deal of philosophical consistency in accepting much of the Government's legislation. I hope that the Government is as consistent in its practice of philosophical consistency when we look to the further deregulation of the wages market and the waterfront. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Wheat Marketing Bill and associated Bills is to allow others as well as the Australian Wheat Board to trade wheat on the domestic market, to allow greater competition in the handling, storage and transport of grain, and to restructure the Australian Wheat Board. The Bill and the debate have aroused much passion, much anger, much joy and a wide spectrum of opinion both within the community and among all parties in this chamber. I acknowledge in particular the wide range of concern evident amongst coalition members, many of whom have very close ties with the wheat industry. Naturally, they are concerned about the degree of uncertainty this legislation creates in respect of the welfare of wheat growers, but they are also concerned about the extraordinary volume of errors and omissions in the legislation itself. I know that the Minister acknowledges that himself through the number of amendments-45, I think we just heard-that he is proposing to his own Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also pay tribute in particular to the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), for the immense effort he has devoted to drafting the coalition's amendments, which I believe should be supported. The wheat growers indeed have a friend in this Parliament in the form of the shadow Minister. In particular, we will see whether the Government is fair dinkum about deregulation as a principle, as opposed to deregulation just for the marketing side of the wheat industry, when we come to the shadow Minister's amendment to free up the labour market on the waterfront. Government members have tried to give the impression that they have been trumpeting from the high moral ground throughout this debate, but I know that they are squibs on deregulation when it comes to the waterfront, the labour market, industrial relations and even things such as uranium mining, where we have in Australia this ridiculous three mines policy. So, when it comes to deregulating its own constituent areas, the Government backs off every time. I ask the Government to be mindful of that when it sees some of us on this side of the chamber quite rightly and sincerely agonising over our constituency of wheat growers. I remind the Government that, despite our concerns and difficulties, we as an overwhelming majority have bitten the bullet and decided to go ahead and support further deregulation in the wheat industry. We are committed in our approach to deregulation. I will be interested to see whether the Government is as committed itself when we come to vote for the shadow Minister's amendment on labour market deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out to Government members that, even though a few Opposition members oppose this deregulation-and who amongst us has sat through a more moving and sincere speech in this chamber than that of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) in this debate-I am proud to belong to a party and a coalition that ultimately allow members to express opinions different from the majority party line. It is sad that in a so-called democratic country the party in government forbids its own members such basic human freedoms. How insecure members on that side of the chamber must be to have to resort to such restrictive, jackboot tactics. I declare myself a supporter of the direction of this legislation, and I would like the opportunity to explain why. </PARA>
<PARA> In round figures, the world produces about 515 million tonnes of wheat each year, of which Australia's contribution is about 15 million tonnes or about 3 per cent. In that sense, Australia is very much a minor producer on the world wheat scene-unlike, say, in regard to our share of world wool production. Most wheat-35 per cent-is actually grown in Asia; Europe grows 21 per cent; North America 17 per cent; the Soviet Union 17 per cent; and 10 per cent is grown elsewhere, which includes the three continents of South America, Africa and Australia, as well as all the Oceanic islands. However, as we, unlike most of these large producers, export most of our wheat, Australia is actually one of the major exporters of wheat, along with Argentina, Canada, the European Community and the United States. The biggest importers of wheat are the Soviet Union, China, Japan, Brazil and Egypt. It is interesting to note that 25 per cent of world wheat consumption is feed wheat. Of the 500 million tonnes or so grown worldwide, around 100 million tonnes of wheat is traded outside the country in which it is grown. I quoted these figures to show that Australia, although a major trader, is nevertheless a relatively small player on the world wheat market and is therefore largely dependent on world wheat prices for what we are paid for our wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> Short of a massive subsidy commitment from general revenue, which we could not afford anyway, Australia's influence on the overall world wheat market is that of a minor player. Wheat, like all commodities, is ultimately subject to the laws of supply and demand. When volume is up, such as occurs through increases in yields from new varieties-helped along with fertiliser usage in Asia-relative oversupply occurs and the price falls. Similarly, an increase in assistance levels in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries also depresses prices. In fact, such government intervention can cause a 15 per cent drop worldwide, which flows through to roughly a five per cent loss in income for Australian wheat farmers after our wheat growers-most of the 45,000 of whom are mixed farmers-substitute wheat growing for other areas of primary industry. I say this to get the wheat debate into perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia grows three per cent of the world's wheat, of which we export 80 per cent. Of the 20 per cent or so of the wheat that we sell on the domestic market, around 40 per cent is sold as feed wheat on a virtually deregulated market through the permit system. So tonight we are really only debating whether to deregulate further the sale of 12 per cent of our total wheat production, that is, about one eighth of our crop. The Wheat Board has, of course, already gone some distance down this deregulatory path, especially over the past few years. It was once quite a rigid and inflexible statutory marketing authority-of which, incidentally, we have about 60 in this country-but grower demands, and especially the pressure of this legislation which has been mooted now for quite a long time, have acted to bring aspects of the Wheat Board into the real world, the commercial world, with long overdue reforms. I am referring to the tentative steps taken with increased selling options, deferred deliveries, further disaggregation of individual grower's costs and so on. All these moves have been both welcome and successful. The Wheat Board, for whatever motive it introduced these changes, is to be congratulated on doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction in 1984 of permit selling for domestic feed wheat sales is a good example. Before its introduction, a number of prominent commentators predicted that the sky would fall in for the wheat industry in Australia. I am over six feet tall, and I have no bruises on my head yet. Despite these gloomy prognostications, the growers endorsed this change overwhelmingly. They voted with their feet to the extent that over 90 per cent of growers-indeed I think about 96 per cent in Victoria-now choose to bypass the Wheat Board and sell direct through the permit system for feed wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> On this subject it is interesting to note that Australia and Canada are the only major exporting countries in the world to use a central agency with powers to acquire wheat compulsorily. Indeed, of the 100 million tonnes of wheat traded on the world market, some 75 per cent is handled by private traders. Even in Australia the Wheat Board allows 20 to 30 per cent of its export sales to be handled through private traders. That is to the benefit of us all. In fact, it could be argued, despite what nearly everyone in this House may claim, that there is no need to have a Wheat Board monopoly for export. For example, if it is argued that a single seller structure is necessary to extract the best price from a single designated market-something, incidentally, that has never been able to be proved-the Wheat Board could sell that entitlement to that market to the highest bidder. In this way growers could still get the benefit of the premium along with the cost saving advantages of private sector marketing. It is not only wrong to say that these premium prices, or monopoly rents, to use the correct economic term, can be secured through Wheat Board sales; it is even detrimental to the interests of wheat growers. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention these things simply to illustrate that the further deregulation of that 12 per cent of Australia's wheat crop that we sell on the domestic market, when put into that sort of context, is no big deal. We are talking about that fraction of our crop which is sold for human consumption or for industrial use. </PARA>
<PARA> Numerous studies have been done on the wheat industry in Australia. The Industries Assistance Commission (IAC), a great friend of the farming community over the years through its advocacy of tariff reduction, has written three reports on the wheat industry over the last decade. In the 1978 report it recommended deregulation of the domestic market, and this was rejected by the government of the day. In 1983 it again recommended deregulation of the domestic market, and again it was rejected. In 1988 it once more recommended deregulation of the domestic market, and it was finally accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> In one sense, domestic deregulation is a concept whose time has come. As with all such moves, the downside is usually clear and visible and can be easily pointed to whereas the upside cannot be so clearly defined. It is a similar situation to removing tariffs. The disadvantage to wheat growers from this proposed legislation is that that portion of the price that is made artificially higher because of the present legislation than it would otherwise be on the open market, will now largely disappear. Averaged over the whole crop sales, including export sales, this amount ranged from a few cents to a few dollars per tonne, probably in the 50c to $2 per tonne category. The advantages are numerous, and the Wheat Board will be in an excellent position to dominate a fully commercial domestic wheat market. </PARA>
<PARA> A new range of selling options should open up to growers, and the growers themselves should be able to base their decisions on much more up to date, accurate and detailed market reports. As well, private traders will offer an expanded range of cash options, deferred payments, forward selling options, deferred delivery sales and so on. No seller will be penalised more than the costs that each uses. Impositions such as the $16 per tonne domestic selling charge and the Tasmanian freight equalisation charge of $1.90 per tonne, these monopoly costs, will disappear, I am pleased to say, and charges will more accurately reflect genuine costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Some growers will have the choice to grow new varieties, such as specialist high protein varieties. Market niches will open up for those who can take advantage of specific agronomic factors and locations. Until now the Wheat Board has found that such quantities are too small for it to handle in many cases. The increased number of buyers entering the market will put pressure on transport, storage and handling services to improve their efficiency through changing their work practices, varying and extending their operating times and by speeding up the use of technical innovations. </PARA>
<PARA> The more buyers that enter the market, along with the consequent investment in facilities that will follow, the greater the pressure there will be to enact and discover new efficiencies and lower costs. Private traders will use a wider variety of marketing techniques, will have a much more specialised knowledge of their markets because of the decentralising effect of their emergence that will result, and they will offer new market packages of various grains of various origins. Their greater marketing efficiency will lead to lower costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wheat Board will be strengthened immeasurably by certain measures in this Bill which further untie its hands, allowing it to buy wheat for cash, market other grains, trade in wheat produced in other countries and so on. The Wheat Board will have a commercial advantage over private traders, and this should not be overlooked. It is assured of a supply of capital through a levy. It will not have to generate a commercial rate of return on its shareholders' funds, and it is guaranteed a continuing monopoly on exports. If the Wheat Board is not a major player under these circumstances, it could be classed only as grossly incompetent. Its 80 per cent export market share alone will permit it to dominate the market overall and so set a floor. Private traders will be forced to match the Wheat Board instead of vice versa. </PARA>
<PARA> Why sellers of grain, that is the wheat growers, would do anything but welcome more buyers into the market is beyond me. As a wool grower and a meat producer, I cannot have too many buyers when I come to sell my product. More buyers increase the chance of a higher price. This fear of collusion amongst grain merchants that was supposed to take place in the 1930s is virtually overcome by restrictive trade practice laws, by having a Wheat Board as an alternative buyer, which the farmers did not have then, and by having much better market information and storage facilities available than were ever dreamt of in the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian farmers are now much more informed, competent, sophisticated and adaptable than they have ever been. The expertise of the farmers I know gives me the confidence that these days the hay is in the paddock and not in their hair. Naturally, because they have been sheltered and have limited first hand experience of wheat markets, many are apprehensive of the changes. However, change in this modern world is inevitable for survival, and a prerequisite of success is direct contact with the market. We should not deny this to our growers. The fallacious argument of the market being set by the weakest seller, is an economic nonsense. How could someone selling 1,000 tonnes of wheat for a low price, or even giving it away for that matter, set the market for the rest? The 1930s slump in prices was not due to greedy merchants, as most seem to believe; it was due to government policy, whereby growers were urged to grow massive amounts of wheat for guaranteed government prices, which the Government later found it could not meet. Its chopping and changing of promises after the glut of wheat arrived and the farmers delivered, created awful uncertainty amongst the buyers and they could not pay more than the world market price or else they would go broke. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I believe a successful seller's friend is a buyer, and the more buyers there are, the more friends the seller will have and the happier everybody is. Let us not talk of restricting buyers from the market-place. Indeed, the prices in real terms for wheat were higher in the 1930s than they were in the last couple of seasons before this one, when we had a Wheat Board. I would like permission to incorporate in Hansard two tables-I have shown them to the Minister and have received his approval-which will demonstrate this fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. On the matter of underwriting, I accept that there is little logic in having a government guaranteed price for wheat but not for other commodities. But leaving that aside, several speakers on the other side have been saying that a 95 per cent underwriting guarantee, as we have proposed in our amendment, would involve the Government in huge pay-outs. That is quite untrue. Over the last 10 years, if we set the gross national product on a one year basis instead of a three-year rolling average, the 95 per cent level would have been triggered only once, and that would have been in the 1980-81 year when the shortfall was only a mere $3.46 a tonne. However, that was before the Wheat Board was allowed to hedge on the futures market, which would probably have meant that it would not have had even that small pay-out. In the 1986-87 season when we did have that big pay-out of $220m, which amounted to about $14 a tonne, under our amendment formula there would have been no pay-out at all. In light of these figures, I hope that the Minister will look more benignly on the shadow Minister's proposal rather than rejecting it out of hand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I know time is short and as other honourable members wish to speak in this debate, I say in conclusion that there are many good things in this legislation. I support the general thrust of it, but it is very disappointing for many honourable members on this side of the House and for the wheat growers that so many substantial corrections are needed. I hope that, at the committee stage, the Government will see fit to accept most, if not all, of the proposed changes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The whole sorry wheat saga shows just how incompetent and irresponsible this Labor Government is. Instead of having a rational debate about new wheat marketing proposals, last year the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who is at the table, announced a number of vague propositions that were floated around the country. Amongst other things they involved substantial changes to underwriting, deregulation of the domestic market, and an undermining of the Australian Wheat Board's export powers. Many wheat farmers justifiably said, `The last thing we want is an undermining of the Board's powers and a return to the 1930s'. In no time at all, fears regarding the future of the Australian Wheat Board spread like wildfire through the bush.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two reasons why there were such deep rooted fears. Firstly, farmers just do not trust this Labor Government. Consistently Labor has applied one rule to the farmers and another to its union mates, and they do not trust it. Secondly, the original vague wheat marketing proposals had major flaws which, in many respects, justified the wheat growers' fears. The Government and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy have been responsible yet again for the gross mishandling of what should have been a very sensible debate about ways of reducing costs to growers by cutting bureaucratic intervention and by cutting transport and storage costs, especially in the eastern States, thereby increasing the efficiency of handling and increasing returns to growers. What hope have we got of this Government introducing a much needed and meaningful deregulation of the labour market when it cannot even handle a simple matter of improving the returns to growers in the new wheat marketing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has always been in favour of scrapping the rorts in the system, thereby increasing returns to growers, but we have never been in favour of undermining the Wheat Board's ability to gain the best possible price overseas by having the responsibility for selling Australia's wheat crop on the world market. So, yet again, it has been left to the coalition to clean up Labor's mess and bring sense to the debate and to the new wheat marketing proposals. How many more times are we in the Opposition going to have to save the Australian farming community from the crass stupidity of this Government. My colleagues and I saved the nation from the identification card. We stopped the stupid constitutional changes proposed by Labor and now we have to clean up the mess that it has made of what should have been a sensible debate about improving the wheat marketing arrangements for Australia. For example, as a result of our unswerving opposition, the Government has now scrapped its proposal to undermine the export powers of the Wheat Board. It is a significant victory for the coalition and for commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of amendments to be moved by the Opposition and the Government highlights the unmitigated disaster the Government has made of this proposal. Some 45 amendments are to be moved by the Minister and almost the same number are to be moved by the Opposition. I have met, as have so many honourable members on this side of the House, with wheat growers in my area. I have had meetings with them throughout the electorate, in Bordertown, Lameroo, Wanbi, Loxton and Waikerie. Those meetings reflected growers' concerns about the vagueness of the proposals as they were put up last year and earlier this year. At those meetings I gave undertakings to my growers, some of which are met by the Government's back-off from its original proposals in areas such as the Australian Wheat Board's export powers. Other commitments I made are picked up in the amendments to be moved by the Opposition, especially those relating to underwriting, penalties on illegal exports, and the vital application of the same rules to the unions as this Government is applying to wheat growers. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal briefly with some of our proposed amendments. It is important for wheat farmers, who have a very large capital investment in equipment and a very large annual cost in planting crops, to have the advantage of knowing what the likely return is to be if they can grow and reap that crop successfully. This is one of the core reasons for establishing the Wheat Board as the farmers' international marketing arm. The guaranteed minimum price has provided our farmers with the much needed certainty required, just as has the floor price for wool growers. It certainly illustrates this Government's lack of understanding of the needs of industry that it seeks substantially to undermine the guaranteed minimum price (GMP) in the current circumstances. We in the Opposition will be moving an amendment to maintain the 95 per cent GMP. Wheat is one of our most significant export commodities and this underwriting is a small contribution to provide some certainty to this industry at this time. I can recall the Government having to assist in meeting the guarantee only once, and the Australian Wheat Board says that it is extremely unlikely to occur again because of its better forecasting techniques. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that it is highly unlikely that the guarantee will ever be used. Nevertheless, the need to provide some certainty for growers is highlighted by the scandalous announcement yesterday by our so-called free trading United States of America allies that they are to sell $1.5m tonnes of subsidised wheat to the Soviet Union. This brings the United States subsidy on sales to the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics over the past four years to around $670m. It is a most stupid, short-sighted, irrational policy being implemented by the United States. Whilst it is clear that Europe for some time sold subsidised products into our markets-although there are signs that the rate of subsidy is reducing in recent years-nevertheless, the United States, in upping the ante on the trade war, will do absolutely nothing to help the long-term goal of free trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment we propose is to increase the penalty for the illegal export of wheat-that is, exports other than those approved by the Board. Growers in my area were concerned that the penalty of $100,000 on a large illegal shipment would be peanuts. Therefore, after consultation with the wheat industry we have proposed that the penalty be a financial penalty of a percentage of the value of the wheat illegally exported or $100,000, whichever is the greater. Subsequently, the Minister, I understand, is agreeing to lift the penalty to $300,000 with which I agree. However, I urge the Government to accept the percentage penalty as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Another essential amendment we propose is to shore up the right of the Australian Wheat Board to trade within a State. I understand that it is a common goal of all parties to this debate that that be the case. I do not have time to deal with all the amendments proposed by the Opposition after consultation with the wheat industry, but I wish to refer to our proposed clause 88. There is no doubt that one of the greatest constraints on economic growth in this country is our antiquated industrial relations system, together with the restrictive work practices and other impediments to improvements in labour productivity. Whenever the Labor Government is pressed about its failure to deregulate the labour market, it diverts attention by claiming that it has done some work towards deregulating. More often than not, it points to the deregulation of the exchange rate, the banks and now, no doubt, it will point to the deregulation of the wheat industry. However, it continues to refuse steadfastly to act in areas such as the waterfront. Why? The answer is clearly political. The Labor Government is only too prepared to deregulate in areas where it does not affect its supporters but it has continually refused to act when the heat gets a bit closer to home. For example, the Government has done absolutely nothing about the waterfront. Not only has the Inter-State Commission report highlighted the gross inefficiency and the need for deregulation on the waterfront, but today we have received even more proof of the disastrous waterfront situation. The Australia to Europe Shipping Conference has proposed that surcharges for port congestion be applied on all exports and imports through Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. It is reported in today's Australian:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australia to Europe Shipping Conference (AESC) which coordinates the sailings and freight rates of most British and European lines trading to Australia, has told exporters and the Federal Government the surcharges would be applied unless there was an immediate improvement in disastrously low productivity on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> The Conference said it would charge up to an extra $190 a container and $10 a tonne for loose cargo, which would have a significant impact on the price of traded goods. </PARA>
<PARA>Urgent action is needed, and the coalition is determined to act after the next election. In the meantime, we are proposing an amendment to these Bills which will extend the Government's use of the export powers not only to blow up State rail monopolies but also to cover grain terminals and loading facilities. In other words, we are trying to get the Government to apply the same rules to the waterfront as it intends to apply to wheat farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> The time has come for the cosy relationship between this Labor Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to end. It is time for the Government to put the national interest before the ACTU's interests. Even Max Walsh agrees. Recently he said in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald that the accord was `a reckless and wrecking monster'. We agree with that, and many people in the Australian community now agree with it. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government doing about it? We intend to do something about it tonight. The pressure is on the Government to respond. Our proposal is quite simple. It provides that there will be no closed shops, no preference to unions, and no artificially imposed number of people to do the work in the terminals, loading ships. In addition, we will provide for voluntary agreements to be entered into between the employers and employees, with provision for damages for any breach of the agreement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very good idea.

In other words, we are saying to the Government that it must use its export powers to implement responsible work practices on the waterfront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal is generally consistent with the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission. The Government should act on its own report. It has the chance to do that tonight. We are providing the Government with an opportunity to do exactly what it says it intends to do, that is, to implement micro-economic reform. The question is: does the Labor Government mean what it says or is it too scared to do the right thing because it might affect some of its mates? Tonight we will see who is pulling the strings. Is the Government in charge or is it the ACTU?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NI4">Mr PORTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My fear and the fear of the Australian community is that the honourable member is quite right-that the Government is not in charge and that it is the ACTU which is in charge. The failure of the Government to act tonight on our amendment to clause 88 will not only mean that this country will continue to lose out in the international trading stakes but also it will herald even higher charges being loaded onto our exporters because of the Government's inability to bite the bullet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is this Government that will carry the can for the extra $10 a tonne to be loaded onto our wheat growers as their wheat goes over the wharf. The challenge to the Government is clear: it must act tonight and avoid the threatened extra $10 a tonne. If it squibs that, it must carry the responsibility for the higher waterfront charges. If the Government really has the interests of wheat growers at heart, it must support the Opposition's amendment to clause 88 tonight. It is no good saying in response that it is all right, that negotiations are being undertaken between the waterfront unions, the ACTU and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). We know all about that. They met all day today and got nowhere. They are doing nothing, and they have no intention of acting on the Inter-State Commission report. So the Government cannot deal that up to us, because we know that nothing will happen as a result of those negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of breaking the outrageous work practices on the waterfront cannot be overstated. The Inter-State Commission has stated quite clearly that we are wasting $440m each year. That is obviously reflected in lower export returns and higher import charges. Quite frankly, the problems in relation to the Victorian rail monopoly, which has had so much airplay during this debate, pale into insignificance when compared with the rorts that are occurring on the waterfront. There is no doubt that the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia has grossly abused its monopoly position, and action must be taken. We provide the Government with the opportunity to do that tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly it is an extraordinary abuse of power when we see gang supervisors working about 46 hours a week and being paid about $78,000 a year. The average wage of the wharf labourer is about $1,000 for a 28-hour week. I would not mind paying those high wages if they were earned. No one minds paying high wages for work done, but the problem is that the waterside workers are not earning their wages. It is quite clear that unless we remove the restrictive work practices which are fast throttling the lifeblood of this nation, as a nation we will go under. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I shall finish where I began. I cannot remember an instance in relation to a piece of legislation where the Minister in charge has managed to get everyone offside. This is not because he is right but because he has blundered into this new wheat marketing arrangement with vague, irrational proposals instead of a tight, well-argued case for change. It is only as a result of the action of the Opposition that we will have a reasonable package worth supporting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The wheat industry is a particularly valuable part of the Australian economy, and it has developed from the activities and personal endeavours of many tens of thousands of people, some of whom began to establish this industry soon after Australia was settled. It now presents to this country one of its basic means of earning export income. The industry is now very much different from what it was in years gone by. It is an industry made up of the hopes and aspirations of those people who operated in the industry previously and who were subsumed into larger organisations as the wheat industry and wheat properties were aggregated-and this has occurred ever since property was first taken up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today, wheat properties of a sizable nature consist of the many smaller properties that have been gathered together, according to the economic message that farmers have always had to face. We see today an industry which, as many have said in this debate, is sophisticated and in touch with modern technology and world events. The people who are responsible for making the decisions to manage the various properties that produce Australia's wheat crop can be counted as some of the best informed people in Australia. Whilst this is admitted and promoted in debate on both sides of this House, I am astounded that we can hold that collective view and yet we are willing to ignore the collective view which has been put to this Parliament and to the various parties involved by people in the Australian wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that some 40,000 of the 45,000 individual operators would be against this legislation that we are considering here tonight. I therefore view with some cynicism the assertion made by honourable members in this House that they regard those who operate in the wheat industry as being up with current trends and knowing what they are about. On the one hand I suppose that this is being said to impress them, while on the other hand we throw aside the advice they give us in relation to this legislation. I can understand why they are concerned. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) brings this legislation into the House two months before it is necessary to renew the life of the Australian Wheat Board. It is the same as putting the farmers up against the wall and saying, `You will accept the legislation or I will economically shoot you'. There is no alternative in the wider terms of having a Wheat Board, of the Board handling the continued trading of wheat in Australia, and looking at the pools which will come from the next harvest. That, in itself, is an offence to those who work in and manage this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> But of a greater nature is the Government's absolute deceit throughout this country and in this House in maintaining that it is necessary to diminish the powers of the Wheat Board to improve the infrastructure that serves the wheat industry. It is absolute deceit. The Wheat Board could be given that power which is in this Bill without touching its capacity to handle the domestic market. The two are totally unrelated. If we wanted to, we could pass a Bill of one page giving the Board that power. We do not have to take away its other powers to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer truly is that the infrastructure is basically in the charge of State governments, which over the years have failed to deregulate. My State, in this particular, stands out amongst all States. In the early 1960s road transport in South Australia was deregulated and operators of all industry everywhere could choose the form of transport that they desired. There was one further major move. I say this with some trepidation because on no other occasion have I been known to support any move by the Dunstan Government in South Australia. Its move in selling the South Australian railways to the Commonwealth, in addition to the freeing up of transport, was one of the best things it did for South Australian rail transport. The South Australian railways were taken out of the parochial management of the State Government and put in the hands of national management. The reforms that have occurred there have produced the best rail transport in Australia. But the basic reforms were made by the Playford non-Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What Labor governments do about transport is quite evident. Which other governments in Australia have deregulated transport? Who governs Western Australia? A Labor government. Who governs Victoria? A Labor government. Of course, there is now the start of significant deregulation in New South Wales under a Liberal-National coalition. Labor was in government for years and did nothing. In recent years Labor has failed to meet the challenge of modern reform in infrastructure. We approach this Bill and its passage with that deceit behind us and without knowing that any State will approve internal trading for the Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA> Are we all going to sit here and pass this Bill and say how good it is when we do not know whether the Wheat Board can trade internally? We would have to be off our heads to approve that sort of thing. Do honourable members really think this Bill will go to the other place and come back here containing that amendment about the deregulation of the work force, which I will happily support? Come on, let us be realistic. It is an attempt similar to my attempt to move that this Bill be subject to a referendum. It is totally symbolic. If this Bill is to come into effect, it will come into effect with deregulation. It will give the Wheat Board power to affect the internal price of wheat in Australia. Nothing will be done about the costs that feed into the wheat grower's cost of production. He will pay the same inflated cost for Australian made vehicles to go into his operation and pay for all the other goods and services based on a regulated work force. So, his input costs will not be affected by our so-called amendments during the passage of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to see some equity between the major producing areas of agriculture and the pastoral industry. It is one thing to say that the pastoral industry can have one of the most significant price support schemes, as it has under the Australian Wool Corporation. It has one of the most admirable schemes brought in in support of the pastoral industry-one of the most significant industries in Australia. No matter what people may say, it is a significant price support structure. When the market was down, as we know, the Wool Corporation brought in, I think, well over one million-it may have been 1.7 million-bales of wool. It was a huge amount of wool. Under its legislation it was charged to support the price and it did support the price. Through the assessment of what the world market will bear through the auction system, it continued to assess what floor it can place under the market. Its operation is distinctly advantageous to the wool industry and maintains a floor under it. Under that operation all users of wool in Australia pay more for that wool than they would have paid if that mechanism was not in place. </PARA>
<PARA> That is fine for the wool industry, but it is no good for the wheat industry. Under this legislation the Wheat Board apparently is not allowed to fix the internal price. It is all right for the wool industry, but it is no good for the wheat industry. The wheat industry has tended to protect the interests of the grower in Australia by adopting an uncorrupted price for Australian consumers and to establish an umbrella under which all these other examples which have been given, have been obtained. Someone might get a few more dollars in some other action somewhere for their wheat, but it is all achieved under that umbrella price of the Board. That is to be diminished. We will have to have an internal price which undoubtedly will fall. One wonders why we have this disparity between the two industries. Does that mean that somehow the wool industry has a greater social standing? As someone has suggested, perhaps we should not call our wheat years `pools'; we should have vintages. As someone said, perhaps we could have a grain hermitage. The wheat industry perhaps needs a better social standing to impress on Parliament that we should have the same right to set some better standard for the price of wheat in Australia on behalf of growers. One can understand the growers' fears. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond the detail of this Bill, what growers fear most of all is the `foot in the door' approach-the almost fanatical approach to deregulation today not only in politics but also in the community. Many growers are viewing this Bill as a foot in the door. Does it mean that in a few years time there will be a concerted attack on the very existence of the Board and, in that, a demand across Australia that we do away with it? I hope that that demand will not succeed. Of course, there will be such a demand. We know that there are many people in the economic world and some in this Parliament who would like to do away with the Board altogether. Certainly, that fuels the fears of growers. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that many people have considered this Bill on the basis that orderly marketing is not for good times but for bad times. One does not need anything to sell wheat in or outside Australia now. But how many years do we have to go back before we come across bad times? Not too long ago we had quotas for growing wheat-certainly in my State-and one did not get paid at all for the third tier of quota. We had two tiers of quota and after the second tier we got nothing. I would like to see what deregulation would do in those times. The value of the Board and pools is that they can always straddle the times of oversupply and the times in which growers find it difficult to survive. They can ensure that each year something is paid for the wheat crop. Orderly marketing is ingrained in the consciousness of Australian wheat growers. If anyone thinks that he can get away with threatening the existence of the Board in the future, he will come up with a great deal more opposition than he has on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I also listened to continued loose talk about more competition in the local market. What does the Government mean? When one gets down to it, it means competition between grower and grower. That is what the Government means when one analyses it. The very existence of pools is to do away with competition on the basis of price between grower and grower. That would be a return to a most murderous situation in an industry which from time to time is bedevilled with low overseas prices and the great inequities of the Australian climate. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I ask several questions. Is it necessary to reduce the Board's powers to revamp the infrastructure which serves the industry? I have already dealt with that. The answer is a resounding no. It is a plain and simple deceit. Will the return to growers for the sale of wheat in Australia be lower? The answer will have to be yes. If we want to confirm that, we can refer to the recent sale of American wheat, an issue that was much referred to today. If one can see anything but a reduction in the price of wheat in Australia in the economic war between the United States of America and the European Community, one would have some sort of crystal ball which is not available to others. </PARA>
<PARA> Will the Board have the right to trade at all in Australia? How do we know? We do not know. We do not know whether the States will give that right. Will there be further demands to deregulate wheat export markets? The answer will be a resounding yes. As someone has said, one does not feed red meat to young tigers. I can assure people that this proposal is certainly feeding red meat to traders who will want to get their hands on a deregulated export market. Will the dogma of deregulation for deregulation's sake again override wheat growers' expressed interests in the future? I can only say that I do not know.</PARA>
<PARA> To oppose the major aspect of this Bill, which is the deregulation of the internal price, is not to set one's head in the sand or to oppose any alterations to the operation of wheat marketing, which could be advantageous to both grower and consumer. To accept lightly this move from a Labor Government which is under deep suspicion in the economic community is, I believe, to accept a position which may be a temporary one. I urge all those in the wheat industry to look to the future and make sure they take action now to maintain the export control of the Board and that they do not let the forces which will be unleashed by this legislation destroy the Board's great capacity to serve the Australian wheat grower into the long term future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join tonight my colleagues in the National Party of Australia in speaking in this debate on the Wheat Marketing Bill 1989 and cognate Bills. Of course, it will be of no great surprise to honourable members that this debate is of particular interest to the National Party and has caused great concern within our ranks. Before I commence the prepared portion of my address tonight I want to take a few moments to highlight some of the aspects of the proposed wheat marketing legislation which concern me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, I believe that the way the Bill has been put together, the way it has been drafted, is one of the worst examples of draftsmanship and preparation, one of the sloppiest performances, that we have seen in a long time in this House. I believe that more than 40 amendments have been proposed to the Bills since they were first introduced a couple of weeks ago. That in itself is of concern to every one of us. It is not as if this Bill has been produced overnight. It was more than 12 months ago that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who is sitting opposite, announced to the world his intentions to deregulate the wheat industry. The Minister, the Government and all those concerned have had ample time to prepare the legislation without ambiguity and in such a way that it met all the concerns of the industry. Despite all of that time and opportunity for preparation, that was not achieved successfully. That is why tonight we see so many amendments being added to the original Bill. It is worth pointing out that not only has the Government put forward its amendments but we on this side of the House have our own amendments to propose to the legislation. We feel our amendments certainly add to the usefulness and workability of the legislation. We believe they are important to ensure that the wheat industry is properly serviced in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also very concerned about the state that this leaves the Australian Wheat Board in. We know that, as this legislation goes through the House in the last few sitting weeks of this session, the life of the Wheat Board comes to a very rapid end. Unless this legislation is passed, the future of the Wheat Board is very much in doubt. What happens if there is a hitch? What happens if the Parliament rises earlier than expected? What happens if something does not go as planned? Does the Wheat Board exist after 1 July of this year? These are questions which are not being adequately answered. They are questions which should not even be asked. Had the Government organised itself properly and prepared the legislation in sufficient time, there would be no question as to the future of the Wheat Board after 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point worth making in this debate is that, from the view of the National Party of Australia, the legislation is crucial to the very nature of the Party. The National Party, or the Country Party of Australia as it originally was, was created from the desire to establish orderly marketing for our primary products. That is one of the very pillars upon which the Party was built. Tonight we see that very pillar being somewhat eroded. The issue we are debating tonight is terribly important to us. Just as important from the Australian Labor Party's point of view would be a piece of legislation going through this House which the Labor Party would be asked to support which did away with trade unionism in this country, because trade unionism is one of the pillars upon which the Labor Party was built. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Mayo points out, it was the only basis upon which the Labor Party was created, and still exists today. It is these very crucial aspects of the National Party's history which lead to this particular legislation being of such importance to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen the Government be very cunning in the way in which it has been able to reduce the position of primary industries in Australia since it took up office in 1983. Just a few weeks ago in this place, when the April mini-Budget was announced, we saw in the explanatory memorandum the fact that drought relief from the Federal Government was under review. The funding for drought relief, some $17m, was being scrapped from the Budget. It was a great time to remove drought relief when half the country seemingly was under floodwaters. The fact that these sorts of things are being done at a time when it does not seem so important for them to continue causes us concern too. The Wheat Board and the way in which the whole wheat industry has operated over the last few years has been good for the industry in both good times and bad times. As we have heard from previous speakers tonight, it is the bad times when the present system of operation within the wheat industry has gone so far to help individual growers of wheat throughout Australia. Once again we find the Government choosing a good time to change the manner in which the wheat industry operates. We find that seasons have been quite good. Prices have been improving on the world market. So we find the Government using this time as an opportunity to do away with the very basis upon which the industry has been able to survive through bad times in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation changes the way in which the industry operates. The present system, which we have had for a long time now, has served the industry well. It has provided, as one of the principal bases of the industry, a floor price for all wheat growers to operate under, a guaranteed minimum price scheme. Many people in this House may not understand the benefits of that. Having been a wheat grower prior to entering this place I know that it is of great security to wheat growers to know what price they are going to receive for the product they can deliver and to know that they have a market for that product. Farmers are very busy people. Farmers do not always have the time to carry out every facet of their affairs, particularly over the last few years when the high cost of wages and the necessary changes to the use of farm labour have forced farm managers to become jacks of all trades on their farms, leaving them very little time to deal with some of the business aspects of running their farms. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is placing upon farmers greater responsibility for management of all of the facets of the production and sale of their products. Many people might say that that does not seem to be such a big problem. I can assure people that when one has to do everything from maintaining the tractor, driving the header, keeping the auger going, to driving the truck to the silo, one has little time to be concerned about where it is going to be delivered, what sort of price one is going to get, what the quality is and what sort of a buyer is going to be found for the product. There is a finite amount of time in which farmers have to do everything they have to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The present system has been a great asset to many growers throughout Australia, particularly the smaller farmers who have found the way the Wheat Board and the wheat industry have operated to be of great benefit to them. The present system has helped to protect farmers from the world corrupted markets, markets that are corrupted by the European Economic Community and by the United States. They are corrupted by the heavy subsidy programs that those two entities engage in. These are subsidy programs which we saw evidence of only yesterday when the United States Government entered into further sales of wheat at heavily subsidised rates. Yet the present system has helped to ensure that our Australian wheat farmers have had at least some small protection from some of those corrupted world markets. The present system has helped with so many of the mechanics of growing and producing wheat, such as delivery arrangements and, as I mentioned, guaranteed payments. The present system has helped to ease the minds of wheat farmers. The moment one delivers to the Wheat Board and has the docket, one can drive home knowing that eventually a cheque is going to arrive in the mail and there is no need to worry about the person who has bought the product that has just been sold being of sound financial state. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times we have seen some minor changes to all that. We have seen farmers being able not only to operate under the present system but through the use of Wheat Board authorities they have been able to sell some of their grain on the domestic market to local buyers. For example, I am a piggery producer. Over the last few years we have been able to buy direct from the farmer. Purely and simply by getting the appropriate authority from the Wheat Board we have been able to purchase our grain direct from the grower. Over the last few years the Wheat Board and the wheat industry have been moving with the times, opening up for farmers the opportunity to sell to people in their local area or to the odd persons whom they find are suitable buyers. At the same time they have the security of mind that the opportunity to sell to the Board at a guaranteed minimum price and with a guaranteed payment of that price is still available to them when and where they want it. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last few years we have seen some minor changes to the way the industry has operated. They were very well received changes and have been well accepted by the industry. Some people say that there is a need to change. Many members in this House over the last day or so have highlighted the differing views of wheat growers throughout Australia. Some people say that all wheat growers are opposed to the legislation. Some people say that that is not the case. There is not doubt that just because the old system has worked in the past there is not an opportunity for us to look at ways of improving it in the future. This is what the present Minister claims is the justification for this current legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Only the test of time will tell, but I can assure the Minister that there are many people in the community today, many people in this Parliament and many people in the National Party who are very sceptical about the way in which the benefits from this legislation will actually flow to the individual wheat grower. Many wheat growers throughout this country believe that ultimately the net result will be that we will swap one monopoly for another. We will find that the Wheat Board, having previously been the monopoly, will be traded for some other private enterprise operation that will be a monopoly operator in the market and not necessarily working in the best interests of the industry. That is the background to this debate today. In addition to that background, when the Government first announced its intention to change the way in which the wheat industry is structured there was great scepticism among individual growers because they do not trust the Government in matters of primary industry. Over the last six and a bit years we have seen primary industry suffer badly under this Government. We have seen hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits that have been provided to the wheat industry removed by this Government. All of us can recall such things as the fuel freight equalisation subsidy scheme being scrapped. We have recently seen the superphosphate bounty go. We have seen depreciation rates for such things as grain storage, water conservation and various other aspects of life reduced since this Government got into power. We have seen the price of fuel go up. When this Government says it is going to change the way in which the wheat industry operates people say, `If you are going to change this part of the industry like you have changed other parts of the industry we are very sceptical'. That is why so much concern has been expressed and that is why so many people do not believe the words of the Minister and the members of the Government that as a result of this legislation we will see major improvements. The background has been one of scepticism. Growers have felt tremendous benefits from the present system. There are concerns all around as to what this Government really intends to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has singled out primary industries for some major changes. It seems to be almost singularly one-eyed in the types of changes it has proposed over the last few years. Strangely enough, when this legislation was first mooted there was no talk of changing some of the aspects of high costs to the wheat industry. It has only been as a result of pressure from the Grains Council of Australia, individual wheat growers and members of my own political party that we have seen the Government moving towards the deregulation of the transport industry, changing aspects of the waterfront and talking in these last few days of looking at the coastal shipping industry to try to do away with some of the rorts there and some of the high costs that are incurred by wheat growers as a consequence of those regulated industries. We now know that from the very outset the Government did not initially intend to look at these aspects of our industries. It has only been as a result of the efforts of our party, the Grains Council of Australia and the individual wheat growers that the Government has moved down that path. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some comfort for those of us in our political party when we look at this legislation tonight because at least we have changed some things. From the outset there was to be no export monopoly, from what we can believe from the original utterances from the Minister, for the Wheat Board. At least that part of it has been retained. At least we have seen promises of deregulation of the transport industry. At least we have seen talk of changing things on the waterfront. This legislation tonight is seen very sceptically by wheat growers throughout Australia. It is legislation which comes to the Parliament slightly better than it would have had it not been for the efforts of the industry, the Grains Council of Australia and individual members of my party. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), for the work that he has done. Through all of his efforts we have seen some improvements to this legislation which I believe will deliver great benefits if we can add to them when hopefully we have the opportunity of being in government in a few short months. Tonight we see legislation that will go to the people which is not universally supported, which needs a lot of improvement and which we have given promises to members of the wheat industry that we will be able to improve on when we have the opportunity of being in government. I believe that from the legislation tonight and from the calls of concern from so many ordinary Australians the sooner that occurs the better Australia will be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I speak in this debate on the Wheat Marketing Bill 1989 and cognate Bills. This debate has been tarnished with anger and concern. We have been lobbied and we have seen emotion, hysteria, baiting, hypocrisy and cynicism on a subject which is very special to the primary producers of Australia. In this current year this industry directed economic aid worth about $2.87 billion to this struggling Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I speak from a couple of points of view. As the Federal member for Adelaide, every few months I go to the Trades Hall on South Terrace to pick up a trade union card as a paid up member of Actors Equity. Recently I was asked to strike for the benefit of actors in Australia. Last night I was encouraged by the fact that the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) inquired about how much wheat is grown in Adelaide. I hasten to point out-and I am proud to say-my stocks are etched deep in rural South Australia as I am a fourth generation wheat farmer. The honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) said last night that he has spent a lot of time on the tractor. His colleague the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffith) suggested that he may have been conceived on one. I too have spent many a long day and long years on the tractor and on the farm. As the broadcast of this debate goes around Australia I know that my rural colleagues, relatives, friends and family will listen with interest. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) spoke about the farmers not being able to see the wheat for the chaff. The rural producers say, `We do not want deregulation'. But if that is taken a step further and we ask `Why don't you?', they have trouble coming back with an answer. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, we will not walk away from the basic support of rural Australia-the wheat and wool industries. The Australian Wheat Board is the major player in this industry, and we will not walk away from the people who have helped to make this country as great as it is. I talk about the industry when I speak to the farmers of Bute, Baringa Gap and Blyth, and they know what I am speaking about. But these same men and women are deregulators themselves. They have the opportunity to sell their lambs at the abattoirs in Adelaide, their weaner cattle and cracker ewes at Burra, their shipping wethers, their peas for vegetable protein, their oats to the trotting and racing industry, their barley to the maltsters and their wheat to the pig and chicken vertical integrators and they sell their off-grade and their feed and seed wheat. They have the ability to sell those products on a deregulated market but when one talks to them in some sort of a debate over a cup of tea or around the kitchen table or perhaps in a silo queue, they want everyone's hands off the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The myth which has been associated with the Australian wheat industry must be exposed. My colleagues talk continually about the bad old days of 1945 and the bag industry. I can remember the Bunges, the Charlicks, Southern Farmers and the other romantic names that my father spoke about when wheat cost one shilling and tenpence a ton. I think that might have been the currency; I am not sure because it is a long time ago. They spoke about a lot of bartering and trading in those bad old days of bag wheat and bad times. They spoke about the pea industry, which unfortunately in 1988 fell over in Balaclava. But there has to be some entrepreneurial skill as we drag ourselves and sometimes the rural farmers kicking and screaming towards the 1990s. To say that farmers who have the ability to handle 300 horsepower tractors, air seeders, 20-foot harvesters, combines, grain augers and weed sprays are not intelligent enough to know a bit about wheat deregulation or to be a bit more progressive is an indictment of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this myth and the image portrayed from those olden days is long behind us. I am pleased to have been associated with several South Australian members: the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter), the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and, in particular, the elder statesman of rural South Australia, the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), who brought some very salient points to this debate in relation to the deregulation of the transport industry, which is what the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport is about. </PARA>
<PARA> For several years I was involved in trucking wheat out of the Blyth silo, a horizontal silo to which the railways would bring in seven rail trucks. If one filled them in a day, it was good. Us hardworking and enterprising farmers looking for a bit of extra cash used to punch those out 60 tons per truck, jack them down the line and bring in another one and we would have the job done by lunchtime. We could then go home and perform another task and get paid for two jobs as one. Overtime was not available in those days of the wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> So, I have touched on all of that. I have also been a transport operator. I started off with a Dodge Power Giant, a single drive bogie trailer, carting grain all around South Australia. South Australia is to be congratulated for being the last State to go into the bulk handling cooperative system. It has excellent superports around the State. I have spent many a long day and night at Port Pirie, Wallaroo, Port Adelaide, Ardrossan and Port Giles carting wheat, in particular, and barley. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a suburban seat, but I am a practising, practical farmer with 1,000 acres of wheat about to shoot out of the ground. I remember the days of wheat quotas, which were alluded to by the honourable member for Boothby. They were the dark and dim days of the industry. I remember the years when the rust came through and took out an excellent variety of wheat called halberd, which was bred in South Australia. It was my decision to go to Dubbo where I bought some condor wheat from a man by the name of Croker and brought it back. I congratulate my cousins Ross and Geoff Pratt, who have a farm. I have a cousin farming at Moree and they were among of the first people to bring back a bushel of festiguay hard wheat into South Australia. This was a long-stemmed, non-shedding variety of wheat which was able to prevent rust. Now we are getting into the new varieties of spear, dagger, warrigal and molineux, which is a cereal cyst nematode-resistant wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> The wheat industry is very important to Australia. This debate has raged long and hard. I reckon that if we get our people to the wire it is up to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) to see whether he can come good with those amendments. Sections 7 and 88 of the Industrial Relations Act were alluded to, and the Opposition has made some commitment, as has the Minister, to deregulate the waterfront. The Inter-State Commission report makes very good reading. As the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) said today, overseas shipping in Australia is viewed as a war zone. Today on the waterfront one can get a job for 20 hours a week on good money with long overtime, five weeks paid leave and an annual leave loading of 25 per cent. Waterside workers are earning an average of $25 an hour-some earn more than $50-with generous employment conditions. I am sure that there are a few farmers-and a few politicians too-who would not mind those sorts of conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> I will have an opportunity during the committee stage to add further to my comments. To suggest that 45,000 farmers would be pitted against each other is a folly. It is not their way to go down that path. I support the amendments but I think that the legislation, as suggested, has been sloppily put together. There are 45 Government amendments, making approximately 90 amendments from both sides of the House. This great industry has been brought to its knees in some areas. Not only is the Government trying to pit farmers against each other, but it is trying to pit politicians against each other. As I have said, with the concessions that we have made we have been shown to be philosophically consistent and I hope that the Minister will offer Australia those same concessions when it comes to cleaning up the labour market and the waterfront. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wheat Marketing Bill and associated Bills before the House are very important. Also, this debate is very important because when all the necessary amendments have been made to this sloppy and poorly drafted legislation-we in the Liberal Party of Australia have about 41 amendments and the Government itself has the same or an even greater number-we will have provided for a significant change in the arrangements for the industry which, I am certain, will be of lasting benefit to wheat growers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation is also important because, with the Government having responded-and I stress this-to pressures from the Liberal-National Party Opposition in key re- spects, it is something of a landmark in so-called micro-economic reform; that is, the potential for significant advance in that micro reform area, as the jargon has it, is there. When we talk of micro-economic reform, we are talking about the freeing up of existing restrictions on the supply of goods and services, change to enable greater productivity and lower costs, the absolutely essential reform, the central, the indispensable, key for this country to work its way out of its yawning trade deficit and frightening overseas debt problems and go on to resumed rising living standards for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why this legislation is so important. It is all about deregulating-a word many fear, but, in simple terms, all about reducing restrictions on enterprise and efficiency and producers wanting to do things in the most productive way possible to everybody's benefit-for instance, not to have to send wheat to a port 100 kilometres away by rail; but at present it is regulated that it has to be sent by rail and possibly by a route up to twice the direct distance from the port, therefore costing much more. So it is about removing and reducing restrictions on enterprise and efficiency and producers wanting to do things in the most productive way-deregulating to a degree the domestic marketing of wheat, but also the transport, handling and storage of wheat. Indeed, if one of our amendments were to be passed, restrictive aspects of the conditions of people working in those areas of the activities of this great industry would be covered. </PARA>
<PARA> The central concern in the industry is what will happen to the domestic price of wheat under deregulation of the domestic wheat market. Given the limitation on time, I will not go over that matter again. It has been adequately dealt with by my colleagues. It has been widely canvassed. It is not a case of going back to the 1930s. The Australian Wheat Board remains in place, and its export power will remain unimpaired thanks to pressures from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> With feed wheat already deregulated, it is the remaining 60 per cent of the domestic market that we are talking about. As the export market takes 80 per cent of the production, if one works that out it is about 15 per cent of total production and the domestic price for that which is at issue. Indeed, while there will be some pressures for the price to fall perhaps nearer the average export level, there are important offsets. There are the possibilities of entrepreneurial activities of growers specialising in particular varieties of wheat-chemical varieties, for instance-and, of course, the benefits of greater competition and efficiency in the transport, handling and storage of wheat. I stress again that it was the stand of the Opposition in calling for the implementation of reforms in transport, handling and storage as one of the conditions for coalition support-the other main condition was that the Australian Wheat Board's export powers should not be changed, and we won on that too!-of the wheat legislation that forced the Government to extend the legislation in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to my starting point, this legislation is very important both in setting the parameters for the future of the wheat industry, including deregulating-that is officially; there is already a large measure in practice-the domestic market in wheat, and in encouraging significant change for greater competition and efficiency in the transport, handling and storage of wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of my remarks, it is reform in this so-called micro-economic area, the freeing up of restrictions on the supply of goods and services, change to enable greater productivity and lower costs, which is the central and indispensable key to this country working its way out of its yawning trade deficit and massive overseas debt problem. The agenda for reform is wide indeed. The central, indeed the first, item is reform of the rigid, inflexible and centralised wages and industrial relations system, further straitjacketed by the accord-and the `macro' benefits of which are debatable, and its micro, its efficiency, adverse effects are disastrous. The recent publicity about the problems in Qantas Airways Ltd in attracting and retaining engineering staff is just one of hundreds of examples one could cite. This agenda for so-called micro-economic reform also includes, related to that, the countering of the widespread incidence of restrictive work practices and it includes the key areas of the reform of the waterfront, coastal shipping, land transport and communications. It further includes privatisation for greater efficiency and growth and lower prices-like the crying need in Qantas but, of course, that is blackballed by the left wing of the Australian Labor Party. That is the sort of agenda of reform in this vital area. </PARA>
<PARA> A month ago we had the report of the Inter-State Commission on the waterfront which recommended changes to achieve economy-wide savings of the order of $620m and increased output of twice that to the benefit of the whole nation. It was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of 7 April that even before the report had been tabled in this Parliament, Mr Tas Bull of the Waterside Workers Federation and Mr Bill Kelty of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) had conferred by telephone and `agreed to reject the package of proposals outright'. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess that significant reform in this area sooner or later is going to involve taking on such as the Waterside Workers Federation, and even the ACTU itself apparently. For the Australian Labor Party, that would involve taking on its own essential constituency. That causes me to ask, as I have asked before, whether this Labor Government can or will ever seriously undertake the essential micro-economic reform to get this country back onto its economic feet. By the very nature of its constituency, it is not going to be on. What the Sydney Morning Herald described the other day as `the outlandish proposals' or, again, `the nonsense' trotted out by the Government's shipping reform task force, set up by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis), underscores the point. For significant micro-economic reform, the Australian people will simply have to change the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, this side of politics has to deal with its own constituencies. The wheat growers are just such a case in point. That position was not lost on Mr Tas Bull. At the time I referred to a moment ago, when some reports had it, wrongly, that the coalition was going to oppose the wheat legislation, that gentleman made a remark to the effect of quoting the then reported coalition attitude to wheat as some sort of justification for his summary rejection of the Inter-State Commission's proposals for the waterfront. But in fact the coalition is supporting this legislation, subject to a number of amendments it has previously referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, this legislation is very important-something of a landmark. It will free up the domestic market for wheat, to the longer term benefit, I firmly believe, of the great wheat industry and, in the context, provide potentially for a significant increase in competition and efficiency in the transport, handling and storage of wheat, again to the benefit of wheat growers-but also to the benefit of the entire Australian economy and nation. </PARA>

I particularly thank my colleagues on this side of the House, in particular, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Mildren), who addressed the whole question of rail transport. The debate on the wheat industry and the Wheat Marketing Bill and associated Bills, here in Parliament but mainly outside, has in the past year been marked by a lot of cant, hypocrisy and double standards. All that is bad in our political system has come to the surface.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The debate has been bitterly divisive for the Opposition. The princes of hypocrisy, the rural populists and farm socialists-that is, the National Party of Australia, led by a dinosaur-have fought for the status quo because their farmer boss, the Grains Council of Australia (GCA), has told them to. </PARA>
<PARA> The ideological deregulators, the Liberal Party of Australia, under weak leadership, have had to fight their lust for inaction in matters rural because of wider imperatives. It has been only the encouragement of some backbenchers that has given any credibility to the stand of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). One of the silliest comments made in the debate was that the Government's proposals were designed to cause trouble in the Opposition. One does not have to try very hard. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of the debate in the House has been about the export enhancement program (EEP) of the United States and the common agricultural policy (CAP) of the European Community (EC). Despite the protests of the US Administration and the grain farmer dominated views of the Congress and European parliaments, the EEP has seen the US share of the world wheat and flour market go up from 28.7 per cent in 1985-86 to an estimated 42.9 per cent in 1988-89, while at the same time the EC, against which the EEP is targeted, will have increased its share from 17.4 per cent to some 20 per cent. Australia's share has declined from 19.5 per cent to 11.3 per cent for the same period. The US likes to waste its taxpayers' funds, and the sort of people in the US that the National Party thinks it represents here just love it. </PARA>
<PARA> So at the outset let me state that it is because of the EEP, the CAP and the international conditions that the Australian Government is standing so firmly behind the Australian wheat industry. We are standing behind the whole industry with national interest cover on credit sales to the extent of $800m, which is a contingent liability. We are standing behind the whole industry with a government guarantee for the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) to finance the purchase of the crop and to enable the acquisition of the cheapest funds on world money markets. This has saved the industry hundreds of millions of dollars since 1984. We are standing behind the whole industry by not only enabling the AWB to pay a first advance of 90 per cent but also with an underwriting guarantee of 90 per cent of an estimate of the return from the season ahead, phasing down to 80 per cent in common with general government policy for other commodities. </PARA>
<PARA> We are standing behind the industry by now proposing a Government guarantee for the AWB to trade and market on the domestic market so that it can participate in the domestic feed wheat market without one arm tied behind its back to give growers more choice. We are standing behind the whole industry by maintaining the export monopoly, although I believe that my original proposition to allow the export of de-natured wheat by the trade posed no real threat to the monopoly. We are standing behind the wheat industry by giving it the capacity to levy itself to fund additional facilities such as marketing, financial and storage, as agreed between growers and the board. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are proposing is that the AWB be clothed with more powers then ever before and that the peak industry body, the Grains Council, have a larger role to play than ever before. We are standing behind the wheat industry by placing the AWB in the most powerful market position to catalyst change and savings in off-farm costs-to put more money in growers' pockets-and the growers will have more choice. Those that the National Party consider cannot make choices can do exactly what they have always done-grow the wheat, harvest it, tip it into a silo and take the pool price. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not often that I become involved in an ideological debate of the dimensions of this one. The strands in the debate relate to the ideologies of the Opposition political parties, the perceived self-interest or ideological views of various participants and some gutless State governments-principally Queensland. Putting aside the lies, libels and license of some, the main arguments have centred on the maintenance of the status quo, a bit each way, do not do as I do, do as I say-the classic position of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair)-genuine unashamed hypocrisy and distortion of State's rights and the Constitution. The positions put forward really demonstrate why we are crippling ourselves as a commodity exporting nation. Little in the debate has indicated an analysis of the wheat industry and the international situation throughout this decade. Little has indicated any thought about the changes under way in the grain growing and livestock sectors of Australia. Little has indicated that it is sensible to look at Australia's overall interest, producers, consumers, exporters and service providers. Very few people see any need for the application of consistent principles or any conceptual basis to policy or a vision of where we want the wheat industry and its infrastructure to go. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rare for a Minister to be in the same job for two wheat plans-and I had better concede at the outset that the Grains Council of Australia was a bit better to deal with in 1988-89 than the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation (AWF) was in 1983-84. Quite frankly, there was not as much Queensland National Party influence. My experience with the wheat industry goes back to the early 1950s as a buyer of wheat. Wheat was then worth a bit over one pound a bushel f.o.b. The administered stock feed price for wheat was eight shillings a bushel-so wheat was poked down the throats of chooks and we exported eggs. We did not export a high proportion of our crop and it mainly went to the mother country. We got away from that and reversed the stupidity by adopting a cost of production formula on the domestic market that almost strangled our domestic industries-and eventually we got away from that. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977-78 I worked in the Grains Marketing Section of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. So I thought I would see the AWF and the AWB to get some figures. I was bluntly told by an AWF spokesman that no figures were available, certainly not for the likes of me, that the Federation ran the Board and told the Government what to do, and, of course, the National Party Ministers always did as they were told. But eventually I got some figures and found out with hindsight that the Board had cost growers $150m on one deal alone-not that the growers ever knew anything about that. And a Japanese student of our grains industry drew to my attention the absolute nonsense of what was happening in grain marketing in general in Australia. Failed State boards are just one symptom of the nonsense that continues to this day. </PARA>
<PARA> Gradually the picture unfolded: a rail system that did not reward users as a result of efficiencies or occasional investment and one whose accountancy and work practices were Dickensian; a storage and handling system overbuilt by a factor of 3-some 43 to 45 million tonnes storage for a maximum 22 million tonnes crop-because of farmer control, and some indecision on where to place additional storage because of the blockages in the system, such as sidings being too short, but I will not go into it; and terminals crucified by demarcation disputes, hopeless management, thuggery and featherbedding. The whole system was creaking. Yet we had a marketing monopoly that never really marketed wheat but one which traded, with the United States setting the world price and where we could get some premiums because of freight and quality advantages. The growers never had to market their wheat; they had only to sell into a pool or sell on the black market-but perhaps then that was okay. </PARA>
<PARA> Running up the 1984 plan, the Wheatgrowers Federation wanted the status quo. Now the GCA wants the present status quo. The States wanted the status quo, and of course, the Senate only grudgingly let the Bill through. So we did not get the best-we got a bit better. We got commercial borrowing freedom, we got a permit system on the domestic market, and we got a more corporate, professional Board. The States would not move much on off-farm costs. Remuneration agreements were negotiated by the Board toughly, or there was a stand off. So I set up the royal commission in 1986 to expose the creaking system which, to be fair about it, was starting to be cleared up. </PARA>
<PARA> Why change is the cry. Let us look at the 1980s. The 1981 United States Farm Bill was predicated on high inflation and with the US Loan Rate in the early 80s underpinning the world price for wheat. When the price fell to a certain level US wheat went into stocks and the Canadians, EC and Australia expanded production. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 the United States started to reduce the loan rate. In 1984 the Government changed the underwriting formula because as then structured it could not be maintained without becoming a subsidy. As I said, I also put in a permit system for feed wheat to nail some of the black market trade and tried to get a more corporate Board to end the appointment of National Party hacks or favoured agripoliticians regardless of ability. In 1985, the US Farm Bill moved to keep the loan rate under the market price and thus the world price became more subject to price fluctuations. In 1985-86, with the influence of high United States stocks and the EEP and CAP export subsidies, the world price collapsed and was further corrupted by the use of the export subsidies. It was only the dollar float that saved the wheat industry. At that time; if one wants to talk about a farm crisis, it was very much a specialist cereals crisis. The EEP, despite US denials, may become a permanent feature of its highly administered system, like the EC stabiliser export subsidy system. There is another report out today from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics which shows the deficiencies in the EC system and what that means. The 90 per cent underwriting formula in this new plan will pay more than the old 95 per cent formula in the next year or two. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons I am putting forward deregulation of the domestic market is to develop marketing skills to better equip the AWB on the more volatile international market. Many speakers from the Opposition have not demonstrated that they understand how the international market works or the role played by buyers, sellers and other governments. The Opposition has not demonstrated that it understands what is changing on the domestic market. Even in Queensland the barley growers want a permit system. The Queensland cotton growers, by a majority of 94 per cent, want to market privately. Major advances in rail systems have been made in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria and there is even change under way in New South Wales. The Australian Wheat Board is offering new services and the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport has put an enormous focus on the way ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has other parts of the whole system-shipping and coastal trade-and the wharves on the agenda. But these things do not really affect the wheat industry as a bulk commodity all that much. What we have on the agenda is something that the Opposition, when in government, never bothered with. That is a problem of 60 to 80 years standing. It is one of the major reasons we are trying to help the wheat industry. Firstly, we are setting about enabling the Wheat Board to have enough power to catalyse change in storage, transport and handling to give farmers cost savings off-farm on an ongoing basis. In other words, we will use market forces rather than administered arrangements to keep the pressure on costs off-farm. Costs for some people are 35 per cent of their gross. </PARA>
<PARA> We are doing this to enable the Wheat Board to be more effectively and commercially involved in domestic trading, thus allowing it to compete with private firms and traders and provide additional services and choices to farmers; to enable the Wheat Board to be in a position to trade in other grains, so that it can assist growers where there are no statutory arrangements-there is a grain legume industry growing up-and to give the Wheat Board experience in the domestic market and to give it a more pro-active role in international grain marketing, where I believe we have missed opportunities; to enable general economic efficiency gains for the cropping sector as a whole; to allow the better development of additional domestic and export industries, agricultural industries and value adding or at least to remove some of the unreasonable costs for it. I would like to read in part a letter from a major food producer in Australia, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> At a time when we are expanding our usage of premium soft wheats, as a result of our major test market launch in the USA and growing sales to a wide range of overseas countries, it is particularly concerning that our ability to produce should be threatened by a statutory system which encourages the sale of scarce speciality wheats for stockfeed. This year we will waste $650,000 to bring wheat from Western Australia to replace premium soft wheats used for stockfeed. Obviously we will need to recover this amount in price increases. </PARA>
<PARA>The producer will probably lose the export markets it has gained. That is what is happening. We are doing this to give the growers more choice through the Wheat Board and to give growers more influence through the Grains Council of Australia. What the Government is doing accords with the advice that has been given to governments for many years. It accords with advice from at least three Industries Assistance Commission reports and the Opposition's own Balderstone Working Group to Provide a Policy Discussion Paper on Agriculture, which it chartered when it was in government. What the Government is doing accords with its general policies on statutory marketing authority reform, underwriting and the particular needs of the wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been listening to National Party of Australia members opposite. They do not have much capacity to make policy, only to be told what to do by farmer organisations. Every move I have made in agriculture has been opposed by the National Party unless the relevant farm organisation agreed. An awful lot of tick-tacking goes on. I was very pleased that unlike the dairy debate, people from the Grains Council were not sitting in the boxes advising the Government on its amendments, but that is what happened with the dairy matter. The Opposition in the Senate held up the dairy plan for a year and probably robbed itself of a lot of money, because it could have got a lot more advantage out of the value of the dollar for that extra year. But no-one now seriously disagrees with what I did. </PARA>
<PARA> We can go through the various industries-grapes or whichever one we can name-and if there is a bit of opposition we can almost count the number of days before the press release comes out. The National Party has a lot to answer for. Gunn and Vines fixed up the wool industry but look what they had to go through. The government of the day, to its credit, did respond, but unless we go through a bit of hell and put down all this rural populism, we never really get change. The rural press somehow thinks that the National Party has failed-peculiar articles are appearing-because it is not going to hold on to every aspect of the status quo. I would put it to some of these commentators that the National Party and the Liberal Party succeed when they are prepared to embrace reality and look to change that is in the farming industry's own interests. I have always said that we cannot take the Liberal Party seriously unless it takes agricultural policy more seriously. What has happened this time is that the old two card trick, with the Opposition saying one thing in the country and another thing in the cities, has been exposed. We have a lot of high cant on labour deregulation, and I will get on to that during our consideration of some of the amendments. Because we deregulate one part of the system to the advantage of an industry, does not mean we have to deregulate the world. I think the Leader of the National Party at one stage was suggesting that we had to break down the CAP. That is how nonsensical it got. If someone brought in a Bill to privatise Qantas Airways Ltd, would honourable members opposite be demanding that we privatise every government business enterprise? How are they going to handle that through the Cabinet and Ministers in government? It is nonsensical. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats had a hang-up about organic wheat, durum wheat and a few other things. When we explained that the new system would allow better arrangements for those people, they fell back to some other opposition. I ask honourable members to have a look at the States and the Australian Agricultural Council. They sit on their hands. I got all the arguments back, and they were a repetition of exactly the arguments I was getting from the Grains Council that week. At least the Grains Council is more flexible. It can move week to week, but the States never could. There is a lot of nonsense about. Now the State Ministers want to have a meeting. They were not prepared to look at the intrastate question the last time I put it to them because, as they explained to me privately-not at a meeting-`We are against this on first principles because the farmers tell us they are not going to accept it yet. We will have a look at that later if you get it through'. I think governments have to make policies. I do not think the environmentalists should make environmental policy. I do not think the trade union movement should make industrial relations policy. I do not think outside forces should make policies for governments or political parties. I believe that governments have to make policies, to weigh it all up, because we are in a very privileged position, with our Public Service, to look at the whole, and that is why we have governments. If farmers run all aspects of rural policy and farm policy, we will not get good policies. That is the view I have always taken. Consultation is another thing. Of course one must consult and adapt to reality. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, I think some elements of this debate have been pretty disappointing. I will try to address some of the other more substantial matters that have been raised as we get on to the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendment I have circulated, because of the form necessary, appears complicated, but in effect if carried would simply make the operation of this clause subject to a plebiscite of Australian wheat growers. I have moved this amendment without any optimism. I know from the attitude of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy that he does not want to listen to the industry. In fact, he rejected it in his last few remarks. He does not think the industry is capable of making the right decisions on its own behalf. I find this a rather strange attitude. We are talking about people who make large scale decisions about investment; decisions which concern their livelihood. They make those decisions on a day to day basis or on an annual basis. They are decisions which affect their whole life. They are taken against the great background of the industry, and they are taken on the basis of all the current knowledge that is available to the agricultural and grain growing industry. As I said, they are made with comprehensive planning in mind. Many operators in the grain industry also establish off-farm investments to sustain their activities during difficult times. Beyond all else, rural producers know that there is always something unknown in their future. Because of that they do not approve lightly changes which are put forward by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of special pleadings are made as to why the Australian Wheat Board should be stripped of its powers to fix an internal price. Some of those pleadings can be persuasive in isolation, but they are very much in isolation. Much of the success of the price structure in Australia is due, obviously, to the umbrella price fixed by the Board. As I have said, the overseas market, with its continuing curruption, does not give long term confidence to Australian wheat growers about overseas prices. They fear the introduction of those corrupted prices into the internal Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> Without repeating things that have been said previously, I believe that the orderly marketing of this industry began after much argument in the late 1940s and culminated in a vote with something like 64 per cent of grain growers approving the initial operation of the Australian Wheat Board. With the industry marketing having begun in that fashion, significant alterations should again be approved by growers. It is because of this belief that I have moved the amendment. As I said, I do not believe that the Minister will entertain it judging by the remarks that he has already made, but I want it to be known that there are a few people in this place who still regard the opinion of growers as important. We are willing to say to them, without any hypocrisy, that we believe in the good things that are said about them and in the modern technology used by the grain growing community. We believe growers are able to assess not only their individual financial position but also their position in the rest of the world, that they are aware of international politics and international price movements and that, because of this, they are capable of making decisions on their own behalf. If this amendment is carried it will establish the necessity to ask for the grain growers' approval before this legislation becomes law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many honourable members have referred to the messy nature of the Wheat Marketing Bill. It is significantly different from the Act and the issues are complex, as the Opposition has acknowledged. The Wheat Marketing Bill was drafted against tight deadlines, and there are a number of technical drafting amendments. A large number of the amendments have resulted from representations by the Grains Council of Australia and the Australian Wheat Board. The Bill was drafted in consultation with both these organisations. Even after it was finalised and tabled, both organisations came back to the Government and sought further changes. I think honourable members would agree that it is important that the technical aspects of the Bill are right. Consequently, the Government agreed to accept some of the proposals and any consequential amendments. Some of the amendments are very similar to those being proposed by the Opposition. To add to my embarrassment, late advice from the Attorney-General's Department is also responsible for some of the amendments including all those for the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Collections Bill to which I will be moving 17 amendments on behalf of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The aim of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) appears to be to hold up the legislation until there is a referendum of wheat growers on the provisions. This is a recipe for inaction and is against the interests of the wheat growers. There has been extensive consultation on these issues. As I said earlier, governments need to take decisions and act on them. The honourable member for Boothby has already argued that we should allow the States, in effect, to block the legislation, and now he wants to put it to a referendum. I do not think we can tolerate that sort of thing, so the Government rejects it. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also says that the Australian Wool Corporation fixes the price of wool, so why cannot we let the Wheat Board do the same thing for wheat. The Wool Corporation does not fix the price of wool; it fixes the reserve price. It uses the growers' funds to maintain a buffer stock and to manipulate that stock and price to try to get the maximum from the market. But eventually the market fixes the price. This legislation actually allows the Wheat Board to pay a levy in much the same way as the Wool Corporation has for many years. Again, the market will set the price for wheat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes this amendment. We will be opposing amendments that will be moved by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher). The amendments basically seek to reinstate the status quo-the compulsory acquisition system, the feed wheat permit system, the grower to buyer scheme and the administered price for the domestic market. It is contrary to the basic aims of the Wheat Marketing Bill. The accusation that I did not attend any grass roots meetings is incorrect. I went to a meeting of the Queensland Grain Growers Association in Caloundra. I realised after that meeting that they were the shock troops of the opposition to the proposals. When I faced that group of people with their own expressed ideology on choice and freedom, on markets and on deregulation, there seemed to be hardly any opposition. I think what the honourable member for Mallee is concerned about is one of the central things, the question of whether the domestic price will fall. We know that it will not fall in the next two years. We will not be able to measure it in the hand because if we get a cheque in the hand we do not know whether it is more or less at a certain point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The measurement is always very difficult, but let us just try to calculate this figure. This relates to about 15 per cent of the wheat crop-it might be less in a big year-sold domestically. The best calculation one can make is by looking backwards, with a bit of regression analysis: take an extreme condition, with no domestic wheat sales being made through the pool, with the whole lot being involved. The estimated potential losses to the pool have been estimated, and they range between 23c a tonne in 1987-88 to $2.93 a tonne in 1986-87-and that is the year when the world price collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is every chance that the domestic price of wheat will be above average export prices. No-one will sell below the pool price on the domestic market, unless they are crazy. No-one will be forced to pay for services any more that they never use. I keep on stressing the fact that the Australian Wheat Board will be clothed with more powers than it has ever had before. It will be a major force on the domestic market. It will use its expertise. It will have 80 per cent of crop in its hands before it starts. That is why we can catalyse savings off-farm. It can use that export grain and can be in a very powerful position. </PARA>
<PARA> It will use that marketing expertise and its knowledge to meet users' requirements on the domestic market to sell wheat locally to the best advantage to growers. Local millers and processors can be expected to pay a premium in order to secure the quality of wheat required-perhaps through forward sales. Those growers selling direct or through merchants will benefit from being able to avoid the pooling and bulk handling costs associated with the current grower to buyer scheme, and also from being able to organise storage and transport arrangements to suit both buyer and seller. That is why we oppose what the honourable member for Mallee is proposing. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Clause 3, page 2, lines 34 and 35, omit `by notice published in the Gazette', substitute `by regulation'. </PARA>
<PARA>The unexpected concern that this legislation has aroused in a very widespread manner around Australia is the use of the commerce power to override State marketing boards completely unrelated to the transport and handling of grain or the marketing of wheat. Part of that concern arises from the definition of `grain'. It is a very wide definition. I think that every possible grain that has ever been thought of is included in this definition, and in case any more need to be included there is the further option: `any product of the soil declared by the Minister, by notice published in the Gazette, to be grain for the purposes of this Act'. That provision will be somewhat Gilbertian if it is allowed to survive in that form. Consideration was given to changing that definition of `grain' to restrict it more appropriately. However, we recognise that we should not restrict the Australian Wheat Board's ability in relation not only to exports of wheat but to where it works in with other State marketing boards or other grains. Therefore, as a safeguard I think it is necessary to change the provision to stipulate that instead of a notice published in the Gazette the alteration should be done by regulation. Thus, everyone would know what the Minister was up to, and there would be the opportunity for Parliament to disallow the regulation. We will seek to amend the legislation in three other places to ensure that the Minister-or any Minister, for that matter-does not override the State marketing boards, which have been formed at the wish of the producers in those States and of those State governments, outside the use of the commerce power, to assist the Australian Wheat Board to improve the transport, storage and handling of grain and the marketing of wheat. </PARA>

<PARA> Objects of the Board</PARA>
<PARA> ``5. The Board shall perform its functions and exercise its powers:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) with the principal object of maximising the net return to Australian wheat growers from the marketing of wheat by securing, developing and maintaining markets for wheat and wheat products and by minimising costs as far as is practicable; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) in so far as it can do so consistently with paragraph (a), with the same object as is specified in paragraph (a) in respect of grain other than wheat.''. </PARA>
<PARA>As currently drafted in the Bill, the objects of the Board include the provision of a choice of marketing options to Australian wheat growers. My amendment affirms the primary object of the Board as maximising the net return to Australian wheat growers and, as far as is compatible, to the growers of other grains as defined in the Bill. This Parliament should not have to search for very long to see what has happened to the reputation of some sectors of the corporate sector and to question the establishment of massive monopoly marketing in this country. I am convinced that, after deregulation, there will be fewer grain merchants than presently exist, and this can no longer represent true competition without a multitude of buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> No one in this debate has shown that deregulation will improve net return to growers as distinct from benefits to buyers or traders. My colleague the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), in his usual well-balanced contribution to debate, spoke about the wheat issue-unlike most members in the House-but he could not convince me that the weakest seller, selling for whatever reasons at a low price when supply and demand are in imbalance on the domestic market, will not set that price. I also remind the honourable member that there is no prohibition on growers planting any varieties that are not approved at present. However, growers must expect that these varieties will be heavily discounted if their quality is poor and demand is not available. My colleague the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) well knows the chaos in table grape marketing without lack of quality, quarantine or inspection procedures. I ask the committee to support my amendment. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) Clause 5, page 4, line 15, omit ``wheat'' (first occurring), insert ``grain''. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments and the amendment moved by the Opposition are very similar. These amendments broaden and clarify the Australian Wheat Board's commercial operations to encompass activities involving grain as well as wheat. I would emphasise that this does not change existing marketing arrangements for other grains in the States. The primary objective of the Wheat Board is to look after interests of wheat growers, and any trading in other grains will be to assist the AWB's wheat marketing operation. As I have said, the Opposition has moved a similar amendment to broaden the scope of the AWB's objects to cover trading in other grains in the interests of all grain growers, not just wheat growers. This goes beyond the scope of the Act which deals with the Australian Wheat Board-not an overall grains corporation. Also, it should be borne in mind that the Wheat Board's commercial activities will be financed by wheat growers only. In these circumstances it would be inequitable to give it a charter to look after the interests of all grain growers. I think the Opposition is looking at the same position as the Government. There is some semanticism in this, but I would strongly adhere to the Government's amendments in this case. </PARA>

<PARA> (3) Clause 6, page 4, lines 20-31, omit paragraphs (1)(b) and (c), substitute the following paragraphs:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(b) to trade in wheat in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to make arrangements for the growing of wheat for the purposes of:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the export of wheat from Australia; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) trade and commerce in Australia;''. </PARA>
<PARA>Next to the initial move by the Government to weaken the Wheat Board's export power, the greatest concern is the chaos that this Government could inflict on the wheat industry and the wheatgrowers of Australia as from 1 July when the Wheat Board will be unable to trade intrastate. Some 80 per cent of the Wheat Board's domestic trading is intrastate. By the wording of this legislation, from 1 July it will actually be illegal for the Wheat Board to trade intrastate. This is in complete contradiction of the Minister's second reading speech in which, in several places, he claimed that the aim of the legislation is to strengthen the ability of the Wheat Board. The legislation does the direct opposite. This is an indictment of the Government and the Minister for misleading the wheatgrowers of this country and for months and months doing nothing about a situation which he and the Government knew was coming. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now well into May, and the only way that after 1 July the Wheat Board can really be allowed to trade successfully intrastate without the possibility of a legal challenge is for the States to pass complementary legislation. At this stage, not one State is prepared to pass complementary legislation. The South Australian Parliament has already risen. On Tuesday the relevant Minister, supposedly a friend of this Federal Labor Government, in the Victorian Parliament said that he would have a look at the situation when this legislation was finally passed in Canberra. By then, the Victorian Parliament will have risen. The Queensland Government rejects it. The New South Wales Government rejects it. So far, to my knowledge, the Western Australian Government has rejected it. What a hopeless situation. </PARA>
<PARA> What an indictment of a government that claims that it is helping the Wheat Board to be a more flexible intrastate marketer, to do this and to do that for the benefit of the wheat industry. It promises that the Board will be there as a stronger and more flexible safeguard for the wheat industry, to help the wheatgrowers of this country. Yet, with this legislation, it will be illegal for the Wheat Board to trade intrastate after 1 July. What a disastrous and treacherous situation for any government to impose on the wheatgrowers. It is in complete contradiction of what the Government promised for months and months. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I am concerned, there is only one way that we can endeavour to assist, and that is by moving this amendment to allow the Board to trade if it so desires-it may not wish to, because of the possible complications-until such time as there is some sort of court challenge from a trader or the Labor States are finally bludgeoned by this Government into passing the complementary legislation. This is one of the most significant problems that we have with this legislation. The wheat industry also has this problem with this legislation because of the Government's betrayal of that industry. Therefore, we will require a division on this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot accept this amendment. I commented on this in my response to the contribution to this debate by the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall). Basically, the Government will not buckle because the States are too thick. The States were not prepared to move on this matter in general terms when it was put before them at the Australian Agricultural Council. The amendment attempts to provide the Australian Wheat Board with powers to trade intrastate in the absence of complementary State legislation. We cannot say very clearly that there is any problem in the Wheat Board trading intrastate, but we think there is a legal matter that needs clearing up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no problem at all with the principle of ensuring that the Wheat Board has this power. The trouble is that the Opposition's amendment goes beyond the Commonwealth Government's constitutional power. The only way this issue can be solved is for the State governments to pass the necessary complementary legislation. All that legislation has now been sent to the States. If this legislation gets through the Senate-as I expect it will-I expect that the States will very quickly come to the party. The Grains Council of Australia is certainly one of the first organisations to put the pressure on the State governments to do just that. The creating of an additional clouded legal situation is not the answer since it puts the Wheat Board in an impossible situation. The Government cannot accept this amendment because it is not constitutional. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment seeks to restore the Australian Wheat Board's control of marketing of wheat interstate and in the Territories. As has already been pointed out by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), the shadow Minister for primary industry, this particular clause is a great failing of the legislation. Lack of genuine consultation has left the Australian Wheat Board in a totally exposed position. It is in a weak position at a time when it needs at least to trade effectively and competitively. The Minister has failed to meet the basic requirements of equal trading opportunities. The amendment is a consequential amendment. I seek the support of the committee. </PARA>

<PARA>We are told that it is part of the Government's policy to allow the Australian Wheat Board to trade more commercially, to allow it to be more flexible to make decisions itself. Yet time after time in the legislation there are quite unnecessary restrictions because of ministerial veto or for some other reason. These amendments relate to one of those reasons. In moving the amendments I want to make the point that if the Board is to be able to operate commercially then it may have to give preference to one State over another in relation to the growing of a particular type of wheat, a special pool or some other consideration where it is sensible for the grain growers of this country and for the Wheat Board, in the exercising of its correct commercial responsibilities and its responsibilities to maximise returns to wheat growers, to have a pool which could be said to give preference to one set of growers in one State over another. If one argues that we do need some way to check what is happening, we have the Audit Act and we have the general provisions of the Australian Constitution. I think it is absurd that there is the type of restriction when at the same time the Government is saying that it wants the Board to be more commercial. </PARA>

If the Commonwealth is to be serious in seeking deregulation of storage, handling and transport of grain it needs to have in reserve the broad power in respect of marketing to ensure the States do not try to circumvent its intentions through the extension of compulsory marketing arrangements.

It is our belief that there are other areas where a government can require a board to undertake certain action which could cause a loss or a less than maximising of returns to growers.

<PARA> (13) Clause 15, page 10, line 16, after ``members'' add ``5 of whom shall be wheat growers''. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments relate to the membership of the Australian Wheat Board. There are two membership provisions which are of great importance to the wheat growers of this country. Both provisions have been very much an integral part of the Wheat Board until this legislation was introduced. The first amendment concerns the Chairperson. It has been to the advantage of the wheat industry, because of the nature of its operations and of its overseas sales, that the Chairperson of the Board should be a wheat grower at the time of his or her appointment. This requirement has served the industry well. The industry sees good reason for that to continue. I believe that it is sensible for it to continue and it forms part of my amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendment concerns the membership of the Board. There are eight members nominated by a selection committee and the Grains Council provides the membership of that selection committee. At present the legislation requires that five members be wheat growers, one from each of the five wheat growing States. The Opposition does not intend to persist with this requirement that the five grower members be from each of the five wheat growing States because if that is a high priority of the wheat growers of this country, they have the ability, with five out of the eight members, to determine that in relation to the selection of those nominated members. However, the Opposition believes that it is important that five out of the eight Board members be wheat growers. The Wheat Board deals with a product which remains basically as wheat-it is not processed or transformed into some other product. There is no requirement other than to have skills in finance and marketing as well as wheat growing-certainly not some of the other skills needed by some statutory marketing authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that it is important that the current system of membership of the Board which has proven to be successful should continue; hence, the amendments standing in my name that the Chairperson be a wheat grower at the time of appointment and that five out of the eight nominated members be wheat growers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the amendments proposed by the Opposition. I do this as a wheat grower. I spoke on this legislation last night. I point out again to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that this is the most regulated concept in this legislation. The clause allows the Minister to be all powerful. The Minister appoints the chairman and the deputy chairman of the selection committee. There is nothing in this legislation to say that one single wheat grower is eligible to be a member of the Australian Wheat Board once this legislation becomes law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Growers are being asked to contribute a levy of 5 per cent of our gross proceeds. Up to $50m a year will be creamed off our gross proceeds as producers. The Wheat Board has the cooperation of the 45,000 odd wheat growers in Australia, yet it is not clear in this legislation that the Chairman should be a wheat grower. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) made it clear in relation to subclause (a) that we should get from the Minister a definition that the Chairman should be a wheat grower. Certainly, the eight people appointed by the selection committee should be wheat growers. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this legislation the Minister has the power to reject any person who is put forward for membership. Members must retire at the age of 65 and they serve for a term of three years. I wonder why parliamentarians do not have to retire at 65? Under this legislation, if a person is over 65 he cannot be a member of the Australian Wheat Board; likewise, a member of the Grains Council Executive cannot be a member of the Australian Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very disappointed that the Opposition is not supporting this aspect more strongly than it did last time. Two years ago the Opposition stopped the Government introducing legislation of this sort. The Democrats and the Liberal and National parties forced the Government to have representation from each State. The Board is now made up of a grower representative from each State-five of them. As a grower I feel very strongly that this position should remain, considering the fact that growers are having more financial responsibility to support the Board foisted upon them in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I put forward the reasons why the Government cannot accept this in the concluding part of my second reading speech. The Government believes that with respect to statutory marketing authorities, where possible it should try to establish consistent principles. Once that is done the special features of a particular industry can be taken into account. I do not think it is appropriate to include in the legislation a provision with respect to the Chairperson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have made the commitment in my second reading speech to appoint a chairperson who is a grower. In terms of interpretation before the courts, that has the power of law. I merely want to maintain consistency. As the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) said, any attempt to provide consistency was rolled in the Senate last time. As a result, I think we got a less capable Board in some ways than we may have done. Where we have applied these principles to authorities such as the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and other statutory marketing authorities where the growers, the levy payers, have the whip hand, we have quite successful boards. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the honourable member for Maranoa, I trust the Grains Council. In relation to the Opposition's second amendment, if the Grains Council, which will have a majority on the selection committee, finds two or three outstanding people in one State while in another State there are no outstanding people, I trust it to make the decision and to have that flexibility. The Board needs to be comprised of the best people available with a balance of production, marketing and finance skills. If one cannot get five growers who have a mixture of skills State by State from an industry which has 45,000 growers, I think that the wheat industry would be in a pretty desperate situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board needs to have this expertise because it has to do a very important job. I am trying to establish boards which are based on expertise, using the best people available-not, as I said, favoured agripoliticians. I believe that the Grains Council can settle some of the industry's politics and let the Board get on with the job by appointing the best people to it.

<PARA>The amendments relate to the ability of the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) to pay the market rate for its employees. Under legislation at present the Board is restricted in its ability to pay for employees because it is not allowed to have any employee paid more than the chief executive, the chairman or the managing director. The AWB is a major borrower and a major user of foreign currency; in fact, it is one of the major operators in Australia in respect of foreign currency. So one has only to look at the restrictions that are inherent in this legislation and then at the going price for a financial director, money market operators or employees who are essential to the Board and the well-being of wheat growers who supply the Board to realise that it is absurd that there should be such a restriction. If the Government is sincere in its claim that it wants the Board to be more commercial, as I said, it is absurd to say, on the one hand, that it wants the Board to be commercial and then, on the other hand, to unduly restrict it in this way in such an important and sensitive area. I ask the Government to seriously consider these amendments because I believe that they are of considerable importance for the better management and operation of the Board. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendments, which I think are eminently sensible. This sort of flexibility should be given to the remuneration packages available to the Australian Wheat Board when it sets the salary levels and so on for employees. I hope that the Government will agree to these amendments, because the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has put forward one example and I dare say that over the years the Board will face similar situations from time to time where it may have to pay additional amounts to gain the services of people with the necessary skills to carry out some of the functions for what is going to be one of Australia's major corporations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To pick up a phrase from the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), I hope that the Government will agree to these amendments, too, but there are wider things to consider. I take the view very strongly that the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) is probably Australia's second biggest exporter, but there are general matters that a government must take into account. The Grains Council of Australia argues that this provision is not in the current Act and therefore precludes the Wheat Board from paying an employee more than the chief executive receives. It is true that this is a new provision in the legislation but, as I said, it reflects Government policy. The provision is not onerous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As it stands, clause 44 provides scope for the Board to engage a managing director as chief executive and pay him or her market rates, provided the chairperson is appointed on a non-executive basis. It would be on only rare occasions that the Board would wish to engage someone-for example, a finance or market expert-on a higher salary than the managing director, and it would be able to do this through its power to contract for consultancy services. Because of my strong feelings on this, I undertake to have this provision looked at again in the Senate by amending clause 44 (3) along the lines of the Dairy Produce Act, which provides for employees to be paid on terms and conditions more favourable than the managing director, with the approval of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand what the Opposition is getting at here. It is a matter that I have been grappling with for quite a long time but, as I have said, the Government has broader matters to consider in this area, and at this stage it cannot accept the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA> (16) Clause 48, page 23, line 23, before ``Act'' insert ``or any other''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment relates to equal opportunity. It seeks to amend clause 48 to read:</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing in this or any other Act requires anyone to do anything incompatible with the principle that employment matters should be dealt with on the basis of merit. </PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that in this and other legislation which deal with government statutory marketing authorities, there is now a more sensible approach to equal opportunity. Nobody in the wheat industry, on the Wheat Board, or in the Opposition is opposed to that. But we are concerned that other legislation may override the merit principle. Hence, we have proposed this amendment. </PARA>

As the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) readily concedes, with the statutory selection committee process now in being, if women put themselves forward and are judged to have sufficient expertise, this whole problem of token women and some of the fears of people who do not understand what equal opportunity really means will be easily assuaged.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This amendment proposes the insertion of a new division in the Bill comprising a number of new clauses designed to restore the Wheat Board's compulsory acquisition powers in respect of the Australian domestic wheat market. Clause 56a provides for the appointment of State corporations or bodies corporate contracted for wheat storage and handling to be appointed to receive wheat on behalf of the Board. Clauses 56b and 56c relate to the delivery of wheat to the Board. Clause 56d provides that the Act does not apply to seed wheat or wheat that does not satisfy the Board's classification standards. Clauses 56e and 56f provide for the issue of permits in certain circumstances, while clause 56g provides for contracts for sale of wheat to be entered into on behalf of the Board. Clause 56h prohibits unauthorised wheat sales. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been an interesting debate. Almost everyone who has spoken has been a wheat lumper, a bag sewer, a truck driver or a wheat grower. I recently took the opportunity to read many of the previous debates on former wheat plans in the industry. I discovered that nothing has changed, only the players. Orderly marketing does not inhibit innovation by growers in the type of wheat produced. It is the commercial worth of the wheat variety so produced that is the barrier or stimulus to innovation. Orderly marketing provides equity and stability. It provides the same price for the same quality grain irrespective of geographical location and, importantly, does not encourage inefficiencies. A farmer's own skills and productive capacities are still paramount to his success. Downstream processors are not disadvantaged or their development inhibited by the current wheat pricing and marketing arrangements. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics strongly supports this position.</PARA>
<PARA> Wheat growers should not be expected to subsidise the international competitiveness of downsteam user industries. Therefore there is a need in the debate on this legislation to distinguish between and separate out marketing competition from storage, handling and transport competition, which I totally agree with. Competition in marketing has the guarantee of reduced grower returns, while competition in storage, transport and handling produces at this time only a speculative gain for growers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's commitment to this is acknowledged, but the results are all in the future and must be challenged, given that the Australian Wheat Board in this Bill does not have the capacity to compete fully on a level playing field. I put before this chamber that none of the debate has shown that de- regulation will improve net returns to growers as distinct from benefits to buyers or traders. The Minister acknowledges that in his second reading speech. If deregulation did open up the domestic distribution system, I am convinced that any lower storage, handling and transport costs for domestic sales would flow to intermediaries and domestic end user buyers. As the Australian Wheat Board has estimated, farm gate return would be the net of the export component, storage, handling and transport costs, keeping in mind that grain can go to either domestic or export markets. The domestic buyer therefore has to pay only marginally above the Australian Wheat Board's reference price to compete, and he pockets any savings. A sole seller operating for growers and not shareholders, given the flexibility of clauses of this Bill, will allow the purchase of services from different providers and so influence costs and pass these on to the growers.</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot support the changes that will reduce net returns. As I have already said, the Minister has acknowledged that the only argument is about the amount. He has also acknowledged that this amount is very much dependent on the savings that may be achieved in the future with transport, handling and storage. Changes are made here without any guarantees of reductions in storage, handling and transport costs. I believe that the wheat growers face the worst possible scenario. I ask that the chamber support this important amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in supporting this amendment. We will, of course, be calling a division on it. It is a great disappointment to me that so many members of the chamber are not supporting their constituents and the wheat growers of this nation. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) knows from meetings and from the Grains Council of Australia itself that it does not oppose many of the clauses in this Bill. It is important to understand that. I ask the Minister to withdraw this legislation and to start again. The fact that he has to put up 45 amendments tonight and that he seems to be accepting every second one that we are putting up, indicates to the growers of this country that he and his Department of Primary Industries and Energy have made a shonky, shocking job of preparing the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Vice-President of the United States of America has only just visited us. He left our shores only three or four days ago with all sorts of promises about not subsidising wheat. Yet yesterday we saw an announcement of a sale to Russia. Russia is only one of the markets that we sell to. We sell throughout the world, but obviously Europe and the United States will continue to subsidise our markets heavily through cash. I have held talks with the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, Clinton Condon, who was a constituent of mine. He grew up with me in the small wheat growing centre of Dalby in my electorate of Maranoa. He certainly is not in agreement with a lot of this legislation. Today the card price for Australian wheat is $US183 which converts to $A229. The card price relates to the Australian standard white quality wheat, the standard wheat we produce in Australia. It is not the best wheat; it is not the worst. It is an average standard quality. The average price for this wheat will be used in the so-called deregulated market. There is no such thing as a deregulated market. It is a lot of hogwash. There is nothing deregulated in business these days. There never was and never will be.</PARA>
<PARA> I guess Mr Peter Fisher and I cannot agree with the position the Government is taking. I believe that the legislation ought to be withdrawn in protest at the United States Government's intention to continue to subsidise. The legislation ought to be brought back into this House with some sort of support for the locally, domestically consumed wheat. I believe we ought to be able to trade our feed wheat as freely as possible. That is the only way we will be able to support the price locally for grain. I include the word `grain' because it is being included in many amendments to the wheat legislation. The word `grain' is being used in many clauses. It is quite obvious that this legislation will cover all grains, not just wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important to understand this industry. People compare it with the wool industry and other industries that have support prices. Growers were forced to come together as a cooperative many years ago and establish their own selling organisation. That is what the Board is; the growers own the Board, not the Government. The Government does not put a red cent into it. In actual fact, the Government put $12m a year into the Australian Wheat Board which is worth about $3 billion a year in export income. This big-hearted Government is withdrawing the support it paid last year. Poor Peter Walsh whinges and cries in Cabinet that he had to spend a lousy $175m in an industry that is earning and trying to put the balance of payments of this nation in some sort of perspective. Of course, without wheat, instead of us being $1 1/2 billion down the drain each month we would be $3 billion down the drain each month. </PARA>
<PARA> Wheat is a very important commodity for the total economic well-being of all Australians, not just the wheat growers of this nation. It is interesting to see the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) here. I know he is going to sleep because of what I have to say. Of course, the honourable member for Wills is listening intently to what we on this side of the House have to say. It is good to see him in the House occasionally. It is not often that he makes the effort to get here. I do not know what is grown in his electorate; it is probably carrots. Was he born a wheat-lumper? Was he born at Bordertown and did he lump wheat most of his life? I can imagine!</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill should be withdrawn and it ought to be re-introduced with some sort of support price arrangement. I do not mind if the growers have to pay it. I am supportive of applying a levy. I have argued this way for a number of years. We ought to pay a levy. I would like to ask the Minister whether the levy is tax free. I have contacted the Department on a number of occasions and am yet to find out whether it is tax free. The Department did not know and the Minister's office did not know. But as a wheat grower and as someone who pays taxes occasionally, and large lumps of it, I am very interested to know. If it is tax free, the setting up of a levy like this is a benefit in my mind to the industry because if we build up a fund where we can help pay our first payment we should also under this legislation be allowed to use this money as a support for our domestic price. </PARA>
<PARA> What people do not understand is that the reason why the Wheat Board was established was that wheat happens to be stripped all at once. It does not come off every week, every month or every six months. Cattle are held in the paddock and there is a steady flow of beef to the market. There is also a steady flow of wool to the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately for wheat growers, if the sun happens to move from north to south fairly rapidly the headers rush from north to south and the crop is ripped off in about two months. All of a sudden there are 1,800 million tonnes of grain for sale. The whole of the domestic wheat requirement is dumped on the market at once, and this is what forces the price down. After the wheat industry is deregulated other grains industries will suffer because presently the price of wheat, which is held up with the support price, is the price for all grains that are traded in this country. That includes sorghum which in Queensland is traded nearly as much as wheat. A lot of sorghum is grown in Queensland. Some of it is sold on the open market and some of it is sold through a board arrangement. The domestic price of wheat controls the price of barley, oats, sunflower, sorghum, et cetera. Wheat is the grain produced most. It affects the price of all grains that we sell. Once we deregulate it, our price will become the card price for export. With the heavily subsidised world market it is obvious that the price of wheat which is consumed locally will drop substantially. No-one can convince me otherwise. If growers are prepared to put a levy on wheat, as the Government is forcing us to do, to the tune of $50m a year, we ought to be able to introduce our own support price and so help control the price of domestic wheat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is obvious from the remarks made by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) that he has not listened to anything I have said. Obviously he believes in his own rhetoric. It is a pity the growers in his electorate believe it, too. He says that the majority of farmers are not supporting me. If I waited for the majority of farmers to support me I would never change anything. I was delighted to see in one poll that 41 per cent of farmers supported what I was doing in the wheat market. I could not believe that-I still do not believe it-but there you go. The levy will not be forced. It is tax free on the way in; the tax is paid when it is rolled out. That is what happens with wool. The honourable member is trying to get back to subsidies and to continue the domestic arrangement. We have to keep putting forward the belief that we cannot support 80 to 85 per cent of wheat production by fixing prices for 15 to 20 per cent of it. I think the honourable member for Maranoa is beyond persuasion, redemption, or even salvation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will address the more substantive comments made by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher). He argues that market deregulation should be removed from the wheat legislation, now that the Government has taken steps to override State regulations which prevent cost savings in handling and transport being achieved. I reflect on a constant theme through speeches made by Opposition members in the second reading debate. They said that the Liberals had forced us in this whole question of transport and marketing. The timing of our decision on that was not forced. We got the advice on 30 August 1988. It was a question of working out when to exercise those powers if the States were not going to cooperate. </PARA>
<PARA> The approach of the honourable member for Mallee on this issue is much too simplified. Storage, handling and transport are integral parts of the overall wheat marketing process and changes in one area will inevitably affect other areas. There are benefits that arise from the deregulation of the domestic wheat market quite apart from those associated with grain storage and distribution. For example, there is a greater degree of choice for growers in disposing of wheat and there is the potential for local buyers and sellers to avoid the unnecessary costs associated with the pooling of revenues and costs which apply under existing grower to buyer arrangements. The organic wheat growers and the durum wheat growers pose a problem, as I pointed out, for a major food processor in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage Handling and Transport was of the view that potential resource cost savings can largely be realised under current marketing arrangements providing deregulation of transport, storage and handling costs occurs. It is also recognised that marketing reform may inject additional competitive pressures into the market environment for storage, handling and transport. The deregulation of the domestic wheat market can see the emergence of a range of new storage, handling and transport options, an increase in direct grower to end user sales, an increase in the use of on-farm storage as growers develop their own marketing strategies, the expansion in the activities of the private storage and handling agencies, and the extensions of the services provided by existing bulk handling agencies to meet the needs of private traders, millers and growers. In addition, deregulation of domestic marketing will allow downstream processors of gluten, starch and glucose to purchase wheat at market prices. That will inevitably enable an expansion of wheat sales on the domestic market. It will enable them to supply local users more cheaply and to compete more effectively with other supplies in very competitive export markets for such products as gluten and bakery pre-mixes. As honourable members know, Australia is a major gluten exporter competing directly with the European Economic Community on international markets. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on, but we do have problems with the present system where costs are paid where they are not actually incurred. Any corporation which holds a monopoly over its outputs while it purchases inputs in a competitive and deregulated system is in a very favourable position. I think it is inconsistent for the honourable member for Mallee to seek deregulations in industries which supply handling and distribution services while opposing deregulation of marketing services which will produce cost savings for growers and users, especially when wheat alone amongst all exporters retains a privilege of a total export monopoly covering 80 to 85 per cent of the crop. Finally, many growers support deregulation in the domestic market and by extensive use of the parliamentary system have shown that they wish to have the option to sell wheat direct to users. They cannot be conned; they are not fools. The Government opposes the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA>(17) Clause 57, page 26, line 15, omit ``Penalty: $100,000'', substitute ``Penalty: $100,000, or an amount equal to the percentage of the market value of the quantity of wheat as is prescribed by regulation, whichever is the greater.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The present penalty in the legislation for the illegal export of wheat is $100,000. That is clearly inadequate. The Government has recognised this, as has the Opposition, by the amendment the Government will be moving. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to give a simple example of how inadequate the present penalty is. One could have a shipload of wheat of 80,000 tonnes. Even with a $10 per tonne profit, which is not a huge profit, one would have a total profit of $800,000. With a $100,000 penalty, one would still have a profit of $700,000. I make this point to the Government because its amendment proposes that the penalty be lifted to $300,000. Even with the example I have given, it still will not be an adequate deterrent to someone illegally exporting wheat. I strongly suggest to the Government that it give favourable consideration to our amendment, which gives the Board the flexibility to prescribe a percentage, so that it is made very clear that anyone who attempts to illegally export wheat will not profit from that illegal export. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and reiterate what he said. While we welcome the fact that the Government will move amendments that stiffen up the penalties-they not only increase the financial penalties but also make illegal export an indictable offence-I still think that the penalty could, on some occasions, be insufficient. As the honourable member for Murray has pointed out, a ship carrying 80,000 tonnes of wheat would pay less than $4 a tonne penalty if it were illegal wheat. For someone who could make a reasonable profit on the wheat, that may be seen as a reasonable penalty to continue that practice. I urge the Government to have another look at this question of penalties because I still think they are inadequate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), indicated, Government amendment No. 13 covers the Opposition's concern. The only reason why we cannot accept this amendment is that the Attorney-General's advice is that ad valorem penalties are not generally employed. There could be difficulties in the establishment of the value of the goods in respect of which the offence occurred. Furthermore, if the value is small the penalty may be too small in relation to the offence. The Government amendment makes it clear that any breach of this provision is an indictable offence and prescribes the maximum available penalty of $60,000 for an individual and $300,000 for a corporation. The Government cannot accept this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (a) the Board has given its written consent to the export of the wheat; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the export of the wheat is in accordance with the terms of that consent. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment principally clarifies the penalties for contravention of the Australian Wheat Board's export monopoly for wheat. It makes it clear that such an offence is an indictable offence and provides for an updating of the penalties in line with the amendments that the Government will be including in the forthcoming Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill. As I said, this should meet the Opposition's legitimate concerns regarding penalties. </PARA>

<PARA>Non-application of Trade Practices Act 1974 to pools</PARA>
<PARA> ``61a. The provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 do not apply to purchases of wheat by the Board under section 60 or to pools for the marketing of wheat established by the Board under section 61.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment relates to the exemption from the Trades Practices Act of that part of the Australian Wheat Board's domestic trading activities concerning the use of the pool for such domestic trade. The majority of the Wheat Board's domestic trading will be done by a subsidiary company which will be subject to the Trade Practices Act and all the other requirements of company law and ordinary commercial law in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Wheat Board is required by another proposed section of this legislation to purchase all wheat offered to it and the pool will be the basis for acceptance of that grain. As I said, almost all of it will be for export purposes. When the pool buys grain into the pool there is no certain knowledge as to the ultimate sale of that wheat from the pool. There will be a number of times when it will be very sensible from the point of view of both the Board and the customers for wheat to be sold from the pool domestically. The problem is that under the Trade Practices Act the dominant trading position of the Board's pool could be challenged, thereby preventing the Board from trading interstate domestically. This is a sensible amendment which clarifies the situation so that the Board is free to exercise the different options available to it for domestic trading using the pool. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not understand the technicalities of the matter raised by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). I will give the matter he raises consideration after discussions with officials and the Australian Wheat Board (AWB). The Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Lloyd) proposes in his amendment specifically to exempt the Wheat Board's pooling activity from the Trade Practices Act. Our advice from the Attorney-General's Department is that such a specific exemption is not required. The Bill provides clear authority for the Wheat Board to operate pools and therefore such operations are automatically authorised under section 51 of the Trade Practices Act, which provides for specific exemptions for the activities of statutory marketing authorities. The Wheat Board would be expected to operate in such a way as not to misuse its market power. I made that point in the second reading speech. The proposed amendment would be unlikely to achieve anything by way of protection for the AWB in the event of a challenge under the Trade Practices Act. The Government cannot accept the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The amendments concern the requirements in the legislation for the Australian Wheat Board to take certain action in the termination of a pool, the requirements for final payment. This is incongruous because it contradicts the principles that the Government is supposed to be acting under in relation to the Board being made more commercial and having more commercial ability to make the decisions itself. I happen to supply a different commodity. The directors of that particular company indicate, sometimes well ahead, that they will be making a certain final payment, but they have the right, and I think the commercial right, to determine when that payment will be made and the form in which it will be made. I believe the Wheat Board should have that same right if it is to be allowed to act, as the Government says it wants it to act, in a completely commercial manner. I believe that these particular clauses should be deleted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an amendment which the Grains Council of Australia and the Australian Wheat Board are seeking.

Some growers will still have no alternative but to deliver to the Board.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (35) Clause 78, page 38, lines 27-32, omit subclause (14), substitute the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(14) The appropriate percentage, for all seasons commencing on or after 1 July 1989, is 95%.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This is one of the most significant aspects of the legislation and also one of its major weaknesses. At present, the Government guarantee is for 95 per cent based on a three-year average. The Opposition accepts that there are advantages in changing that calculation from a three-year average to the current year, but it strongly opposes the initial reduction from the present 95 per cent to 90 per cent phasing down to 80 per cent over five years and having a 1993 sunset clause. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement of the Government to actually pay out any of this guarantee on a single year basis is non-existent. In fact, as the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) indicated earlier tonight, on the calculation for each single year basis in only one year would there have been a requirement for the Government to make up the guarantee, and that was 1980-81. That was before the Board had the ability to hedge. Since then, even with the very bad year of 1986-87, when under the current arrangement there was the requirement for the Government to provide ultimately about $220m, there would have been no requirement for the Government to contribute on this new basis. However, by having an underwriting of 95 per cent it materially assists the Board to borrow-and borrow favourably-so that wheat growers can receive a better initial payment and it generally assists the industry at no cost to the Government. I believe that this is a very unfair and mean provision inserted by the Government and it is one about which the Opposition feels very strongly. We will divide on this issue to indicate our strong opposition to what we consider to be most unfair treatment of the wheat industry. </PARA>

Subclause 13 provides that when determining the figure the Minister shall have due regard to information given by the Board or the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. I ask the Minister whether he would be prepared to disclose to the Parliament that information. Furthermore, I ask the Minister whether he is prepared to give an undertaking to the Parliament to provide information about the basis of any pool estimates that would lead from that, and things such as relevant futures prices, exchange rate forecasts and that type of thing which would form the basis of the Government's estimate of the expected price so that it could set its level of underwriting.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out to the House that, while I support entirely the amendment moved by the Opposition, it is not the preferred position of the Australian wheat growers. A 95 per cent three-year moving average would allow more effective support during a severe downturn in the industry. It would also remove from the Minister some of his capacity to direct any instructions to the Australian Wheat Board in line with political considerations. The previous arrangements allowed for adequate market signals to the industry and no more evidence of this is needed than the major change to production that has taken place over the past two seasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the underwriting scheme has operated exactly as it was intended. However, the minister's commitment to stand behind the industry will be of little value given the proposal to reduce the level of underwriting. Underwriting is intended to ensure and guarantee the borrowings of the Australian Wheat Board at the lowest possible cost in order to commit a high advance payment to growers on delivery of the crop. It is intended to cushion the effect of a significant collapse of international prices and to help retain resources in the industry while not making long term signals. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also intended that it will be triggered only in exceptional circumstances but that there will be automatic Government support in a crisis. The Grains Council of Australia considers that the existing scheme has operated exactly as was intended, having been triggered, as the shadow Minister mentioned, on only one occasion and that was in 1986-87. This, as has been pointed out already, follows the aggressive use of the export enhancement program by the United States of America. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, in the May economic statement, agreed to stand behind the industry in the event of an extraordinary downward price movement, while expecting the industry to shoulder an increasing share of the price risk itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to the industry, in 1986-87, of overseas subsidy activity was estimated in the Industries Assistance Commission report at about $420m. Given that the underwriting payments incurred by the Commonwealth in that year in which the gross national product was breached are estimated at around $200m-of which approximately $60m, it will be remembered, was interest-the industry, I believe, has already borne a considerable burden. Where downturns in the market, as a consequence of foreign subsidies, are not so dramatic, the industry simply absorbs the full price impact. I believe that underwriting to the 95 per cent level, with a moving average, and at least in line with the amendment proposed by the Opposition, is necessary to reduce uncertainty and to maintain investment and production in the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this amendment. Let me, in doing so, ask the Minister, who has been on about the wheat industry costing taxpayers' money, to point out where this is so, other than in the case of the dollar-for-dollar subsidy for research and development-a cost of $12m a year in an industry worth roughly $3 billion a year. I would argue that the industry more than covers itself by the amount of taxation it pays to offset some of those funds that it receives for research in ongoing years. Of course, that is an advantage to the taxpayer who gets more money back in the longer term. Growers are disappointed that the percentage is being dropped from 90 per cent to 80 per cent over a period of five years, during which time the grower levy is being introduced. There does not seem to be anything in the legislation covering who is going to pay the levy in the domestic market. I have contacted the Minister's Department and I have been told that the purchaser will be licensed, but I have not seen in the legislation anything to suggest who is going to pay this levy and how it is going to be collected. I suggest that a fairly large black market will develop: people, like pig producers and chook producers-like the Minister himself-will not pay this levy because the Government will be able to keep tabs only on the larger purchasers, who will contribute up to 5 per cent, a maximum of 5 per cent-that the Government, in this legislation, is imposing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important for growers and for the Board to have the highest possible guarantee by Government. It costs Government nothing to give the guarantee to borrow funds. It could be argued, perhaps, that the saving is a taxpayers' subsidy, but it still costs the Government nothing. Indirectly, of course, without it there would be a great cost in interest. There is a saving between 0.5 per cent and one per cent in interest borrowings, either locally or overseas. The overall average of the Board's borrowings is about 11 per cent. The local average, of course, is 15 per cent-much higher than the cost of borrowing overseas-but the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board tells me that that is the sort of saving that is involved. Of course, it is a considerable saving. I should have thought that the Minister and his supporters, as so-called deregulators, would be as keen as mustard to give the growers as high a percentage as possible to save some funds in this economic situation, in which the cost of borrowing money is horrific. Indeed, interest is one of the growers' biggest costs. I support the amendment. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a pretty foul comment! I have never been on about the wheat industry costing the taxpayers money. The underwriting did exactly what it was intended to do: there was a complete potholing in the market and the underwriting scheme triggered the situation. Although no-one thought that that would happen, as honourable members know the wheat price collapsed under the impact of the export enhancement program, the common agricultural policy, and all the rest of it-high stocks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first advance, of course, is the most important thing for wheat growers. What we are giving by way of guarantee will allow the Australian Wheat Board to maintain a high first advance. The Government guarantee and the absolute level of underwriting, of course, is what enables the Wheat Board to borrow so well on international money markets, and an 80 per cent underwriting certainly gives the Board that capacity with a government guarantee. The reason why we cannot accept this is basically that Government's policy is to phase underwriting down, consistent with the broader policy of reducing government involvement in statutory marketing, whereby industry is taking greater responsibility for its own risk management, and greater commercialisation of the Board. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be remembered, of course, that the level is initially 90 per cent, phasing down to 80 per cent. The reduction in level is, therefore, very gradual. Even with underwriting at 80 per cent, the wheat industry is very favourably compared with other industries. Provision is also made for the industry to fund advances in excess of the underwritten level. I understand that the industry is not disposed to do this, and no-one is going to force it to do so. The industry is not going to do it because it does not think it is worthwhile, which undercuts the rationale being put forward by the Opposition. Incidentally, in response to the honourable member for Maranoa, the Board will collect the levy. It does not collect the levy on black market wheat now as it is. </PARA>

<PARA>Both these amendments refer to making provision for the Grains Council of Australia to agree in relation to the use of the levy. I know that there is general provision for the Australian Wheat Board to consult with the Grains Council but there is no specific requirement. As it is significant amounts of growers' money that we are talking about, and a range of purposes for which the levy can be used, therefore I believe it is appropriate that with the agreement of the Grains Council, the body representing the wheat growers of Australia-and it is their money-those two clauses be inserted. </PARA>

The industry cannot have it both ways. If it wants that kind of autonomy, it can obtain it through the establishment of an independent industry funded body.

In answer to his question on rice, there is a lot of nonsense put around about any product of the soil-I suppose including worms. The attention given here regarding the use of the power to override the States is consistent with the proposed amendment. The legislation has been drafted broadly to refer to grain in all respects, including marketing. This was done to ensure that, as far as possible, the Commonwealth's deregulation objectives are met. The concern is that the States could attempt to use vesting of other grains as a means to thwart the Commonwealth's objectives and to maintain sole receivership and rail monopolies. There is a bit of a double-edged sword for the Opposition in this matter. I have already indicated that I am prepared to accept clause 7 and to review this again to see whether there is a need to hold a firmer position when it goes to the Senate. I point out to the Opposition that this could be a two-edged sword; it might give an opening to the States to thwart what we are doing.

<PARA> (41) Page 44, after clause 88, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Deregulation of labour practices</PARA>
<PARA> ``(1) It is the intention of the Parliament that the Board and any corporation engaged in the storage, handling, transport or sale of grain for export shall, in regard to any matter connected with the storage, handling, transport or shipment of that grain:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) be entitled to take no cognisance of any agreement, undertaking or other arrangement which requires the employment of any specified number of persons who are members of a trade union or similar society or association of persons, and any such agreement and undertaking or other arrangement shall be void;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) be exempt from the operation of any enactment of the Commonwealth or of any State or Territory which would otherwise require the employment, or the giving of preference in employment, to persons who are members of a trade union or of a similar society or association of persons;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) be entitled to enter into voluntary employment agreements or undertakings with any employee or groups of employees, and such agreements or undertakings will override any awards of the Industrial Relations Commission;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) be entitled to enter into any agreement, undertaking or arrangement with any person or body in regard to the loading of any vessel and the manning of any loading apparatus; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) be entitled to claim damages in the Federal Court of Australia or the High Court of Australia against any person, trade union or similar society of association or associations or persons for an amount equal to the amount of any loss of a financial or contractual nature caused by any action of that person, trade union, society or association of persons which disrupts the activities of the Board or corporation, as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) A natural person, trade union or similar society or association of persons contravening subsection (1) is guilty of an offence punishable upon conviction:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in the case of a natural person-$10,000, and $1,000 for every day that the offence continues; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) in the case of a trade union or similar society or association of persons-$100,000, and $10,000 for every day that the offence continues.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposed new clause relates to the deregulation of labour practices in the transport, storage and handling of grain. It is consistent with the Government's philosophy-at least I hope it is if one accepts what the Government is saying-to deregulate the transport, storage and handling of grain so that efficiencies can be achieved and costs to growers reduced. At present, as I see the application of that power, we will not be having any deregulation whatsoever in the transport, storage and handling of grain, particularly at the wharves. All there will be will be a managed or regulated arrangement between the Australian Wheat Board on the one hand, and the State rail authorities or port authorities on the other. That is not competition. It is not what the Grains Council was seeking when it wanted the commerce power used. It wanted to have an open, competitive situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, unless there is some reduction in the costs of labour in those regulated industries-in some of the very expensive work practices in the railways, on the wharves and in the general restrictions that build up the costs-there will not be any worthwhile savings achieved. If this Government is genuine in what it says about micro-economic reform and about getting some efficiency into the transport system, it should accept this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not long ago part time employees were employed at the wheat dumps throughout Australia to manage and bring in the harvest. The present labour system totally saddles the industry with costs. Employees employed on boards throughout country Australia are on salaries and receive holiday pay, leave pay and all the lurks and perks that are imposed by the ratbag union movement. The Labor Party Government in Canberra goes on with ratbaggery and hypocrisy about deregulating the grain industry. As grain growers we are very keen to see the Government follow through its keenness for deregulation and move into the union movement so that we may begin to compete worldwide. The Government will have to do something pretty soon because at the rate other countries are subsidising wheat sales we will not be able to sell any of our products. I mentioned earlier tonight the fact that the great family company John Shearer Ltd had closed down. It was not because of the quality of its product; Shearer machinery is noted in the farming community as the best quality product one could possibly buy for one's farm. Yet because of the high cost of labour and strikes by the unions in that factory we have seen a great Australian company go to the wall. It will start manufacturing machinery overseas.

<PARA>If the AWB and other grain trading corporations are to realise the savings estimated by the Royal Commission, they must have the scope to use least cost methods of handling and moving grain. </PARA>
<PARA>We agree. One of the real concerns that the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport had was in relation to the waterfront. The Royal Commission report states at page 125:</PARA>
<PARA>Restrictive practices occur in all parts of the distribution system but particularly in rail transport-</PARA>
<PARA>and the Government has acted in relation to that-</PARA>
<PARA>at port terminals and on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA>Where is the action there? The Royal Commission points out that the major problem is on the waterfront, but to date the Government has squibbed on any action on the waterfront. We are providing the opportunity for the Government to act in relation to the waterfront, to reduce costs for grain growers. The following statement appears on page 128 of the Royal Commission report:</PARA>
<PARA>In the Commission's view, there is an urgent need to change the operating environment on the waterfront-</PARA>
<PARA>and I say `Hear, hear!' to that-</PARA>
<PARA>such that competition is encouraged between organisations whose respective work forces are dependent on the economic well-being of their employers. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, `Hear, hear!' to that. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Only in such an environment are real gains in efficiency improvements likely to be achieved on a continuing basis. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what this amendment aims to achieve. It aims to achieve those improvements in efficiency on the waterfront through greater competition. As I said during the second reading debate, right now we have a situation where the shipping lines are proposing to put a surcharge on grain going over the wharves because of the lack of productivity improvements on the Australian waterfront. In fact, they are saying that it is so bad that they will not come here unless they get another $10 a tonne to cover the cost of loading their ships in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government does not accept this amendment not only will it be squibbing on the action that it is taking in relation to deregulation as it concerns farmers but also it will be adding another $10 a tonne to the cost of getting wheat over the wharf. I urge the Government most strongly to accept this amendment moved by the Opposition, to show that it is genuine in its commitment to deregulation not just as it affects wheatgrowers but as it affects some of its mates in the union as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Government does not accept this amendment as proposed by the Opposition parties, the whole integrity and effectiveness of this legislation will be lost. I remind the Minister that in the past eight years the costs to growers from net returns have increased from 15 per cent of returns to 45 per cent. That clearly indicates the impact of restrictive work practices and industrial relations practices on the Australian wheat industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I had actually given enough ideological savers to the Opposition-the monopoly for the National Party and the transport override for the Liberals-but they are having their self-indulgent war dance on this whole question of labour. I appreciate, of course, the acidic comments made by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) during his second reading contribution and just now, and all those nice words.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> May I just point out to the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) that of course I know what the problem is. That is the reason why we are putting the Board in a position to catalyse savings-because we are dealing with State governments and because we are dealing with systems that are very hard to change. By putting in market pressures, we can get changes that we would never get through an administered system. I would love to get it for coal transport, but of course the Queensland Government's coal regulations for its railways are really holding back that industry. But one has a problem with State governments. This way we are doing it with a market induced approach. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely crazy for the Opposition to propose that, because one area is deregulated in a rather complicated way to save farmers money, wages should be deregulated in a wheat Bill. As I said earlier, it is a bit like the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) moving to privatise Qantas Airways Ltd and the Opposition demanding that he privatise every Government business enterprise. The lot cannot be done at once. Other consultations have to take place. All this nonsense about--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Porter" NAMEID="NI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NI4">Mr Porter</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have done nothing. You have had six years and you have done nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You had your chance, old boy. We hear all this nonsense about the wharfies and the reports before the Government. We have received them only in the last four to six weeks and we will be dealing with them this month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us talk about all this hype about the wharfies. The wharfies are on three terminals. The wharfies are not the problem. This is a bulk trade. Opposition members talk about shipping. There is only coastal shipping to Tasmania, so forget the shipping. We are dealing with bulk trade. The taxpayers are subsidising the freight to Tasmania. Opposition members should not get into a lather about the wharfies. The dreaded wharfies operate in only three terminals. The reason they, and not the other unions, are there is that they are a lot more efficient. The wharfies have accepted more change than they are credited for. The problems have been in the terminals-in demarcation disputes and bad management there. It has nothing to do with the wharfies at all. It is a bulk trade. Wharfies do not carry every little grain across the wharf. Opposition members should not get all hyped up about shipping and wharves. That is not the problem for these bulk commodity industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's wages policy and the accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions have already led to substantial reductions in labour costs. Other initiatives are being taken. As I said, they will be taken this month. These actions form part of a cohesive strategy for the reform of the labour market. The provisions already included in the Bill will put substantial competitive pressure on the grain distribution system, therefore putting further pressure on employment levels and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point is that the Commonwealth is continuing to provide assistance to the industry through the export monopolies, borrowing guarantees and national interest cover, which would offset any penalising effect. I am sure the waterside workers would like a monopoly, government guarantees, national interest cover and all the rest. So, honourable members opposite should not think that there is not a balance here. I will not accept an amendment which, in the reality of industrial relations-because we do not have slaves, as the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) wants-could jeopardise the Government's whole labour reform strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear all this nonsense about wages deregulation. Opposition members should look at some of the realities about that. The reason why we do not have wages deregulation in the present situation is that it would be a bit like throwing a broad-based consumption tax in with inflation rising. This is another of the favourite hypes of honourable members opposite. The wage market is not a true market. It never ratchets down. Even in the Depression, in real and nominal terms it never ratcheted down. Opposition members should not think it is a real market. It is not a real market from another aspect. There is not a balance of power within the market. In other words, there is exploitation, such as in Queensland where most of the work force is non-unionised. We have awards as low as $231 a week. I know that when all the fellows opposite are going for more parliamentary pay they think $231 a week is real cream living, but they should not talk to me about wage markets and all the rest of it. We need protection and regulation in the wage market, otherwise we get massive exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point is that, if Opposition members get into Government and bring about wage deregulation, the only way they will escape from a massive wages blow-out-there is at least 12 per cent or 15 per cent there at present-is if they recess the economy quite massively. If that is what they propose, they will wreck this country. So, they should not get carried away with all their ideological hype and acidic comments. The Government does not accept these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose this legislation as it now stands. This is a fundamental issue to my grain growing constituency. I support the unanimous policy passed by the Victorian Grains Council in March, which was attended by 800 growers at Horsham. My decision to divide on the third reading supports a clearly stated policy of the National Party Federal Conference and the unanimous policy of the Victorian National Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It must be made quite clear that the measures to provide flexibility and commerciality to the Australian Wheat Board, the measures to remove unnecessary administrative costs and to impose pressures for efficiency in transport handling and storage authorities, are supported and not impeded by our earlier amendments. The report of the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport was a watershed for the grain industry. His work was excellent and effective. Farmers have seen the greed of this Government and State governments plunder of farmers' returns through freight, fuel taxes and tariff costs of up to $9,000 per farm per year. While wheat industry protection stands at about 2 per cent effective protection, this sector carries a heavy protectionist burden that reduces net wheat growers' returns by some 18.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Opposition parties have moved a number of amendments of great significance which have not been accepted by this Government. They relate to a satisfactory Board structure, a satisfactory underwriting level and the refusal of the Government to give any commitment to the deregulation of labour practices that have been the major cause of cost to the industry. In other words, the Government is attacking again the symptoms of our problems and not the causes. We see in this legislation further erosion of rural producers' status and support in a highly regulated economy. There is no guarantee that the opportunity will present itself again in this House to register opposition to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> a.m.)-I also wish to oppose the full gamut of the Wheat Marketing Bill and the six associated Bills before the House tonight. I do this because not only am I opposed to the philosophy that growers have very little say on their board that is being reconstituted; I am also opposed to the fact that they are being levied to the tune of $50m a year and more as time goes by. In addition the Queensland Government's rights are being overridden by this legislation. It is interesting to note that the financial position of the Queensland Railways-this legislation wishes to interfere with the railways-was turned round by Mr Lane during his term of office. He should be praised for this. The Queensland Railways went from having an operating loss of $100m to having an operating profit.</PARA></TALK.START>
