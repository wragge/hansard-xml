<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Fadden moving forthwith:</PARA>
<PARA> That this House censures the Minister for Transport and Communications for:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) misleading the House by:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) his statements yesterday that the CAA had not compromised safety during the current pilots dispute;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) his statement that the Government has no part in licensing procedures for foreign pilots; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) his statements that the testing of foreign pilots is being conducted in line with normal procedures; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) failing in his Ministerial duties to ensure the continued maintenance of Australia's high civil aviation standards and calls for his immediate resignation. </PARA>
<PARA>This move by the Opposition is taken with the utmost seriousness. It is not a ploy on behalf of any sectional group within our community; indeed, it is a move on behalf of the entire community and especially the Australian travelling public. This pilots strike, which is now in its seventh week, has gone on and on. Right throughout the period we have been told that there has been absolutely no compromise of safety standards by the Government, by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), or by the domestic airlines in terms of the use of international foreign aircraft. Just yesterday in Question Time the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) said in reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Mountford) that he was aware of allegations that had been made that the CAA had compromised safety during the dispute. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I totally reject that charge. Both the Government and the CAA are concerned to ensure that, in rebuilding our domestic aviation system, Australia's high safety standards are fully maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in that same reply he made reference to a situation that existed concerning an Air Maritime 737 going off course out of Sydney just one week ago. I would like to quote to the House from the document that was issued by Sydney air traffic control to Melbourne air traffic control, which was taking over that aircraft. The telex statement was from Sydney air traffic control to Melbourne. Advice was given as to the real situation of the Air Maritime 737 registered Foxtrot Uniform Alpha, which departed from Sydney Airport to Melbourne on a standard flight plan with an accepted clearance via Wollongong. This is a standard departure clearance passed by ground control. The flight plan should have taken him via Wollongong to Corryong but it turned right and proceeded to Shelleys, a point 73 miles south-west of Sydney on a completely different track from the airport. In the message from Sydney to Melbourne tower the controller, after setting out what had happened, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Thank heavens for radar. Sector controller tried to counsel pilot gently but has no doubt he was not understood. Would you please try to help these pilots understand the meaning of SFPDN plans and the difference between a Wol and a Sls dep. We of course will try to do the same. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a reference to the difference between a Wollongong and a Shelleys departure. In the Senate yesterday a matter was raised concerning the operational procedures of an America West aircraft at Adelaide on 22 September. That aircraft, another Boeing 737, registered November 166 Alpha Whiskey, at 1515 hours landed on runway 23 on 22 September and failed to obtain clearance to cross runway 12. It allegedly was taxiing at 60 kilometres per hour but, of course, no action was taken. </PARA>
<PARA> Worst of all has been the real concern of very senior officers within the Department of Civil Aviation as to what is going on. I will quote from two documents. The first was written by Captain G. Segan, the Acting Senior Examiner of Pilots, and is entitled `CAA Operational Standards'. In that document he says:</PARA>
<PARA>By now you will be aware of concerns by CAA officers-</PARA>
<PARA>he is writing to headquarters-</PARA>
<PARA>of the erosion of operational standards as a result of decisions made in the light of the extraordinary events of the last six weeks. </PARA>
<PARA>He lists a number of areas in which those safety standards have been compromised. In terms of granting of concessions this gentleman says in his report:</PARA>
<PARA> To my mind the granting of a concession is tantamount to providing permission to break the law, and such action should only be contemplated after proper consideration of all of the factors involved. In granting a concession, therefore, it would be important that the intent and reasons behind the original legislation be fully understood so that a proper evaluation of . . . an equivalent safety standard would be maintained. During the last few weeks I do not believe that this was done. </PARA>
<PARA> Our major error was to allow ourselves to be drawn into discussions with airline commercial management-a group who had no knowledge or interest in standards. Their approach was to attack our standards in an attempt to reduce training requirements and they were successful. Their only negotiating point was the threat of ministerial action and it is an indication of our lack of confidence that we did not call their bluff. As a result new standards were set by political blackmail and it is now highly unlikely that we can redeem this situation. </PARA>
<PARA>In terms of AICUS flying for foreign pilots, he states:</PARA>
<PARA>Our existing policy on the issue . . . to foreign licence holders was relatively well known . . . There should have been no concession against the ATPL requirement of 150 hours of AICUS flying any more than such concessions would have been applied to experienced RAAF VIP squadron pilots. </PARA>
<PARA>Talking about the French pilots, he says:</PARA>
<PARA>The fact that the French possessed a BAE 146 endorsement was irrelevant. The type endorsement on a licence attracts a requirement of 50 hours of AICUS flying. </PARA>
<PARA>This was not met. He also acknowledged that company procedures and practices detailed in operation manuals are well known to pilots. He also says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it could be argued that their difficulty with the English language would override any advantage that their type endorsement may have offered. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there were real problems in terms of those safety standards. In terms of flight rules and procedure examination he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Small wonder, therefore, that within a week of the commencement of their operation we have reports of ATC confusion due to non standard radio calls, and an RPT aircraft turning right in left hand traffic patterns. This Authority has a requirement to check all pilots whose first language was not English prior to the issue of a licence. It must be assumed that such a test would be somewhat subjective; clearly, a private pilot on holiday should not require the same command of the language as one on scheduled operations. </PARA>
<PARA>But of course, we know that in terms of the issuing of these particular licences this did not happen. There are reams and reams of examples of where these cases have been brought to our attention and where there has been nothing but breaching of our present standards and political interference in the certifying of licences for foreign pilots. Therefore, I submit that this matter is urgent. The censure motion should be debated now without delay. In terms of safety for Australia and of the misinformation that has been continually given to us by this Government, the matter must be brought to light. This censure motion should be debated immediately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. A motion to censure a Minister is not embarked upon lightly. The Opposition would only embark upon that course in two cases. There may be other rare and exceptional cases but what motivates us as an opposition are these two situations: Firstly, where a Minister is shown to have misled the Parliament and, secondly, where a Minister has failed in his duty. On the basis of the evidence that has come to our notice we have no hesitation in saying that this Minister, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis), is guilty on both charges. There is no doubt whatsoever on the material that we have that this Minister has misled this Parliament. There is no doubt on the material that we have that this Minister has failed in his ministerial duties. I am not going to go into the substance of the allegations at this stage. What we say is that it is a matter of urgency; therefore, it justifies the setting aside of Standing Orders. The safety of the travelling public is at stake. The safety of the public travelling by civil aviation in this country is unfortunately, as a result of the failure of the responsibility of this particular Minister, at risk. That is a matter of very great urgency. It is a matter that certainly justifies the setting aside of Standing Orders so that the House can debate this particular motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I say, this is a matter of great seriousness. The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) has already illustrated the situation. We want the Standing Orders set aside so that we can look in more detail at the two documents that the honourable member has referred to. Despite the fact that the honourable member has referred to some details, let us look at the summary of the documents that the honourable member for Fadden has referred to so that we can see the seriousness of the situation. The senior officer in the Civil Aviation Authority, concerned about operational safety standards and having worked through this trauma for the last few weeks, says that the events of recent weeks show three things. They show that concessions have been granted for purely political reasons. On this side of the House, we do not believe that concessions touching safety, touching the operational standard of civil aviation, should be made on political grounds. He says further that those concessions, granted purely for political reasons, have been made:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . against long-standing requirements without due consideration of equivalent safety factors. </PARA>
<PARA>If there were ever a smoking gun condemning a Minister and a government, this must be it. When a senior officer in a department or an authority concerned about safety says that not only has safety been abandoned but it has been abandoned for political reasons, then we say that the House has no choice but to set aside Standing Orders so that we can debate this matter in detail. This gentleman goes on to say that there has been a major communication breakdown between pilots flying aircraft which are carrying passengers and pilots who are still working in their management positions and who are tired and, believe it or not, are dealing with the Civil Aviation Authority in their spare time after they have finished their flying. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Jull" NAMEID="MH4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After they have finished flying not only maximum hours but also, in one case to which this gentleman refers, after they have exceeded limits. That is a disastrous situation. The potential for a tragedy in the civil aviation area in this country is great. Not only is that potential great but it is sheeted home to this Minister, whom we say should be censured, first, for misleading the Parliament and, second, for failing in the most flagrant and demonstrable way in his ministerial responsibilities to guarantee civil aviation safety in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> As a result of these decisions, the essential primary health care functions and services provided (largely free) by pharmacists to the public, have been seriously put at risk.</PARA>

<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) recognises the valuable contribution of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in improving the cultural, intellectual and political life of Australians;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) congratulates Radio Australia on the attainment of its 50th birthday; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) calls on the Federal Government to provide sufficient funds to enable the Corporation to continue its vital role in the development of Australian democracy. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking in support of my motion that the House recognise the valuable contribution of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in improving the life of Australians, I have to admit that this is not the first time I have taken the opportunity to support the ABC in this House. Australia is very fortunate to have a national broadcaster which is free of political and commercial control. I hasten to add that this does not mean that the Corporation is not subject to economic constraints. However, there is no excuse for the kind of editorial I read in yesterday's Australian. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> There he goes again . . . the managing director of the ABC, Mr David Hill, whingeing, once more, about . . . the need to spend millions of taxpayers' dollars-this time on upgrading the transmitters of Radio Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial then goes on to damn with faint praise. It ends with no proof at all for its assertion that the services of Radio Australia lack professional quality. I have recently returned from a visit to a number of countries in the South Pacific. I have heard nothing but praise for the broadcasts of Radio Australia. Does the writer of the editorial realise that the overseas audience for Radio Australia is far greater than the total population of Australia? I think not. Nor is there any realisation of the many complaints received from populations far distant from Australia because of the poor quality of Radio Australia's broadcasts as a result of the ancient transmitters at Shepparton. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention was made in the editorial of the first coup in Fiji in 1987 when complaints were made of the inaccuracy of Radio Australia's news broadcasts about the political situation in that country. I am not in a position to challenge the lapse in accuracy quoted by the editorial but I know that within days of the coup it was impossible to buy short wave radios in Suva and Nadi because the population knew that it could in future rely only on the broadcasts from Radio Australia for unbiased news of events in their own country and neighbouring countries. </PARA>
<PARA> A reasonable implication which emerges from the editorial is that the writer was asked to submit an editorial bucketing the ABC without regard to the facts. First of all, Radio Australia has provided a valuable service for 50 years, as unsolicited comments from credible sources have indicated since the service began. Secondly, it continues to attract very large audiences which overwhelmingly express satisfaction with its service. Finally, I would be interested to know who were the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who were frequently unenthusiastic about the broadcasts of Radio Australia, because that has not been my experience. I have not met those officials. Most of the departmental officials that I have talked to have had nothing but praise for the professional content of Radio Australia's broadcasts. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I will not suggest that there is not room for improvement. A review committee of the ABC's overseas service began its work in November 1988 and produced a report. Eighty-six submissions were received from organisations, employees, ex-employees and other interested individuals including two parliamentarians. Those submissions provided an overwhelming impression of support and goodwill towards Radio Australia. Only a few were excessively critical, with one submission advocating that Radio Australia be closed down-only one. Generally there was appreciation of the credible and informative news and current affairs programs and the value of the presentation of Australia's views to the region. </PARA>
<PARA> However, a number of problems emerged from the review committee involving necessary improvements in the review of program content and style of programming. There are declining audience levels and this is a concern, particularly in the Asian-Pacific region. But that is mainly due not to a lack of program content but to technical deficiencies particularly arising from the transmission facilities. In this respect the Australian newspaper editorial was particularly inaccurate. Anyone reading the editorial could assume that the ABC owned and controlled the transmitters. Why else would the editorial refer to the ABC as a `bottomless pit' for funding? In fact, the transmitters are currently operated by Telecom Australia and are owned by the Department of Transport and Communications. The transmitters located at Shepparton are many years old, so old that they have wooden support structures. A potential fire is a constant hazard. </PARA>
<PARA> In congratulating Radio Australia on its fiftieth birthday, I regret that I often find it necessary to refute the inaccuracies of many of the ABC's critics, who appear to have a wish to denigrate Australia's major public broadcaster because it is public, it is objective and it is not subject to business and political influences. </PARA>
<PARA> The $30m needed to upgrade Radio Australia's transmitters to world class standard is a small price to pay to ensure that the ABC's large overseas audience is able to hear Radio Australia's services free of technical deficiencies. The Government should, as a matter of urgency in order to provide an unbiased news and information service to our more eastern Asian neighbours, provide funding to develop modern transmitter facilities in north Queensland. In addition, there is a need to develop an offshore capacity and two further transmitters at Darwin to increase broadcast capacity into South East Asia. It would be also a practical move to allow the ABC to own and control the new radio transmitters rather than continuing the outmoded system whereby control is exercised by Telecom Australia and the Department of Transport and Communications. </PARA>
<PARA> In a speech I made supporting the ABC on 30 August I commented that I considered it most unfortunate that, as a government, once again we find ourselves embroiled with the ABC in yet another funding row. Since I made that speech I have had the opportunity to look at the detailed figures for ABC funding for 1988-89 compared to 1987-88. Whilst I will not buy into the argument, it is very clear that the ABC had expected to be totally covered for inflation in its 1988-89 funding allocation. That was certainly my impression from reading all the ABC Review of National Broadcasting Policy documents and the comments of the previous Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. These figures show clearly that the inflationary supplement was cash limited to 5.5 per cent and actually provided only half of the actual annual inflation level of 9.3 per cent. What is worse is that this shortfall will be carried forward into 1989-90, thus compounding the shortfall in the second year. The upshot of this is that the ABC has suffered a cumulative shortfall of $32.5m. In this respect I hope that the Federal Government can do something to assist the ABC in overcoming the financial problems occasioned by what appears to me to be a technical difference of opinion between the previous Minister, Senator Evans, and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) in the framing of the budgetary allocation for the ABC. I ask the Government to look again at all the papers submitted at the time of the ABC policy review. If it does I think it will find that everybody participating in the debate had expected that the ABC's funding would be maintained in real terms for a three-year period, subject to the ABC accepting the terms of the review-to which the ABC Board agreed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In commenting about the valuable contribution of the ABC in improving the cultural, intellectual and political life of Australians, I could list many of those programs in both radio and television which I, as a confirmed admirer of the ABC, listen to and watch with pleasure. Occasionally, I enjoy programs on commercial radio and television but for my most constant enjoyment I prefer ABC programs. Basically, I find its choice of programs more stimulating and entertaining. Here I do not include films because they are really derived from a different medium. However, as program preferences are mainly a personal matter I will restrict myself to admitting that my favourite radio programs are news and current affairs, the Science Report and, of course, I must not forget John Cargher's musical programs. My favourite ABC television programs include Four Corners, the Big Gig, Countrywide, the Investigators and Hypotheticals. Obviously I could go on. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to complete my speech by making some additional comments about the report of the Review of National Broadcasting Policy, which was released on 26 February 1988 by the then Minister, Senator Gareth Evans. At some time in the future I hope to publish a joint paper which was written by Dr Terry King and me on the review of both the ABC and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS). In the meantime I will confine myself to a more modest contribution to this debate, which I am sure will be ongoing. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1988 Labor Party platform makes it clear that the ALP is `committed to the retention of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation as a wholly publicly-owned enterprise' and to `the development of the ABC as an innovative and independent broadcaster'. The 1988 platform also states that it will:</PARA>
<PARA>ensure that adequate funds are provided to maintain and extend the production of national, State and regional television and radio broadcasting without advertising or corporate sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to Channel 28, it also states that there will be:</PARA>
<PARA>consultation with the ethnic communities to enhance the operations of Channel 28 so that it can fulfil its charter of presenting multicultural Australian programs rather than simply acting as a conduit for overseas programming. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem is that it is impossible to equate those policies with the thrust of the various policy review proposals that were released only a few months before, and a few months after the conference which committed the Labor Party to that platform. It should be noted here that, even on economic grounds, it is extremely difficult to justify the Government's drive to divest itself of whatever degree of financial responsibility for national broadcasting it can get away with so far as the Party is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The possibility of advertising or sponsorship on either ABC or SBS television has not been greeted by the advertising industry with anything vaguely resembling wild enthusiasm. For example, the advertising newsletter Adbrief came to the conclusion that the comparatively small audience of the ABC would deter most agencies and advertisers from using it. Mind you, I am not quite sure that the audience is as small as has been put. Later figures show that that audience is much larger than had previously been thought. The managing director of one multinational agency suggested that whilst the commercial broadcasters were currently content to poach the occasional program or personality from the ABC, if they were faced with its competition for advertising revenue they would block it completely. The ABC would suffer even more and the SBS would be nowhere. Alex Hamill, the head of Australia's leading agency, indicated that if, as Senator Evans insisted in the policy review paper, there were to be strict limits on the commercialisation of the national broadcasters-restricting advertising to particular programs or accepting sponsorship but not straight advertisements-potential advertisers and sponsors would be even less enthusiastic. All in all, we could not expect, he said, anything more than a very moderate reward for placing at stake a fair degree of principle about the integrity of the national broadcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA> The importance, the value, of national broadcasting cannot be measured simply in terms of budget savings of tens, hundreds, or even millions of dollars. Instead, we must try to envisage the incalculable damage which could be done to Australian nationhood were we ever to lose an independent and healthy national broadcasting service, with the print media, radio and television all either totally or partially controlled by commercial interests-the Bonds, Packers and Murdochs of this world. Nothing in recent history suggests that such forces are any less likely today to attempt to manipulate the mass media to their own advantage than they were when Labor opposed the commercialisation of the ABC less than a decade ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to take up my full time as others wish to speak. Otherwise I would have liked to go on to talk about the comments made by the Canadian scientist and broadcaster Professor David Suzuki about the problems concerning the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Canada. I will not say any more. I urge support of the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I rise to support the motion moved by my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton). The motion says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House recognises the valuable contribution the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has made in improving the cultural, intellectual and political life of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>It is fairly difficult to imagine Australia without the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). We are very much a society that relies on information. In many ways we are an information starved society. In such a society, the ABC is one of our most vital sources of information. The ABC has had many strengths. One of these has been the fact that it is government funded. As such it can cater to minority tastes. It has not had to worry as much about ratings as have commercial stations. This, along with government funding and the ability to cater to minority tastes, has been a great strength. Its size has been terribly important. To put this in some perspective, a program such as Indian Pacific has had a listenership of about half a million people, which is greater than the number who read the current affairs pages of the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald. </PARA>
<PARA> Its range of programs has been quite marvellous. As a practising physician prior to entering parliament, there were many times when I was looking after people in hospital who were recuperating from surgery. Many times people said to me that in that post-operative period it was Radio Australia that kept them sane. The range and diversity of programs kept them going when they were too weak to do much else. The ABC has certainly contributed to our political life. There are some very notable examples here. Probably the best is Four Corners. ABC television is probably justified by the Four Corners program alone, with its exposure of the corruption in one of our States. The subsequent Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct will go down as a feather in its cap. The ABC's recent reporting of the Tiananmen Square tragedy and PM's coverage of the overthrow of Marcos both stand out as shining examples of ABC reporting. We can count on the ABC being anywhere in the world that really matters to us. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the honourable member for La Trobe's motion talks about cultural life, and certainly the ABC's orchestras spring to mind. It is perhaps hard to imagine some State governments sponsoring orchestras and here the ABC fills a gap very valuably. It has a proud record with other areas of music, too. I remember the jazz programs on the ABC, particularly in the 1970s. I have always had a very great fondness for jazz and have appreciated the ABC's attention to it. In the area of sport the ABC has pioneered televised cricket. That has now gone to commercial stations but the ABC has taken up other sports which are having a growing following, such as indoor cricket, netball and lawn bowls. The appreciation of the ABC's coverage of lawn bowls was made evident to me as one of the first things that happened to me after I was elected to this place was that I was inundated with letters from bowlers in my electorate when Jack High temporarily went off Channel 2. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABC is, quite frankly, the best source of information in a world where newspapers and television seem to be narrowing our information base. That is why the ABC is especially important to us. Overseas, economies of scale seem to be bringing us formula programs. That threatens our evolving culture and our own view of the world. It is vitally important that a country such as ours have correspondents in its region, and even outside its region, who will report back. For example, the ABC's correspondents in the Middle East ensure that we do not just get a superpower view of what is going on there. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the honourable member for La Trobe's motion congratulates Radio Australia on the attainment of its fiftieth birthday. Congratulations should also go to Mr Peter Barnett, who has recently retired as head of Radio Australia. After being a foreign correspondent he has held the position of director with enormous success. To me what is important about Radio Australia is that it remains a broadcaster which reflects our view of the region. As such it is important that Radio Australia not pull its punches. I have some concern that in having a career diplomat as head of Radio Australia it could be said that we may pull our punches to suit the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Obviously we will watch the track record of the new head of Radio Australia with interest and hope he follows the independent and distinguished line of Mr Peter Barnett. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important for us that we do not have the type of news management on Radio Australia that has occurred with other broadcasts, such as Radio America. I hope that Radio Australia maintains its independent line. To me the very essence of democracy is the free flow of information and the free flow of political opinions. The charge is frequently levelled against the ABC that it is a biased organisation. I think it is very difficult for any program to be totally free of bias. I am not too concerned about bias per se, but I am concerned with balance. On the whole I think the ABC does try to be balanced, even if we on this side of the House may be annoyed by individual programs from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> The final part of the motion moved by the honourable member for La Trobe calls on the Federal Government to provide sufficient funds to enable the Corporation to continue its vital role in the development of Australian democracy. Many people would see that the ABC is under some threat. It costs a great deal of money and it is paid for by the Government. Perhaps as parliamentarians we are very sensitive to criticism and that too poses some threat to the ABC. It certainly seems that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is somewhat sensitive to the ABC's criticism. He is rarely heard on the ABC other than when when he is talking to Pru Goward about his pyjamas or the like. Anything heard on AM or PM seems to be prerecorded. However, that is not the point. I am here to congratulate the ABC and I would hope that the ABC can continue its role free of fear or favour. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) warmly welcomes the election of Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki as Primer Minister of Poland and congratulates Solidarity on its success; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls on all democratically elected governments to support the new Polish Government as it attempts the difficult task of achieving economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>The formation of a Solidarity based Government in Poland marks the first attempt at a peaceful transition from a communist regime to one with a non-communist leadership and substantial political pluralism. While non-communist authoritarian systems have made the transition to democracy, there is no precedent for what seems to be under way in Poland. As Lech Walesa said recently, `Nobody has previously taken the road that leads from socialism to capitalism'. The Polish developments are important for Australia because of their intrinsic significance and because Australia has direct interests in East-West security. The next Polish Government faces severe economic problems with high inflation, low output, outdated manufacturing plant and an exhausted and alienated work force. A Solidarity led Government must try to cope with these problems and simultaneously set up a new structure of political authority. The Solidarity movement will clearly face substantial internal strains as well as it moves from being a repressed opposition force to leading the government. </PARA>
<PARA> The political and economic problems facing the Solidarity led government indicate that there is no room for complacency in the West about prospects for change in Poland. Gorbachev's courageous and audacious policies in Soviet Union domestic and foreign affairs have created a window of opportunity for peaceful change in eastern Europe which Hungary and Poland in particular are seeking to use. Change in eastern Europe, however, needs to be well conducted and effectively implemented, otherwise it will not be lasting. It is clearly in the interests of Western states to support the process of reform in Poland so as to maximise Solidarity's capacity to achieve success. Aid and support must clearly be given in a cautious manner so that it is not seen to be aiming at compromising Soviet interests and not bringing into question Poland's membership of the Warsaw Pact alliance. This point was made recently by the senior American analyst Brzezinski. What is needed from the West is a combination of material support and rhetorical restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several ways that the West can help. Poland clearly needs substantial amounts of capital to make it possible and feasible for the economy to revive. There are critical shortages of both consumer goods and capital equipment. The West can help substantially by acting to alleviate this capital shortfall. There are grounds for concern that, so far, Western countries are not responding to the pace of change of events in Poland and to the critical need to support moves towards pluralism and democracy in a sufficiently concrete and not just a rhetorical way. So far the United States has committed just $120m in aid to Poland, which is only one-fifth of the cost of one Stealth bomber. </PARA>
<PARA> The European Community and other interested Western states could organise programs to allow a substantial number of Poles to gain skills in running economic enterprises. Western countries could encourage the process of economic reform and recovery by providing wider market access to Polish exports. It is clearly anomalous that exports from East Germany freely enter the European Community through the Federal Republic of Germany while Poland's exports cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other steps can also be taken. One is obviously debt relief. Poland is one of the major debtor countries, yet the flexibility offered by Treasury Secretary Brady's plan should be applied to Poland in the way that it is being applied to developing countries. That would include rescheduling debt reduction and interest rate reduction. Australia could respond to the need for support by giving some aid-perhaps one-off aid; maybe food aid. Such aid at this crucial time of the change of government would be particularly appropriate. We could also offer training programs and market access to Polish goods. The private sector, too, should be offering institutional help. Poland desperately needs management and banking skills. Our own banks could be involved there. Australian companies could be involved in joint ventures and in investment in Poland. That kind of cooperation would be enormously valuable to Poland as well as to Australia in building up Australian markets. </PARA>
<PARA> At present there is a sense of hope in Poland. The key requirement is for a change of ways of thinking, from the Government doing everything to much more self-help. The West did not create the problems of postwar Poland, but it is very much in the interests of Western countries to support those who are working peacefully, valiantly and intelligently for political and economic renewal in Poland. Despite this being a time of economic restraint in Australia, this issue deserves not only our close interest but also our strong economic and political support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this motion, as I believe everybody in this House would. The motion puts two things: that we warmly welcome the election of Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki as Prime Minister of Poland, and congratulate Solidarity on its success; and that we call on all democratically elected governments to support the new Polish Government as it attempts the difficult task of achieving economic recovery. To say that the task is difficult is a major understatement. I address three subjects: first, the trend of change that we have seen within the Soviet empire; second, the emergence of a government which is, in essential respects, a democratic government; and, third, the problems that that government faces and what should be the response of Western governments to those problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The trends of change under Mr Gorbachev are known; the goals and the ultimate agenda are not. But broadly within the Soviet empire we have seen a loosening of the reins, particularly in eastern Europe. We have seen a resurgence in the old empire, inherited from the Tsars, of nationalism, and we have seen in eastern Europe the permitting, for whatever reasons, and after great struggle-I speak here of the Polish people-of political developments that would never have been contemplated by Gorbachev's predecessors. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have the most constructive period in East-West relations that we have seen since the Second World War. When we look at developments within the old Tsarist empire and the new empire that was acquired in and after the Second World War, we are probably seeing developments which are more hopeful than anything that has happened since the 1917 Revolution. This does not mean that the millenium has arrived; nor that the changes that have taken place are irreversible. But it does mean that we have entered a hopeful and constructive time for the resolution of some of the main issues that have plagued us and have plagued peace for decades. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move on to Poland's situation. Poland exemplifies the best of what has taken place and the best that we can hope for. We have seen elections, admittedly in part rigged, and following those elections we have seen the installation of a recognisably democratic government. I remind the House of the composition of that Government. Four ministries have been accorded to the Farmers Party: agriculture, justice, environment and health. The Social-Democrat Party holds the commerce and technical development ministries. Defence, the interior, transport and foreign trade were assigned to the Polish United Worker Party-the Communist Party. I read from the Solidarity newsletter of 1 September 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>The foreign affairs ministry, though doggedly claimed by the communist party as its birthright, passed over to Solidarnosc, which also took charge of the main economic posts in addition to culture, education, communication and labour. </PARA>
<PARA>That is nothing short of astonishing. However, this change would never have come about without the struggle that was engaged in by Solidarity and by all the members of the Polish community who fought for freedom. As Mr Walesa reminds us when he recalls the spirit of August 1980:</PARA>
<PARA>We are celebrating the ninth anniversary of the August Agreements. On 31 August 1980 as chairman of the inter-enterprise strike committee . . . I signed the document that laid the cornerstone for NSZZ Solidarnosc-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Solidarity movement-</PARA>
<PARA>and changed the course of Polish history. The years that have passed since have not been easy-many battles were lost and won. </PARA>
<PARA> Then a year ago, the August 1988 strikes opened up a new road for Poland. The electoral results in this June proved decisively that our nation does not want piecemeal and slow change. It wants a fundamental breakthrough, it wants equality of civil rights, it wants full democracy and a healthy economy. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a marvellous achievement. What are the problems that Poland faces? What is the response that the West should give? Some of the problems have been referred to by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). Some of the details were outlined by the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) a short time ago. He was speaking of the current food shortages. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the current acute food supply shortages in Poland are symptoms of an economic crisis of unprecedented proportion. </PARA>
<PARA> Clear signs of breakdown appeared this spring and the awareness of impending crisis impelled the authorities to make haste in signing the contract at the Round Table. April and May brought near economic collapse. The deficit, which totalled 2.6 billion in April, nearly doubled within a month to 3.5 billion zlotys . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to list the falls in production that have taken place in Poland in May as against the previous year-by 5.3 per cent for the electric machinery industry, 3.5 per cent for non-ferrous metals, 11 per cent in the automobile industry, 7.5 cent in the footwear industry. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>A final indicator sums up the situation: this May, the railway, freight, and maritime networks transported 13 per cent less goods than in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>The calls for aid are understandable and I believe that we must do whatever we practically can to help Poland. If the crisis worsens it could become a catastrophe. If that happened what would be the shape of the government that might then emerge? The aim of Western help, in which the major democracies must join, must be to rebuild the capital infrastructure of Poland and to raise standards of living, particularly in basic areas such as availability of food, clothing and other everyday family household goods. But it is no good throwing money at the problem, even though the rescheduling of Poland's immense foreign debt is going to be necessary as an ongoing process. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me list some of the specifics that I believe need to be addressed urgently: a system of commercial banks to help finance economic reconstruction; government guarantees of foreign investment so that private foreign investment flows into Poland; and an urgent review of the means of channelling foreign investment and expertise into food production to alleviate food shortages and into small business to alleviate other shortages. Remember that small businesses can move more quickly than large businesses. Broadly, and before major commitments are given, there should be an urgent and wide-ranging review of the economy to recommend areas of major foreign investment, especially in areas of shortage. Poland does not need any more white elephants. An equally wide-ranging reform should be made by the Polish Government in restrictions on private sector investment, both local and foreign, because private sector investment in the long run must be the engine which will power regrowth in the Polish economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude with the following comments. The failure of Poland as a democratic government could presage failure of democratic reform elsewhere in eastern Europe or could block moves to democratic reform such as we see now in Hungary and we hope for in Czechoslovakia and even, perhaps against all rational expectations, in East Germany. The economic collapse of Poland would almost of necessity bring about the collapse of the Government. What government would then be installed? There would, I fear, be a reversion to all that has failed and all that has subjugated the Polish people. It is vital therefore that the Polish Government and the Polish people be supported by all practical means so that democracy becomes embedded in the Polish system. There is no time to lose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure for me to second the motion of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) welcoming the election of the Solidarity Government in Poland under Prime Minister Mazowiecki and calling on democratic governments around the world to assist Poland in its difficult task of achieving economic recovery. Like all honourable members, I have been following with interest events in Poland over the last few years, especially its move towards democracy since the fledgling days of Solidarity. It is a matter of great joy to all of us, I dare say, as well as to the thousands of Polish Australians that we represent, that democracy has been reborn in Poland and that the political will of the Polish people is being reflected in its government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Poland, however, as in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), political reforms are not enough. After years of manipulation and central control, the economy is in a parlous state with hyper-inflation and the collapse of supply. The top priority of the Polish Government and its supporters in the West must be to reform and revitalise that economy. Opinion is far from united about how this should be done. Many experts suggest a transfer of state property to private owners. Others, however, see dangers in fully-fledged privatisation for an economy which is devoid of competition and markets. They say that the first step should be autonomisation, not privatisation, and that privatisation would only replace the economic dictatorship of the communist state with that of privately held monopolies. Different economists have different priorities but it is certain that over the next few months some fairly draconian measures will have to be taken to tame the hyper-inflation, restore price stability, build Poland's private sector and put the sprawling government sector under some sort of discipline. </PARA>
<PARA> The Polish economic Minister last month presented the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank with a timetable of reforms over the next six months. Subsidies are to be cut sharply, prices liberated from decades of arbitrary administrative controls, and the highly overvalued zloty is to be devalued. These changes will produce a corrective inflation on top of the existing rate of 50 per cent a month. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable as these plans may be, they are fraught with danger. We see how in the Soviet Union economic and political reforms have quite reasonably raised the aspirations and expectations of the Soviet people for higher wages, better supply of consumer goods and a higher standard of living. But when change is slow people get impatient and frustrated-hence the industrial and civil unrest taking place in the USSR at the moment. There are always political opportunists inside a country who seek to gain popularity by saying that they can do something better and faster. In Poland the planned reforms will inevitably bring in the first instance a drop in wages and higher inflation, which are not things which make governments popular. Poland, of course, is not the beast that the Soviet Union is; it is much smaller, less racially diverse and more manageable. But since it seems as though things will need to get worse before they get better there is every likelihood that the same kind of civil unrest will take place in Poland. One can only hope that good sense, patience and optimism will prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> Meaningful change in Poland can only occur with Western support, both moral and material, as the honourable member for Fraser has already said. Australia can certainly play its part in this process. Australia has accepted an invitation from the European Commission to follow up the Group of Seven economic summit proposals on coordinated Western assistance to Poland and Hungary. Australia has attended two meetings of the Group of Twenty-four in Brussels. Recently we announced a number of assistance measures. These include the provision of the Australian system of tariff preferences to Poland and Hungary, the commencement of negotiations for double taxation agreements, and the use of trade development centres. Australia already has a $200m credit facility with Poland. We are also considering a food package for Poland, investment protection agreements and postgraduate training assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> But, as the honourable member for Fraser has put it very forcefully, there is no doubt a lot more that the Australian Government, banks and business can do for Poland. The same can be said for other Western economies. The amount of money Poland needs now is a pittance of the collective economies of the Western nations. I join the honourable member for Fraser in urging the Australian Government and Australian business and those of other Western nations to reach a little bit deeper into their pockets when it comes to assistance for Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I can only reiterate the sentiments that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) expressed in this chamber on 17 August when he welcomed the new Polish Government and pledged Australia's support for the political, social and economic reforms ahead. We can only wish the Government and the people of Poland courage and patience and, ultimately, success in the huge task they have in front of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to join other members in supporting the motion. I also wish the new Polish Government well. I have a copy of the speech by Premier Mazowiecki to the Parliament in September this year and I will comment on some of his remarks. He commenced his speech with the following words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come here as a Solidarity man who is faithful to the legacy of August of 1980. In my view, that legacy is above all a great all-embracing call from the community to be treated seriously, to have the right to decide their own future as a nation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I was fortunate enough to be in Warsaw in December 1980. We would all recall that there had been yet another summer of dispute in Gdansk. The workers of Solidarity had said that they had had enough with the way that Poland had been run and interfered with by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and that they were seeking to establish Poland as a more democratic state. At that time there was no doubt that the Russian tanks were sitting precisely at the border of the USSR and Poland. It was not a very comfortable time to be visiting. I was able to interview the leader of Solidarity in Warsaw. I remember that we had to sneak away rather cautiously one night and have private discussions in his unit. We were fairly sure that that conversation would be taped. That fellow, and I guess all the Solidarity leaders, were remarkable for their courage. I think they understood-all Poles would understand this better than any Australian-that Poland had been the punching bag of Europe for many years. It had been invaded from the west and the east. These people were under considerable pressure. It was not an easy thing simply to form a free trade union movement and to challenge the power of the state, but Lech Walesa and others had the courage to do that. It was a remarkable opportunity for me to speak to those fellows. </PARA>
<PARA> I later interviewed a political correspondent with the party newspaper called Polityka. We talked about political censorship and freedom of the press. He remarked:</PARA>
<PARA>An editor in Poland doesn't need a set of rules or a political boss to tell him what to do or what not to print, he just needs a map. </PARA>
<PARA>I think he was perfectly right. Poland's geography has determined much of its history because it literally has rested between the two major camps of European and Russian power. The Poles have been imposed upon for a long time and that is why Mazowiecki made the following remarks in his speech about the geopolitical position of Poland:</PARA>
<PARA> The situation of Poland in the last 45 years was largely determined by tensions and conflicts in global policy. Today, the end of the cold war creates for us a chance to realise our national aspirations in accordance with modern trends in global policy. </PARA>
<PARA>He further made the point:</PARA>
<PARA> If the day comes when the security of Europe no longer requires the existence of military blocs, we shall greet this fact without regret. We believe that such a day will come. For today, it is important that all treaties and military alliances should only concern the external security of their member states, and not their internal political and economic order. We greet . . . very sign that this understanding of international relations is taking root in our part of Europe. </PARA>
<PARA>Mazowiecki was saying to the Russians, `Whilst we value an external treaty for the security of Poland and we remain your colleagues and part of the Warsaw Pact, you really should now stop interfering in our internal affairs'. It is a remarkable change in Polish political events that a free trade union movement can now stand alongside the Communist Party itself and other democratic movements within Poland and actually run the country. Mazowiecki has set himself a fairly difficult task. He has said that the test of Polish democracy will be the success of the economy. He is perhaps a little too harsh on himself because I would imagine that the Poles have got used to not only fairly poor economic conditions, but also very poor political government. I do not think the Poles will be so harsh on this new democratic government that they will seek to throw it out if all is not well in the near future. That should not be any comfort to the Western powers. Those powers need to help Poland; they need to assist its economic reconstruction so as to take pressure off the new and emerging democracy in Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amazing fact about Polish political life is the flexibility of the Pole. Again in an article I wrote in 1980 I stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that a significant proportion of the Polish adult population is at one and the same time Catholic, a member of PZPR-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Communist Party-</PARA>
<PARA>and now a member of Solidarnosc. </PARA>
<PARA>The Poles are not fools. They understand that Polish life requires those elements-communism as given to them by the USSR, Catholicism, for which they fought and bled for a thousand years, and now this free trade union movement-but that any one individual adult could be a member of all three institutions. I think that indicates that the Poles are flexible enough and mature enough not to be too hard on their new government. It will be a very difficult couple of years for the Poles as they reconstruct their economy and make it more of a free market economy, but I suspect that they will lend even further support to their new Premier, to Solidarity, and to relations between Solidarity and the Communist Party. I wish them well in that. </PARA>
<PARA> Could I just cast my eye across the enormous number of changes that Mazowiecki is promising his people. He is suggesting that change is so fundamental that for the first time since World War II the Polish Army should not be used to keep the Poles in order but, in fact, should be governed by the Government in order to keep the Poles free from intruders. It is true that the Polish militia, if you like, has been used to keep the Poles in order, not their enemies. </PARA>
<PARA> The sorts of economic reforms that Mazowiecki outlined in his speech were as follows: he wishes to reduce the Government's budget deficit; he wishes to increase what he calls the discipline of tax collection-obviously a whole lot of state enterprises were not very good at paying their taxes; he wants to change the property ownership system so that there is an open market in land in Poland; he wants to allow employees to purchase company shares in these new enterprises; he wants to establish a stock exchange so that there truly is a free market; he wants to revoke the central distribution of market prices; and he wants to allow the zloty to be convertible into other currencies. He wants to break the monopoly in the food market so that eventually food prices for Poles will fall. </PARA>
<PARA> Prime Minister Mazowiecki is very critical of the system of public finance in Poland. He wants a fundamental reform to the tax system and to impose what he calls a genuine tax on personal income. I have not yet understood the next remark in his speech, which is:</PARA>
<PARA>However, the scale of its progressiveness will not be in conflict with the basic goal, which is to tap the huge reserves of human initiative and enterprise to be found in our society. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether he wants a progressive income tax scale or a regressive income tax scale. Maybe one should read more into that remark. He wants to create a banking system and lift administrative control over prices. Above all, he wants the working people to realise that some unemployment will be created, as there is a shift into new industries, and that there will be a need for retraining, retooling and reskilling in the work force-the sort of language that we use. He understands that that needs to take place as Poland moves into a new economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The depth of Poland's economic difficulties is enormous. The inflation rate in Poland is around 4,000 per cent, which means that there is no way in which the Polish Government can deliver a reasonable inflation rate in the next few years. It is simply impossible. Again, when I read Mazowiecki's speech I suspect he is being a little too harsh when he suggests that his Government will be governed in the short term by its ability to solve the economic problems of Poland. He is trying to solve the economic problems of 50 years. He will not be able to do it, but he is quite entitled to call on all of those who believe in a new and democratic Poland to give Poland the greatest possible assistance to achieve that democracy in its affairs which it has been denied for so long. I wish the new Polish Government well, and especially the Polish people as they seek to renew their social, economic and political lives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very early on the new Prime Minister of Poland, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, identified Poland's economic problems as being its gravest danger when he asserted:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Poland cannot afford ideological experiments any more. </PARA>
<PARA>He promised to return to a free market economy, as Lech Walesa had earlier indicated. The new Polish Prime Minister has also promised a return to a legal system that guarantees individual rights. The motion we are addressing today states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>calls on all democratically elected governments to support the new Polish Government as it attempts the difficult task of achieving economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no wonder that Prime Minister Mazowiecki identified Poland's economy as being the country's gravest concern because it is, indeed, in a very grave situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The communist government's greatest policy folly was to allow Western banks to make huge, unsecured loans at ridiculous interest rates during the 1970s. This policy has done nothing for the Polish people except to accrue a massive foreign debt of $US40 billion. In the present circumstances in Poland this debt is impossible to pay off, and it grows daily with compound interest. The shelves of Polish shops are empty and the Polish currency, the zloty, has all but collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> What Poland desperately needs, and needs now, is at least a three-year constructive aid package that will deliver sufficient quantities of food and consumer goods to allow Prime Minister Mazowiecki the time and opportunity to reconstruct Poland's economy. All Western democracies-particularly the United States of America and those in Europe, but also Australia-must do all that they possibly can to ensure that Poland is given both the time and the opportunity it needs to restructure its economy along free market lines. Unfortunately, until very recently, that response has not been forthcoming in the way that it perhaps should have been. However, it is gratifying to see that President Bush of the United States announced today that he will ask Congress for an additional $US200m-$A257.56m-in aid to Poland as part of a projected $US1 billion-$A1.29 billion-in Western assistance to back Warsaw's move towards a market economy. The new aid, which will be in grant form and contingent on Warsaw's agreement to an International Monetary Fund economic stabilisation plan, will be in addition to the $US100m, or $A128.78m, in food assistance and $US120m-$A154.54m-in economic aid previously promised by President Bush. We will all welcome those moves by the United States Administration because there is no doubt that there is a school of thought that the Polish Communist Party and its former parliamentary allies are using the new Prime Minister and Solidarity as a tool to obtain Western aid. If that aid had not been forthcoming, they would have been among the first to force the new Polish Administration to accept responsibility for the subsequent failures. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a very positive note on which to end this debate on Poland. I am sure we all welcome the request that President Bush will be putting to the United States Congress as a major step in pushing the Polish economy towards a concrete road to recovery, therefore guaranteeing its political stability and future as a democracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure my friend and colleague the honourable member for Franklin that I certainly intend to do that. If one looks objectively at the procedure for World Heritage Committee listings, one can only conclude that it is a dog's breakfast. No-one really knows what the procedure is to be. There are no guidelines for nominating listings to the World Heritage Committee. There are no criteria. There is no set procedure that can be adopted, and people in the community-investors and those in industry-have no idea of the procedure to be adopted. The only procedure we can be certain of is that the final approval will be given by Senator Richardson and his colleagues, because they will simply override any criteria or objectives which might come from any of the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Huge areas of Australia are under threat of being locked up from all forms of development. In my own State of Tasmania-which is, of course, my prime concern-25 per cent of the land area is locked up in World Heritage listing. That means that 25 per cent of Tasmania is controlled from Paris-not Tasmania and not Australia. Similar things are happening in north Queensland; there are threats to large areas of southern New South Wales; and, in the electorate of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), huge forest areas are also under grave threat. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to concentrate my comments this morning on what is happening in Tasmania, and what has happened in recent times. As I said, 25 per cent of the land area in Tasmania is now locked up in World Heritage listings. Because this issue is of such importance to Tasmania, I am disappointed that we will not hear a response during this debate from the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr). As this is of prime concern to his electorate and the State of Tasmania, I would have thought that he would be here to offer some comments. I accept that we will get a response from the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), who represents an urban inner city area of Melbourne. We need to understand that this is typical of how the Australian Labor Party uses this issue. The Labor Party uses conservation in general, but more particularly listings for the World Heritage Committee, for purely political reasons in order to win votes in the metropolitan areas of Melbourne and Sydney. It is typical of that objective by the Labor Party that a member from the metropolitan area of Melbourne responds to this motion instead of the honourable member for Denison who ought to have the interests of Tasmania as his prime objective. </PARA>
<PARA> I will press on with the reasons why I bring this motion forward today. In Tasmania we have just witnessed the election of a new government. One might dispute whether it was legitimately elected because there was a huge swing against the Labor Party which came out losing heavily. However, because of a deal that was done between the Labor Party and the greens in Tasmania it became the Government. Within nine weeks of that new Government's taking office, another huge slice of Tasmania was being offered to the World Heritage Committee in Paris. The area of World Heritage listing in Tasmania was effectively doubled by the nomination brought forward by the Field Government after only nine weeks in office. One might speculate as to whether that nomination by the Field Government was a genuine one or whether it was driven by the extremist conservation movement headed by Dr Bob Brown. It is my suspicion that it was the agenda of Dr Bob Brown that forced that nomination for World Heritage listing. After the Field Government had nominated the areas that it concluded were appropriate for nomination on 6 September the Advocate newspaper reported:</PARA>
<PARA> The leader of the Independents, Dr Brown, said that Government decision fell well short of including all areas of World Heritage value and he would continue to fight to have more land included before the listing was sent to Paris. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Brown was not content with just 25 per cent of Tasmania; he wanted more. He made the statement after the State Government had determined the areas that it thought appropriate. It is interesting to see what Senator Richardson had to say. The Advocate reports:</PARA>
<PARA> `The balance is almost right-but not quite,' he said . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It is the latest indication by Senator Richardson and his staff that it is he, and nobody else, who draws boundary lines on Tasmanian maps. </PARA>
<PARA>The Advocate also reports:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Minister for the Environment, Senator Richardson, said last night that there would almost certainly be Federal Government changes to the World Heritage boundaries announced by the Premier, Mr Field. </PARA>
<PARA>... ... ... </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson said that the Premier had `almost, but not quite' got the proper balance between conservation and the preservation of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>One might well question who is governing Tasmania. Is it the elected Labor Government? Is it Premier Field? Is it Dr Bob Brown or is it Senator Graham Richardson, who is governing Tasmania from the Federal Parliament? Quite rightly, any Tasmanian government should be able to determine what developments it wants and its own economic program. It ought also to have the flexibility to be able to put that program into effect. But in Tasmania and, I suspect, in other States, prospective developments such as those proposed for the Gippsland electorate and for north Queensland do not go ahead because of the intervention of the Federal Government using, in particular, the pretext of protecting the natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA> What effect is that having? We have already gone through the debilitating debate about the proposed pulp mill for Wesley Vale. A major company was prepared to spend $1,000m to set up a processing plant that would develop Australia's natural resources into a value-added product. That project would not have cut down one extra tree. Each year three million tonnes of woodchips are exported to Japan. The Wesley Vale project was designed to put 1.8 million tonnes of woodchips into processed paper and 1.2 million tonnes would have been exported to Japan. The result of the Wesley Vale debate is that we will not process that paper in Australia. We will still send three million tonnes of woodchips to Japan and we will then buy back the paper from the Japanese which, in turn, will make our balance of payments worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) described the woodchip industry in rather colourful and expressive language, but he was absolutely right. He said that the Federal Government must reassess its policies on the pulp and paper industry and, in particular, it must have policies that will allow Australian industries to process our resources. Senator Button knows that we cannot continue with an economic or industrial program that sends off our raw materials to another country and then buys back the finished product. That is economic madness, but that is what the Federal Government is doing because it is driven by the extremist environmental movement and Senator Richardson. I strongly suggest that Senator Button had in mind that we keep our raw materials in Australia and use them for our economic benefit-to create jobs and economic activity and to help the economy back on the rails. Unfortunately, Senator Button seems to be a voice in the wilderness within the Government because all the Government is being dictated by is the need to win votes in metropolitan Melbourne and Sydney and it will distort any of our economic prospects for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate in Tasmania has not yet concluded. We have been through the dilemma of Wesley Vale, but that is not the end of it. I know of another project in Tasmania that proposes to invest about $700m in further processing our timber resources. It does not propose to cut down any more trees; it simply proposes to process that material into downsteam products. I wonder what the response from Senator Richardson will be. I wonder what the response from the extremist environmental movement will be because it seems that it is that movement which dictates the policy to both the Tasmanian Government and the Federal Government. I suggest that Dr Bob Brown and his colleagues have made captive servants of the Tasmanian Premier and his Ministers in Tasmania and also have Senator Richardson acting as their agent in the Federal Parliament. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3F4">Mr BURR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member is quite right. I suggest that, if we are to get the economy of the country back on the rails, we cannot do it while we continually transfer the control and the management of our land areas in this country to an undetermined body of people based in Paris while at the same time responding to the extremist environmental movement by locking up the resources of the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment the Government is caught in the same dilemma in considering the development of Coronation Hill in Kakadu National Park. The Government is locked into a bind. It is caught between our balance of payments problem and, therefore, the urgency of developing our national resources and the demands made on it by the extremist environmental movement, which wants to preclude that type of economic development. The Government simply wants to win votes in metropolitan Melbourne and Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Government-and this is why I have moved this motion today-to tell those people who would retard the development of our economy and the job opportunities for our young people, who will be the nucleus, the heart and soul, of this country, and in the process give them little hope, that they are not acting in an Australian way; that we want to provide opportunities; and that we will no longer tolerate being dictated to by a small minority of extremists. </PARA>
<PARA> My motion requests that any new listing to the World Heritage Committee be first considered and approved by the appropriate State and local governments. In the new listings that have just gone forward covering areas in Tasmania, no consideration was given to local government; as I understand it, it was not even informed of the areas to be nominated until they had been announced by Senator Richardson. There was no discussion with industry organisations-the forestry industry, the mining industry or any other industry group-and not even with the trade union movement. When the State Government made its recommendation about listing, that recommendation was overruled by the Federal Government. That situation is clearly unacceptable in any democracy. The Federal Government ought to determine guidelines and proper criteria for any new World Heritage listings. </PARA>
<PARA> What is desperately needed from the Federal Government, and what is more important than having criteria and guidelines for the World Heritage listing, are guidelines for industrial development. We cannot have potential investors who come forward with plans for industrial development feeling that their investments will be jeopardised because they do not know how the Federal Government will respond. If the Federal Government is to give confidence to investors and companies-the Australian people-it must give clearer guidelines. We can then be confident that, when new ideas and potential investments emerge, they have a good chance of being accepted and going ahead. New economic developments can then take place and new job opportunities can be created. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I ask the Federal Government to steer away from its blind adherence to the demands made on it by the extremist environmental movement and give more consideration to what is needed for development and for future opportunities in this country rather than be restricted by the demands of the extremist environmental movement and the narrow objective of simply winning votes in Melbourne and Sydney. </PARA>

The honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) indicated implicitly that because I serve a constituency in the Melbourne area somehow I ought to be precluded from putting a view on this matter, as some of the issues that he adverted to affected Tasmania. As the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) knows, in terms of background and credentials I in fact come from the bush, not from a metropolitan electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member thinks there is something wrong with people who come from the bush, that is something he should be accountable for. I certainly do not hold that view. It is not really apposite to much, but my father was a timber worker for many years until he suffered a quite serious injury as a timber cutter. For the rest of his working life he worked in a factory producing paper from pulped timber. So I have a family background in an area that may surprise the honourable member for Lyons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I should make a couple of quite important points about these issues. My colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) is not here. It was a bit unkind of the honourable member for Lyons to somehow imply that he should be. As the honourable member for Lyons would know, I had priority on the speaking list on this topic, so the honourable member for Denison had no choice but not to be here.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is entirely misleading and incorrect. If the honourable member were to look at the parliamentary record and numerous public statements made by the honourable member for Denison he would see that he is incorrect. But I will not be drawn by the honourable member for Gippsland. I want to make a couple of important points. The first is that the motion that the honourable member for Lyons has put before the House is somewhat ambiguous or moderate in its terminology. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House requests the Federal Government not to forward any new listing to the World Heritage Commission until approval has been given by the responsible State and local governments. </PARA>
<PARA>If one were to strip away that terminology one would see that in essence the honourable member for Lyons proposes a course of action which would allow any State or local government effectively to veto a World Heritage nomination. The record of State and local governments in these issues gives very little ground for confidence that they would properly discharge their responsibilities. The Commonwealth Government, the Hawke Government, views its responsibilities under the World Heritage convention very seriously indeed. A nominated area or property in the World Heritage listing has to have a special and unique place not only in Australia but in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I have here a speech made by Mr Jim Thorsell, the Executive Officer of the Commission on National Parks and Protected Areas under the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. I very strongly commend a reading of this speech by an internationally acknowledged expert in this field, someone who has international bipartisan support for the extraordinary contribution he has made to these very important issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lyons talked about opportunities for young Australians. In a very real sense the issue of environment and conservation takes particular notice of young people. In essence, it is all about this Parliament making decisions that will be relevant not only in the next three years, five years or 10 years but for hundreds of years. There is a most important change in attitude to environmental issues. They are about sustainable development; they are about the future of this planet. The honourable member for Lyons is a bit slow to come to grips with these issues, as many other people are, but they are important issues. Sustainable development does not mean that one simply has no development. That would constitute an absurdity. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, providing the environmental safeguards can be satisfied and the legal rights of the Aboriginal people in that area can be accommodated, Coronation Hill ought to proceed. The driving force for that is, in part, our current account difficulties. My main motivation for coming to that decision is that I am confident that the trade-off, the balance, between environmental considerations and development can be achieved. I believe that it will be achieved with the effluxion of time. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to our whole range of other areas of importance it is worth making the point that every nomination in Australia placed before the World Heritage Committee has been accepted to date. When listing properties on the World Heritage List the Australian Government has obviously been conscious of its responsibility not only simply to list but also to manage and to preserve those areas in the future. Naturally the Government-this is not a matter of assertion by me but a matter of record-seeks the full cooperation of all parties; that is, not only of State governments and local governments but also of industries and, for example, the tourist industry. To date that form of cooperation has been extremely successful. With the exception of a couple of very black marks in a couple of areas overwhelmingly it has been very successful indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone here understands the attitude of the Queensland Government in relation to the wet tropics area of north-east Queensland where the Commonwealth had to deal with what I would regard-I think most people would regard-as a reactionary government in that area. First of all in that Government we had a person whom I regarded as a discredited thug-Bjelke-Petersen. Then we had Michael Ahern and now we have Mr Cooper. Those people are not remotely interested in anything other than supporting developers. As recently as last week on the Four Corners program we had the expose of the National Party Government in Queensland acting in a highly corrupt way by transferring leasehold arrangements in the Cape York area into outright ownership by particular groups. I noticed one case where for $80,000 a leasehold property was transferred by the National Party Government to full ownership by a National Party member. This ought to be public property. A couple of weeks later the National Party member sold the land for $5m. That is not bad money and not bad crookery. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope those people are brought to account. I dearly hope that there is a mechanism available to ensure that the people who were involved in that skulduggery, that theft of public property, that corruption in action, are brought to account.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the point, Mr Deputy Speaker. When the honourable member for Lyons talks about the nomination having the full support of the State Government he cannot reckon on a government like that National Party Government in Queensland. Things are changing. It is worth making the point that in Tasmania, in the context of the Franklin, originally the Franklin was an agreed nomination by the Tasmanian Government, as the honourable member for Lyons well knows. In terms of the contemporary situation there are throughout the country a whole range of discussions going on: in relation to Shark Bay in Western Australia; in relation to the Nullarbor Plain by the Western Australian and South Australian governments which are working on a World Heritage nomination. The Victorian, New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory governments are working on trying to retain the Australian Alps, that pristine alpine area. In a different context, in terms of the urban aspect that the honourable member for Lyons adverted to earlier, the Rocks in Sydney were nearly bowled over 15 years ago. I well remember the debate at the time. But now people are starting to recognise the intrinsic value of such areas not only for honourable members sitting in this place who can wander down there but for future generations, the very young Australians to whom the honourable member for Lyons referred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From the very outset of this debate on the wet tropics, for example, the Government talked to the Queensland National Party with a view to cooperating on management. It was not talking about vetos. It was talking about arriving at a consensus opinion. Of course, the Queensland Government would have nothing of that. It was in the High Court of Australia. We had the sad spectacle of Queensland Government representatives trooping overseas to try to challenge in Paris the relevant nomination. This Government will continue to seek cooperative management arrangements in relation to north Queensland but we must also acknowledge that at the end of the day, as is obvious from the nature of the convention, the Federal Government has the final responsibility. I think that that is an important responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view the Australian Government ought to have a far greater range of powers in relation to environmental and conservation issues than it has now-I go much further than the honourable member for Lyons-but all in the context of sustainable development-the balance between development, jobs, the current account and also the very important environmental considerations that have been referred to. It is also worth making the point that in terms of the World Heritage nominations the four criteria that have to be satisfied are very rigorous. We cannot just roll up, throw a bit of paper around and get a nomination. It is very serious. That is why I think the speech by Jim Thorsell is so important. He is perhaps the most internationally well-respected person in this jurisdiction not only in terms of the broad issues but also in terms of the technical criteria. Mr Thorsell described the World Heritage nominations as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if you like, the `Nobel Prize' or `Hall of Fame' for protected areas. </PARA>
<PARA> My impression here can be briefly and squarely stated: Australia has done more to implement the World Heritage Convention than any other single country.</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>My own experience, after evaluating more that 50 World Heritage nominations from 26 countries, is that two stood out in terms of their solid and scientific documentation and both these were from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to endorse very strongly the role of the Australian Government in these areas. He said that Australia's efforts in the promotion of public awareness of the heritage concept have also been exemplary. I think that the honourable member for Lyons is being too political when he simply asserts that these matters are raised to garner votes in metropolitan areas. I think that will happen. But I do not think that is remotely relevant. I do not believe that any Australian, whether living in a metropolitan or non-metropolitan area, should be prejudiced in putting a view about environmental matters that these days do not only extend beyond State boundaries; for goodness sake they extend globally. That is why this Government is supporting, for example, the world park concept in Antarctica. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House notes the urgent need to promote the use of native saltbush in Australia as a means of protecting the environment as well as providing invaluable stock feed crops. </PARA>
<PARA>Recently I had a visit from a very old friend, an agricultural scientist and a former New South Wales Western Lands Commissioner, Mr Dick Condon. Mr Condon reintroduced me to the unique qualities of the Australian native plant atriplex nummularia, known as old-man saltbush. I have now become a fan of that amazing plant. It is my belief that saltbush can provide an answer to many environmental problems in this country as well as being a source of income for land-holders. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people in Australia are aware of the salinity problems that we face, particularly in the middle Murray areas of Victoria and New South Wales and certain upland areas. We are desperately looking for solutions to this problem and perhaps the solution does not lie in huge and costly engineering works that often concentrate the environmental problems into local areas which themselves become environmental disasters. The answer may lie in the native plant old-man saltbush which has a component of almost every vegetation type in Australia from the middle reaches of the Murray-Darling and Lake Eyre Basin as far north as Hughenden in Queensland and westward to the Indian Ocean. </PARA>
<PARA> But Australia has had to reimport the knowledge of the outstanding qualities and productivity of this vegetation from South Africa. There, it has been possible to re-establish old-man saltbush in a plantation mode and to use it as a living haystack drought reserve. The South Africans have begun to recognise that saltbush is more than a drought reserve and have begun to use it as a means of increasing farm-earning capacity. Some are replacing lucerne stands as they run out with old-man saltbush plantations because they are easier to manage, little problem with waterlogging, are more productive as a grazing plant and, most importantly, once planted last forever. </PARA>
<PARA> Old-man saltbush has had a reputation in Australia of being a very drought-resistant plant, but it had to be handled carefully because it had been wiped out by heavy grazing over large areas in outback Australia. In higher rainfall areas it had been purposely eradicated because it was a harbour for rabbits. Conditions in the original settlement leases in New South Wales required that land be cleared to develop it for cropping and pastures. In the process, we went close to eliminating the one plant which has the capacity to maintain the native environment and sustainable and profitable agriculture. With the knowledge we now have, most of which has come from South Africa, we can use it to rescue our farming, grazing and irrigation areas which are being destroyed by salinity. </PARA>
<PARA> The productivity of old-man saltbush is such that in areas where it can be grown in Australia-on any soil type and anywhere the acidity is not below pH 5.5-it can be used to avoid the need for farm reconstruction, whether necessary because of declining terms of trade, because productivity and profitability are declining as a result of increasing salinity, or a variety of other reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Comparing old-man saltbush as a drought reserve forage with lucerne hay, we find that lucerne hay will cost the user about $5 a bale by the time he transports it and feeds it out. That is sufficient to feed 25 sheep on a maintenance ration for a day at a cost of 20c per sheep per day. A 15-month-old plant of old-man saltbush will feed one sheep for two days and provide a high protein, high fibre, high carbohydrate, low fat, living green feed for an outlay of 30c, which is equivalent to 15c per sheep per day for first grazing, but free feed for the next 160 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Old-man saltbush and other atriplex species and several other genera in the family chenopodioceae belong to an unusual group of plants with a C4 photosynthetic pathway, most plants having a C3 photosynthetic pathway, for fixing carbon dioxide. The C4 pathway enables the old-man saltbush to fix carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a much greater rate than C3 plants, with the result that old-man saltbush can produce forage of a quality equivalent to lucerne with only one-third the water usage per unit of dry matter production.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AH4">Mr HICKS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is remarkable. Of course, the honourable member for Parkes has much saltbush growing in his electorate. Old-man saltbush is thus an exceptional producer of high quality, high protein forage which is equal to or better than lucerne, with high carbohydrates, high fibre but low fat, which can be fed all the year round to provide for feed gaps occasioned by regular summer drought in southern Australia, regular winter drought in northern Australia, irregular drought anywhere at any time, or regular winter cold on the slopes and tablelands. Except for highly acidic soils with a pH of less than 5.5, it can be grown on any soil type anywhere throughout the whole profile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a deep-rooting plant with roots up to four metres in depth. Not many plants send their root structures down to four metres. It is thus able to use deep-seated moisture well below the range of most pasture and crop plants and most trees and shrubs. The high salt cell sap enables it to withdraw a percentage of soil moisture to much lower levels than most other plants. In addition, it actually grows better in salt affected soils or in saline waters much above the salinity of sea water. It is hardly believable, but that is the way it is. It thrives on waterlogging, with soil surface under water for six months or more at a time. One of the problems we are facing in the Riverina at the moment is that unexpected rainfalls have flooded pasturelands and destroyed the native vegetation for a number of years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently, old-man saltbush can withstand flooding over a long period. Its high productivity and affinity for saline conditions means that it can be used to reclaim land devastated by salt and restore such lands to extraordinary levels of productivity. An important consideration for farm reconstruction consequent on declining productivity or declining terms of trade is that, in spite of the high cost of establishment, plantations of old-man saltbush are cheaper per additional sheep area than acquiring additional land. Dryland and irrigation salinity pose the greatest threat to Australia's agricultural and pastoral environment and the economic and social fabric of the rural and urban communities in the areas badly affected. Plantations of old-man saltbush provide a means of bringing all forms of salinity under control and of reversing the decline in farm productivity consequent upon increasing salinity on individual farms. </PARA>
<PARA> If undertaken on a suitably large scale in both recharge areas-that is, non-acid soil-and discharge areas, plantings of old-man saltbush will provide the means of substantially reducing the flow of saline ground waters into river systems at a small fraction of the cost of large-scale tree planting. Today I received in the mail from the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics a map showing the shallow ground water and salinity of the Murray Basin. To say the least, it concerned me greatly. If old-man saltbush has the qualities that I am sure it possesses, it is time experimental plots were planted in strategic locations all over the Murray Basin area as well as in dry saline affected land. This should be done as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> Funds should be allocated to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and other Commonwealth agricultural research groups, as well as State agricultural bodies and various universities, to test the qualities of this plant. While the present trend may be towards the planting of trees for environmental purposes, there is no need to remind the House that trees take many years to mature, they are generally not salt tolerant, and they are expensive to plant. In many cases the solution may be a combined tree-saltbush planting exercise that will provide not only a pump for the saline water table but also a renewable agricultural fodder resource. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just reiterate that old-man saltbush is much more than a living haystack drought reserve. It is especially useful for restoring salted and eroded lands to high levels of productivity-to levels better than local native pastures. Except in highly acidic soils, it can be used to lower water tables in salted flats and recharge areas on adjoining slopes; it can be irrigated with saline waters, including bore waters unfit for irrigation or stock watering, or with fresh water on land that needs only rough preparation for irrigation. That is, it does not need the expensive lasering systems that are in common usage today. It needs only two or three irrigations per year and will give better returns from grazing than irrigated pastures or field crops. It is much better for improving farm earning capacity than any other approach, including sown pastures, dryland cropping and acquiring additional land, with all the inherent problems that that entails. If clearing is necessary, old-man saltbush can get the same result on a much smaller cleared area and will minimise the destruction of our native trees. It can be used as a living, all-the-year-round drought forage which does not have to be bought, transported, stored or fed out. </PARA>
<PARA> Planting old-man saltbush costs from $600 to $1,000 per hectare, depending on rainfall and irrigation, but the returns quickly recover the cost of planting, especially if the 100 per cent tax deductability is used. I believe that its main use, and the one I am concerned about, is the reclamation of irrigation lands destroyed by salt, using old-man saltbush as a means of restoring such land to a high level of productivity and reducing water table levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Old-man saltbush is a deep-rooting species with horizontal surface roots at a depth of one metre to 1 1/2 metres radiating outwards for several metres. Vertical taproots push downwards from these roots to a depth of four metres. It is therefore able to explore enormous volumes of soil to levels much below the root systems of rice, other field crops, pastures, fruit trees and most eucalypts. That is important because we have heard so much about planting eucalypts to overcome the salt water problem. Although the latter are often mooted as having value for reclaiming salted land, they are comparatively shallow rooting and provide no return to the landholder other than shade and shelter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that old-man saltbush will be able to thrive on an underground source of saline water and thereby keep water tables at a reasonable level. The obvious site for the project I spoke about before is an irrigation area, perhaps in northern Victoria or southern New South Wales. I believe that the sooner a project such us that is undertaken the sooner we will know just how valuable this plant is to us. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know how many members have travelled into the outback in recent times but I am sure that they have seen the multitude of wild flowers, particularly in the western part of New South Wales and other areas. One point I would like to make about old-man saltbush, particularly if it is trimmed, is that it can have a very attractive appearance. I notice that in a number of areas it is being used as a plant to beautify areas. The Broken Hill airport is a case in point. Around the actual airport facility a lot of saltbush has been planted, making it an attractive addition to the trees already planted there. I have said that I am a fan of old-man saltbush. It is very valuable for reclaiming salinated land, as a means of preventing soil erosion, as a means of providing a very valuable income for the farming community and it is also an attractive plant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the outset I commend the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) for the excellent research that he has put into old-man saltbush. The number of country members from both sides who are in the House to hear the debate about the prevention of soil erosion and soil degradation shows that they are very concerned about that indeed. Many of the problems that I have in my huge electorate of Grey were outlined by the previous speaker. Members of the House might not be aware of the fact that there is no piped water supply in a number of communities in my electorate. Unfortunately, there is no piped water west of Ceduna. Hopefully the State Government in South Australia will cooperate with the Federal Government so that we can soon get a piped water supply to those people west of Ceduna, a facility that some of the people in regional areas and cities take for granted. The honourable member for Riverina-Darling pointed out some of the difficulties that the people whom we represent in country areas and in the bush have to face every day. I think it is very fitting that this was put on the agenda for discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the area of Cleve on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia a number of people, particularly the Jericho family, are doing a tremendous amount of work planting trees to overcome some of the problems of soil degradation and soil erosion. These people have been in this field for a long period. I am sure that members who are concerned about soil degradation and who want to see what can be effected by planned tree growing would be most welcome to look at the Jericho farming area near Cleve to see the outstanding success that these people have had. As the honourable member for Riverina-Darling points out, trees take a long time to grow. If old-man saltbush is as effective as the honourable member has pointed out-I am sure he is correct-then we on this side of the House will certainly be very supportive of that. I will be having discussions with the honourable member shortly to make arrangements to have discussions with the relevant Minister to see whether finances can be made available so that the program which he has outlined can come into effect. It is very important that as we come up to the reality of the fact that there is much desert that can be reclaimed by the growing of old-man saltbush and trees-certainly in my electorate-we undertake a planned program to bring this to fruition. I conclude by saying that the honourable member for Riverina-Darling is to be commended for bringing this important subject before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate in the grievance debate today and I would like to reassure the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), as he leaves the chamber, that, far from resenting the intrusion into my grievance debating time, I consider the question of the pilots strike to be so important as to justify precisely the action that the Opposition has taken. I say that, Mr Deputy Speaker, because prior to entering this House I was a resident of a small country town in South Australia known as Waikerie. The town is synonymous with citrus growing and the sport of gliding. It was compulsory, almost, for all residents of the town to learn to fly fixed-wing gliders, just as a part of residency. As a result of that experience, I grew up with a great deal of appreciation of the importance of flying safely. In the days before there was regular radio contact with every glider, it was very important to be sure that all other glider pilots were determined to turn the same way in a thermal as you were turning. I would have thought that the emphasis on air safety that has been given priority in debate this morning by the Opposition, which has attempted to raise this issue time and time again, should be applauded by the community and acknowledged by the Government for the important matter that it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recognise that the pilots strike is doing this nation a great deal of economic damage. But I want to use my introductory remarks to the grievance debate to make the even more pertinent point that this same strike is doing extraordinary economic damage to my home State of South Australia. It has been estimated that cab drivers alone in Adelaide are losing $34,000 a day because of the pilots strike; that the Convention Centre is $370,000 down in revenue; that the Hilton and the Hyatt hotels between them have had 4,000 bookings cancelled. As a South Australian I am concerned. Every South Australian in this chamber is concerned, and I would hope that the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party, the Premier of South Australia, Mr Bannon, is concerned about the possible implications of the pilots strike for South Australia's Grand Prix, which last year brought 15,000 visitors into South Australia by air. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I rise today not to lay emphasis on the pilots strike but to draw the attention of the House and the nation to another matter which has been overshadowed by the pilots strike but which is of fundamental importance to every rural Australian in this House, including the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons), who is at the table and who has a rural electorate. That matter is the question of the cessation of live sheep exports. This has been a matter of major concern to every rural Australian but it is a matter which, from a press point of view, has been largely overshadowed by the impact of the pilots strike. The cessation of live sheep exports to Saudi Arabia means that a $100m market has been lost to Australia's primary producers. We should think of the impact of that alone on our balance of payments, already rushing in the wrong direction. A total industry worth $198m-almost $200m-is at risk; has been largely ignored by the press; has not even been aired by the Government this week; and, in fact, it is at risk simply because of unsubstantiated allegations of disease in Australia's livestock. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the dispute is that on 23 July of this year the Mawashi Tabuk entered the port of Jeddah and 80,000 sheep on board were alleged to have been infected by the bluetongue virus. On 31 July that ship was ordered out of port. Four other ships followed the Mawashi Tabuk. They were alleged to have livestock on them infected by bluetongue, sheep pox or some other unspecified disease. Tests were also conducted in the Middle East for brucella melitensis, but this has not yet been cited as a reason for rejection. The point that needs to be made is that brucella melitensis has never been recorded in Australian sheep flocks; neither has bluetongue; neither has sheep pox-those are alleged to have been the diseases that justified these ships being sent out of port and the livestock on them not being received by the Saudi Arabians. </PARA>
<PARA> Not surprisingly, there is always someone anxious to make capital out of someone else's misfortune and the animal liberationists and the animal welfare people have been quick to attach their flag to the mast. And I notice that in yesterday's Australian Mr Graeme McEwen, the President of the Australian and New Zealand Federation of Animal Societies, was critical of the whole livestock exporting industry, particularly the live sheep exporting industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to emphasise that the importance of this industry to rural Australia cannot be overstated. Wethers, the principal part of the live sheep exporting business, play a key role in our balanced approach to agriculture in allowing farmers to have some lay paddocks and enabling them to have a total management structure on their farms. Yet we have seen no real action from the Government in terms of resolving this disastrous dispute. As I said earlier, the value of the live sheep trade in Australia has been estimated at almost $200m and that trade is of particular importance to my own State of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I must point out that the Opposition has not been politically motivated in the way in which it has dealt with this live sheep dispute. In fact, to date we have been totally supportive of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin)--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Dawson says, we have acted in a very responsible way. I do not intend to change that today. Too much is at stake for us to play politics with this industry. We recognise that the absence of the Saudi agricultural Minister, Dr Abdul Al Shaikh, who is overseas-it is presumed he will return some time next week-has made negotiations very difficult. We have not been critical of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and it would be easier to maintain that responsible stance if, on some occasions, it were reciprocated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today, I raise this matter in the grievance debate because I want to highlight the impact of the live sheep export dispute on the Australian economy and more particularly on Australian farmers and on the farmers in the electorate of Wakefield. Summer is coming. With summer will come a shortage of feed and wethers that were being held in anticipation of the opportunity to ship them overseas will have to be destroyed in the paddock. Who will want to buy them as feed shortages increase around Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> As if the impact on my farmers were not enough, I have in my own electorate a feed mill, Johnson's Feed Mill at Kapunda, almost totally dedicated to the production of pelletised livestock feed for livestock being exported overseas by ship. It is a problem that I share with the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who also has a major mill in his electorate. Johnson's Feed Mill at Kapunda is in a small South Australian town of 2,700 people, just an hour north of Adelaide-an almost idyllic setting at the northern end of the Barossa Valley. Between 30,000 and 40,000 tonnes of cereal hay is bought by Johnson's every year. It has an annual turnover of something like $12m. It happens to supply most of the feed for all the livestock leaving South Australia; 32 people employed in Kapunda are directly affected by what will happen to Johnson's. </PARA>
<PARA> I picked up today's Australian and noticed that the Government proposes to pay $701,735 to help with Ansett's wages bill. I ask the Minister at the table: What does the Government propose to do for those directly affected by its failure to successfully negotiate our way out of the live sheep export dispute? I have people in Kapunda directly affected; the member for O'Connor has people in his electorate directly affected; farmers around Australia are directly affected and the Government needs to take action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am angry, and I am going to stay angry with this Government until we receive some justice for the former prisoners of war who served this nation in a time of peril in the Second World War. The Australians who were taken prisoner of war by the Japanese in Malaya, Singapore, and what was then the Dutch East Indies, suffered as no other group has suffered to defend our nation, our freedom and our democratic way of life. During their captivity, ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese experienced slave labour, starvation, sickening brutality, inhumane treatment and neglect. I want from this Government some justice for these men in the last few eventide years they have left on this planet. I am sick and tired of hearing supercilious sympathy that Ministers in this Government have expressed to me on this issue. I do not want sympathy; I want compassion and I want real compensation for these people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thank the Government for the crumbs that fell from its table in the recent budget for the former prisoners of war of the Japanese. Some of the benefits stolen from those prisoners of war in the May statement of 1985 and the Budget of 1987 have been restored. For that I am grateful. But crumbs are not enough. The benefits introduced in this year's Budget are estimated by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to cost around $700,000 whilst the Government this year will retain a Budget surplus of at least $9 billion. But the entitlements accorded to these service men and women in the Budget are really not enough. Are they really an attempt to alleviate the hardships and continuing suffering of these men and women?</PARA>
<PARA> I raise, once again, my demands for justice and compassion for this special group of Australian people. I am calling for two concessions from this Government. I am calling for the establishment of a special pension which should be called `the former Japanese prisoner-of-war disablement adjustment'. This should be set at 200 per cent of the general rate of veterans' pensions and should compensate for the withdrawal in the previous Budgets of the right of veterans to apply for the totally and permanently incapacitated (TPI) pension. The eligibility for this special pension should be assessed in the same way as the TPI pension was assessed. I am also arguing for the right of these former Japanese prisoners of war to end their days in nursing homes free of charge if they so desire. This is a privilege which was made available to all veterans with war disabilities and they were entitled to that prior to the Budget of 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to reiterate the substantial medical evidence behind my claims. The facts are stark, yet horrifyingly real. A total of 550,000 Australians served in all theatres of war. Of these, 19,000 were killed in action-that is 3 1/2 per cent. There were 22,000 Australians taken prisoner of war, of whom 14,000 returned to these shores. More than 36 per cent of those imprisoned by the Japanese died in captivity. That is a startling figure. These prisoners of war of the Japanese were regularly exposed to numerous infections, including diphtheria, bacterial dysentery, respiratory infection, tropical ulcers, malaria and various gastro-intestinal infections. As a consequence of this exposure, the incidence of potentially fatal disease amongst ex-prisoners of war, compared with non-prisoners of war, is excessively high. </PARA>
<PARA> I state once again just some of the poignant clinical evidence which is the basis of my claim. Beri-beri was contracted by 83 per cent of prisoners of war, but only one per cent of non-prisoners of war. What we call `happy feet'-itchy or painful feet associated with vitamin deficiency-was developed in 49 per cent of ex-prisoners of war, as compared with 4 per cent of non-prisoners of war. Cholera was contracted by 7 per cent of ex-prisoners of war whilst this crippling disease was not found amongst any other servicemen serving in that theatre of war. While a long period has elapsed since the inhumane imprisonment of these men and women, some physical and mental effects, resulting from their suffering during the war years, have only become apparent in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> To this day these former Japanese prisoners of war therefore continue to suffer and die as a direct result of what occurred during those 3 1/2 years of deprivation. From 1945 to 1959 their death rate was four times higher than that of other servicemen. Since then they have been dying at a 20 per cent higher rate. They still suffer more from duodenal ulcers, from psychiatric disorders and from gastric diseases than non-prisoners of war. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns and disturbs me greatly is the attitude of the Department of Veterans' Affairs towards just compensation for these former Japanese prisoners of war. That attitude is difficult to comprehend. The Department clearly acknowledges that these service men and women are a special case. It clearly acknowledges that after their imprisonment by the Japanese in 1942 these people suffered conditions of protracted, intense emotional and physical deprivation. I will quote from the Department of Veterans' Affairs handbook explaining the benefits coming out of the recent Budget that was handed down a few weeks ago. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is generally accepted by the community that the ex-prisoners of war (Japanese) suffered particular privations during their war service and that these privations have had a lasting effect on their health and on the well being of their families . . . Medical research has shown that the ex-prisoners of war (Japanese) are more likely than other veterans to suffer from a range of particular diseases. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet the Department then goes on to all but ignore the continuing plight of these service men and women. The Department will do nothing at all to rock the boat or to upset its outdated dogma. I stress that its dogma is outdated. I will again quote to the House from the briefing paper prepared by the Department of Veterans' Affairs which was sent to the Australian Labor Party Caucus to try to counter my arguments to the committee on community affairs and welfare. It shows the reasons why the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which, more than anyone else, should be supporting the claims for justice for the former Japanese prisoners of war, has become the stumbling block to any real progress on this issue. The briefing paper says this:</PARA>
<PARA>The move from the focus on demonstrated need to one of perceived characteristic of a particular group would be to undermine the integrity of the present system. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress the words `to undermine'. To give justice to the prisoners of war would undermine the system. Well, it is about time, I think, that the Department had some compassion and started putting some strength behind its recommendations to the Cabinet that those prisoners of war really deserve compensation. This Government must stop being blinded by the hidebound opinions of the top brass of the Returned Services League and the upper echelons of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Both these groups have consistently worked against the interests of ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese. They have accepted both the logic and the vast array of evidence behind my claims, but they have failed to act upon them. If the Department recognises that the former prisoners of war of the Japanese are a special group, why does it not do something about it?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I will give the details again. Of the 22,000 of our men who left these shores and went to the front line to face the Japanese, 6,500 are left. They are dying at a rate of over 300 a year. More than 2,000 of them are now getting the TPI pension. If 25 per cent of the 4,500 not receiving the TPI applied for this new special pension after a period of three years, it would cost the Government about $5.6m a year. It is politicians and governments who send people to war, so it is about time that this Government faced up to its responsibility and gave compassionate and just compensation to these prisoners of war in the last few eventide years of their lives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to raise in the grievance debate the plight of exporters held to ransom by Australia's archaic ports and the monopoly control of those ports by the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and compare the Government's attitude to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) with its attitude to waterfront reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the Government's attitude towards the AFAP. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wants to smash the Federation and rebuild the aviation industry in Australia from the bottom up. He wants to prevent a wages blow-out, which is commendable in itself, and he wants to win at all costs against the AFAP. The Government and the airlines are working together to break the AFAP. The Federation has committed the sin of working outside the system. The Prime Minister has encouraged the airlines not to negotiate a settlement in this dispute which has gone on for 57 days. The Government has encouraged the strike breaking activity of introducing pilots from overseas. It has encouraged the lockout arrangements where the pilots are not able to work for their airlines. Of course, the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), Bill Kelty, does not agree with the Federation's arrangement because it is outside the system and it is outside the guidelines of the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us compare this with the attitude of the Prime Minister and the Government to the waterfront-a stark contrast to the strong statements made about the pilots. We see the headlines in the Sydney Morning Herald, `Slow motion on the waterfront'. We see in the Australian Financial Review, `Claytons agreement on waterfront reform'. What a change from the headlines we have been reading in recent weeks about the pilots. The main point about the waterfront is the fact that the Government is in a situation where it is negotiating to bring about no change in reality in the conditions on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> The Waterfront Industry Reform Authority is a new committee that has been created to look at the in-principle agreement which has three key elements: three years to implement the reforms of the Inter-State Commission report; total union control; and no hard and fast deadlines to achieve these reforms. I would like to draw the House's attention to the background of the Inter-State Commission's report on the waterfront. It appears that a report appears every five to 10 years on the waterfront and this is just another one of a long line of reports. It is a good report and identifies the major problem. All parties agreed that there was a need for change, especially the exporters of grain, coal and wool. The report indicates the ineffective management on the waterfront, the poor work force training and career arrangements, the introspective industrial relations attitudes, poor response to user needs, the under-utilisation of expensive facilities, especially in the bulk grain facilities and the container terminals, and the abuse of monopoly powers, particularly by the union movement. Add to this a litany of problems. The report goes on to identify high costs, endemic unreliability of those surrounding the waterfront, the high level of disputation, the inappropriate manning levels and work practices, poor discipline, poor motivation by the work force and a pervasive lack of competition in the whole waterfront area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government saw itself as having a role by introducing the Inter-State Commission report in the hope of cleaning up the waterfront. The coalition would go along with that. The parties involved-the stevedores, the unions and the shipowners-have always seen short term solutions to any particular problems that have emerged on the waterfront. As long as a ship could be turned around the shipowner, the stevedore or the farmers would pay up and no one would be particularly responsible. The stevedoring industry is at the heart of the problem and the Commission's report had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>At the heart of the Commission's proposed waterfront plan is the modification of the employment arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Enterprise employment was the thrust of the Inter-State Commission report-that is, that the stevedores should employ their own men and not rely on the pooling arrangements that have been the norm on the waterfront. The competition within the labour market was a point the report identified quite clearly. Page 33 of that report indicates that union monopolies weaken competition within the labour market. How true that is, particularly on the waterfront. Yet on the next page the report says it is unrealistic to have non-union labour on the waterfront, despite the fact that a number of the witnesses brought forward, such as the IDF, said that there ought to be some competition on the waterfront to take away the monopoly power of the Waterside Workers Federation. What a difference between the Government's attitude to union monopoly on the waterfront and the attitude of the Prime Minister to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to draw the House's attention to the historical position on the waterfront. It is a very tough and hard place to work; conditions were poor historically; and the employers themselves were bad and employed the worst kinds of management. Hard physical work was involved and this led to an esprit de corps and a camaraderie amongst those workers in the Waterside Workers Federation. Of course, this led to a monopoly position which has been exploited both politically and commercially by the Waterside Workers Federation. This in turn led to a stranglehold both on Australia's exports and on those companies which wanted to import goods to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Historically, we saw the notorious bull pen in Sydney and other ports around Australia where men who were selected from the pool of labour to work on a particular day developed a set of industrial attitudes from that time which have not helped. The Waterside Workers Federation has been a well led union, with some very good leaders. The workers pay high union dues and boast a 95 per cent union turnout for election ballots, unlike other unions around Australia. Of course, some fundamental changes have taken place on the waterfront. Containerisation of goods, which took place around the world, made a major impact here in Australia and the bulk handling of commodities such as grain and coal changed a number of the requirements of the waterfront. Fewer men were required and a reduction of the numbers took place. But the monopoly position of the Waterside Workers Federation remained. With new technology old attitudes remained in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is reluctantly addressing the change and the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, yet another committee, has put out an in-principle agreement-38 pages of procrastination. Tas Bull himself is on the record as saying that the Waterside Workers Federation will negotiate through yet another committee to maintain the status quo. The key features of the in-principle agreement are that it will take three years to complete and there will be union control of negotiations and no hiring or firing by the employers. Even the name of the in-principle agreement suggests a backing off from these key issues. The major agreement is that the parties have each acknowledged and accepted the need for fundamental, structural and attitudinal change in the waterfront industry. The question is whether there will be the will to implement the changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The parties to these agreements are the ACTU and 10 unions and, on the employers' side, the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour along with some joint venture stevedores in some of the smaller ports. There will be progressive implementation. What a wonderful terminology that is-allowing Tas Bull and the Waterside Workers Federation to go slow in implementing some of these changes. There will be negotiation between employers and unions for enterprise agreements. Paragraph 5.1 stipulates three years for the agreement to come into operation. The early retirements in the document indicate a reduced number of personnel on the waterfront by a net 2,000 men and a rejuvenation of the work force by introducing 1,000 new personnel who are under the age of 50. The interesting point about these requirements is that those who receive early retirement have to be members of the union. The recruitment makes no adjustment for a change in attitude by the new waterside workers who might come and work in that arena. The compulsory redundancy ensures that those new men employed will maintain that monopoly position where they cannot be fired and redundancy will be a last resort. The port transitional lists is another name for the old pooling arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Waterfront reform is slow, it is union dominated and it is strangling the export industries in their endeavours to export products around the world. The Labor Government and the Prime Minister are keen to smash the Australian Federation of Air Pilots but the Hawke Government and the Australian Labor Party are applying intensive care surgery to maintain life in the ailing Waterside Workers Federation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to draw the attention of the House and, indeed, of those listening to this debate to a very important issue in my electorate, namely, the future of the land known as Glenthorne, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) land at the corner of Main South Road and Majors Road on O'Halloran Hill. There have been some suggestions that this land might be used for housing, something which I have been resisting and which I believe will now not occur as a result of some developments on that line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I first want to mention the history of this beautiful property. It was land taken up by Major O'Halloran very early in the history of South Australia. Major O'Halloran arrived in Australia on 15 November 1838 on the Rajastan, very shortly after the date of proclamation of South Australia, and moved to O'Halloran Hill in January 1839. He brought with him a prefabricated wooden house which he called Lizard Lodge because he was descended from a proud old Irish clan, an early chieftain of which was saved from the enemies by a lizard crawling on his face. That was why the house was first called Lizard Lodge and now, of course, it is known as Glenthorne. He built a stone house there and there was a stone coach house built also in April 1839 which had a couple of shot holes so that people could protect themselves from the Aboriginals who were there at that time. Major O'Halloran became a very famous figure in the history of South Australia. He was a member of the first elected Legislative Assembly in 1857 and he was the first chairman of what became the Marion District Council. He was a prominent churchman and when he died at the ripe old age of 73 he was buried in the Christ Church cemetery on O'Halloran Hill in 1870. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the history of this property. It was acquired by the Commonwealth in 1913 as a remount centre and during World War I it served for training horses, mainly for shipment to India. I am told that it was also used for that purpose during the Boer War and it was also used as a remount centre during the Second World War. In fact, a constituent of mine, Mr Col Riley of Morphett Vale, who was stationed there in the Second World War tells me that in 1941 there were about 1,200 troops based there. I am sure that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons), who is at the table, will be interested in that. There were 2,000 or 3,000 horses there; it was the headquarters of the 8th Auxiliary Horse Transport Company and the 3rd Australian Remount Company. We forget that in those days horses were used-very largely to save petrol-to deliver supplies and ordnance. One particular use was to carry wood for cooking, which was much used during the war. Heavy Clydesdales were used to move guns around, timber and so on and the hack horses that were bred there were used for officers to ride around on. Mr Riley tells me that his grandfather who went to the Boer War got his horse from there in 1899, just as many others did later. </PARA>
<PARA> The place is absolutely beautiful and has been well looked after and well restored. The CSIRO leases two-thirds of the property-the whole property is 220 hectares-to the Waite Institute in South Australia and it is farmed in an ecologically sensitive and environmentally productive way with contour ploughing and so forth. In my opinion, it would be an absolute tragedy if this part of the landscape of the southern suburbs of Adelaide were to be sold off for housing. I am very pleased to say that I believe that as a result of efforts that have been made, that will not happen. Many people in the south have actually moved to that area because of the large areas of open space which once existed and to some extent still exist. The vineyards are being sold off and cut up for housing and the beaches are being increasingly encroached upon, so I believe it is very important that we preserve this area for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the very great privilege of walking and driving around the Glenthorne property three or four weeks ago. Mr Blair Cowan, the manager of the farm, took me around and it was quite beautiful, in the midst of suburbs, to find a dam where ducks were nesting and to look at the spring lambs which are now there. That kind of pleasure can be available for everybody. Not many people are fortunate enough to live in an urban environment in which they can go past an area such as this as part of their daily life. Glenthorne helps to provide that opportunity, and I believe that it should be left either as it is, or possibly developed in the future, revegetated as a native flora and fauna park or possibly used as a demonstration farm promoting environmentally sensitive farming practices, as happens now. If we think that there is pressure on open space now, we should ask, for goodness sake, what will it be like in 20 years time. </PARA>
<PARA> I undertook a survey of opinion in my electorate about the future of this property when a proposal was put forward a couple of months ago when a developer expressed interest in buying this land. The response was simply astonishing. I sent out a questionnaire and people simply had to answer the question-`yes, I am happy for Glenthorne to be sold off and cut up for housing' or `no, I do not want Glenthorne sold off for housing, it should be left as it is with the option for future non-housing use'. I have had more than 5,000 responses to that questionnaire. Of those, 18 responses were in favour of cutting up the place for housing and the remainder were in favour of leaving it as I had suggested, or developing it in an open space way for various purposes. I would just like to quote from several of the letters that accompanied the questionnaires. One said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is rare in cities to still have that amount of land still as open paddocks so close to the business centre and it is certainly worth preserving. It is lovely to see the lambs in spring and the native birds during the summer feeding while traffic roars up and down the South Road. It gives the area a rural touch while still allowing us the benefits of suburban living. The possibility of this land becoming a park or a sanctuary is great and is certainly something which I would support. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one letter. Here is another:</PARA>
<PARA>The Glenthorne countryside is the only green belt break between the city and the suburbs in the south. We feel that if the CSIRO want to give up the land it should be developed as a native flora and fauna park, incorporating a demonstration farm in ecological farming practices, so that the younger generation can enjoy the future, and people can learn and experience the beauty of nature. </PARA>
<PARA>Here is another extract from a letter:</PARA>
<PARA>I have lived in the South for 29 years, nearly all my life, I am 31. (Port Noarlunga, O'Halloran Hill and now Hackam). I have two young children, one 20 months and one eight weeks old, and I would like them to see the sheep and especially the baby lambs like I did every time we travelled the South Road. I wish you success with this one. </PARA>
<PARA>Here is another one:</PARA>
<PARA>My wife and I purchased our home in Trott Park because of the views looking over these beautiful paddocks with a rural setting for our retirement. . . It is a coincidence receiving your letter. This past week I spoke to a gentleman at the ``farm'' about how much we enjoyed the sheep and lambs in the paddocks directly behind us. My wife and I do care about this beautiful land. Thank you for caring. </PARA>
<PARA>And so on and so forth. I will not quote all of these because there are so many of them, and they all express the same sorts of views. </PARA>
<PARA> Bolstered by this expression of opinion I wrote to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) again-I had first written to him on this matter months ago, and had spoken to him-and in my letter of 18 September I said:</PARA>
<PARA>I firmly believe that if discussions-</PARA>
<PARA>to which he refers in earlier letters-</PARA>
<PARA>are to continue, the option of a wholesale sell-off of Glenthorne for residential housing development should be ruled out from the very start. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to say that I have had further discussions with the Minister today. I have received a very encouraging response and with the cooperation of the State Government-which I have to acknowledge has also taken the attitude all along that this Commonwealth land should not be sold for that purpose, and which does have zoning responsibility for it-I anticipate very shortly the kind of outcome which will please everybody in the south, with a very few exceptions. This will enable the preservation of a kind of lifestyle in that part of the world which, I am sure, will be popular there and of which I am very proud to have been part of achieving. In short, it looks as though Glenthorne will be saved for the future; will be saved for our children; and the value of that will be more and more appreciated as time goes on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disturbed and disappointed with the Australian Government's blind, uncritical and almost fawning support for an overseas terrorist organisation that has committed, and indeed is continuing to commit, horrific atrocities against several hundred members of the human race. I refer to the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO), a communist-backed terrorist group, which has been trying to win control of Namibia, mainly through violent means. It is structured along undemocratic lines, with bases in Angola and other countries, such as Zambia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The history of SWAPO can be traced back to the 1950s and it has been led for most of its existence by a Mr Sam Nujoma. It has trained many of its recruits in Algeria, Tanzania, China and the Soviet Union. In 1966, after the International Court of Justice threw out the challenge from Liberia and Ethiopia that South Africa should not be in Namibia, or South West Africa as it was called at the time, SWAPO declared from Dar-es-Salaam that it no longer had any alternative `but to rise in arms to bring about our liberation'. Armed clashes between SWAPO and both security forces and Owambo chiefs in the north of the country followed soon after. The Soviets increasingly financed SWAPO's operations in return for SWAPO more and more closely following the USSR's ideological line. In 1976, when Shipanga challenged Nujoma's leadership of SWAPO, he and 1,000 of his followers were thrown into detention and a new SWAPO program was drawn up, based on Marxist-Leninist principles. Fortunately, Shipanga was released in 1978, after pressure from such groups as the International Red Cross. </PARA>
<PARA> A brief history of Namibia is, perhaps, relevant here: it is a country about the size of New South Wales, and 62 per cent of its population of 1 1/4 million live in the north. It is dry, often barren country; it is inhabited by 11 ethnic groups and 11 different languages are spoken. It is Africa's fourth largest mineral producer and is especially rich in gem quality diamonds, uranium and some gold. It has good potential in tourism with its game parks in particular, and in fishing. However, I note that the Eastern bloc countries are exploiting its territorial waters with no payment. It has a very good infrastructure due to South Africa having pumped in billions of rand over the years. I am referring to its roads, its rail network, its excellent international airport, particularly by African standards, its top class hotels and its telephone network. </PARA>
<PARA> Namibia was in German hands from the 1880s until South Africa took over in 1915, in World War I, in a similar way to that in which Australia took over control of Papua New Guinea. South Africa reported regularly to the League of Nations Mandates Commission about this country until the League was disbanded in 1946. After a continuing verbal skirmish between South Africa and the United Nations as to who should have control of Namibia and when and how independence of that nation should take place, agreement was all but reached on this matter in 1978 for independence to go ahead immediately. Regrettably, civil war flared up in neighbouring Angola to the north between the MPLA and UNITA and this conflict became a testing ground for superpower rivalries. For example, several tens of thousands of Cuban troops poured into Angola to act as Soviet surrogates there. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, SWAPO, with what amounted to encouragement from the United Nations, set up bases in Angola from which to launch terrorist attacks into Namibia. South Africa was forced to make incursions into Angola against some of the SWAPO bases, although it is to be stressed not against the Angolan or Cuban forces there. When agreement was finally reached last year on withdrawal of Cuban forces and moves towards peace in Angola, the independence of Namibia again became an imminent possibility. Unfortunately the Angolan conflict had delayed Namibia's independence by more than a decade. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is now possible for United Nations resolution 435 of September 1978, relating to Namibia's independence, to go ahead. Under the present agreement SWAPO forces agreed to remain north of the sixteenth parallel and United Nations peacekeeping forces, including Australian troops, would monitor the transition phase to an internationally supervised free and fair general election in November this year. A multitude of parties have indicated their intention to contest this election the constituent assembly. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to incorporate in Hansard a table listing these various parties. I have cleared it with the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. It will be a proportional representation election and a two-thirds majority will be needed to rule. Despite all the hype from the Socialist Left around the world, including Australia, considerable opposition is growing against SWAPO in Namibia and there are doubts as to whether it will even get its necessary majority, let alone the clean sweep that it has been expected to obtain. This is despite its having the enormous advantage of being an Owambo-based organisation which is as large as all the other ethnic groups combined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reasons for SWAPO's growing un- popularity are three-fold. Firstly, no sooner had their leader, Sam Nujoma, given his absolute guarantee in writing that SWAPO would scrupulously observe the cease-fire and avoid all violence from 1 April this year than heavily armed SWAPO troops made numerous incursions into Namibia. This was an abominable act calculated to take advantage of the cease-fire and is well documented. Secondly, SWAPO misappropriated United Nations funds, including Australian funds, by accepting aid to look after a stated 69,000 refugees when only 35,000 were present. This excess money should be handed back after United Nations inquiry into this fraudulent exercise. Thirdly, and most importantly, horrific accounts are now coming through from refugees who are returning of appalling maltreatments of political prisoners and refugees by SWAPO. Some 1,400 prisoners are still believed to be held by this organisation. Over the last 13 years there have been certainly several hundred, if perhaps not thousands, of victims. They have usually been arrested; accused of being South African spies on trumped up charges; beaten for hours with clubs and radio antenna wire; they have been dropped into seven-metre deep hot, dank, stinking mud pits and incarcerated there for years. </PARA>

Australia has lost one of its most important leaders at the young age of 53 years. He was not only respected throughout the world as a church leader, but also was loved as the friend of millions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> David Penman was as wonderful a human being as any of us is likely to meet. He strove for human rights, justice, tolerance and love throughout the world. He built bridges between people of different colours and creeds and is loved in countries as diverse as Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, Ethiopia and South Africa. He loved his native New Zealand and his adopted Australia and followed our sports with the passion he brought to a range of issues such as poverty, labour relations, multiculturalism, a free media, understanding Islam, and women priests. David's great self-deprecating humour led to his having, probably, the biggest collection of ornamental wombats in the world. My wife, Julie, and son, Scobie, join me in sending love to his widow, Jean, and their children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to draw to the attention of the House problems with the dividend imputation system, introduced on 1 July 1987. A number of constituents in my electorate have found to their disgust that the dividend imputation system has discriminatory consequences for low income earners, such as pensioners and retirees, who are trying to increase their income by investing in companies with franked dividends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The system was introduced to overcome the previous harsh double taxation on dividends. Under the old system tax was imposed on the profit of companies twice-firstly, by taxing the profits of the company itself and, secondly, by taxing the dividends received by shareholders. Now, when an investor receives a franked dividend, however, he receives a credit for the tax already paid by the company and, effectively tax free, these imputed or franked dividends are very attractive to investors. </PARA>
<PARA> The trap for unwary players, however, is that the shareholder is only entitled to a rebate, or a reduction in tax liability, equal to the amount of his imputation credit. Unfortunately, this means that while many low income earners, pensioners and others, were attracted as investors to companies with franked dividends, they have not been able to reap the full benefit. For example, assuming a pensioner receives a total dividend of $1,000 from his share portfolio, 49 per cent of this will be paid by the company in tax. The pensioner, or a shareholder, will then be left with 51 per cent, or $510. While he or she will have to disclose and pay tax on the full $1,000, that person can claim a credit for the tax already paid by the company up to the amount of their tax payable. But the problem arises where the shareholder is only liable to $400 tax; he can only claim this and he loses the benefit of the extra $90. Because of the nature of their small tax liability it means that, in the main, pensioners and low income earners are discriminated against. If they had higher incomes, they could offset more of the tax already paid by the company. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) should introduce legislation to prevent this trap from catching low income earners. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the opportunity today to point out to the House that the Federal seat of La Trobe was named after Charles Joseph La Trobe, who was a previous Victorian Governor. People often get confused and think that the seat was named after La Trobe University, or La Trobe Valley, but of course that is not the case. However, it is the case that on 3 September 1839 Governor La Trobe arrived as the Superintendent of the Port Phillip district. This week there was a gathering of his family, his descendants in Victoria, at his cottage. They were there to commemorate the 150th anniversary of his arrival in Melbourne. The occasion was marked by the planting of a 150th anniversary tree. As the member whose electorate is named after Charles Joseph La Trobe, I thought it most appropriate to point out this matter to the House and, indeed, to wish the family of Governor La Trobe well.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think it is fair to point out that something like 20,000 pharmacy assistants are under threat from the present situation where the chemist dispensing fees are being reduced by 23 per cent. But I am most concerned about the ordinary citizens of Australia who are concerned and do care about the situation and the future of the pharmacists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have here some 5,000 letters from my constituents to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) asking him to do something personally. At the appropriate time, as soon as my speaking time is expired, I will ask the very friendly, very kindly Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons), who is at the table, whether I can give him a couple of plastic bags full of letters to deliver personally to the Prime Minister with my compliments-and his compliments. This issue is of vital importance to every person in Australia. I will have another 5,000 letters coming early next week and I will deliver those personally to the Prime Minister as well. This makes the point that the people of Australia are deeply concerned when they are prepared to sit down, write letters and put them in envelopes. As I said, I have 5,000 letters here, all personally addressed to the Prime Minister, and I now ask the Minister at the table to take them for me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last month I was pleased to be part of a ceremony celebrating the planting of the one millionth tree by the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers (ATCV). The tree itself was planted by celebrated conservationist and artist Clifton Pugh. The next tree representing the start of the second million trees, was planted by noted broadcasting gardener and conservationist Kevin Heinz, a resident of Montrose in my electorate of Streeton.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the efforts like this by the ATCV, the objective announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to plant one billion trees by the year 2000 becomes more than a possibility. A properly constructed program can make the regreening of Australia a fact. Australia has fragile soils, limited water and a rising water table, along with increased salinity. Our past deforestation has contributed to this deterioration of the Australian environment and to the greenhouse effect. The solution demands a vast reafforestation program, as outlined by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The program need not be expensive. According to Rural Trees Australia Ltd, the use of the rapidly developing technology of direct seeding would mean Australia's 150,000 professional farmers could plant two billion trees, committing on average no more than 13.5 hectares of their land, at an average cost of $1,350. Urban dwellers could also `reforest' the suburbs in private gardens and public parklands. The ATCV has set the example of direct tree planting. Its slogan `the working environmentalist' is truly earned. I congratulate the movement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I take this opportunity to congratulate the director, staff and students of the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education in Toowoomba, as it moves towards full university status in 1992. While Toowoomba is a provincial centre of educational excellence at the primary, secondary and technical and further education and tertiary levels, Dr Lindsay Barker and his institute team have established a very special national and international reputation for high academic standards. It is no accident that the institute is now the second largest distance education centre in the nation. I know that it will go from strength to strength over the next three years, particularly in the area of research, and I look forward to its inevitable emergence as the University of Southern Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On a sour note, in the recent press I have seen the institute being used as a political football by Queensland Young Labor, a mouthpiece for Mr Goss's Opposition Labor Party in the lead-up to the State election later this year. These people are simply regurgitating the unsubstantiated accusations of nepotism and malpractice put about in the Queensland media 10 years ago. I can only suggest to Queensland Young Labor and Mr Goss that they put up or shut up and let the institute get on with its primary task of educating our kids rather than dealing with political mischief makers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, as I rise to make this 90-second statement, I think I will refer briefly to what the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) said about Queensland. We all know about Queensland, the place of corruption. Anyone who wants to go there can learn about a political system that has been gerrymandered and rorted for years and years. I am pleased to say that I belong to a party which, when it takes power there in the next few months, will at least get a broom through the place-no pun intended-and clean up that area in Queensland. It is a disgrace up there, and one can only say that it is about time the people of Queensland woke up to the National Party; woke up to exactly what it is doing along with its Liberal Party cohorts. It is time the people threw out the Nationals and got back to decent, stable Labor Party government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must congratulate the newly nominated chief of the Queensland Police Force. He is a Victorian, of course. The Queenslanders would have to have a Victorian up there to clean up that place. It is a disgrace. The corruption has gone on for too long; the electorates are just out of control. Once again Mr Cooper has said that he will not honour the report of the Fitzgerald Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct and he will have nothing to do with the fair realignment of the boundaries. Once again the National Party has reneged on something that it said it would do. </PARA>

The dilemma facing the live sheep exporting industry has been largely overshadowed by the protracted pilots dispute, but live sheep exports to Saudi Arabia, worth at least $100m a year, have ceased. Does the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) recognise the importance of this industry, not only to our economy, but also to balanced agricultural practice in Australia? Will the Prime Minister give an undertaking to intervene should negotiations in the next week fail to find a solution? What sort of compensation does the Government plan to pay to the farmers, exporters and livestock feed manufacturers whose businesses are substantially at risk due to circumstances entirely beyond their control?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These questions deserve to be answered. Unsubstantiated allegations of disease are being allowed to cripple an important rural industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to use this opportunity to draw the attention of the House to the very peculiar practice of the Queensland Government in relation to `phantom projects'. It has been a particular trait of this Government since the National Party took power in its own right, every time an election comes around to announce a series of you beaut community service projects. One in particular is the building of a hospital in the township of Caboolture within my electorate. This particular hospital has been promised by local National Party State members since 1974 and, of course, at every State election it gets trotted out again. The current State National Party member for the area is no exception and he is now going out claiming that this hospital should be built.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Queensland Government has no intention of actually building this facility; there is no funding provided in the recently passed Queensland Budget and despite an increase in funding to that State from the Commonwealth and the Medicare arrangements, which would allow expanded public hospital places, there is no intention on the part of the Government to actually honour that promise. Like the railway for Redcliffe or power stations in the Gladstone region or a whole range of other projects which keep getting trotted out, year after year, this very much needed project will not eventuate until the corrupt National Party Government in Queensland and its spineless Liberal colleagues are assigned to the Opposition benches. </PARA>

So, honourable members should not for a moment stand up here in this place and suggest that there is anything new about electoral rigging and gerrymandering in Queensland. Everything came from previous Labor Party governments and the people of Australia should be very much aware that in history it is Labor Party governments that have provided the best examples of corruption, the best examples of gerrymander and the best examples of breaking promises that this country has seen.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member's question goes to probably the most important issue that is before us today-that of improving productivity and restructuring our industries to make them internationally competitive. I have seen briefly the report that the honourable member has referred to. I have not had an opportunity to go through it in detail but I understand the views put by Mr Webber. They are somewhat in contradiction with the viewpoint of the BCA President, but I will come to that in a moment. It is quite natural that award restructuring should focus in the early stages upon manufacturing, particularly the metal trades industry. It is in manufacturing that we have the fastest growth in activity in world trade, and we need, more than anything else, to improve our performance in that area. Similarly, the metal industry award is a key award in the whole wage-setting process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, it is quite natural that the metal trades industry should figure very prominently very early in the award restructuring process. That point was also made, as I mentioned, by the BCA President, Dean Wills, in a recent letter to the Prime Minister in which he emphasised the need for improvement in the metal trades industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The award restructuring will be what the industry and managers make it. The mechanism--</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members-What about Bill Kelty?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is determined not to understand what award restructuring is about. To do everything possible to block the improvement that is coming, on the other side they mouth these platitudes about productivity. Productivity begins with improving arrangements in the workplace and with award restructuring. It is something that this Government is determined to do. Members of the Opposition can stay on the wayside by themselves, but if they have any concern about our country at all they should not get in the way of the process. Industry wants it. The process is not helped when the shadow Minister for industrial relations gets up on his high horse and criticises industry leaders and business for their support of the accord, of stability and of restraint in wage cost growth. Members of the Opposition should get off the tram, get out of the way and cease being an obstruction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Progress in award restructuring will be that which managers initiate. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission in its recent decision has set the mechanisms in place for progress to be made. But nothing will move unless managers move. If there is benign and sloppy management and if we have sloths in industry, progress will not be made. The work force will participate. The trade union movement is leading in this process and the Government is giving support to it. But industry itself and industry managers must initiate processes in their own workplaces.</PARA>

Is it further a fact that according to the CAA Acting General Manager, Safety, in Western Australia, Mr Scaife, Captain Smith had `a known history for deliberately breaking rules'?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, the document on which the honourable member for Hume is relying is a document which was addressed to Mr Freeland, the Chief Executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, from his Acting General Manager in the Victoria-Tasmania Division of the Authority. It was dated 28 September. The first that Mr Freeland knew about this document was when he got phone calls from the press yesterday asking him questions about it. It was in the hands of the press before it was in the hands of Mr Freeland; in fact, he still has not received the original. I mention that as background because this document, which was obviously leaked by someone to the newspapers, on the face of it was prepared for the Chief Executive but one wonders exactly for whom it was prepared. The reality is, as I said yesterday, that the normal procedure was for pilots to be authorised by check captains of the airlines or by examiners employed by the Civil Aviation Authority. That was the normal procedure, and that is the procedure that has been used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the use of Captain Radnedge is concerned, it is a fact that Captain Radnedge was the Civil Aviation Authority's examiner of airmen in Western Australia. He had been employed by East West Airlines and, in the absence of the Civil Aviation Authority having an examiner of airmen in Western Australia, Captain Radnedge was loaned back to the Civil Aviation Authority for one day and in that capacity as consultant performed the licence approval. Of course, until a few days before, he had been the examiner of airmen. If Opposition members want to suggest that he was not qualified to do that, that is a ridiculous assertion. The man had been the Civil Aviation Authority's examiner of airmen in Western Australia for some time and was obviously qualified to conduct the tests. In any case, he approved Captain Smith, who went on to become the check captain for Ansett Western Australia. Captain Smith trained the French pilots, who were subsequently authorised and licensed to operate flights in Australia. They were approved by BAe captains, who are check captains and conduct this kind of activity around the world, and also subsequently by Ansett's own check captain. There can be no suggestion that Captain Smith was not qualified to train to undertake the task for which he was approved by Captain Radnedge, so the whole point of the question disappears.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question and particularly for the moderate manner in which he has raised it, which was different from when he raised the matter privately. It may be helpful to honourable members if I answer the second part of the question first, which concerns the background to the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1988, at the conclusion of a scientific meeting between Australia, New Zealand and Japan, scientists from those countries put a recommendation to the trilateral management group that the only safe catch level for bluefin tuna would be zero. The report went on to say that if managers feel that other considerations prevent an immediate reduction of this magnitude, the unanimous feeling of the scientists was that the immediate reduction should be at least half of the current catches. The quota cuts which were effected last year as a result of the advice reduced catch levels to nearly half the previous year's level. These cuts were seen as a first step towards achieving the necessary stock recovery. I should say that the industry accepted those cuts in a most responsible manner. No doubt these reductions caused difficulties across all major sectors of the fishery in southern Australia, which is the concern of the honourable member for Grey and particularly his constituents in Port Lincoln. There has also been an adverse effect in Western Australia, Japan and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> Population analysis by Australian scientists during the last 12 months has shown that there is no improvement in parental biomass as far as the fish are concerned, leading Australian scientists to continue their recommendation at this year's trilateral meeting. Acting on that information, the Government has decided to press for a global moratorium on the taking of southern bluefin tuna. New Zealand is supporting Australia's call for the zero catch level, which was the original recommendation. The Australian Government has never countenanced a unilateral moratorium. That would make no sense for the interests of either the Australian industry or the fish stock, which is the concern of the scientists.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government believes that without a drastic catch reduction there is a very real possibility that the industry will suffer a complete collapse. The purpose of pressing for a moratorium this year is to allow a recovery of southern bluefin tuna stocks. It is important to prevent parent stock declining to a point from which it cannot recover. If this is not achieved and there is a stock collapse the Australian industry, which is valued at about $45m-the figure referred to in the press report that has been drawn to my attention-would become zero for many years. At least a moratorium would give a chance of stock recovery. Only if the stocks are allowed to recover can a profitable tuna industry exist in the long term. That, of course, would benefit both tuna fishers and Australia as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> Briefly turning to the first part of the question, the Government is aware that any decision regarding this fishery will have an impact on Port Lincoln as the bulk of the southern bluefin tuna fishery is located there. The Government is concerned at the industry's lack of support for that moratorium. It places Australia in a very difficult negotiating position when the industry takes an opposing view to that which the Government is putting. Of course, the Government recognises that in the short term a moratorium will cause hardship among southern bluefin tuna fishers, but the stage has been reached where tough decisions are needed if the fishery is to be saved from commercial and possible biological extinction, because that is what we are facing. The Government is not afraid to take those decisions for the long term benefit of the industry. The negotiations on the southern bluefin tuna quotas will recommence in Canberra on 8 October. I am not in a position at this stage, of course, to foreshadow the outcome of those discussions.</PARA>

The second major item the Council will consider will be Australia's core capacity in science and technology and our ability to respond to a uniquely rapid period of change internationally.

I certainly do not have any naive view that President Gorbachev's success is inevitable, unfortunately, but the policies he is pursuing are important to the emergence of a less confrontationist international environment overall. We now see signs that we will all benefit from such an environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A dramatic example is worth noting with respect to the positive effect of the current changes. That has been seen, of course, in Hungary, which the Prime Minister visited recently and which hosted a Cairns Group meeting last year, and in Poland. Both countries are undergoing far-reaching changes which offer prospects of great benefit to their people and to the world. The position on this has been made very clear by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. The difficulties faced by both countries are daunting. Australia, along with a group of 23 other Western nations, has been able to participate in a coordinated effort to assist them during this critical period of adjustment.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1575" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BONYTHON" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Oxley for his question and take the opportunity to congratulate him on his first year's service in this Parliament. He is the only honourable member on this side of the House whose service has been unique to the new Parliament House. In asking this question he recognises the great community benefit, particularly to the least well-off in the community-not a group of great interest to those opposite; that is why they are chattering away. But at least he recognises that the bulk billing process is of benefit to the least well-off in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last month I indicated that community support for Medicare had reached an all time high of 71 per cent and increasingly was being accepted as a part of Australian life. That same research reveals that one of the main perceived advantages of Medicare to the Australian people is that it financially helps the less well-off and includes direct billing. Indeed, over two-thirds of those surveyed-68 per cent-think that direct billing is a good thing. Less than one in five people-some 19 per cent-oppose direct billing. The honourable member for Tangney should take those statistics into account in his planning.</PARA>
<PARA> Today I am pleased to be able to report that the figures for the June quarter 1989 show that direct billing of all medical services is at the highest level yet. Fifty-six per cent of all services are now direct billed, up 10 percentage points since 1985 and up three percentage points since last year. For general practitioners (GPs) the level of direct billing is even higher. Almost two-thirds-65 per cent-of all GP services are now directly billed; that is, they are provided at no cost to the patient. This is up 12 per cent on 1985 and 3 1/2 percentage points over the last year.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Oxley will be interested to know that this trend is reflected Australia-wide. In Queensland the level of direct billing of all medical services is up four percentage points to 58.4 per cent. Direct billing of GP services in the last year in Queensland has risen by five percentage points to 67.5 per cent of all services. I am also particularly pleased that the ACT, where bulk billing has been disappointing in the past, is at last beginning to catch up to the rest of the nation. The level of direct billing of all medical services in the ACT has risen by six percentage points-the highest rise in the last year-to 36.5 per cent, while the level of direct billing of GP services in the last year rose from 41.4 per cent to 47.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> We can now say that general practitioners, particularly in the ACT, are clearly recognising the importance of direct billing, bulk billing, for the least well-off. While there is strong community support for that, while increasingly the medical profession is observing direct billing practices, I notice that in one of those leaks we get about Opposition health policy-all we have had about it for roughly five years is leaks-the Medical Observer of 3 August states that direct billing for the general community is not to be a feature of the new Liberal health scheme. That is more proof that whatever proposal comes forward from the Opposition benefits the well off perhaps but certainly disadvantages the least well-off.</PARA>

<PARA> That this House censures the Minister for Transport and Communications for:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) misleading the House by:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) his statements yesterday that the CAA had not compromised safety during the current pilots' dispute;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) his statement that the Government has no part in licensing procedures for foreign pilots; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) his statements that the testing of foreign pilots is being conducted in line with normal procedures; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) failing in his Ministerial duties to ensure the continued maintenance of Australia's high civil aviation standards and calls for his immediate resignation. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we are in the seventh week of the pilots dispute, with a country that is bleeding and with a government that keeps telling us that we will now get back to 50 per cent of our normal services. We have been told that by next week we will have 60 per cent of normal air services operating. If we go back through the history of this dispute we will see that by now, from statements by Ministers of this Government and from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in particular, we should have the entire fleets of Pan American World Airways, British Airways and United Airlines Inc. flying around Australia. In fact, we have become the Liberia of the South Pacific. We have in Australia a makeshift fleet of aircraft flying, aircraft from the most amazing places. It is true that we have aircraft from France, from the United States and now from the United Kingdom. The latest arrival is a Liberian registered, Irish operated, 22-year-old Boeing 707 aircraft used for freight duty in Europe. It has been hired by Australian Airlines Ltd. It is now before the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to receive approval for Australian Airlines to use it to fly regular passenger traffic in Australia. I was delighted to hear the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) say that that application has not yet been approved. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation really points to the fact that there is a world shortage of aircraft, a world shortage of pilots, and that this Government has misled the people of Australia virtually from day one of this particular dispute. All the way through we have heard of these tremendous percentages of services that are allegedly operating around Australia. We keep hearing stories of these magnificent charter aircraft that will arrive in Australia at the end of the charter season. How many do we have? We have two 737 aircraft from a French charter company and one inter-European charter aircraft from Great Britain, owned by Aspro Holidays. I suggest that the line of the Government obviously will be that `Aspro will ease it'. I tell the Government that the travelling public of Australia will not play a part in this particular government operation because it knows that it is virtually impossible to book services in advance; it is virtually impossible to travel when it wants to, and it is virtually impossible to travel more than one leg of a journey at a time. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had the Minister for Transport and Communications in here today at Question Time making denials of reports that have been given to his Department by very senior officers. These people are not the flunkies of the Civil Aviation Authority; these men hold very senior positions within the Department; these men are, in fact, responsible for the air safety standards of Australia; these men are expressing very grave concern at what is happening in civil aviation in Australia. Australia has always had a very proud international aviation record. We have prided ourselves in having one of the best aviation records in the world. Yet in the last seven weeks or so we have seen this particularly proud record being diluted all the time when compromises have been made. We have seen our aviation industry taken over by a group of pilots from the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Hungary and now from Yugoslavia. Where will the next pilots come from? Maybe it will be Ireland if ever this 707 aircraft gets off the deck. But who knows?</PARA>
<PARA> The plain facts are that we have a very serious situation in Australia. It is not good enough for the Minister to come in here and say that the reports that have come from very senior officers in his Department are to be scoffed at. All the way through the Government has led us to believe that there will be no compromise of safety whatsoever. We have just heard the Minister for Transport and Communications deliver his statement as to what happened with the Air Maritime aircraft the other day out of Sydney. I hope that in his reply to me today the Minister will also answer these questions: Has he yet received an air safety incident report regarding the flight of an Air Maritime 737 aircraft last night, 4 October, on approach into Sydney? Is it a fact that Air Traffic Control in Sydney directed that aircraft to fly to 3,000 feet but not below the distance measuring equipment step process? Is it a fact that that aircraft either ignored or did not understand that instruction and was in general air traffic space at 3,000 feet over the city of Camden?</PARA>
<PARA> We want an answer to those questions because that event is the subject of an air safety incident report and we want to know what happened. This sort of thing is going on despite the fact that even the Government's propaganda unit, the National Media Liaison Service, has produced a statement from the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) who, through the Government propaganda machine, has continually given us assurances that there will be no breaches of Australian air safety standards. We have already introduced to the House evidence that there have been very great difficulties with the French pilots passing the examination set by the Civil Aviation Authority. I think it is really sad when we look at this particular report from Mr Lewino to read what he has had to say about some of the things that have happened. The Minister should really address himself to what is the true situation of the working conditions and the times worked by the management pilots in the airlines. Mr Lewino in his statement says:</PARA>
<PARA> A more serious consequence, which has manifested itself over the last week, is that the operational managers are becoming fatigued. They are flying to the full limit of flight and crew duty rules (in one case, over these limits) and attempting to perform their normal management functions as well. I have received several telephone call from managers, trying to catch up with their work during the brief turn-around between flights. Also, although nominally on a `rest day' at home, managers continue to perform management tasks by the telephone. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the three-day period, 23-25 September, Ansett requested three extension of flight and crew duty time. I raised this with Ansett's Director of Operations, Captain Dorward, on the 26th. He was annoyed as he had directed no such requests should be made and undertook to repeat this instruction. At the time, Captain Dorward stated that working to the prescribed limit was very tiring for management pilots and he could not accept any increase. </PARA>
<PARA> There is other evidence of fatigue. Normally, cool calm managers are becoming terse . . . and they look tired. People like Captain Dorward seem to have aged several years. </PARA>
<PARA>The report then contains this line which we must take notice of because we understand that everything is normal and we hope that there will not be any other directions from the Minister or from the Department. In this particular document Mr Lewino goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of this development, I have directed my RPT Examiners to increase their line surveillance of Ansett operations and to be on particular lookout for evidence of fatigue induced errors, unreasonable irritability, etc. I have asked to be immediately informed of all such observations as I believe it may be necessary to impose additional rest periods on management pilots. </PARA>
<PARA>That certainly is a responsible situation. But the plain facts are that, to maintain the Prime Minister's motley collection of airlines in Australia, these fellows have had not only to be able to work to the limit but, in one case, to go over the limit. I move on to the situation that has been pooh-poohed by the Minister in the Parliament today. I raise the situation of Captain Colin Smith, who was brought to head a program of training for the foreign BAe146 pilots from France and Hungary who were drawn from Thomas Nationwide Transport's cargo operation in Europe. This report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Captain Smith had previously been with Ansett WA and had retained his currency with their operations during regular visits to Perth. It was arranged for Captain Smith to have his NZ check captain status validated for Australia by undertaking a flight test with Captain Radnedge. This officer had, until a few weeks ago, been the CAA's BAe 146 Examiner in Perth. He had resigned to take a position with East West but was made available to the CAA, on a ``free consultancy'' basis, to perform the test. Captain Smith passed and was verbally advised by my Senior RPT Examiner, Captain Jones, that he was approved as an Ansett check captain. This has not been confirmed in writing, as will be explained later. </PARA>
<PARA> The only concern about Captain Smith at that stage was advice from Mr Scaife, AGM (SR) in WA, that he had a known history at deliberately breaking rules. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, he had been approved to give a demonstration flight at an air show and had exceeded the safety limitation laid down in the approval. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I first became personally concerned about Captain Smith on 14 September, when he rang me about the Instrument Rating theory exams of the six French pilots. This exam had been completed the previous day and the examination officers in both Vic./Tas. and HQ became concerned when the answers on the papers were virtually identical. Cheating was suspected and Mr Thomas, acting AGM (OPS), advised me he intended to declare the results invalid. He agreed to defer doing this for a few hours while I investigated the matter as I believed another explanation was possible. Before attempting the exam, the French pilots had been given intensive coaching by two instructors and I thought it was possible the common answers to the exam might be due to the effectiveness of this specific purpose training. As Captain Smith was unavailable, I arranged through Ansett's Training Manager for Mr Fry, my senior Examination Officer, and Mr Moss, my Investigation Officer, to interview the instructors on an `informal' basis. I sent Mr Moss along as he developed over the years a proven ability to detect liars. By asking the instructors certain questions from the exam paper which all of the French pilots had answered incorrectly it was established that in two areas the instructors gave exactly the same erroneous answer as the French. Mr Moss was also of the opinion that the instructors spoke frankly and were unlikely to be involved in any cheating. The meeting with the first instructor, which took place in a room in Ansett's training facility, was amicable and the instructor thanked my officers for pointing out where his instruction was inaccurate. </PARA>
<PARA> I was therefore surprised when Captain Smith rang me in a highly emotional state and accused me of deliberately sabotaging the training of the French pilots . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This saga goes on. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The next morning Mr Thomas arrived in Melbourne to handle the America West arrangements. I informed him of our concerns about Captain Smith and that I intended to withdraw his check pilot approval. In return, Mr Thomas advised that Captain Smith and Mr McMahon, Ansett's GM, had contacted him late the previous evening, via Minister Willis' office, to protest at the French requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>We heard at Question Time today that this was quite a normal procedure; that all this went through the office. I am not quite sure how many people in the House know Mr Graham McMahon. He is a most assertive character, and I can imagine exactly what that conversation was likely to have been when it went through the Minister's office. The plain facts are that we have a very difficult situation in terms of what really happened with those examinations in Western Australia, and we have a very serious concern in regard to the certifying of the Air Maritime pilots' licences because of their lack of capacity to understand the English language. All of these things must really worry the members of this House and the public of Australia if we are to maintain those safety standards to the degree that we believe they should be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me quote a little further from the document concerning this examiner, Captain Smith. This incident just kept going on between Ansett, the CAA, the Minister's office and everyone else who was involved. One of the quotations in this report concerns Mr Alan Rainbird. Mr Rainbird, of course, is one of the most senior executives of the Civil Aviation Authority. Mr Rainbird said that he doubted this particular officer's report on the pilot. Mr Lewino said:</PARA>
<PARA>I gained the impression he thought my judgement was distorted as a result of this. Also, that my differences with Captain Smith were known to everybody from the `Prime Minister on down'. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is no doubt that the Prime Minister has been involved in this incident about this check captain. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Again I reached the impression that there was a belief my concerns about Captain Smith's suitability as a check pilot was unjustified and the result of personal dislike. I suggested that Captain Segen, Captain Radbone and Mr Scaife be approached to gain other opinions but Mr Rainbird declined. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the senior officers of the CAA had decided that Captain Smith was probably not the right person to undertake the duties of a check captain on these foreign pilots flying around Western Australia in BAe 146s. Of course everybody from the Prime Minister down knew the story about Captain Smith. We know, through the Minister's office, that there was intervention about the certifying of Captain Smith as a check officer for the BAe 146s as well. I believe that that should give us a great deal of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> We do have a great deal of concern about what is going on in the aviation industry in Australia today. We are concerned that the pilots who are flying are being pushed to their limits. We are concerned that people are now on the verge of being overworked. We are concerned that normal instructions from air traffic control are not being understood by some of these pilots. We are concerned that we now have a mixture of international pilots flying around Australia who may not have the capacity to understand the English language to the extent that they should have to fly regular passenger traffic in Australia. Yet we have been told by the Government all the way through that everything is all right. Everything is not all right. Concerns are coming from all over Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it perfectly clear that it is not only our judgment that things are not what they should be. There have been some changes in the procedures for the certification of aircraft in Australia during the period of this dispute. It is interesting to note in a CAA circular to all its managers around Australia headed `Surveillance of Foreign and Military Operations' that military aircraft are the responsibility of the Department of Defence. We have no problems there. The circular states:</PARA>
<PARA>Foreign aircraft conducting commercial operations into and/or within Australia are in two categories . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We have in that category overseas carriers who are presently carrying domestic traffic. That circular sums up the situation of these foreign charter airlines. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Foreign operators authorised to operate on Australian domestic routes. At present there is only one prospective operator in this category, that is America West. It is envisaged that America West's aircraft (B737) and crews will operate under dry lease arrangements to Ansett and under the provisions of Ansett's Air Operators' Certificate. Technical surveillance of America West in Australia will remain the responsibility of the US FAA and that Authority will position staff in Australia for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>Do we have any evidence that staff have been stationed in Australia for that purpose? I know that America West carries its own engineer on each of its flights. It is interesting that Australian engineers are not allowed anywhere near these foreign aircraft. The circular goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>However, it is envisaged that operational surveillance will be the responsibility of the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA>It mentions operational surveillance but there is nothing about the airworthiness of these aircraft. I think that must give us some cause for concern as well, especially when we see some of the types of aircraft that are presently coming into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that a number of honourable members in this House have expressed a great deal of concern to me at the reports they are getting about the Liberian Boeing 707 that is yet to be certified by the CAA. I just hope that we will not have a problem with the Minister. Although the CAA has not provided that certification we do not want to see any short cuts whatsoever on that aircraft. We have had reports about cracked frames on the landing gear, about door seals not working properly, and about harness restraints on the seats within aircraft not being right. All these things must be of concern and they must be checked out before any thought of certification can be given to that aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> Right throughout this pilots dispute this House and this nation have been given information all the way down the line that, frankly, is not true. The information that has been provided by the Prime Minister in terms of the seating capacity that is available in Australia is not true. The information about the number of aircraft that will be operating in Australia also is not true. If we are to reach the level of passenger traffic that is required to meet the Prime Minister's numbers, regarding the percentage of available seats around Australia, today there should be 157 Boeing 737 flights full up with 130 people on each aircraft. That is not happening. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not been told the truth in this instance. We have not been told the truth about what has been going on in the CAA. We have not been told the truth about the adjustments that have been made to safety standards. This Minister is responsible and because he has not been completely truthful with us he deserves to be censured. The Opposition parties call on this Minister to resign. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion that has been moved by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) accuses me of misleading the House in various respects and calls for my resignation. Anyone listening to what he had to say in his 20 minutes would hardly feel that he had enough information or anything like an argument which would justify censure of me, let alone cause my resignation. Let me say emphatically that I stand absolutely by the statements I made to this House yesterday during Question Time. I refute absolutely any suggestion that I have misled the House. Nothing that has been said by the honourable member for Fadden today could in any way lead any objective listener to believe that I had misled the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the formal motion, which the honourable member hardly spoke to, he said that I had misled the House in my statements yesterday that the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had not compromised safety during the current pilots dispute. The CAA has a statutory obligation to ensure that there will be a safe aviation operation in this country. In my view, the CAA carries out that obligation with considerable expertise, but of course not without internal dispute sometimes as to what should happen. It does not mean that it is a unanimous organisation in which everybody views every situation absolutely and in the exact same way. There will be differences of opinion at times. Where there are those differences of opinion obviously the senior officers with responsibility should take the final decision. That is essentially all that we have before us at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents leaked from within the CAA even before they reached the senior officers to whom they were intended to go have simply indicated that there is a difference of view within the organisation. That difference of view needs to be looked at, particularly in the case of Mr Lewino, because the circumstance which he is describing has not been properly stated and has been supplemented by other actions since he finished that report. Essentially what Mr Lewino is saying in his lengthy document, which was quoted at some length by the honourable member for Fadden, is that he was concerned about Captain Smith. He did not like him particularly. He thought his manner was not so terrific and he was therefore concerned about the BAe146 operation for Ansett Western Australia. I think the reality of the situation is that Mr Lewino had a difference of opinion with his senior officials about, firstly, the capacities of Captain Smith and, secondly, whether the BAe check captains who were in Australia were appropriate persons to approve the French pilots for flight operations in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The BAe check captains are highly experienced pilots who have set up BAe 146 operations in various countries around the world, including Australia. These same BAe check captains are the people who came to Australia five years ago when the 146 operation was set up in Western Australia. They effectively established that operation. They participated in the compilation of the operations manual for Ansett Western Australia BAe 146 operations. They trained the Ansett Western Australia pilots and conducted flight checks of those pilots who were being endorsed on the 146, the new aircraft at that time. Who could argue that these BAe check captains who were in Australia and who set up the Ansett Western Australia operation when it first started are not appropriate persons now to approve the French pilots for their capacity to operate the service in Western Australia? Given those circumstances-they may not have been known to Mr Lewino; he does not refer to them in his lengthy document-it was the view of the senior officers of the CAA that there was no reason not to approve a circumstance in which the BAe check captains were deemed to be the appropriate persons who could approve the French pilots for operations in Western Australia. That is what happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Lewino was also saying that he thought the senior check captain of the Ansett operation should conduct the approval. That also happened. The very day this document was written, 28 September, Captain Hanrahan from the Ansett check and training operation went to Western Australia and conducted his own independent and additional check of the French pilots. He also approved them. So there can be no doubt whatsoever that the French pilots flying in Western Australia have been properly authorised by people who are reputable and fully qualified to approve the operations by those pilots of 146 flights in Western Australia. I think any other conclusion that can be drawn in those circumstances obviously falls to the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been said that there are other concerns, particularly looking at the other document from Mr Segan, who makes all sorts of allegations. They were hardly referred to at all by the honourable member for Fadden. </PARA>

<PARA> The second leg of this censure motion on me was for my statement that the Government has no part in licensing procedures for foreign pilots. I stand absolutely by the fact that the Government has not been involved in any way in putting pressure on the CAA about the licensing procedures for foreign pilots. We have not been interfering in that. That is a matter for the CAA. There is no proof whatsoever to justify this allegation, made at length in the Senate this morning and also in this House. All that the Opposition has is the circumstance I referred to during Question Time when there was a phone call to my office late one night from the General Manager of Ansett, who complained about the CAA. He was given the name of an officer of the CAA to speak to and his home phone number. That is supposed to implicate the Government, as though we are involved in some heinous activity to put pressure on the CAA. What a ludicrous, ridiculous suggestion. Am I not to tell Ansett anything about the CAA? Obviously it was the sensible thing to do, and that is all that was done. There are a couple of allegations about political interference, but there is no substance whatsoever in those allegations. Frankly, these officers would not know if there was or there was not. They are not in a position to know. I absolutely deny that there has been government interference in the licensing procedures for foreign pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> The third leg of this motion is that I misled the House by my statements that the testing of foreign pilots is being conducted in line with normal procedures. This is what I said in the House yesterday at Question Time with regard to foreign pilots:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the CAA is ensuring through flight checks and oral or written tests that these pilots are competent. The tests are conducted in line with normal procedure by check captains of the airlines or by the CAA examiners of airmen.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the truth. I do not in any way go back on that statement; the statement stands. There is no suggestion that anything I said there is wrong. So I cannot see the point of the third dot point under the first paragraph of the censure motion accusing me of misleading the House. It does not have any substance whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion says that I have failed in my ministerial duties to ensure the continued maintenance of Australia's high civil aviation standards. I refute that statement. This Government has done everything it can in the course of a very difficult dispute to ensure, first, that Australia had some level of civil aviation service and the highest possible level of service that we could provide in the extremely difficult circumstances of 1,600 pilots having resigned their positions; and, second, that we built up that capacity on the basis that we maintained our high level of safety in this country. That was the basis upon which we conducted the whole operation. I said to the CAA that that was the basis upon which we should be proceeding. Mr Freeland, the chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, this afternoon has issued a press statement. I will not go through the detail of that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in a press statement, issued to the press this afternoon. It is quite clear that the Civil Aviation Authority is conducting its operations as it sees appropriate in extremely difficult circumstances. It is trying as far as possible to assist the airlines to rebuild capacity, but not at the expense of safety, and with no suggestion from government that there should be any lowering of safety standards. There is nothing coming from the Opposition, nothing in these documents, which suggests in any way that there has been any government interference which would be pushing against the safety standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are suggestions in those documents that in the opinion of those people safety standards have been compromised. In relation to the BAe 146 operation in Western Australia, it is clearly and undeniably wrong, and people listening to this debate should not swallow the Opposition line that foreign planes, ipso facto, mean an unsafe operation. We have foreign planes operating here all the time in normal circumstances. International foreign planes come here all the time. They fly not just in and out of Australia but around Australia. They carry tens of thousands of Australians every year. Does anyone suggest that that is totally unsafe and that we are destroying the safety of the aviation operation in Australia because there are foreign pilots in foreign planes flying around Australia in normal circumstances? Of course not. </PARA>
<PARA> These additional flights are operating on a similar basis. There is no reason whatsoever for the people of Australia to be scared by the Opposition into believing that there is an unsafe operation. They should recognise the Opposition's motive. It is to try to destroy the Government's attempts to defeat the pilots. They are the friends of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. They have done everything possible to stop this Government from resolving this dispute in a satisfactory way; and this motion of censure is just part of that process. </PARA>

The Minister is prepared to give this off the cuff defence, but the Government and he are not prepared to let the people see the substantial and sustained allegations made against him and his Government. The Government wants to stifle the facts so that the people do not have access to concerns expressed by two senior officers, not just about something concerning money, not just about some issue of public policy, but about the safety of people in aircraft in this country. It should be understood very clearly that the Government is refusing leave to have those documents tabled so that the people can see the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has the Minister said in response to some very serious allegations about the compromising of air safety standards? He said, `Well, yes, there is some internal dispute here and there; only an internal dispute, of course, about whether a check captain is authorised properly to check other captains before they are allowed to fly'. That just wipes off some internal disputes. He says, `Oh yes, there is some difference of opinion here and there, a difference of view'. That is the off the cuff defence we get. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that it fits in very well with the standard of defence that we saw in Question Time today. When we pinned the Minister, when we found the smoking gun about a very serious safety infringement concerning the Air Maritime aircraft, what was the Minister's reply? It was, `Oh, the air traffic control was wrong. It was not the case that the pilot was wrong. It was just a trifling matter of the air traffic control being wrong'. What we say to the Government is that, because of its hamfisted handling of this matter, it has brought civil aviation and air safety to the pass where, if what the Government says is correct-that the air traffic control was wrong-there is a very serious situation so far as air traffic control and safety in this country are concerned. I suppose that the Minister can sit there smirking it off. Whatever safety infringement we raise, he smirks it off, laughs it off-</PARA>

Only that-yet the Minister sits here smirking, wiping it off and simply saying that it is a difference of opinion and that the air traffic control was wrong. He is the Minister and he does not escape responsibility by saying that the Civil Aviation Authority is an independent body. The Minister is responsible and he is abrogating his responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us listen to just some of the things which indicate how the Minister has fallen down on his job and his lack of ministerial responsibility. He had these documents and it is a pity that he did not have the respect or the Parliament that would have led him to reply to some of the allegations made. For example, Mr Segan said that there is an erosion of operational standards. If this man is employed in this position, that seems to me to be a very serious allegation. He says that the administration of standards is `totally inadequate' today. That is the situation we have got to. The administration of safety standards, according to the public servant most intimately responsible for them, is totally inadequate. He says that some of the concessions that have been given are `tantamount to providing permission to break the law'. He says that the new standards of safety that are being set around the country these days are being `set by political blackmail'. He says that there are non-standard radio calls. Are non-standard radio calls being made? Is it true? Will the Minister tell us whether non-standard radio calls are being made between air traffic control and aircraft carrying Australians around the skies of this country. Is the allegation true or false? That is all we want to know. The honourable member for Gellibrand is the Minister, and he is responsible. Mr Segan went on to say that the exams administered to foreign pilots have been `relaxed without justification'. Is that true? Have the exams been relaxed without justification? If the Minister had any respect for his ministerial responsibility or for this House, he would reply to that specific allegation. He has not done so. </PARA>
<PARA> In his summary Mr Segan went on to make a very disturbing statement about an area of government activity. He said that for purely political reasons, against longstanding requirements, concessions on safety matters have been granted without due consideration of equivalent safety factors. Let us remember those words `without due consideration of equivalent safety factors'. That is a very serious allegation to make. It is not enough for the Minister simply to come in here and say that is nothing but a difference of opinion. His defence is that he says that it is a difference of opinion. We want a few more facts let out, if the Minister does not mind. The Australian people, especially those who are being conned by the Minister into believing that our air system is getting back to normal and that it is safe, also want to know. </PARA>
<PARA> The allegations go on, of course. It is not just one statement, but two. A second statement was made by Mr Lewino, and in some cases it is a matter of even more concern. Mr Lewino has made a number of very serious allegations. The Minister has not replied to any of them. Mr Lewino says that the operational managers who are also flying are getting fatigued. Can you believe it? The Minister is presiding over a situation which he is allowing to continue where operational managers who are flying aircraft with passengers are becoming fatigued. In his statement the Minister could have told us whether that is true or not, and he could have told us what was being done to rectify the situation. It goes on and on and on. A whole history of allegations is made there-not, I repeat, just by some underling but by two of the public servants responsible. Some serious allegations which have not been replied to give us in the Opposition and the Australian people very grave concern indeed about the system the Minister is presiding over. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just that the Minister is presiding over a system which is very clearly unsafe but that he came into the Parliament yesterday and continued to promote the line that none of this exists at all, as he has done week after week. That is the burden of our complaint-that he has misled the Parliament and the Australian people. There is a very compressed way of looking at the whole case that he has presented over the last few weeks. When the Minister came in yesterday he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am aware of allegations made by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots . . . that the CAA has compromised safety during this dispute. I totally reject that charge. Both the Government and the CAA are concerned to ensure that, in rebuilding our domestic aviation system, Australia's high safety standards are fully maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>That was yesterday's position. Today we have these two reports blasting those assertions completely out of the water, and the Minister has given no reply. All we get is the standard smirk, the standard brush-off. </PARA>

He says, `There is no problem. The Minister is in charge. It does not matter about aircraft flying 76 kilometres off course or air traffic control being wrong. `No, no problem at all', he says.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is another illustration of just how wrong the Minister is. I would like to refer the House to another document which shows just how firmly in control the Minister is. As honourable members will recall, one of the Government's recent bribes-I know it is difficult to distinguish one from another-was to waive charges levied by the Civil Aviation Authority and Federal Airports Corporation. It is known-but not to too many people-that the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority were not too keen on waiving those charges so the Minister had to give them a direction. In the direction given to the Civil Aviation Authority he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I, Ralph Willis, Minister of State for Transport and Communications. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The document is signed by him. I presume that he would not have signed it unless he had read it. Can the House believe that when we read on we see that the Civil Aviation Authority is being directed to waive charges that are brought to the notice of the Federal Airports Corporation-not the Civil Aviation Authority at all. Presumably the direction given to the Federal Airports Corporation would be telling it to waive charges brought to the notice of the Civil Aviation Authority. I suppose the Minister would sign his own death warrant if it was put in front of him. I give the Minister some free advice: his notice is invalid and he would be very well advised to do it again if he wants to have these charges waived. The Minister would be well advised to follow that advice. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to put this matter in context. We have established beyond any shadow of doubt that the Minister for Transport and Communications and the Government have misled the Parliament and the Australian people both about the safety standards applying today and about the Government's involvement in the whole charade. I want to end by putting the matter into context because it goes further. We should ask the question: Why has the Government been involved in this situation? How has it come about that we have allowed Australia's fine civil aviation record to fall to this pass where we now have concerned public servants writing memoranda to draw attention to safety shortcomings?</PARA>
<PARA> The context is that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-and the rest of the Government-has been concerned to carry out his vendetta and to pursue his manic preoccupation with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, one that he has had ever since he failed to force it into the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). The day of reckoning has now come. The Prime Minister has been so extreme, histrionic and provocative in the dispute and so concerned about pursuing his manic vendetta that he has let-and other Ministers have allowed him to do this-the whole hatred which seems to be his prime motivation colour the way in which our civil aviation problems are being solved today. The problem is so great that the Prime Minister has allowed himself to be influenced in this way and to drag our civil aviation industry into a very unsafe state indeed. The two documents I have referred to are the evidence of it. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the context. The Government will now adopt any device-even breaches of air safety-to pursue its manic policy, the objective being to preserve the centralised wage fixed system and to destroy the Federation of Air Pilots. The Government can do what it likes about the centralised wage fixation system, but it must not continue to mislead the Parliament about air safety standards and the Minister for Transport and Communications should do something to exercise his ministerial responsibility, in which he is failing gravely, to ensure the safety of the system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek an extension of time to make up for the time lost. This censure motion is a ruse from an Opposition that is desperate to find its own way on industrial relations policy. Members of the Opposition have many conflicting points of view and many competitors putting their policy, and a Leader who does not understand what it is all about. Right through this dispute with the pilots, what has been the role of the Opposition? It has been to give aid and encouragement to the pilots; to abet them and give them succour. What is the effect of that? It is to prolong the dispute. Their tears about the disruption being caused to Australia are crocodile tears. It is utter hypocrisy. Members of the Opposition come into the chamber and try to convince the people of this country that international aircraft are unsafe. My dear-foreign pilots! How is that? Fancy having an Irish crew, of all things. How dare overseas registered aircraft be brought into this country! This is the same Opposition saying, `We want more international tourists here. We want an open skies international aviation policy so that any intrenational airline can fly here'. What we are seeing here is just rank opportunism from people who do not really care, who think that they can score some cheap political point regardless of the cost to this country or the fear, anxiety and worry that they may create for some people. But, most of all, we see their hypocrisy towards the tourism industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government is faced with a situation where an elite group of people set up a demand for a 30 per cent increase in pay. If that had been acceded to, a wage explosion would have followed. From that wage explosion there would have been inflation and, after that, massive unemployment. Who loses their jobs? Not the pilots. The senior pilots are well paid; they can get by in a tough period. It is the ordinary people, the workers of this country, who would suffer. We will not let them suffer, nor do they want the Government to change the policy that it is pursuing. They know in their wisdom that we cannot afford a wages explosion in this country. They know what will happen, and they do not want to lose their jobs; they want the security of our maintaining record low un-employment in this country. That is what this dispute is all about. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) at the end of his comments finally got around to mentioning wages policy and the centralised wage fixing system. Some members of the Opposition are hell-bent one way or another on destroying that system. Playing along with the pilots is part of that process. They thought that they were on a winner. I can tell them that they are not on a winner. There are no winners in this kind of exercise, only losers. It is a battle that should not be happening. It is a problem that can be overcome tomorrow or in the next few days. If the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is genuine in what it is saying, that it is prepared to accept the terms of the contracts that have been signed for the pilots who are now back at work and that it is prepared to go back and accept arbitration-that is all it has to say-it should go and put its case before the Industrial Relations Commission, accept the Commission's decision and encourage the pilots back to work. The more members of the Opposition encourage the Federation, the more it encourages pilots not to go back to work, the more it prolongs the dispute, and the more damage and disruption is done to the tourism industry. That is really the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a political campaign by a group of people who would have to constitute the most irresponsible Opposition that we have seen in this place. To set out on a concerted campaign to undermine public perceptions of air safety, to frighten people out of aeroplanes and to suggest that internationally registered aircraft which meet international requirements and the requirements of the Civil Aviation Authority of this country are unsafe, and to convince people that all those foreign pilots are unsafe and only Australians pilots can fly aeroplanes safely, is the height of irresponsibility. What members of the Opposition are about is attacking the economy and attacking the Australian people, and damaging the economic stability of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go to the problem of industrial relations policy. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) just does not understand. Members of the Opposition are not in the chamber; they have all gone. This is such an important issue to the Opposition and there is one Opposition member in the chamber plus one at the table. That is the measure of the importance of this issue. It is a cheap, irresponsible, dirty stunt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where are they? Where is the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who does not support what those opposite are doing? The former Leader of the Opposition supports the Government. He has a nine-point plan and within the nine-point plan there is a one-point plan. The one-point plan is: let the pilots pursue their own thing and let each of them individually negotiate. At the same time the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) had a six-point plan. His six-point plan was to say that they could not get what they wanted under his system. Senator Stone had his own style. Senator Chaney, really the contortionist, had a whole range of them. Every day he had a new policy and a new approach that fitted in with whatever he thought the newspapers would run that day. But the one consistent person in all of this issue, right through, is the former Leader of the Opposition-who is looking to be the Opposition spokesman for industrial relations. He has his own policy; that is, dump the union, the Federation; no negotiations; let the pilots and individual airlines work our their own arrangements. He is the only person in the Opposition with any dignity in this whole issue. He was not here yesterday for the matter of public importance; he is not here again now. The issue facing the Opposition is what to do with the honourable member for Bennelong, how to contain him and how to reconcile his consistent responsible view-even though we disagree with it, at least he has the dignity of being consistent-with the Opposition's opportunistic, irresponsible approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Opposition members go around this country trying to frighten people and convince them that aviation is unsafe, that aircraft that have been approved by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) are not airworthy, that aircrews that have been approved by the Civil Aviation Authority are not competent, what are they doing? They are frightening people away from air services. The next thing they say is that the air services will not operate, that there are not as many air services operating. Go to the airports, watch the aeroplanes come and go and ask the passengers. Opposition members will find out for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition asks the Government what it is doing for the tourism industry, while the Opposition itself is busily undermining the very services this Government is assisting with and the airlines are providing to get the tourism industry back on its feet and try to recover lost ground. Opposition members should talk to people in the tourism industry and explain to them the Opposition's double standards and hypocrisy. They should explain why the Opposition is trying to undermine the efforts of the airlines and the Government to get air services back to normal. As I said, as far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, what he says is all waffle anyway. He does not understand the situation. He waffles on about it regularly. The only consistent person is the honourable member for Bennelong. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a way through this. The decision of the Commission set out the roles of the various parties in this dispute. It will meet tomorrow at 11 a.m. to discuss the next step in the process. If there were one skerrick of integrity on the other side of this House, the Opposition would be encouraging pilots to get back to work. It would be encouraging the Australian Federation of Air Pilots to get itself back within the national wage case guidelines, to accept arbitration and to put a sensible and responsible view to the Commission and the parties involved. That is the positive and responsible way forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will not do that because it thinks there are a few points to score. Those points will hang around the necks of Opposition members for years to come, as they sit on the Opposition benches. That is where they will stay. The public in this country understands what needs to be done. The public understands that it is not responsible to destroy wages policy and it is not responsible to grant to a group of people a wage increase that is more than most families in this country are required to live on for a year. It is more than most families earn in a year to rear their kids. The Opposition thinks that does not matter. It is prepared to do anything to undermine the system, to undermine the wages policy, to attack Australian families. The solution is for the Opposition to join in encouraging the Federation to adopt the right course, to get the matter settled and services back to normal. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the issue of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). We listened today to questions at Question Time which were effectively rebutted by the answers given by the Minister. The remarks that have been made against the Minister during the debate in this chamber can only be described as pathetic. There are probably a few fellows within the Civil Aviation Authority from the older days--</PARA>

The honourable member recognises that there are probably people within the CAA who have allegiances from the past to the Federation of Air Pilots, who might feel that there is a link, that they should be doing something to give succour and understanding to the Federation. Be that as it may, that is the organisation. The fact is that the Minister for Transport and Communications has effectively rebutted what the Opposition has put forward. The new proposal put forward by the pilots is a con trick. If they want to participate in the resolution of the dispute they should be accepting the terms that have been put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to finish on the subject of the role of the shadow Minister for tourism, aviation and sport. His is the role of doing everything possible to undermine services. He has a divided loyalty. On the one hand, he is hammering away with every bit of scuttlebutt, gossip, phone call, anything he can find to convince people that air services are unsafe and that the Government should be doing more. On the other hand, he bewails what the Government is not doing and what services are not being provided for tourism. He as an individual member of the Opposition has a case to answer. He has to explain why he is trying to destroy the redevelopment and regrowth of the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This censure motion should be directed at the Opposition. Day after day, week after week the Opposition has done its best to cause confusion, alarm, anxiety and damage for Australia's tourism industry, at the same time professing concern at the disruption to air services. The Opposition has contributed to that. The acts of the Opposition today, yesterday and during previous weeks have had one effect only and that is to prolong the resolution of the dispute and the resumption of normal air services in this country. Meanwhile, this Government will continue giving assistance wherever necessary in a reasonable way to provide alternative and supplementary services. The Government will continue to do that, as the Opposition provides in its own policy. The policy of the Opposition provides for assistance in appropriate circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That speech by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) was a pathetic effort. If I were the Minister, trying to do the right thing, I would be donating today's pay as a Minister of the Crown to some worthwhile charity. I can assure the Minister that, on the basis of that performance-that rhetoric, that diatribe, that rubbish he has just given the House-he has not earned his day's pay. The only thing that has been good today is the Minister's imagination. He has been able to imagine that the most unbelievable things have been occurring in the pilots dispute during the last seven weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the most fantastic forms of imagination on the Minister's side of the House is the view that somehow or other the Opposition is responsible for this strike. To use a pun, that is the greatest flight of fantasy that has occurred in this country for years. I can assure the Minister of that. He is a Minister of the Crown, he draws a wage as such and is a part of the Government, and the Government makes the rules. The Government determines what happens, not the Opposition. The job of the Opposition is to bring to the attention of the public, the voting people of Australia, just where failures occur in the administration of this country and where things that might be of concern to them are not being brought to their attention. It is on that basis that today the Opposition brings forward this censure motion. It does so because in the possession of the Opposition are two documents which would be of the gravest concern to any reasonable person. </PARA>
<PARA> The claims which the Minister, in his speech a few moments ago, was saying are our claims-that we are frightening passengers and so forth-are not our claims. They are not the claims of anybody on this side of the House. They happen to be the claims of two very senior officials within the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The Civil Aviation Authority is the body set up to administer the safety procedures of the civil aviation industry in Australia. Two of its most senior administrators say safety procedures are not good and that in the last few weeks they have gone backwards. They are saying that there is a serious situation and that safety standards have been compromised. Those are the claims the Opposition brings to the House today to put before the people of this country so that they can assess the truth. It is not what the Opposition says; it is what two senior Civil Aviation Authority people say. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one should be fooled for one moment by the comments of the Minister, who tried to make out that the Opposition was making up these things. The Opposition is only bringing to the people of Australia documents which would be of grave concern to every Australian-not just travellers on the airlines of Australia-because we are all concerned about the future and safety of our fellow Australians. There is no doubt, as a result of the evidence in these documents, that the safety of our fellow Australians is being put at risk every day. The Government claims that 15,000 to 17,000 people are currently using civil aviation services each day. If honourable members read the documents that we have tried to table in the Parliament today, they will realise that as a consequence of the Government's industrial relations approach every one of those 15,000 or 17,000 Australians who get in the air each day is having his life put at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) today stands condemned before the Parliament. He stands condemned because the evidence provided by those two senior members of the Civil Aviation Authority condemns him outright. He is hung, drawn and quartered on this one. There is no way he can get out of it. The Minister laughs, but I remember his colleague-who is now just the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown)-laughing equally loud just a little while ago, before he resigned as a Minister. He resigned as a Minister because he misled the House. The evidence in the documents that we have tried to table indicates to the House that the Minister has misled this place. If he has the same degree of integrity as other members who have resigned for being found guilty of those same charges in this place in years gone by, he too would resign because he has been found guilty of misleading the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The comments made by the previous speaker, the Minister for Industrial Relations are quite insulting to anybody of a reasonable nature. For example, he said that we were using this censure motion about the safety procedures in our aviation industry as a ruse. I can tell him that our concern about the safety of air passengers in Australia is not a ruse. It is a genuine concern, as it should be, of any reasonable Australian and any reasonable parliamentarian. Our concern is heightened because of what is in the documents to which I referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister asked how we dared to question the qualifications of foreign pilots and the standards of foreign aircraft. As every member in the House would know, other countries do not have the same standards and safety procedures for the operation of their aircraft or for the training of their pilots as we have. This is why it is of great concern to us and why we believe we have a right to question the qualifications of those pilots who are now flying commercial aircraft in this country. Indeed, we have a right to question the procedures and safety standards that apply to those foreign aircraft that are currently plying the airways of this country. All we got from the previous speaker was a diatribe about the wages system. He, like his colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications, did not address the very fundamental issues of this censure motion. He went on about the wages system. We have heard it a hundred times; we all know about it. It does not address this censure motion before the House today. </PARA>
<PARA> The defence put forward by the Minister for Transport and Communications was very weak. He said that all the information in the documents that we are not allowed to table is no good and that there is no truth in the information. He said that he can verify it all because a senior public servant issued a press statement which disqualifies all the things that are in the documents that we have in our possession today. The basis of the defence that the Minister put forward in his speech today was built on a press statement put out this afternoon by a senior member of the Civil Aviation Authority. His defence does not stack up with the words in the documents of the two senior civil aviation authorities in the CAA. That is the situation that we have had so far today. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not been frightening people. The documents that we have in our possession are causing people right across Australia to be frightened. We believe that as a consequence of the censure motion today the Minister has misled the House and should therefore resign. Australians right across the country have a right to know what is going on. They have a right to be outraged-particularly those Australians who fly each day; particularly those 15,000 Australians, so far, who have lost their jobs as a consequence of the pilots dispute; particularly those Australians who own small businesses which are related to the tourism industry who have had their businesses' viability put at risk. Some of the latter are already going out of business. Honourable members opposite should speak to some of their friends in Tasmania to find out what is happening there. They should speak to some of their friends in north Queensland to find out what is happening there. They have been put at risk as a consequence of the Government's actions in the pilots dispute. The Government has put at risk all those jobs and businesses. Why has it done it? It has done it because it has some manic commitment to the centralised industrial award system that it has introduced. It is prepared to put at risk the lives of every Australian who flies. It is prepared to put at risk the jobs of people in the tourism industry. It is prepared to put at risk foreign earnings. It is prepared to strangle the fastest growing, probably the most exciting, industry that we have in Australia today. </PARA>

Every Australian has a right to be concerned about this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his response, the Minister for Transport and Communications said some things which most of us could find unacceptable. For example, he said that Captain Smith was an appropriate person to be used for the proper testing of foreign pilots in this country. It is interesting to read the document that the Government will not let us table. I assure the House that Captain Smith is a cause for concern. If we read the document we find that Captain Smith suggested that in the process of testing these first officers he should put two of them in the control seats; he should sit in the flight engineer's seat or the jump seat and authorise their licences to fly in Australia during a normal commercial flight. That is not acceptable. That is the standard of the man that the Minister allowed to authorise those foreign pilots to get their licences in this country. That is the standard of the man who the Minister thought was appropriate to license those pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is quite untoward. Proper licensing procedures have not been met. For example, the normal English language tests that are used to test foreign pilots to ensure that they have an adequate grasp of the language were not used. They were just left out. We find in the documents that we are not allowed to table that the oral examination that was put to those pilots was not of a normal type and that each of the French pilots got exactly the same questions wrong and exactly the same questions right. Surely that should cause people to be concerned, yet the Minister said that all the systems used for authorising the pilots were normal. I assure him that most Australians who are concerned for their safety in the air would not consider that those systems were normal. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite the Minister to imagine what would have happened had the Air Maritime aircraft crashed. According to the transcript of the conversation between the two air traffic control towers in Sydney and Melbourne which the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) read to the House, the French pilots could not understand the directions that they were being given. As a consequence of their lack of understanding of the language, they turned right instead of left. As a consequence of that, they were 76 kilometres off course. The situation could have resulted in a serious accident. How would the Minister feel had that been the case? How would he feel had the accident occurred? I assure the Minister that had there been an accident he would have been the man responsible. He would have been very sorry indeed that he had allowed the Prime Minister, the Leader of his Government, to bully him and his colleagues into allowing a reduction in the standards of safety applied to our aviation industry to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> A reading of the documents also shows that the Minister allowed the Government to become quite compromised with the commercial airlines system. If the Minister reads the document, he will see that whenever Ansett Airlines of Australia seems to want to do something, it seems to do it. Whenever Ansett wants control, influence or guidance, it seems to get it. The compromising situation highlighted in these documents is cause for concern. Why is it that Ansett has this relationship with the Government? Why is it that this Government is prepared to compromise safety procedures in order to facilitate the best commercial interests of Ansett Airlines? I am sure that honourable members on this side of the House could give me a very precise answer. </PARA>
<PARA> The censure motions moved today by the honourable member for Fadden and the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) are overwhelming. They highlight to the Parliament precisely how the Minister for Transport and Communications has misled the House, how precisely the standards of safety have been reduced in the aviation industry here in Australia, and just how far this Government is prepared to go to maintain its manic commitment to the centralised industrial award system. As a consequence of these documents, which the Government has refused to allow us to present to the Parliament so that everybody in Australia can see them, there is no doubt whatsoever that the Minister for Transport and Communications has misled this House and should resign today. </PARA>

<PARA> Let me say one thing about this censure motion. The House of Representatives has been broadcast all day today, so those few masochists out there listening to us will not be aware that this debate has been run all morning in the Senate. The general public may also not be aware of the fact that the Government does not have a majority in the Senate; in fact, the Government is in a significant minority in the Senate. The Senate's position is arbitrated by a number of minority parties. We generally lose censure motions in the Senate. The Government is regularly censured in the Senate. I myself have been censured on several occasions. The last time I was censured in the Senate it took me two weeks to find out. It is not unusual for a Government Minister to find himself successfully censured in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> What is unusual is for a Government Minister to find himself unsuccessfully censured in the Senate-that is, an unsuccessful attempt to censure him. This has been one of those occasions. It has not been possible for the Liberal Party of Australia, on the basis of the documentation it has brought into this place and on the arguments it has made, to sufficiently convince minority parties regularly prepared to censure this Government and our Ministers that the Minister concerned and the Government generally ought to be censured. A degree of commonsense has applied. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now go into detail as to why that confidence should be placed in us. The fact is-and this shows how far the Opposition is from government-that there is scarcely an area of Government activity in which advice or final determinations or whatever are made on the basis of a unanimous view among the personnel who offer that advice. I was an aviation Minister myself for 20 months. I note that some honourable members opposite have been aviation Ministers. It is now the turn of this Minister, whose administration of his Department is being debated today, to be an aviation Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been nothing more contentious than the way in which the Civil Aviation Authority and its predecessors have conducted the regulatory environment in which they operate. Every issue in that regulatory environment has been the subject of debate. When I was aviation Minister I was the repository of endless submissions by honourable members opposite to change this or that civil aviation regulatory practice. Endlessly, those opposite claimed that the Civil Aviation Authority was overly restricted. They pursued that line month after month on the-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We know the value of the honourable member's legal advice; it was obviously regarded very highly by the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) and the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) in the course of their deliberations today. The fact is that there has been a constant effort by members of parliament who have an interest in the aviation industry to change the regulatory authority arrangements or at least the procedures by which these arrangements are carried out. That is a matter of debate. I draw attention to that fact only to indicate that the Civil Aviation Authority has been addressing those matters and has changed the regulatory environment and the procedures to some considerable degree. What has been presented by the officers in the documentation that the Opposition has to hand to some extent portrays a degree of ignorance about some of those fundamental changes in administrative arrangements. It is worth pointing out that fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is difficult for the Government to respond to these papers immediately for one simple reason: the original documents concerned have yet to arrive at the Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do have copies of them. They appeared in forums outside the Government almost immediately they were written and well before they arrived at the central authority. I do not in any way, shape or form wish to question the motives of the authors of the document, but I do question the motives of those who had immediate access to them and were prepared to put them about in public so generously. I wonder what those motives might be. It is at least a sustainable view that those motives included an intention not to deal with safety but with the politics of this dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me pick up one or two of the points that have been made. The Opposition is concerned that the French pilots speak no English. Indeed, in one of the documents the suggestion is made that this happens to be the case and that difficulties arise from this. People whose native language is Serbo-Croatian, Italian, Japanese, Korean from time to time, Chinese, French and German, regularly fly into and operate within our air space. The ability to read, write and understand English is a requirement specified in civil aviation orders. This may be examined by a specific test or by observation at any stage during the training. Let me read from the advice of the Civil Aviation Authority to the Minister about the French pilots. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The French pilots demonstrated this requirement initially by sitting for the examinations in writing in English and subsequently successfully completing approximately 40 hours of flying under supervision. </PARA>
<PARA>The complaint was made about the check captains that were appointed to do the BAe146 examinations. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am getting down to dealing with the Opposition's allegations; which it did not. It turns out that the check captains who were appointed and who were the subject of a complaint are the same check captains who assisted in the preparation of the Ansett Western Australia operations manual for 146 aircraft when they were originally introduced in Western Australia about five years ago. They also trained and checked Australian pilots employed by Ansett Western Australia at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One person whose reputation has had a bit of a raking over in this place is one Captain Smith. Obviously Captain Smith has had personality clashes with different members of the Civil Aviation Authority. That is unfortunate but not atypical. This same Captain Smith was responsible recently for setting up the entire Ansett operation in New Zealand. He is clearly regarded as a very senior captain. The bulk of the Civil Aviation Authority people have found him to be so, as they have been prepared to put him in that position. All these activities occurred well before the pilots dispute. Any criticism-again, the advice of the Civil Aviation Authority-of Captain Smith has not been borne out by the performance of the pilots whom he has trained and who have been independently checked by experienced BAe check pilots and finally by Ansett's chief pilot. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the ignorance of the Opposition, now so long in opposition, about the governing process, is its inability to establish a relationship between a leaked document of what purports to be conversation between two air traffic control operators and a Bureau of Air Safety Investigation report on the same incident. It is all very well for the odd air traffic controller, or a pilot, or a member of a ground crew, or anyone else in the aviation system, to have a complaint. This complaint is interesting but it has no real substance to it and no real value as an indicator of what may be a public problem until it has been properly considered by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. As the Minister tried to point out to the serried ranks of gibbons opposite him during Question Time, this particular incident was the subject of a Bureau of Air Safety Investigation report in which that organisation completely cleared the pilots of any wrongdoing. The Bureau pointed out that they were not off course; they were not going in the wrong direction; they were on course. The unfortunate Minister attempted to explain that to the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) and others during the course of his remarks but they chose not to listen to him as he attempted to mount his defence in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact of the matter is that to the extent that we have now had time to check out the repeated allegations and scuttlebutt that the Opposition has put forward in this place-as far as they can be checked out-every one of them falls down. These propositions are explained either as manifestly false or as products simply of assertion which have subsequently been counterchecked by more senior officers in the Civil Aviation Authority down the line and properly addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> That ought to be of great reassurance to the Opposition. It certainly ought to be of reassurance to the travelling public, as indeed should the statement by the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority. He is an independent statutory officer, independent as a result of our decision to give him that independence. That independent statutory officer has been prepared to say that he has not been under pressure by the Government to compromise the safety standards of his Authority. He is not a person capable of being removed from office by the Government. As a result of decisions by the Government he is no longer a public servant who is directly responsible to a Minister. He can state his course as he sees fit and he can state his views as he sees fit. He has stated his views quite clearly on this matter. They are: point one, that he has not been the object of pressure; point two, that on the particular complaints that have been made he has pointed out that they have been properly looked at by the relevant officers of the Civil Aviation Authority and found not wanting. He has also pointed out that there has been a matter of some dispute inside the Civil Aviation Authority for some considerable time now and at a time predating the pilots strike. </PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation Authority has been responding to pressures, like those placed by honourable members opposite and others, about the speed with which the Authority carries out its procedures. One complaint made in that regard was that pilots who unsuccessfully completed examinations could be re-examined two days after unsuccessfully completing the examination instead of the normal 14 days. That does not alter the fact that pilots being re-examined still have to pass if they are to fly-whether they pass the examination two days after they initially fail or 14 days. The pilots who passed those examinations two days later under the accelerated procedures of the Civil Aviation Authority, did pass those examinations. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation where the Opposition attempts to seize on any particular item in this situation and attempts to cause public alarm and despondency because of the political position on this dispute. I do not take the same umbrage to the Opposition as does the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris). I do not see honourable members as terribly significant in this issue. They are more like a chorus in a Greek tragedy. Many features of this dispute are tragic. The protagonists happen to be ourselves, the airlines, and the people of Australia, whose economic interests have to be and are being defended by this Government in this dispute. Many unfortunate pilots have been misled by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. The Opposition is the chorus in a Greek tragedy. Its sole role is to wander around saying, `Oh, no', and attempting to look good. At least in that regard it has a Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) who is absolutely perfectly cast as an appropriate member of a chorus in a Greek tragedy. There is no need to consider this matter any more. The Minister has been well defended. He is a Minister in whom this House can have confidence. It will express confidence in him. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The 298th report, the annual report of the Public Accounts Committee, will give some indication of the wide range of subjects covered by the Committee in its work. Time precludes a comprehensive discussion of that report, but I would like to highlight one particular initiative which is the centrepiece of the work of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee presented its 296th report on the reform of the Audit Office to the Parliament on 6 April this year. The report was entitled Ally of the People and Parliament-Reform of the Australian Audit Office. The report was the result of the first comprehensive inquiry into the work of the Audit Office in the 88 years of its existence. The Committee found that the Audit Office did not have the resources and independence necessary to perform its functions under the Audit Act to the satisfaction of the Parliament, nor had the Audit Office kept pace with reforms in the Audit Office in other jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee made 78 recommendations, the most crucial of which were: firstly, that there should be legislation to establish the Audit Office as a statutory authority and to permit the Auditor-General to determine the terms and conditions of employment of Audit Office staff; secondly, that there should be repeal of the Audit Act 1901 and replacement by a new Audit Act and a new financial administration act; thirdly, that a parliamentary committee should be established to advise the Auditor-General on the Parliament's audit priorities and consider the Audit Office's finances in detail; and fourthly, that there should be the provision of additional resources specifically to allow for more efficiency audits so that in the next five years, 50 per cent of the Audit Office resources would be spent on efficiency audits as distinct from the 6 per cent which currently prevails. A further major recommendation was that the Auditor-General be reinstated as the auditor of all government bodies and have the right to appoint private sector firms as contract auditors. </PARA>
<PARA> This report has been fully supported by the Auditor-General, who presented his report to the Parliament on 7 September. There was only one recommendation to which the Auditor-General gave qualified support. The rest were given his full support. The Auditor-General has urged the Government to act to give effect to those historic reforms recommended by the Committee. Indeed, this has been the response of Auditors-General around the country and editorial writers of almost every major Australian newspaper. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee remains totally committed to the report and believes that it is imperative that the Government accept the recommendations, as they provide a blueprint both for greater accountability and efficiency in government. The annual report that I have tabled contains summaries of the reports presented to the Parliament in the 1988-89 financial year as well as a summary of activities in current inquiries. The Committee notes that a Bill relating to therapeutic goods was introduced into the Parliament yesterday and that the resources for the Antarctic Division have been increased in line with the Committee's recommendations. In conclusion, I wish to thank all members of the Committee and the secretariat for their support during the year. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes with deep regret the death of Archbishop David Penman, Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) pays tribute to his life which exemplified service to the community based on an international outlook with a tolerance and understanding of others with differing views and from other faiths, scholarship, the forceful pursuit of ideas, concepts and ideals to advance the well being of Australians from all walks of life; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) extends to all members of the Penman family its sincere sympathy in remembrance of an active life. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion speaks for itself. David Penman was a great Australian who made an enormous contribution to the development of Australia's history. He was a catalyst for action and at times created controversy. He realised that. I think he courageously involved his church in Melbourne into controversial issues. He took the church into the community in the broadest sense and he answered the challenge of the church in that way. He took controversial issues to the Anglican community. He gave the church that he loved so dearly that challenge, and he responded to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that history will judge David Penman, the late Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne, as a man whom the Anglican Church needed at that time in the church's history in Melbourne. It is with regret that I have had to move a motion concerning the death of this great person. But I do so proudly, knowing that all those of the Anglican faith and of other faiths, Christian and non-Christian, had great respect for this great man. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. Archbishop David Penman was a remarkable community leader. His influence extended far beyond the Anglican Church of Australia and the Melbourne Diocese. His interests were global but his concern for individuals and for causes was striking. He was an organiser, a negotiator, a philosopher and a scholar. He had a rare understanding of the Muslim world, having gained a PhD in Islamic studies at the University of Karachi. He recognised that in the long term the cause of world peace depended as much on the resolution of conflicts within Africa, Southern and Central America and the Middle East as on the very welcome resolution of some of the outstanding areas of conflict between the two global powers, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had some association with him, particularly in regard to his interest in African and Middle East causes. I had the advantage of having many discussions with him. He was an exhilarating companion, he had a lot of compassion, he was courageous and he was a man of vision. He has left us at a very inappropriate time and his loss will be felt for a long time, not just by this community but also by New Zealand, from where he came. He built up an extraordinary international network of contact with people throughout the world who recognised the moral force that he brought to his cause. His death at what seems to me to be the absurdly young age of 53 is something that we all deplore. I share with other members-still-a sense of shock and almost disbelief that he has gone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion that has been moved by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton). It is extraordinarily important that the House place on record its recognition of Archbishop Penman who, in five short years, made a remarkable stamp on the Diocese of Melbourne and an outstanding contribution in terms of leadership within the Church in Australia and the Australian community. He was a man who reflected, as most of us do, his past. Undoubtedly, his period of scholarship in Karachi and later his very extensive experience in Beirut and the Middle East underlay his very strong grasp of the issues involved in multiculturalism and his commitment to an understanding of Australian society which embraced that experience in an extremely positive way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to add a personal note with respect to David Penman. When I first became the Minister for Social Security in this place he invited me to Bishops-court for an evening to meet clergy of the Melbourne Diocese, I think to get some indication of what my thoughts would be within the portfolio, which I think he understood bore some relevance to his understanding of social justice, but also to allow the clergy to present as early as possible to me their views on some of the issues that might be considered by the Government or me in the social security area. At that time I very much appreciated the hospitality offered by David and Jean, and I got a great deal out of that meeting in terms of thinking about some of the values and issues that are important in the portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> I also recall the second occasion, when I was invited to attend a reception at Bishops-court to meet Archbishop Desmond Tutu. As has been referred to by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), he had a great interest in Africa; not only in African studies but, of course, in the course of events in southern Africa. I remember his obvious excitement and enthusiasm on that occasion, and then going with him and Jean to a great meeting with an overflowing attendance that was held at the La Trobe University at which Archbishop Desmond Tutu spoke for over an hour. He spoke without a note and had people quite entranced. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view David Penman was a very inspiring person, and his inspiration extended, as I suggested, well beyond the church. The recent weeks must have been an extraordinarily difficult time for his family. While I have had no personal contact with them, I have certainly felt for them during that time. I think all members of Parliament who recognise the great responsibilities that go with an office such as his would recognise that people such as David pay a price and would also feel, not only before but now, for Jean and the family in the period ahead. With those words and with great feeling, I support the remarks of previous speakers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not know that this motion was going to be moved; so I actually did make a 90-second contribution before lunch on the death of Archbishop Penman. However, I would like to be associated with the motion. David Penman and Jean have been close friends of my wife, my son and me, and we feel his loss very much. He had so much more to give the world and humanity and had so much more to enjoy in life, so it is a most tragic occasion indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> David Penman was all the wonderful things that have been said about him and, indeed, much more. He had a very indefinable greatness about him, including a truly great and gentle sense of humour. So I am delighted to support this motion on this occasion not only on my behalf but also on behalf of my wife and son. Children often have a capacity not to face up to the realities of death and not take death very seriously. No person's grave illness has touched my 10-year-old son more than David's illness. In the last two months he has been asking each day how he was, and it has been profoundly moving. I am very glad that the House has seen fit to move this motion for this very wonderful citizen of the world. </PARA>

She has been quite active in this. I know David Penman was a great advocate of priesthood for women. He will be sorely missed by many people who believe that it is about time priesthood for women happened. He was a great man and did a lot for underprivileged people. He had a lot of battles within his own church, but he stood firmly for what he believed in. This motion certainly honours the memory of a very great person.</PARA></TALK.START>

I came from elsewhere the moment I heard it was being moved to at least associate myself with the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> David Penman was not someone I knew until he was appointed Archbishop. He was in every sense from that moment on a leader not only of a church but of significant movements for human beings throughout the world. We owe him more than we can express here. His tolerance, humanity and, above all, that sensitive and sensible leadership moved so many across so many socio-economic groupings. He is truly one to whom we can be grateful for, tragically, the short time that he was Archbishop of Melbourne. I trust that all that he achieved will be able to be followed through by whoever is appointed as his successor. He struck new directions, and it is important certainly from my own point of view as a member of his faith, his church, that such new directions which were forged be carried forward. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be attending the service tomorrow. In the meantime, I join with others in expressing my deepest sympathy to his family, together with the viewpoint that they can be aware that he gave so much which is appreciated by so many of us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems a very hard thing to do to move to less moving matters than the previous debate. On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the Committee's 299th report, entitled Compliance with the Guidelines for the Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr TICKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Compliance with mandatory reporting requirements for departmental annual reports to parliament should be a straightforward administrative matter. However, I believe that non-compliance with such requirements is a threat to our concept of democracy. The Public Accounts Committee was forced to produce this report I am tabling today because it found a substantial level of non-compliance. The reporting requirements for annual reports by the secretaries of Commonwealth departments are set down in guidelines approved by the Public Accounts Committee and presented in the Parliament by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). This procedure and the requirement that the reports be in accordance with the guidelines are provided for in section 25 of the Public Service Act 1922.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year, in report No. 291, the Public Accounts Committee foreshadowed that it would review annual reports of departments for compliance with the relevant guidelines. This inquiry followed on from the Public Accounts Committee's report No. 262 in which the Committee considered the draft which became the current guidelines for departmental annual reports. Originally, this review was intended merely to confirm that the secretaries of Commonwealth Government departments were complying with the requirements that they include certain information in their 1987-88 annual reports to Parliament. Compliance by secretaries was, after all, mandatory under the Public Service Act itself. </PARA>
<PARA> During the inquiry the Committee became most concerned about the level of non-compliance with the guidelines. The concern was highlighted as the attention of each Commonwealth departmental secretary had been personally drawn to the guidelines by letter and, further, that the Committee had put on notice, by tabling a report in the Parliament, the fact that it intended to review compliance with the guidelines. What more could this Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament have done to achieve compliance?</PARA>
<PARA> Even if departmental secretaries believed that the accountability requirements were excessive-and that is not what they told us-surely they can see that if departments do not report in the manner required by the Parliament the recent reforms in public sector management will be put at risk. Management for results and devolution involves a trade-off of more autonomy and control for more accountability. In this regard we were pleased to hear that some departments are taking steps to ensure that the problems of non-compliance will not be an attribute of the 1989 reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee encourages all parties concerned with annual reports to take an active interest in ensuring that they are useful documents. If scope to improve the guidelines significantly is identified, this should be drawn to the attention of relevant bodies, the first being the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. For our part, the Public Accounts Committee has commenced a review of the guidelines which is intended to assist the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in redrafting those guidelines by giving a parliamentary perspective. The review will give the Committee an opportunity to consider its preferences for the guidelines prior to being required to consider the draft guidelines for approval under the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee awaits with interest the 1988-89 reports as they will no doubt comply with the requirements of the Public Service Act and thus provide information on the operations of Commonwealth Government departments. The Committee takes the view that the initiative and skill of departments should be reflected by their presenting the required information in a manner which is concise and accessible to the reader. At one of the public hearings of this inquiry one of my colleagues on the Committee said that the Prime Minister's guidelines seemed to have been `totally regarded with contempt by much of the Public Service'. I hope that annual reports will never again lead any of us to that conclusion and that this inquiry has contributed to that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I would like to thank my fellow Committee members, the various departmental secretaries and their staff and the staff of the Public Accounts Committee secretariat for their efforts in producing this report. This was not an inquiry which the Public Accounts Committee wished to conduct. In fact, it went to great lengths to avoid it. It has been an inquiry which has involved some considerable embarrassment to some senior Commonwealth Public Service managers. I am convinced that very important lessons have been learned as a result of this inquiry. Above all else, it has been a forthright assertion of the supremacy of the Parliament. I believe that that is a concept fundamental to Australian democracy. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The primary purpose of the Crime Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 is to review the Commonwealth sentencing legislation and the laws governing Federal offenders found unfit to be tried or not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. In addition, the Bill makes minor amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988, the National Crime Authority Act 1984 and Part VIIC of the Crimes Act 1914-spent convictions. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Crimes Act 1914 was amended in 1982 following the Australian Law Reform Commission's interim report on sentencing-ALRC 15-to require that imprisonment be the punishment of last resort, except for serious Federal offences, and make State and Territory alternatives to imprisonment, such as community service orders, available to Federal offenders for the first time, this Bill represents the first significant change to Commonwealth sentencing law since the Commonwealth Prisoners Act 1967 was enacted over 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of Federal offenders in custody has been steadily growing from 244 out of a total prison population of 10,621 on 1 May 1985 to 517 out of 12,429 on 1 July 1989. These offenders serve their sentences in State gaols by virtue of section 120 of the Constitution and are subject to the same prison regime as State or Territory prisoners. This system can operate effectively only because of the significant assistance and cooperation that the Attorney-General and his Department receive from the officers of the State and Territory corrective services departments or commissions on a range of matters, including the calculation of sentences and the preparation of parole reports and such like. That assistance is greatly appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the close association of Federal and State/Territory prisoners it has been the policy of successive Commonwealth governments to maintain intrastate parity of treatment for Federal offenders. The current Commonwealth legislation applies State and Territory laws relating to the fixing of non-parole periods to Federal sentences. However, the increasing divergence of, and frequent changes, both administrative and statutory, to State and Territory legislation have resulted in increasing use of administrative measures to ensure that Federal offenders are not disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> In late 1988 the final report of the Australian Law Reform Commission on sentencing-ALRC 44-was tabled in Parliament. It is therefore timely that further and more significant amendments be made. The reform and review of the sentencing legislation to ensure its fairness and effectiveness and to ensure community confidence in the ability of the criminal justice system to deal with offenders are an important part of the Government's fight against crime, particularly organised crime. The new sentencing proposals are intended to complement the other major legislative initiatives by the Government in this area, including the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987, the Extradition Act 1988, the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988, the 1989 amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 to enable superannuation to be forfeited where a police officer is convicted of a corruption offence, and the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that there is a need for a separate Commonwealth sentencing regime to ensure that Federal offenders are not disadvantaged because of the complex legal problems that may arise in a Federal system. This Bill provides a sentencing regime for Federal offenders which pursues the aims of certainty and fairness. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement that imprisonment be the punishment of last resort has been strengthened. But where a court determines that a sentence of imprisonment is the appropriate penalty, that sentence will be certain. The Bill provides that where a Federal offender is sentenced to imprisonment, if the court fixes a non-parole period or makes an order for release on recognisance-a form of bond-this is the period that the person will actually serve in custody before parole eligibility arises or the person becomes eligible to be released on recognisance. Such periods will not be reduced by remissions from the non-parole or pre-release periods. </PARA>
<PARA> Great care has been taken to ensure that establishing certainty in sentencing does not result in harsher or longer prison terms. In those States where remissions reduce State non-parole periods, the Bill specifically provides that a Federal offender is to have his or her non-parole adjusted to take into account that it will not be reduced by remission. The Bill requires that the court explain to the person that the sentence of imprisonment is made up of a period to be served in custody and a period in the community subject to conditions either on parole or on recognisance. </PARA>
<PARA> As Federal offenders are persons who have been convicted of offences against Commonwealth law-for example, the importation of narcotic drugs, money laundering and fraud on the Commonwealth-they will include principals in large scale operations as well as persons who have played minor roles in such offences or persons who have committed relatively minor offences. Federal sentencing legislation therefore needs to provide a range of sanctions to enable the sentencing court to choose the sentence that is appropriate and proportionate to the offence. Although this Bill deals mainly with Federal offenders who are sentenced to imprisonment, it also ensures that a greater range of alternatives to imprisonment is available to persons convicted of Federal offences. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these important matters, this Bill also provides an innovative and humanitarian regime to deal with the difficult and frequently overlooked problem of mentally ill and intellectually disabled persons who come into contact with the criminal justice system. The existing legislation only provides limited options to deal with a person who has been charged with an indictable Federal offence where there is a finding of unfitness to be tried or not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. One of the most serious criticisms of the existing law is that a person may be kept in custody indefinitely, without any statutory requirement that his or her case be reviewed. Moreover, a person found unfit to be tried is kept in custody indefinitely without even a prima facie case being established that he or she committed the alleged offence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides a new regime for dealing with persons who are found unfit to plead, or unfit to be tried or not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. Sentencing courts are also being given additional options for persons who are mentally ill or intellectually disabled. The Bill gives magistrates courts greatly increased options when dealing with cases summarily. Hospital orders will be available in lieu of imprisonment, where mental illness has contributed to the commission of serious offences. Special bonds will also be available-psychiatric probation orders for mentally ill offenders, and program probation orders for intellectually disabled offenders. The new sentencing options of hospital orders and bonds give effect to the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>Contents of Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A detailed explanation of the contents of the Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum. Accordingly the Attorney-General wishes only to refer to the more important features of the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill repeals the Commonwealth Prisoners Act 1967 and amends the Crimes Act 1914 to consolidate all the general sentencing legislation in that Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Remissions that currently reduce the non-parole periods of Federal sentences in some States will not apply to sentences imposed after commencement, except remissions granted for prison warders strikes. In those States where remissions off the non-parole period apply, the courts are specifically instructed to take account of the fact that they will not apply to Federal offenders and to adjust the non-parole period accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>Remissions that reduce the total-or head-sentence will continue to apply, if available under State law. In those States where remissions on the head sentence are not available, only New South Wales at present, the courts are specifically required to take this into account so that Federal offenders are not serving longer sentences because of the abolition of remissions for State prisoners. </PARA>
<PARA>Federal offenders sentenced to imprisonment prior to the commencement of the Bill will continue to have their non-parole periods reduced by remissions available under State or Territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The new legislation provides for a Federal scheme for setting non-parole periods, instead of relying on State/Territory law. A non-parole period may only be set where the sentence is greater than three years. </PARA>
<PARA>Where the sentence is three years or less, and the court considers that the person should be released from prison subject to conditions, then, at the time of sentencing, the court may make an order for the person's release on recognisance, a bond subject to court imposed conditions relating to good behaviour and supervision et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA>Consistent with the Government's view that there should be certainty in sentencing, the Bill provides that a court sentencing a Federal offender to a life sentence may fix a non-parole period. A Federal offender serving a life sentence with non-parole period at the time this legislation comes into force, may apply to a court to have a non-parole period fixed. It is not mandatory that a court fix a non-parole period for a life sentence. </PARA>
<PARA>Where the sentence is greater than three years but less than 10 years and a non-parole period is specified, release on parole is to be automatic on completion of the imprisonment period with the Attorney-General setting conditions, where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>If the sentence is greater than 10 years, including a life sentence where a non-parole period is set, there is a presumption in favour of release on parole upon completion of the non-parole period. However, in these cases the Attorney-General has a discretion to defer release on parole. Where release on parole is deferred the Attorney-General must provide the prisoner with reasons for the deferral. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill retains the `release on licence' mechanism to permit early release where a prisoner establishes exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>The releasing authority for parolees and licensees will be the Attorney-General, instead of the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>Procedures for the revocation of parole orders and licences have been revised.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides that State or Territory pre-release schemes may be prescribed, subjected to eligibility conditions. These schemes enable select State or Territory prisoners to be released shortly before a non-parole period is served or a sentence has been served. Prisoners are subject to strict conditions and supervision while on these schemes. Any regulations prescribing a scheme will, of course, be subject to section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, which permits a regulation to be disallowed by either House of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides a new regime where a person, charged on indictment with a Federal offence, is found unfit to plead or be tried, or is found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. </PARA>
<PARA>These changes, for persons found unfit to be tried, include procedures for determining whether the prosecution has established a prima facie case, and for establishing the person's likely fitness to stand trial within 12 months. Where a court finds the person will not become fit to be tried the person may be released on a bond or placed in custody for a period not exceeding the maximum penalty for the offence. </PARA>
<PARA>If a jury finds a person not guilty on the ground of mental illness, the court may either release the person with or without conditions or make an order for his or her detention in custody for a period not exceeding the maximum penalty for the offence. </PARA>
<PARA>In cases where a person is ordered to be held in custody either because he or she is not fit to be tried or has been found not guilty on the ground of mental illness, the Bill provides for regular review of the detention and for his or her release by the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains a number of minor amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988, the National Crime Authority Act 1984, and the Crimes Act 1914. The substantive thrust of the Cash Transaction Reports Act is contained in provisions of the Act that are not yet in force. Honourable members will no doubt appreciate that it has taken time to establish the Cash Transaction Reports Agency, which is pivotal to the operation of the legislation. The Attorney-General is pleased to inform the House that the Agency is now in place and the substantive provisions of the Act are to come into force progressively from 1 January 1990. The staff of the Agency have been involved in extensive liaison and consultation with financial institutions, other cash dealers affected by the Act and law enforcement agencies. As a result of this process it became clear that the Act required finetuning. The amendments contained in this Bill will greatly enhance the implementation process and the effectiveness of the legislation. Certain amendments, such as that removing the requirement for an identification reference to be a statutory declaration have been made following representations from financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The balance of the amendments to the Act, and those to the other Acts, are minor and self-explanatory. Those are the major features of the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> There is not expected to be any significant increase in costs or expenditure from the measures proposed in this Bill. In fact, savings in administration costs are anticipated from the abolition of remissions on non-parole periods and the introduction of automatic parole. On behalf of the Attorney-General, I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill would amend social security and veterans' affairs legislation to implement some of the measures announced in the Budget this year and several other program refinements of a mainly administrative nature. It also contains measures to enhance the effectiveness of the child support scheme. Over the past six years the Government has rebuilt the integrity of Australia's social security system. We have substantially amended legislation to support an overhaul of administrative systems. This Bill would amend the Social Security Act to continue this reform. Compensation recovery mechanisms will be made much more effective, family allowance and family allowance supplement procedures will be refined, assessment of domestic circumstances of sole parent pensioners will be overhauled, deferment periods for education leavers applying for benefits will be adjusted and unemployment and sickness benefits will not be payable to people who refuse to provide or apply for a tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA> Three amendments in the area of compensation recovery promote the administrative integrity of the social security system and help to ensure that the funds made available by the Australian public for social security go to those who most need them. Under present arrangements which apply where compensation payments and social security benefits overlap, the Department of Social Security tries to recover any money from the employer or the insurer. However, some employers and insurers pay out compensation before recovery is made even though they may have been alerted by the Department. This Bill makes it possible for the Department to take recovery action against employers or insurers to redress this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill tightens the Department's recovery powers to ensure that State compensation bodies participate in proper recovery arrangements. This Bill also provides that any outstanding money still owed to the Department once a client has been paid compensation may be recovered from his or her continuing social security entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, sole parent pensions are payable to people caring for children who are not married nor living in a de facto relationship and to people caring for children whose spouse is in prison. It is paid because of the very special hardships and disadvantages caused by bringing up children alone. The administration of sole parent pension requires assessment of the domestic circumstances of some claimants and pensioners, to determine whether they are unmarried and not living in a de facto relationship. That aspect of administration has been most unsatisfactory for clients and staff of the Department. Without any clear legislative provisions, staff have been left to administer a program without clear rules and with no clear procedures. The results have necessarily been intensive investigations and arbitrary decision making. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would specify clearly the process for decision making in these cases. It would enable the Department to require sole parent pensioners and claimants for pension who are living in a de facto or marriage relationship to fully disclose their domestic circumstances to the Department. It would provide that, where this is done, the Department must weigh the evidence with a clear list of relevant indicia set out in the legislation and make a decision whether the person is, or is not, entitled to pension. The legislation would provide that, in the rare case when a decision maker is unable to come to a clear conclusion one way or the other, pension should cease, subject to continuation of pension pending resolution of any appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation would also provide that, when a pensioner or claimant has fully and honestly disclosed his or her domestic circumstances to the Department and it has been decided that he or she is entitled to pension, there should be no further investigation of the domestic circumstances of that person for 12 weeks, unless there is a significant change of circumstances. In this way, the Bill would guarantee a decision-making process which recognises the complexity of many cases in this area, and protects clients and staff from the indignity and arbitrariness of current arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation would also specify-for the first time-matters which decision-makers must take into account in determining marital status issues for all purposes under the Social Security Act. This would lead to more structured, more consistent interviewing and decision making on these issues across all pensions, benefits and allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill refines provisions relating to family allowance supplement (FAS) when family income has fallen. These amendments flow from practical experience with the FAS program. Under current arrangements, families may qualify for FAS if their taxable income for the financial year ending in the previous calendar year is below certain levels. If the family's previous taxable income was higher than these levels, but its income has dropped so that taxable income in the current financial year will be at least 25 per cent less, the family can qualify for FAS on the basis of its current financial year's income. </PARA>
<PARA> From December 1989, FAS will be payable, even if the drop in income is less than 25 per cent, as long as total income is expected to be below the FAS income threshold. To preserve the effect of this amendment into the next entitlement year, families will retain their new, higher entitlement if this would make them better off than under a normal assessment based on their income for the previous financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would provide for reassessments of FAS following amended assessments by the Australian Taxation Office or taxable income for the year which is the basis of a FAS entitlement. Under the provisions in the Bill, a downwards reassessment of taxable income would trigger FAS arrears for the client. With an upwards reassessment, an overpayment and reduction in FAS rate would occur only if the reassessment was more than 25 per cent higher. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment ensures that low income parents who are fulltime students receiving Austudy or a similar payment will not be excluded from entitlement to FAS through the operation of the income test. FAS will now be payable to these people at the maximum rate subject to the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> From January 1998, the family allowance provisions will be changed to require recipients to inform the Department of certain notifiable events which occur during the calendar year. Events such as the allowee starting a new job or getting married are likely to generate an increase in income and, therefore, might affect the family allowance rate payable. Prescribing notifiable events in this way puts the family allowance system on a similar footing to FAS. </PARA>
<PARA> A refinement is also being made to the FAS notifiable events arrangements. Currently, FAS can be reassessed where a family's income increases following a notifiable event but only if the event occurred after FAS had been granted. It will now be possible to take into account a notifiable event occurring before grant to arrive at a fair and accurate entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill includes a number of refinements to the unemployment benefit system to strengthen its principles of providing support to people when they need it, providing opportunities and incentives to unemployed people to get back to work and, in return for the community's support, requiring recipients to utilise the opportunities available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to encourage school leavers who become unemployed to commence job search immediately, the four-week period of grace for education leavers to register with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) after leaving study will be abolished from October 1989. This means that the standard 13-week deferment period which applies to all education leavers would run from the date of CES registration as long as a claim for benefit was lodged within two weeks of that date. The Bill stresses the importance of job search by providing that, when a young person registers with the CES before finishing school, that registration would date from the last day of school for benefit purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirements for payment of unemployment benefit and job search allowance include the need for the client to be actively seeking suitable work. It is often difficult to assess this when that person moves to an area where there are low employment prospects. At present, once a person has moved to such an area, it is usually sufficient for benefit purposes if he or she can demonstrate satisfactory attempts to find work in that area. The Bill turns this situation around in cases where there are no good reasons for making such a move. In future, a recipient of unemployment benefit or job search allowance who moves address and reduces his or her employment prospects as a result will have his or her benefit cancelled and, on reapplication, will have to serve a waiting period of 12 weeks. This rule will not apply when the move is to live with or near a family member of the beneficiary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would provide for unemployment and sickness benefit to not be payable when the beneficiary does not provide, and will not apply for, a tax file number. At present, unemployment and sickness beneficiaries who fail to supply their tax file number are taxed at the top marginal rate of 50.25 per cent including the Medicare levy. As from November 1989, benefit will not be payable if claimants do not either supply a tax file number or agree to request one from the Australian Taxation Office. Any current beneficiaries who have not supplied a number by the date of effect or who are not prepared to request a tax file number will forfeit their benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, this Bill incorporates minor amendments to strengthen the child support scheme. The special maintenance income concession for pensioners and beneficiaries who are eligible to apply for administratively assessed child support under stage 2 would be available only if an application is made to maximise recurrent cash entitlements under child support assessment legislation. The Child Support (Assessment) Act would ensure that child support agreements, instruments and orders are exempt from State and Territory stamp duties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act would be amended to ensure automatic withholding from salary or wages can be effectively and speedily applied in every case when a non-custodial parent defaults, regardless of the date of the order giving rise to the liability. It would also be made clear that automatic withholding can be used by the Child Support Agency to collect arrears of maintenance owing to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the States and the Northern Territory in 1989-90, consistent with the decisions taken at the May 1989 Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting. The Bill will replace the States Grants (General Revenue) Act 1988 and the States (Works and Housing) Assistance Act 1988. Both forms of general purpose assistance-general revenue grants and general purpose capital funds-are being provided under one Bill this year, because, as I will mention later, the arrangements for general purpose capital assistance are to be simplified in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> The current estimate of general purpose funding for the States and the Northern Territory under the Bill totals $13,135m, or about 15 per cent of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1989-90. As such, these payments constitute a major element of the Commonwealth's Budget. In combination with the global borrowing limits agreed at the Loan Council meeting, they also have a major bearing on the spending and borrowing of State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> General purpose payments to the States and the Northern Territory are estimated to decline by around 3 per cent in real terms in 1989-90. While the real reduction in general purpose funding is less marked than in 1988-89, it will add to the effect of the significant reductions in payments to the States and global borrowing limits of recent years. These reductions in payments and borrowings have been a key part of our strategy to ensure that all levels of government in Australia contribute to fiscal restraint-something that is essential in order to reduce pressures on domestic demand and the current account deficit. As a result of the funding cuts agreed in the last few years, State spending has been more restrained. Together with the strong growth in the States' own revenues, this has led to a decline in the State sector's net borrowings. Further restraint in State budgetary policies, however, is required. The level of payments provided for in this Bill will help ensure that the States continue to share in the burden of restraint. </PARA>
<PARA>General Revenue Grants</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Most of the assistance to be provided under this Bill is in the form of general revenue grants, which are currently estimated to be $12,825m in 1989-90. The vast bulk of this amount comprises financial assistance grants, but it also includes special revenue assistance to the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> At the May 1989 Premiers Conference, it was agreed that the pool of financial assistance grants in 1989-90 would be determined on the basis of a reduction from the Forward Estimates at the time of $550m in savings; and a further $45m to fund the special revenue assistance for the Northern Territory. This implies a reduction of $595m in financial assistance grants, but net savings from the Forward Estimates of general revenue grants of $550m. Consistent with the arrangements in 1988-89, both financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance are to be adjusted for the difference between the actual increase in the consumer price index in the year to the March quarter 1990 and the forecast at the time of the Premiers Conference, so that the real level of assistance agreed at the Conference is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> The distribution of financial assistance grants is to be determined on the basis of per capita relativities determined by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its Report on General Revenue Grant Relativities, 1989 Update. As in 1988-89, the relativities are applied to a combined pool of financial assistance and hospital funding grants. However, in 1989-90 the entire `incentives' component of hospital funding grants and certain penalty provision adjustments are to be excluded from the pool of funds to which the per capita relativities apply, whereas only funding for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was excluded in 1988-89. These amounts are excluded from the calculations so that they are distributed on the basis of specific factors such as the State by State incidence of AIDS cases, rather than the relativities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes provisions for each State's financial assistance grants to be reduced so as to recoup 90 per cent of the additional revenue available to the States and the Northern Territory as a result of the removal from 1989 of exemptions for Telecom Australia, Australia Post and the Overseas Telecommunications Corporation from a range of State taxes and charges such as stamp duty and land tax. It is estimated that the additional savings to the Commonwealth from this measure will be about $70m. Because the States will retain 10 per cent of the additional collections, the net effect of this measure will be to enhance their fiscal capacity. Similar arrangements applied in 1988-89 when the Commonwealth recouped 90 per cent of the extra revenue accruing to the States as a result of removing the exemptions from payroll tax for a number of Commonwealth business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is also included in the Bill to make appropriate minor adjustments to financial assistance grants in 1989-90 and the base level of assistance in respect of the recoupment of payroll tax paid by business enterprises for 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> As noted earlier, the Northern Territory is to be provided with special revenue assistance in 1989-90 at a base level of $45m. Four States, including the Territory, received special revenue assistance in 1988-89 to ease the adjustment to reduced levels of funding and the new per capita relativities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to move the Northern Territory to a financial basis comparable with the States. If special revenue assistance to the Northern Territory had been terminated in 1989-90, however, the Territory would have experienced a substantial fall in its general revenue grants. </PARA>
<PARA>General Purpose Capital Grants</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the payment of $310.5m in interest-free capital grants to the States and the Northern Territory. This is the same amount provided as grants in 1988-89 under the States (Works and Housing) Assistance Act 1988 and is to be distributed on the same basis as in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements proposed for 1989-90 do not, as in previous years, provide for concessional loans for public housing. These loans are being replaced by additional grants under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (CSHA). These additional grants amount to $310.5m, the same amount as the concessional loans provided in 1988-89, and will be distributed on the same basis. The distribution of the new grants will be adjusted over the period to 1992-93 to correspond with that for other general housing assistance under the CSHA. Providing these funds as grants rather than as repayable advances increases the value of the payment to the States and should allow them to provide additional assistance to the public housing sector. </PARA>
<PARA> One further change from the arrangements put in place last year is that under this Bill the payment of general purpose assistance has not been made conditional on State observance of the global borrowing limits. Such a provision was included in the States Grants (General Revenue) Act 1988 in response to the refusal of Queensland to agree to the resolution of Loan Council which set the limits for 1988-89. All States have agreed to the resolution for 1989-90. However, should any State in the future fail to commit itself to the global limits or fail to use its best endeavours to observe them, the Government would be prepared to propose the reintroduction of the provision to this or future legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> No provision is made in this Bill for payments of general purpose assistance to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). However, provisions in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) allow for analogous payments to be made to the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an integral part of the Commonwealth's financial relations with State governments and the Budget. I commend the Bill to the House and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill, together with the companion Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1989, proposes a series of amendments to the Commonwealth's anti-dumping legislation, contained in three Acts: the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975; the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988; and part xvb of the Customs Act 1901. The amendments contained in this Bill give effect to two substantive proposals and some other technical amendments. The first substantive proposal effects the restructuring of the provisions dealing with anti-dumping matters into discrete taxing and non-taxing Acts. This has involved the repeal of a substantial number of provisions of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act, effected by the companion Bill, and the transfer of those provisions to part xvb of the Customs Act, effected by this Bill. A detailed analysis of the repeals and transfers, including a concordance of the provisions affected, is contained in the explanatory memoranda to both Bills. The purpose of this exercise has been to avoid possible difficulties arising out of the High Court's decision in Air Caledonie International v. the Commonwealth. That decision relates to section 55 of the Constitution and the treatment of taxing and non-taxing provisions, and it has raised doubts about the proper placement of some of the provisions in the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975. The Government has decided to put those provisions beyond doubt by transferring them to the Customs Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the second substantive proposal in this Bill, which is aimed at implementing the Government's recent decision announced on 10 September 1989 on the inclusion of a profit margin when the `normal value' of goods is being `constructed'. Dumping occurs when the price at which goods are exported to Australia-the `export price'-is less than the normal value of the goods in the country of export. This `normal value' is usually just the price of the goods in the domestic market of the country of export. Sometimes, however, that price is unavailable, for example because the goods are produced only for export, and not sold on the home market; or unusable, for example when the exporting country is a centrally planned economy. The normal value must then be obtained in some other way. One such way is to add up the costs of making and selling the goods within the country of export and, in appropriate cases, including a margin of profit. Such a normal value is said to be `constructed'. One possible reason why the domestic price might be unusable would be that the overseas company had been selling the goods in its domestic market at a loss, for an extended period of time and in substantial quantities. Under subsection 5 (9) of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act, which is to be subsection 269tac (12) of the Customs Act, such sales would be considered not to be in the ordinary course of trade, and their price therefore not be usable as a normal value. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 the Government asked Professor F. H. Gruen of the Australian National University to review aspects of anti-dumping policy. Professor Gruen's subsequent report made many recommendations for change, most of which were accepted by the Government. Professor Gruen in his report noted, and deplored, an increasing propensity to use constructed normal values. He noted, too, that such values could be substantially above the actual domestic price. He therefore suggested that the number of constructed normal values should be reduced to the absolute minimum and that this be achieved by repealing subsection 5(9) of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. He went on to say that, if this approach were not adopted, more realistic normal values could be obtained by not including a profit in constructed prices. In the event, the Government decided to retain subsection 5 (9) of the Anti-Dumping Act, but to tighten some aspects of its use. In particular, it decided that, unless there were strong reasons to the contrary, a zero profit should be assumed when subsection 5 (9) was being used. However, this intention could not be achieved by amending subsection 5 (9) itself. The operation of that subsection might make it necessary to construct a normal value, but the method of construction-including the matter of a profit margin-was specified in three other subsections of section 5 of the then Act, any one of which might be used in a given case. The amending legislation passed by this Parliament last year therefore included changes to each of these three other provisions. In each case, the amendment was to the effect that a profit would only be included in circumstances specified in regulations to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The same legislative package created a new Anti-Dumping Authority, which came into existence on 1 September 1988. Shortly thereafter the Government referred to the new Authority the question of what regulations might be made to prescribe the circumstances when a profit component should be included in a normal value construction. The Authority held a public inquiry into this and some other questions referred to it, and at the same time received and considered many submissions, and reported in March 1989. In its report, the Authority distinguished sharply between the construction of a normal value because subsection 5 (9) had been invoked, and the construction of a normal value for any other reason. Subsection 5 (9) comes into play only when prices, in the domestic market of the exporting country, have been unprofitable for an extended period. Under the Authority's rationale, had the sales not been at a loss, their price would probably have been accepted as a normal value and `construction' of a value would have been unnecessary. The constructed value should therefore take account of all costs, so that sales at that price would not be at a loss; but there was no reason to include any profit. The Authority went on to argue that, when a normal value was being constructed for any other reason, a profit should indeed be included. </PARA>
<PARA> The margin of profit allowed would vary from case to case, and could sometimes even be zero. Like other components of a constructed normal value, it would always be so chosen as to obtain the best estimate possible of a fair price within the domestic market of the country of export. The Authority reasoned that the inclusion of a profit, which might be zero, in such cases would improve consistency. A company, for example, might produce two kinds of goods, export both to Australia but sell only one on its domestic market. For the latter goods, the domestic price-which would usually include some profit-could be used as the normal value. For the other goods, a normal value would have to be constructed. For consistency it, too, should usually include that same level of profit. The Authority considered, and rejected, the argument that profits should never be included in constructed normal values, to keep these values as low as possible. If the construction process tended to lead to overestimated normal values, it reasoned, the solution should be found in revising the process rather than in compensating for the error by an arbitrary exclusion of profit from all constructed values. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority also considered arguments that the level, if any, of profit to be included should be decided by referring to the conditions facing the relevant Australian industry, such as its need for protection against dumped imports. This argument, too, it rejected. The Authority said in its report that it could not, `. . . see how the current condition of, say, the Australian lampshade industry can conceivably be relevant to the normal value of (say) Egyptian lampshades sold on the Egyptian domestic market'. The Government has considered carefully these conclusions by the Authority, and agrees with them. In its report the Authority went on to recommend regulations which might be made under the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act to achieve these effects. After consideration, the Government has come to the view that these same objectives can best be implemented by amendments to what was section 5 of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Under other changes proposed today, that section will become section 269tac of the Customs Act. Its wording, as proposed to be amended, allows a profit, which may be zero, to be included in a constructed normal value except where the reason for construction is that subsection 269tac (12)-the equivalent of the old subsection 5 (9)-has come into operation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I take great pleasure in introducing the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 to the House. The purpose of the Bill is to provide, so far as the Constitution permits, for the establishment and maintenance of a national system of controls relating to the quality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic goods that are supplied in Australia, whether those goods are produced in Australia or elsewhere, or are exported from Australia. This Bill will bring together and strengthen various pieces of Commonwealth legislation to provide protection to consumers of therapeutic goods and to assist Australian industry both locally and internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> Therapeutic goods are those goods for use for the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of diseases and other bodily conditions or which can be taken to be for such a use through advertising and other means. These goods cover a vast array of products ranging from those that have become essential to maintain the standards of health and well-being which we have come to expect to those that are merely for our convenience. The range includes substances extracted from biological sources such as vaccines and antibiotics, the large range of chemically made pharmaceutical products which we see in pharmacies, test kits for the diagnosis of diseases such as dip sticks to monitor urinary sugar, and a diversity of other therapeutic devices ranging from cyclotrons to contact lenses to bedpans. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time it is estimated that on the Australian market there are over 14,000 medicinal drug products and perhaps 25,000 therapeutic devices. This is an estimate because currently many products can enter our marketplace without prior recording or scrutiny. Several factors have influenced the average life expectancy at birth of the Australian population, which has increased by 15 years over the past 65 years. Improved sanitation, improved education about health issues leading to changes in personal habits and improved nutrition have all contributed to this increase. What is clear, however, is that the availability of modern therapeutic goods has played a major beneficial role in modifying the impacts and outcomes of illnesses and contributed greatly to the quality of the life which individuals now enjoy. Many therapeutic goods are, in effect, man-made supplements to the body's own mechanisms to maintain its health status. However this manipulation of the still poorly understood and immensely complex checks and balances that occur in the body involves a substantial risk factor. One has only to consider the personal catastrophies caused by thalidomide, when it was given to pregnant women, to realise that there is a narrow margin for many therapeutic goods between benefit and risk or, put another way, for a drug to be either a medicine or a poison. In the same way a poorly made or designed device may be a hazard rather than a help. The potential damage is compounded by the huge international scale of mass production and distribution of therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Three parameters are used to define the acceptability of a product for therapeutic use. The first is its quality which refers to aspects such as its proper manufacture, the trueness of the contents to the label and its compliance with any relevant product standards. The second parameter is its safety, that is its lack of toxicity or hazard or at least that the product has an acceptable level of risk compared to the expected benefits when it is used as directed. This aspect is often demonstrated from animal experiments and the information must be assessed in relation to how and why the product will be used. Surveillance for unwanted effects must also continue after a product has been marketed. The third parameter is the product's efficacy, or its effectiveness in fulfilling its intended purpose. Of course other social and economic considerations follow from these product specific aspects, considerations such as the need for the product and its cost. These are not covered in this legislation but for drug products are matters dealt with by the Department of Community Services and Health primarily through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the National Health Act. Together, consideration of these factors made the major contribution toward the rational use of therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA> While therapeutic goods are used in both humans and animals, the Bill deals primarily with those therapeutic goods for human use. It complements the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act that deals with products for veterinary use and which comes within the jurisdiction of my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). Many therapeutic goods are used on or in humans, with the individual patient often having little choice about whether or not to use the product, or being able, by themselves, to assess the benefits of its use against the risks. The complexity of therapeutic goods, the diversity and size of the industry and the real risks represented by many products are such that self-regulation by the industry is not sufficient. In recognition of these circumstances therapeutic goods are worldwide, subject to a relatively high level of control. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides a standard of regulation that is recognised internationally as being necessary to control therapeutic goods and which will bring Australia into line with the levels of product assurances exercised and required by its major trading partners. The Bill includes the three major elements recommended by the World Health Organisation as being necessary for effective regulation and which are utilised by several European countries, as well as Britain, the United States of America, Japan and Canada. First is premarket assessment of products for human use, this being an independent assessment of the manufacturer's data on the product. The Bill permits the assessment of new products prior to inclusion on the Australian register of therapeutic goods. Secondly is the assurance that good manufacturing practices are followed in the manufacture of the therapeutic products for human use. Although a product may be judged to be of an acceptable standard and would appear safe and efficacious on the basis of the premarket evaluation, the standard of manufacture may be so inadequate that there can be no assurance of its quality or consistency on a batch to batch basis once it has entered the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill requires that most Australian manufacturers are regularly inspected by authorised inspectors for compliance with codes of good manufacturing practice as a prerequisite for holding a licence to manufacture therapeutic goods. Thirdly is compliance with set standards for therapeutic goods for human and animal use. The Bill contains provisions for setting standards and provides for regulations for the independent sampling and analysis of goods on the market. All parties-government, industry, professional organisations and consumer groups-agree on the validity of these means of protecting the public from unacceptable products. The Bill is designed to replace the current potpourri of State, Territory and Commonwealth legislation which has evolved in a largely uncoordinated manner over the years, resulting in both disturbing overlaps in controls and unacceptable gaps. The current situation neither adequately protects the public nor benefits the industry. The Bill does not in general greatly increase the current levels of legislation but will remedy identified unacceptable gaps. An example of the gaps is the lack of comprehensive licensing of manufacturers. In the 1960s it was agreed that the Commonwealth would provide a pool of expert factory inspectors and that the States would license manufacturers of therapeutic goods on the basis of the inspections. To date only one State has a comprehensive licensing system and recent evidence that the Department of Community Services and Health gave to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts revealed that many manufacturers do not have an acceptable standard of manufacture. The fragmented licensing controls have meant that Australia has been refused membership of international inspection agreements through which we could gain information on the standard of manufacture of imported products and which would assist reputable Australian exporters to enter overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example of the current inad- equate situation is the lack of scrutiny of locally made products. This is because the Commonwealth powers to carry out comprehensive premarket evaluations of products currently rely on the provisions of the Customs Act 1901 which applies only to imported products. The Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 will rectify these deficiencies. It utilises the Commonwealth heads of power over corporations, interstate trade, and imports and exports. It will change the focus of control from the point of import to the point of supply and will provide a substantially uniform, national system of controls. Industry and consumers alike will benefit from the legislation. For the industry the controls will protect the good reputation of reputable Australian manufacturers by weeding out unacceptable manufacturers and products. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will apply similar requirements to locally manufactured and imported goods and many of the costly and frustrating differences in requirements that currently exist within Australia should disappear. The standing of, and confidence in, Australian exports will, I am sure, increase and we will be able to enter cooperative arrangements with other governments and regulatory authorities. This is essential, so that we can compete in overseas markets, for instance, in the environment of the 1992 proposed European Community's trade agreements. Consumers will have the protection and peace of mind of knowing that new therapeutic goods, both locally made and imported, can be subject to scrutiny before approval for supply and that the products will have been manufactured to acceptable standards. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now give more detail on the major aspects of the Bill. The Bill contains provisions to establish standards for quality for therapeutic goods and it will provide for the uniform application of those standards to imported, exported and locally produced products for both human and animal use. The British Pharmacopoeia and the British Pharmacopoeia (Veterinary) will automatically be adopted as the primary sources of standards. These represent sets of standards, mainly for medicinal drugs, which are recognised internationally. Uniformity of standards between countries is desirable to facilitate international trade and assists the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also has provision for establishing national standards by ministerial determinations which are called therapeutic goods orders. Therapeutic goods orders are developed by a committee established by the regulations, the Therapeutic Goods Committee, which has industry and consumer representation. The Committee must advise the Minister on any proposed standard or changes to standards. National standards are required where there is an identified and proven need and where a suitable international standard does not exist. These can be created by adopting standards from other sources such as other pharmacopoeias or, in the case of therapeutic devices, standards developed by the Standards Association of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains provision to establish the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Inclusion in the register will represent approval for supply. It will be an offence to supply therapeutic goods in Australia or to export therapeutic goods from Australia unless the goods are included on the Register or have been specifically exempted from this requirement by the regulations to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Register will be divided into two parts: one part for registered goods and the other part for listed goods. Registered goods will require evaluation by my Department prior to approval for supply, the degree of evaluation being related to the perceived risks of that class of goods. This will include products such as prescription drugs, new medicinal chemicals and those therapeutic devices regarded as presenting significant risks to the patient. Where possible, existing expertise in the States will be utilised in the national system. For example, negotiations are well advanced to contract the Victorian Proprietary Medicines Advisory Committee to carry out evaluations of many non-prescription drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> The other part of the Register will be for listed goods. Listed goods will be those which by their nature and history of use represent a low risk and which will be included in the Register subject to compliance with standards and some other requirements relating to quality and batch-related safety, rather than a full evaluation. Included in this group will be most of the herbal products, the more concentrated homeopathic products, vitamin and mineral products and most therapeutic devices. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulations will exempt certain products from the requirement for prior approval for supply. These products include simple pharmaceutical formulations for external application and therapeutic devices which are seen as presenting no greater risk than consumer goods in everyday use. Also exempted are personal imports; that is, products for a person's own use or use by the immediate family, which are produced overseas and not available in Australia, provided the products are not injections or are not specifically prohibited. However, the current conditions for a personal import will be tightened to include a limit on the quantity imported of three months supply at the maximum dose of a medicinal drug recommended by the manufacturer. If it becomes evident that this exemption is being abused, it may be necessary at a later stage to amend this exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> Special provisions will also apply to goods not on the Register which are for use in treatment of specific individuals where other treatments have failed and to products for use in clinical trials. Although these goods will be exempt from inclusion in the Register, the Bill contains specific requirements for their supply. Products legally on the market at the time of commencement of the legislation will be entitled to immediate entry into the Register following application by the sponsor. Many of those will not have been evaluated and it is proposed to evaluate relevant products in this grandfathered category if the need arises, or selectively as resources in my Department permit. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible that some products which have previously been rejected by the Victorian Proprietary Medicines Advisory Committee, yet which are legally sold on the Australian market, will be grandfathered. It is intended that these products will be reviewed as quickly as possible to decide whether each should remain on the Register. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulations will continue the existing expert committees which will advise the Secretary and the Minister on matters primarily dealing with the pre-market evaluation of products. These committees are the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee and the Therapeutic Device Evaluation Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major part of the Bill is the provision to license Australian manufacturers. The issue of a licence will depend upon compliance with the Australian codes of good manufacturing practice which are of an equivalent standard to the codes of other major countries. A manufacturer's licence will be issued to cover a range of products which the manufacturer has sufficient expertise to produce. Manufacturers of certain imported goods will be required to provide evidence of their compliance with acceptable codes of guaranteed minimum price in the country of origin. The appeal provisions within the legislation allow for internal review of decisions with ultimate appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The details of the Bill have been the subject of wide consultation with industry, industry associations, consumer groups, professional and practitioner groups and State and Territory governments. The original proposal for the legislation has been substantially modified to take into account the comments my Department has received. </PARA>
<PARA> With the passage of the Bill, many of those provisions in the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations which are currently used to control the import and distribution of therapeutic goods will be revoked. Similarly, the Act and its regulations will replace the current Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 and its regulations. It is expected that the States and Territories will implement complementary legislation to cover products and the few manufacturers which are not encompassed by the Commonwealth controls-for example, unincorporated manufacturers who do not trade interstate. Model legislation will be presented to the States and Territories which would effect this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Community Services and Health has the expertise and infrastructure to implement the provisions of the Bill. In fact, Australia has gained international respect for its performance in this area. The Department employs product evaluators, factory inspectors for good manufacturing practice, and incorporates laboratories which carry out post-marketing testing of therapeutic goods. Some increases in staff resources will be required and these have been agreed to by Cabinet. Cabinet has approved a fee structure that will recover from the industry half of the costs of the therapeutics program. The cost of the program was about $30m in 1988. The most substantial fees will be for the evaluation of products for registration and for the inspection and licensing of manufacturers. Fees will be associated with defined standards of service and the utilisation of the revenue from fees will be reviewed by a joint industry-government committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will not only provide the means to protect the Australian public from substandard, unsafe and ineffective products but will assist the Australian industry in maintaining a local and international reputation for quality products. For the first time, this legislation will provide Australia with uniform, national and comprehensive controls for therapeutic goods. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts, in its recent investigation of the therapeutic goods program, expressed particular concern about the present lack of such controls. I commend this legislation to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of Commonwealth Offices, Logan City, Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a proposal for the construction of a three-level office building containing some 5,600 square metres of usable office space. The building would also allow for future expansion at the upper floor level. It is proposed to construct the building in the Logan City central business district on Commonwealth owned land. Logan City is approximately 25 kilometres south-east of Brisbane central business district and is a new and thriving community with a very high growth rate. It has a relatively young population with a high level of dependency on Commonwealth services, particularly in the welfare area. On the ground floor, the building will accommodate the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service-an excellent service-providing direct public access to their services. Upper floors would also house these organisations together with district representatives of a number of government agencies. Secure car parking is to be provided in the basement. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, in Logan City the Commonwealth occupies about 2,700 square metres of leased office accommodation which is inadequate in terms of size, standard and location. This proposal presents an opportunity to overcome these inadequacies and at the same time to curb the Commonwealth's commitment to rental outlays. Savings for leased space equivalent to the proposed building over a period of 15 years have been estimated at $14m. The administrative and technical needs of Commonwealth staff in Logan City can be satisfied through well planned and properly designed office accommodation. There are also major benefits to the public of this proposal. Ready access to a range of Commonwealth services in one convenient location will be provided, as well as access for the disabled. The Logan City Council is encouraging office development within the central business district and believes the proposed Commonwealth development will add stimulus to this initiative. Two groups within the Department of Administrative Services are involved in the project. The proposal is sponsored, and will be managed, by the Australian Property Group, and will be designed and constructed by Australian Construction Services. </PARA>
<PARA> On 13 April 1989, the House agreed to refer this proposal to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for examination and report. The Committee tabled its report on 5 September 1989 and has accepted the need for the proposal to proceed. In its report, the Committee recommended that additional public toilets be provided on the ground floor of the proposed building. The Committee also recommended that measures be introduced to ensure the security of Commonwealth staff and records. The Department of Administrative Services will incorporate these recommendations when it prepares the detailed design of the building. The Committee noted that the existing policy concerning the provision of car parking spaces at proposed Commonwealth office projects is to be revised by the Department. This review has commenced and will take account of the Committee's comments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also stated that the existing Commonwealth policy concerning the provision of child-care facilities in Commonwealth offices needs to be reviewed. The Government recognises that the provision of an adequate network of children's services is essential to facilitate work force participation. Consistent with its commitment to equality of opportunity in employment and its policies on affirmative action, the Government's policy on child-care is therefore to support and encourage community based work-related child-care facilities. The primary objective of the existing policy is to meet the work-related child-care needs of all families including those who work in the public sector. The Committee's comments have been brought to the notice of my colleagues the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), who is responsible for the Government's children's services program, and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) for consideration as a Public Service condition of employment issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended that the project go ahead at an estimated cost of $9.6m at April 1989 prices. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose this motion, but it is worthy of comment. The report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works is of considerable interest. It is as notable for what it does not tell us in some regards as for what it does tell us in others. We are told that the building is to cost $9.6m. That is in present day dollars. Clearly it will eventually cost in excess of $10m. This is while the Treasurer (Mr Keating) maintains interest rates at 17 plus per cent. Bank bill rates are 18 per cent. In other words, the Commonwealth, were it to go to the bond market with $10m, would be able to get 18 per cent for it. We are told that, although the present bill for the areas being rented is $304,900 per annum, somehow or other we are going to save $14.53m over a 15-year period, about $1m a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The interest bill on $10m-the opportunity cost of the taxpayers' money-is $1.7m a year. So it appears that the Government is converting a rent outlay of almost $305,000 to an interest cost, or opportunity cost in this case. The Government certainly does not make any calculations in this report as to the opportunity cost of the $10m of taxpayers' money to be expended. However, $10m at 17 per cent is $1.7m. So the rental cost of this building to the Australian people is $1.7m, whereas the private sector is presently providing it for $305,000. It is time that members of the Government, all of whom are notable for their lack of business experience, and headed by the world's best Treasurer, a union bureaucrat who, at the age of 24, came to this place where he has been a professional politician ever since, acknowledged that those numbers are not very true. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other aspects of the Committee's report which are worthy of reference but which received no comment from the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan). The first aspect is the concern of the Logan City Council about traffic matters. There will clearly be a cost to the ratepayers because the Commonwealth basically says that traffic is the Councils' problem. The Council has indicated that it sees an increase in traffic movements of about 60 vehicles an hour, and all the Commonwealth is going to do is change the median strip, primarily so that its clients can get into the building. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not much being done to assist the local authority. Of course, that has to be taken in the context that presently the Commonwealth Government is being extremely mean to local government and State road authorities in terms of the funding available for road construction. In fact, we are well aware that local government in particular has had to impose very large burdens on its ratepayers to obtain sufficient funds just to maintain roads, let alone improve them. Here we are going to have a very large building with a substantial increase in traffic movements, estimated at 60 vehicles an hour in addition to the 230 that apparently already pass the door. The Government's attitude is, `That is your problem, mate, you deal with it'. I guess that the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), who is the local member, will be trying to explain to the local ratepayers why they have to put their hands in their pockets so that the Commonwealth can concentrate all its activities in a single area and, as a result, worsen the traffic problems as reported on pages 12 and 13 of the Committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders what efforts the honourable member for Forde made on behalf of the local ratepayers. I see that the honourable member made a submission to the Committee. I bet it was all about, `Let's build it, it's a great idea'. But it appears that the taxpayers of Australia will contribute in excess of $1m a year for the privilege and the Logan City Council will be up for substantial expenditure in improving the road system, whereas I gather that at the moment these various offices are spread around the district and do not concentrate the traffic to such a degree. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have a similar situation with parking. The Commonwealth says, `We are bigger and better than local government. Your rules do not apply to us'. We see that happening quite frequently. The Commonwealth is going to provide only 120 parking bays when Council by-laws apparently require 265. Again, that will put extra pressure on the local authority. The local authority has a provision for cash in lieu but the Government is declining to provide the cash in lieu. It is suggested that the matter be reviewed. I think the Minister is suggesting that one day the Government will do so, but not this time. So there will be considerable cost to the ratepayers of Logan City. I am sure that the ratepayers of Logan City have not been made aware of this by their local member; their interests have not been defended. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter is child-care. The Government, which wants to push everybody else into child-care, seems to be deficient in this area. Because of the substantial interest costs now pressing home owners, many wives have to work. About 30 per cent of women in the work force have stated categorically that they would prefer to be at home giving proper attention to their home and family but can no longer afford to. Family life should not be a luxury but women find themselves being forced into the work force because families cannot afford the Treasurer's interest rates on their homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, if the Government is of the view that child-care is a responsibility of employers, it should be leading the way, and I do not mean with institutionalised child-care at the present level. It should take advice from the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, and assist the individuals concerned. The Government could provide a private enterprise facility in a building of this size to assist those women who have no choice today under this Government's grand economic plan but to take their children to work with them or put them in child-care facilities. I am sure that if those child-care facilities could be close to the individual's workplace, many mothers would be much more confident about leaving their children and would be able to pay some attention to their children during the lunch hour at least. </PARA>
<PARA> There is going to be a review. That is another gonna. There seems to be quite a few gonnas; the Government is gonna do this and gonna do that, but it is not going to do it with this building. The honourable member for Forde is well known for her utterances on welfare issues, but she has clearly failed her constituents in this case. She has failed to convince the Public Works Committee, although it has made a recommendation as a result of the submission from the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association. But, basically, the Government has not heeded her pleas and her constituents will be the losers. </PARA>
<PARA> As we say, the Government is here to govern. It still suffers from the belief that it is cheaper to spend taxpayers' money building buildings of this nature. It is building them at a time when it is demanding of the business community that it spend less. These hundreds of millions of dollars worth of projects that have been presented to the Parliament in recent times are a classic example of government expenditure which may or may not be necessary but which certainly will contribute to further overheating of the economy. It is strange that business is being told to pay 20-odd per cent interest to embark on projects of this nature so that they will stop doing it. That seems to be the Treasurer's desire. But the Government is going out helter-skelter in its marginal electorates building these sorts of programs. However, it is the Government. We are not opposing the motion. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Refurbishment of the Reserve Bank, 60 Collins Street, Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed public work is the refurbishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia premises at 60 Collins Street, Melbourne. The financial system, and the Bank's role in it, has been transformed in recent years by substantial deregulation, including abandonment of foreign exchange controls and floating of the Australian dollar. In the case of the Bank's Melbourne branch, these changes have resulted in some staff reductions, an increasing adoption of new technology and economies in total office space required for a consolidated operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Melbourne branch has operated from its current premises since it was completed in 1966. Although structurally and externally sound and well located for its purpose, it is in need of substantial internal refurbishment to meet current standards for accommodation, amenity and operational efficiency. On completion of the works the Bank will occupy wholly or in part seven floors, with the remaining nine floors leased to generate income, estimated at $2.3m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed scope of work will include enlargements and upgrading of the ground floor lobby, upgrading of all office floor levels, including removal of asbestos fire retardant material in ceiling spaces, and installation of new ceiling, carpets and building services, including the extension of a sprinkler fire service to all levels of the building. A three-level basement housing the Cash Department will not be refurbished as part of this project. </PARA>
<PARA> The design is being undertaken by private sector consultants and future design documentation and construction will be undertaken on a project management basis, using a construction management project delivery system. The estimated capital cost is $25m at June 1989 prices. Funds have been budgeted by the Bank. This is a significant public work and one which will materially improve the operational base of the Bank. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a reference to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. It has yet to go through the processes that have just been referred to, so the Parliament will have another chance to consider this work. The Opposition does not oppose such a reference. The amount of money being spent by the Reserve Bank of Australia is $25m. Considering its form of accounting, presumably that, too, will be a charge against the Australian taxpayer. On many occasions before, when the Government was having difficulties in balancing its Budget, it was in the habit of calling our attention to profits of some thousands of millions of dollars that were transferred from the Reserve Bank to the Government. So any depletion of that profit will be noted, as occurred with the deal done the other day between the Government and four banks, when $200m worth of Reserve Bank profits were transferred to certain trading banks. I add that it was done on a benefit ratio, compared to their housing assets. Certain banks get a 50 times bigger advantage from that deal than others. It is very notable that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was showing a degree of nervousness about that and trying to tell us that it was ordinary people who might miss out. It is not ordinary people. The customers of some banks will get 50 times less chance to benefit than the customers of other banks. We do not oppose this proposal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Debt Sinking Fund Amendment Bill 1989 amends the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966, which is about redemption and repurchasing of Commonwealth and State debts. Its operations are supervised by a National Debt Commission which comprises the Treasurer, presently the Chief Justice, the Secretary to the Treasury, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department. The purpose of the amendment is to take the Chief Justice from the Commission. As an Opposition we have no problems with that; it has been done at the suggestion of the Chief Justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is an interesting conjunction that at a time when we are talking about taking somebody off the National Debt Commission the debt crisis that Australia faces is absolutely horrendous. This has been a wide-ranging debate and I find absolutely fascinating the way in which the Government is treating an opportunity to talk about the greatest crisis Australia has faced economically-our overseas debt crisis. I illustrate how important it is by saying that in the first 82 years of Federation our debt rose to approximately $35 billion; in the last six years of Federation, since 1982-83, it has risen by another $100 billion. If people were to put that on a graph they would realise the significance of what I am saying tonight: that this millstone around our national neck is horrendous. It will impact not only on my children but also, I believe, on my children's children because of the excesses of this Government and the lack of framework to prevent this rich country of ours sinking into a huge debt with enormous consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> The debt can be described in many different ways to get across just how bad it is. In 1983, on average, each Australian man, woman and child represented $2,000 in overseas debt. That figure is now past $8,000. In other words, it has quadrupled in six years. That is a quite incredible state of affairs for a country that is rich in mineral resources and agricultural products, has sophisticated communication systems, and until the last few weeks had an effective transport system. This country has gone down the chute in a quite dramatic and tragic way. </PARA>
<PARA> Another way of expressing the problem is to compare the net debt with that of some other countries. The net debt of Australia as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) has gone up by a factor of five in the last eight years. Just to get a comparison, we can look at Canada's record. In 1981 its net debt as a percentage of GDP was 25 per cent. What is it now? It is 24 per cent. If we look at Australia's net debt as a percentage of GDP, in 1981 it was 6 per cent. Now it is 30 per cent. We have a horrendous problem in relation to our net debt as a percentage of GDP. It is a huge change from the circumstances that Australia enjoyed only a few years ago. Per capita we are the seventh most indebted country in the world. In absolute terms Australia's gross foreign debt is exceeded only by that of the United States, France and Canada. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to read tonight from an editorial that appeared last year in the Australian Financial Review which brings home the reality of the overseas debt we are faced with, right down to the grassroots of this society. The editorial illustrates that overseas debt affects ordinary Australians and feeds through into the interest rates for small business people and housing. Ultimately the ordinary worker has to pay for the mismanagement the Government has imposed on this country over the past six years. The editorial, about 12 months ago, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Although few ordinary Australians realise it, the high foreign debt level has a number of effects on their daily lives-and the future of their children. </PARA>
<PARA> The most direct effect is on interest rates. Foreign investors demand higher returns in Australia than in countries with much lower debt ratios as they fear further depreciations of the $A. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, interest rates on government and statutory authority bonds have to be higher than otherwise would be the case. These costs are then passed on to ordinary Australians through higher government charges and taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Other interest rates-including housing rates-are also affected. If the differential between the rates on bonds and other government bonds becomes too narrow, then foreign investment falls and with it the demand for the $A and the exchange rate. In such circumstances, the authorities have no real choice but to let the rates creep upwards. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . At the same time as Australia has been borrowing heavily overseas, more and more of its savings are being invested overseas by Australian companies. While total private investment in Australia increased by only 5 per cent in real terms over the past six years, Australian investment abroad has increased ninefold. </PARA>
<PARA>That editorial in the Australian Financial Review makes a very clear judgment. That is not what the Opposition is saying or what I am saying; it is what the editorial is saying. It has predicted very clearly the pattern that has occurred over the past six or eight months in this country. Now it is ordinary Australians who are suffering. They are paying the penalty for the mismanagement of this economy, which has allowed our overseas debt to blow out to enormous proportions at this stage in our history. Our children will be paying for this in the years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> We could go on for quite some time about the way in which this impacts on the lives of all Australians. What is required to bring about changes to this great country, which has a great future if it is managed properly by a good government? I can suggest a few things which I believe are very important. There is a great need, first of all, to reduce demand for foreign capital. There is a need to increase domestic savings. We have to put in place mechanisms which will encourage Australians to finance developments in Australia so that demand for foreign capital will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly-we hear about this regularly, but the Government does very little about it-productivity should be improved in the workplace, in transport, in shipping and in management. Overall, our goal has to be to boost exports and to lower imports. We have seen how the Government's intransigence in regard to Australia's economy has kept the dispute between the airlines and the pilots going for the past seven weeks. Sadly, that is due largely to the confrontationist approach by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). This dispute would never have gone on to this extent if the Prime Minister had not poured petrol onto it. The opportunity exists now for a compromise to be found so that this country's productivity can be brought back on the rails. The way in which this Government has intervened in this dispute has meant that it has continued much longer than need be, and that is a great tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly-we have hammered the Government regularly and asked it to do something about this-there is no choice for this country but to get wage increases, interest rates and inflation in line with those of our trading partners. This country will not make progress until we actually achieve that. The reality is that, even though the Government claims that our inflation rate has come down, it is still much higher than our trading partners' rates, and this is of grave concern vis-a-vis this country's future. The same applies with wage increases and interest rates. Australia will have a great problem getting back onto its feet with housing loan interest rates at 17 and 18 per cent and interest rates for businesses at 22, 23 and 24 per cent while our trading partners have interest rates of half that. Until we address these factors, and until this Government gets a grip on the macroeconomy of Australia, we will continually be faced with this huge crisis of our overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by saying that we do not oppose what is being proposed in the Bill. However, it is significant that we are removing from the National Debt Commission a person who has a great standing in this country. At this stage in our history, instead of removing somebody of that stature, maybe he should be staying on and giving some firm direction, and not just legal advice, which was the purpose of his appointment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to lead the debate from the Opposition benches on the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Amendment Bill and the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Collection Amendment Bill. These are basically minor technical housekeeping Bills; nevertheless, I am delighted to have the opportunity to talk about borrowing and the performance of the Hawke Government in that respect. It is important to recognise, first, that a levy was imposed on borrowings on all Commonwealth semi-government authorities and government-owned companies other than those engaged in the business of financial inter- mediation such as the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the Australian Industry Development Corporation. The levy is currently set at 0.125 per cent per annum and is designed to take account of the benefit these enterprises receive in terms of access to financial markets by virtue of their Commonwealth ownership. By ensuring that the effective cost of borrowings to these enterprises is more directly comparable with that faced by private sector borrowers, the enterprises are encouraged to take full account of the cost to the community of their investment decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason that I read that section from the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) was to draw particular attention to the nature of this borrowing levy. There are a couple of important points that need to be made about that. The first is that we should recognise that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) boasts on most occasions about his fiscal performance in the sense that he claims to have reduced the Commonwealth's contribution to the public sector borrowing requirement quite significantly over the life of the government, and draws attention to the fact that in recent years he has increased that Commonwealth Budget surplus to about 2 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year. It should also be recognised that the deficit on the part of Commonwealth Government agencies and corporations to which this levy applies has gone up quite dramatically and in fact now significantly offsets the size of the surplus that has been achieved on the Commonwealth's own Budget account. The obvious reason for that, of course, is that a substantial number of items have been moved off Budget during the life of this Government, and it is important to recognise that that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the quote concerning the nature of the levy, and the fact that it is imposed on Commonwealth semi-government authorities and government-owned companies in order to facilitate their access to international financial markets. It is worth asking the question: Why do some of these authorities bother? What are they really getting in return for this borrowing levy? When Australia had an AAA borrowing status in international capital markets it was something worth having, and these authorities probably did not feel too badly about paying a levy for the right to borrow as if they were the Commonwealth Government and had AAA status. Now that Australia's credit rating has been downgraded by Moody's Investors Service from AAA to AA1 and, most recently, to AA2-Standard and Poor's, the other rating agency, is now carrying out a review of our Standard and Poor's rating-I am sure a number of these authorities have started to ask themselves what they are paying for, why they are paying for this access when the bottom line has been a significant increase in the effective cost of their borrowing over this period. It was about three years ago that we rated AAA. The practical effect of the downgrading of our international credit standing over that period has been that the cost of borrowings to these agencies, as well as to the Commonwealth, has jumped quite significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important for the Government to recognise that, while it might find this levy to be a very convenient revenue device for raising, in this year's Budget, about $11m from these authorities, it should look at the other side of the coin and at its responsibilities in relation to that levy. It would then run a much tighter, more effective domestic economic policy than has been the case. In this regard it is important to recall some of the things that Moody's Investors Service said at the time it recently downgraded our credit rating, for the second time in three years, from AA1 to AA2. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the most telling point was that Moody's drew attention to the fact that our debt service ratio has fallen out of line with other countries that were AA1 rated since September 1986, when Moody's downgraded us from AAA to AA1. Basically, Moody's said that the Government has failed to address our fundamental economic problems over that period. As a result, our debt level and service burden have increased dramatically over that three-year period. More important is the point that Moody's drew attention to the fact that Australia's relative external debt position will probably worsen before it stabilises, and that it will probably not stabilise until the middle 1990s at the earliest. Moody's emphasised that the Government has no medium term response to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Government's own figures-produced recently by the Economic Planning Advisory Council through a number of scenarios that had been run on various econometric models around Australia, looking at the circumstances under which our international debt may stabilise, and when-led to the conclusion that the middle 1990s was probably the most optimistic one could be. In fact there are scenarios which, perhaps more realistically, show our international debt stabilising in the late 1990s at the earliest. </PARA>
<PARA> In making its assessment Moody's drew attention to a number of factors which ought to be on the record. It emphasises the Government's inability to control excessive dom- estic demand growth. In recent days we have seen considerable continuing evidence of that fact. Although the Government claims to have been addressing that issue quite directly and explicitly now for 18 months, by putting up interest rates and running a tight monetary policy, there is still very little evidence that the economy is actually slowing down. There has been, until recently at least, some evidence to suggest that the housing sector and other parts of the building sector are slowing down, but the most recent data even in that area has shown a pause, and the decline in activity in that sector has stopped. There are a number of pieces of anecdotal evidence running around financial markets now to suggest that the banking sector has increased its lending in the month of August. It will be interesting to see what happens when those statistics are released. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we are, 18 months after the Government started to tighten monetary policy, with record level home loan interest rates, even when the Treasurer has tried to hold down some of those rates artificially. Borrowing costs-that is, interest rates-for small and large business are in the range of 21 per cent to 25 per cent. There have been recent significant increases in Bankcard lending rates, in some cases, and personal finance rates and there still is not much evidence that demand is slowing down. The principal reason is that relying solely on monetary policy, particularly in an environment where both the fiscal and wages policies have recently been eased, will not necessarily slow the economy down in the near term; indeed, it can be counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has clearly eased fiscal policy twice in the last 14 or 15 months. It increased expenditure between the April-May statement of last year and last year's Budget, and this last Budget saw a further increase in expenditure. More importantly, the Government delivered unfunded tax cuts on 1 July. I am not about to say that tax cuts are not essential for a lot of people in this country who have been hit to leg over a period of six years under this Government, but they were unfunded tax cuts on top of an easing of Government expenditure in an environment of a significant easing of wages policy over the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you can cast your mind back to about 12 months ago when the Treasurer first launched this idea of a wage-tax trade-off, and spoke of there being a zero wage increase in return for the tax cut that was in prospect. The tax cut in prospect was always around $20, but the zero wage increase was the key element of that trade-off. The Treasurer is on the record as saying that he thought there would be a zero increase in average earnings in return for that tax cut. By the early part of this year he realised that Messrs Kelty and Crean, the two de facto Cabinet members, could not deliver a zero wage increase and so he readily accepted a substantial wage increase. It can be summarised, loosely, as 6 1/2 per cent earnings growth for this financial year- 1989-90-in return for that tax cut. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the first major easing of wages policy. We are now in the midst of the second major easing of wages policy. For one reason or another, earnings growth has already broken out well above the agreed 6 1/2 per cent, and it looks like coming in during this financial year at somewhere between 8 per cent and 9 per cent at the absolute best. That is a substantial easing of wages policy and fiscal policy over the last 18 months. Indeed, in my view, the Government will be lucky to get away with an earnings increase of between 8 per cent and 9 per cent, under its centralised system and the pressure it is now under, in the course of this financial year. All the elements are there, in terms of the structure of the labour market and the extent to which that labour market has tightened in recent months, for a substantial wage break-out. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) does not talk in terms of wage break-outs any more. It all happens within the system. There has even been a desperate effort to get the contracts that have been offered to the pilots validated as if they were within the system. We will see substantial wage increases, whether they are within or outside the system, in the course of this financial year and probably beyond. </PARA>
<PARA> In all those circumstances the one balancing factor has been monetary policy. More and more weight has been put on monetary policy in the last 18 months. We have record levels of interest rates and no visible evidence that the monetary policy is doing its job. As I suggested, it is probably counter-productive in the near term because it has appreciated the exchange rate, cheapened imports and worsened the balance of payments. It has also fed directly into the consumer price index and worsened our inflationary situation. Finally, that sole reliance on monetary policy has stalled, if not threatened to work directly against, the much needed structural adjustment that will allow us to trade out of our present international difficulties. The only way we can turn our balance of payments around is by getting up our production, productivity and exports. A high monetary policy that is directly attacking investment and which in time will choke off that investment through high interest rates will take away the very much needed capacity that should flow through to create additional production and additional exports. </PARA>
<PARA> To go back to the first point made by Moody's, the Government has demonstrated a continuing inability to control excessive domestic demand growth. Secondly, Moody's mentioned the insufficient progress in generating additional export earning capacity and in restructuring industry to achieve productivity gains. Productivity gains are a bit of a misnomer under this Government. At best they are productivity zeros, and they may be productivity negatives because productivity is stalled and nothing in the Government's policy will see any significant recovery in productivity under the centralised wage determination process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been plenty of employment growth. If I did not worry about the bottom line, I could create jobs too. That is what Moody's is saying: if we do not worry about how much international debt we have, we can create as many jobs as we like. The Government claims to have created between 1.4 and 1.5 million jobs. That represents, per job, about $65,000 in international debt. We could build the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) the biggest house in the street if we did not worry about the debt. We could buy the house next door and add one room, then another, then a wing and another wing. The next year we could buy the next house and so on. We could end up owning the street as long as we did not worry about the overdraft or the size of the debt. That is what Government members have done. The real question is whether those jobs will prove to be sustainable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a real threat inherent in the sole reliance on monetary policy. The Government will undoubtedly put already high interest rates across the board much higher before they do their job in order to stay with that strategy. Those interest rates will ultimately bite, the economy will come crashing down and all the jobs that the Government boasts about will be at risk. People in this country will then be locked into sustained high interest rates because of the external debt situation which has not been addressed, and will be at risk of losing their jobs at the same time. That is the only reason why the Treasurer is panicking at present and running all over the country to create circumstances to go to an early election. He knows that next year the circumstances will be a lot worse. The worst is yet to come by a long way. That is why the circumstances are being carefully manipulated and manoeuvred in order to create the atmosphere in which to go to an early election before the end of this year. The Treasurer knows that the worst is yet to come. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, Moody's drew attention in its assessment to the continued slow pace of structural adjustment which makes Australia ill-positioned to weather the next downturn in the global business cycle without further large increases in foreign currency debt. People forget that even the significant deterioration in our current balance of payments situation-as bad as it is, and it will turn out to be worse this year than the Government's forecast-has occurred in a period in which we have had very favourable world demand and activity circumstances and in which we have had very favourable world commodity prices. In that point, Moody's is asking whether we can imagine what that balance of payments will look like down the track if the world business cycle turns against us. If world activity slows, if world commodity prices fall, where will our balance of payments be relative to GDP or to any of our trading partners? It will be the biggest on our post-war record. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that honourable members opposite like to draw attention to the circumstances in 1981, 1982 and so on when, they say, we had a substantial balance of payments problem. But at that time we had a world recession and the biggest drought in this country this century. Now the current account problem is of the same order of magnitude as it was then, and in the best world circumstances the Government could have. Can members opposite imagine where they will be going next year?</PARA>

As soon as that drought broke this country started to trade its way up a bit and look a bit better. I am putting to the House the argument that in those days the magnitude of the problem was about as big as it is now, and we have had very favourable circumstances. No wonder Moody's takes the point that I have just emphasised concerning the very precarious position this country is in going into the possible world downturn in the course of the next 12 to 18 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final comment that I wanted to take from the Moody's assessment of Australia which I think is very important, and one which must have got right up the whatever of the Treasurer, was the conclusion that the recent Budget did `fail to decisively address the issues of external imbalance and productivity'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman on the other side does not like the fact that the bottom line of everything that I have said is borrowing. This Bill is the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Amendment Bill and I will keep mentioning borrowing every time, because that is the bottom line of all the points that I am making. I was talking about the levy on Commonwealth authorities charged by the Government in return for their use of the Government's guarantee. That guarantee is important in the context of this international financial market that I have drawn attention to. The cost of those borrowings is very heavily dependent on the assessment of organisations like Moody's, so there is a very direct link with the point that I was making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To go back to Moody's final point, it emphasised that the Government's Budget failed to decisively address the issues of external imbalance and productivity. Undoubtedly the Treasurer was fairly shaken by all this. Let it be remembered that he took a particular dislike to Moody's. Who knows why, but in the last 12 or 18 months he has spent a fair bit of his time bucketing Moody's; in the Euromoney magazine and various other places. Where the opportunity presented itself he was quite happy to bucket Moody's and its professional standing. He took a very hard line when its representatives came to Australia to review our credit rating. He refused to let officials from government agencies like the Commonwealth Bank, the Reserve Bank and the Treasury speak to Moody's to put their side of the story. Subsequently Moody's downgraded us, and that was apparently totally justified by the list of facts that I have drawn attention to. </PARA>
<PARA> A second group, Standard and Poor's, the other major international rating agency, is apparently now in Australia. That is very important from the point of view of the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Amendment Bill. This time the Treasurer has decided to take quite a different tack. He is letting the Standard and Poor's representatives talk to officers of the Treasury and the Reserve Bank. He is trying to kill them with kindness, having failed with economic thuggery in the case of Moody's. </PARA>
<PARA> This country has a fundamental debt problem. It is the major policy challenge before the Government and it is one area to which it has principally turned a blind eye for six years. International debts have quadrupled over the life of the Hawke Government. Gross debts are now approaching about $140 billion. Net debt, netting off our international reserves, is about $110 billion. That is a phenomenal amount of money-about $6,500 to $7,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. All we ever get from this Government is false argument and misrepresentation as to the nature of the problem. Never do we get any serious attempt to deal with the problem or to create the circumstances in which we could trade out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> When Moody's recently reviewed our international credit rating the Treasurer attacked Moody's. Both he and the Prime Minister used the argument that the Commonwealth is not a significant borrower; that it is not borrowing on international markets now, and therefore it does not need Moody's. He forgot to mention that the Commonwealth still has a substantial amount of outstanding debt, the interest rates on which will be significantly influenced by any downgrading by an organisation such as Moody's. He also forgot what is inherent in the nature of this levy on the Commonwealth public sector, semi-government authorities and Commonwealth corporations, that is, that Moody's was not grading just the Commonwealth debt; it was grading the debt rating across a wide range of public and private sector organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the list of those whose ratings were under review one sees organisations such as the Australian Industry Development Corporation, the Australian Resources Development Bank, the Australian Wheat Board and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, in addition to the Commonwealth of Australia. One also sees private sector banks such as the National Australia Bank Ltd and the Westpac Banking Corporation. One sees various State government instrumentalities such as the State Banks of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria, the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, South Australian Finance Ltd, the South Australian Government Financing Authority, the Queensland Treasury Corporation, Qantas Airways Ltd and so on. The Government, as the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report was quick to point out, has a widespread responsibility for our international debt. The bottom line is that the debts are there; they need to be serviced. Of course, the rating of the Commonwealth is only part of the story; the rating of all those other public sector and private organisations was at risk when Moody's considered our international credit standing a few months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I have one final comment on the Bills. As I said at the start, we see them as a fairly minor housekeeping operation. They change the nature of the base of this levy. Two new authorities-the Civil Aviation Authority and Aerospace Technologies of Australia-are being included in the list of authorities subject to the levy. The Australian Capital Territory Electricity and Water Authority is to be deleted from the date of ACT self-government. In those circumstances, the Opposition would support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What an extraordinary speech by the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson)! It sounded like his speech during the Budget debate all over again. Undoubtedly that is what it was. The honourable member for Wentworth was not here when these Bills, the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Amendment Bill and the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Collection Amendment Bill, were called. The Government had to call a quorum to get him out of the dining room. He then came in and simply repeated what he has said here a score of times, principally what he said during the Budget debate. It was quite inadequate, and it was the longest speech I have ever heard on a very minor Bill. In some ways what he said was interesting because he has changed his tune very strikingly. Only a month ago he was saying that the Government's policy was so tight that the economy would suffer a deep depression. He is now saying that the Government's policies are not tight enough and that we will not suffer such a depression. He seems unable to make up his mind. He blames the Government for not getting its forecasts right but he completely reverses his own forecasts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> His comments on macro-economic policy, which have nothing to do with the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Amendment Bill at all, deserve a little comment because they also were all over the place. He said that he wants wage cuts. It would be interesting for the whole Australian labour force to know that he wants wages cut. But he does not take account of the fact that because of the growth in productivity, because of the effect of the accord on the rate of inflation, real unit labour costs have already fallen substantially. He said that we had unfunded tax cuts. I am not sure what he means by that. In fact, we have a Budget surplus of $9m. Quite clearly, all the tax cuts that were provided were funded from existing revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> He talked about the need to improve the balance of payments. We all agree with that. But he would like an even tighter economic policy, an even tighter fiscal monetary and wages policy, which would drive the economy into depression. Surely what is required is not only control of imports, a reduction in the level of imports through some lowering of economic activity, but also a much more positive and creative approach to building up the level of exports. One of the principal successes of the Government is the high level of private investment. The present high level of private investment will lead to a better base for future economic growth, which will allow not only import replacement but also export expansion. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wentworth talked as if he wanted tighter monetary policy. That would drive up interest rates. How else would he get the depression that he claimed to want? The real danger of driving interest rates any higher is that it would attract more capital from overseas, keep the exchange rate high and delay the kinds of adjustments to exports and imports required to remedy our balance of payments problem. His analysis and his prescription were internally inconsistent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to remember what this Bill is about. It is a very simple and modest little Bill designed to impose a levy on certain borrowings of Aerospace Technologies of Australia, the Civil Aviation Authority and subsidiaries of certain Commonwealth authorities and corporations; that is, to offset the benefit that those authorities receive from having a government guarantee for their borrowings. At present, the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act imposes a levy on the borrowings, other than from the Commonwealth, of certain authorities and Commonwealth corporations. The levy replaced the Commonwealth guarantee charge. The charge was imposed on bodies which used an explicit or discretionary Commonwealth guarantee when borrowing funds. Such a guarantee allows bodies to borrow at a favourable interest rate as repayment is guaranteed by the Commonwealth. So the risk of default is reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> During the operation of the charge, Commonwealth authorities found that they could borrow on similarly favourable terms without relying on a guarantee because lenders were aware that the Commonwealth was unlikely to allow them to default. As a result, bodies found that they could bypass the charge and still borrow on terms favourable to them due to their semi-government status. The principal Act which this Bill will amend already imposes the levy on organisations such as Australia Post, Telecom Australia, Aussat Pty Ltd and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The other Bill that we are debating-the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Collection Amendment Bill-deletes from the Act the borrowings of the Australian Capital Territory Electricity and Water Authority because the Authority now reports to the ACT Government, following self-government. The Bill will increase revenue by about $200,000 a year. The total Act, therefore, generates revenue of about $8.7m a year. It is a very minor Bill but it draws attention to a major reform the Government has introduced to the management of public sector corporations. The Government has corporatised most of the authorities in the public sector so as to devolve to their boards, councils or commissions the responsibility for the policies of those organisations. The Government sets broad guidelines for those boards and their senior management and they are responsible for the whole performance and functioning of those authorities. It is a dispersal of responsibility. It improves the identification of the location of responsibility. It gives them greater control over their own affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The results of that corporatisation have been excellent. We had a particularly good example yesterday when the Commonwealth Banking Corporation announced profits of $866m for 1988-89. That is a return on shareholders' funds of 14.6 per cent. Some of the honourable members on the other side like to throw abuse at public authorities, saying that they cannot manage their affairs efficiently. I would like to hear them argue that a profit of $866m did not suggest a high level of efficiency and improvement in productivity. Another particularly good example of that high level of productivity is in the airline industry where Australian Airlines Ltd has had a better return on shareholders' funds than Ansett Airlines of Australia has had for some years. We know that in the last year or two Australian Airlines has notably improved its performance. It has a higher level of the air traffic in Australia than has Ansett and it has developed a very efficient method of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is relevant in this context to look at the Opposition's policies about public authorities because it does not impose any reasonable, gradual reforms like the corporatisation that the Government has introduced. It proposes instead the draconian policy of privatisation. The Opposition says that everything which it declares to be wrong with the public authorities can be fixed up by privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I dispute, as I have been doing, the Opposition's claim that there is anything wrong with the public authorities. Not only are they delivering their services effectively but also they are doing that particularly efficiently. The principal claimed justification from the Opposition is wrong. The Opposition has put out a policy statement-one of the few that it has released-called `Privatisation, the Australian Way'. I would like to look very briefly at the four reasons the Opposition gives for claiming that privatisation would improve the efficiency of these organisations. Let me say by the way that there is no evidence at all of a systematic difference in efficiency between the public and private sectors. It is a difficult issue to resolve empirically rigorously but various researchers have tried to do so. Their evidence suggests that there is no systematic difference between the efficiency of substantial, large organisations in either the public or the private sectors. There are some inefficient public authorities but quite clearly there are many inefficient private companies. There are many efficient public authorities and there are many efficient businesses as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The documentation that I have found on this matter-I have done a fairly careful literature survey and I will quote some of the more conclusive evidence-suggests that there is no systematic evidence that public enterprises are less cost effective than are private firms. It is quite clear why this would be so. There is a great difference in the capitalisation, the technology, the management skill and the market situation of organisations in both sectors and their performance will depend on each of those factors. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the four reasons that the Opposition gives for claiming that privatisation is justified. The Opposition suggests, first, that that is a necessary condition for public authorities getting the funds they need. That clearly is not so. For a start public authorities can get most of the funds they need from retained earnings but to the extent that they need additional equity that can be invested in them by government using a borrowing that the government makes. It is not necessary to have a cent of tax revenue put into the equity of public authorities because the equity can be obtained by government through borrowing in the financial markets. The effect of that borrowing will be very little different from the effect of a share issue by a private business. There is no sense in which it could possibly be argued that borrowing by a government to invest in a public authority will crow out the private sector. The Opposition's first point has no rational justification of any kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's second claim is that privatisation would lead to greater efficiency and an improvement in economic performance. I have already shown that the performance of many of the public authorities is extremely good. But the Opposition goes on to suggest that its claimed identification of poor performance in public authorities comes from, for example, lack of managerial autonomy. That certainly cannot be true because under the corporatisation policy of the Government, managers have autonomy. That point carries no validity of any kind. The Opposition claims that the public authorities' purpose which includes their community responsibilities inhibits their effective operation. That is certainly not true if those social responsibilities are important. The Government sets up those authorities largely to provide a service, part of which includes their social responsibilities. If those initial responsibilities are important it is justified in that activity going on in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> It is claimed by the Opposition that public authorities experience rigid and entrenched labour practices. That problem is being addressed through award restructuring. It is claimed that privatisation would increase competition. The Opposition cannot increase competition in natural monopolies, by definition. In the case of some of the public authorities which are already in competition with private businesses, for example, the Commonwealth Bank, to sell it off would reduce competition because it would increase the danger of collusion. I could go on and on but I will not. </PARA>
<PARA> The third claim is that privatisation would increase consumer benefits. That is clearly not so. The experience in Britain is sufficient to refute that. In the year after British Telecom was privatised the number of complaints to British Telecom went up by 70 per cent on its previous full year in public ownership. British Telecom concentrated on providing good service to business and let its services to domestic consumers drop right off. The level of efficiency of delivery on domestic services deteriorated severely. That is what consumers have to expect if public authorities are privatised. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth point made by the Opposition is that privatisation increases the opportunity for employee participation. That can be achieved in lots of other ways, apart from selling shares to employees. The Commonwealth Bank today announced that it had bonus payment arrangements with its employees because of its good profit performance. That is an obvious way of ensuring that there is a direct benefit for employees from their high profit performance. None of those four justifications-the only four justifications which the Opposition gives in this paper-has real justification at all. They can all be shown to be empty and hollow. Clearly what members of the Opposition are proposing through their privatisation policy is based on their ideological position. They do not want the public sector to have any power at all to be able to operate on behalf of consumers in the community. They reject that leverage that public authorities give the Commonwealth Government. If they were sold, the situation for consumers and for the community at large would be severely undermined. I hope that the community at large will recognise that and oppose these policies of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> That having been said, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to deal with these broad issues in this legislation. This legislation is a small step towards improving the corporate management of public authorities and I strongly support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Amendment Bill 1989 and the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Collection Amendment Bill 1989 are a small but important step in implementing an overall government response to increasing the efficiency of the public sector and making sure that it is responsible in Australia's best interests. To put it in some kind of context, it makes sure that public enterprises are placed in a borrowing framework no more advantageous and no less advantageous than other commercial companies in Australia. They are treated fairly and properly in that environment. It fits in with a whole range of other government initiatives which are set out to make sure that the public sector in Australia is treated properly and with those objects in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me just mention three other legs of government actions that have been taken with respect to Commonwealth government business instrumentalities. First, for many years government enterprises were not subjected to obligations to pay rates to local government authorities. That has been resolved and tidied up now so that such instrumentalities pay rates to local government. Of course, that decision has been a remarkable boon to local government authorities, which have collected substantial benefits, and it has put Commonwealth government business enterprises on exactly the same commercial footing as other companies that transact commercial arrangements in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, these instrumentalities, these corporations, have been subjected generally to State laws. In the past, many Commonwealth instrumentalities have been exempt under the shield of the Crown doctrine and have not been subject to the ordinary State legislation that applies to other commercial entities. The Commonwealth is now tidying that up with legislation that was debated in this House just some weeks ago. Under that legislation, government business enterprises will be subjected to the full range of ordinary State legislation with a reserve power in the Commonwealth to make sure that laws which are aimed at discriminating against Commonwealth government business enterprises can be struck down by way of regulation. Essentially, that also puts in place a regime of law that treats Commonwealth government business enterprises in a proper commercial framework. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Commonwealth has dealt with these enterprises, in terms of their own internal management and their structure, to make sure that they work on a much more goal-oriented method and without the kinds of constraints that were inherent in previously rigid structures in the management and reorganisation of the objects they are seeking to serve. All those policies are in place, not simply as incidental and random selections of policy, but as a coherent response to make sure that the Government gets the best out of its own government business enterprises. Referring to the comments of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), it is making sure that the public, which owns those enterprises, gets efficient results from a fully competitive and aggressively managed Commonwealth business enterprise sector. That is something this Parliament should be proud of; it is something that went without remark from the Opposition in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the contribution of the Opposition in this debate, because it really slid away from any substantive examination of these issues. I suppose I would have to say that the way in which the Opposition approaches policy formulation is one of the most interesting Stiffy and Mo acts that the Commonwealth has ever seen. We have the fairly glib reassurance of the recycled Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock)-platitudinous assertions-that all will be well under a Liberal government, and the kind of bland reassurances that are designed to soothe the electorate into some kind of sense of potential pleasure at his elevation. We have side by side with him the Hanrahan of Australian politics, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). He says again, `We will all be ruined before the year is out'. But we have been hearing this tune since Hanrahan became the shadow Treasurer, and we are still waiting. </PARA>
<PARA> What did we hear tonight? We heard a recycled Hanrahan with a slight variation on the theme of his Budget address to us. His peroration from the Budget night had to be recycled, because, obviously caught this time with his pants around his ankles, he was saved by the good nature of the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan), who is seated at the table, who was courteous enough to call a quorum to permit him to come to the House, from whence his travails had taken him, to give us the wisdom that he sought to instil upon this matter. Unfortunately, the wisdom he instilled in this matter was by reading verbatim from the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris). When that exhausted his knowledge of the matter-and that was within about 30 seconds-he then gave us the benefit of what I thought was a most interesting digression-interesting because it exposed some of the positive ideas that really have made up this tirade from the man who would have us believe that we will all be ruined. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most interesting things that he said was that we had unfunded tax cuts. This man, who has berated the Government and has said to the Government, `You do not understand your economics', said that we had unfunded tax cuts! This Government is running a surplus of $7 billion. What an extraordinary assertion for him to make. We then had the usual scare tactic about debt. One of the most extraordinary performances of a person in public responsibility is to repeat the kind of cheap gutter-press logic that every man, woman and child in Australia owes a certain sum of debt. When the Hansard is published, I shall be interested to see the exact figure that was referred to by the shadow Treasurer, because I suspect that, unless there is some doctoring of the Hansard, that will illustrate not only that he is a rather gloomy man but also that his mathematics are none too sharp either, at least in the heat of debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that is put forward is that somehow, collectively or individually, we in Australia owe some massive amount of debt. What nonsense! The Commonwealth owes not a cent in public debt. The Australian public does not owe anything in terms of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth, by virtue of its surpluses, its repayment of debt, its constraints in its own borrowing program, is now in a position where it is a net repayer of debt. The debt, such as it exists, is in bulk private debt. The growth in the debt sector has all been from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Not one Australian man, woman or child, save perhaps for those who have not yet ditched their shares in Bond Corporation, will be subject to the slightest vagaries if Mr Bond falls victim to his present travails. Not one Australian man, woman or child, save perhaps those who have invested in shares in Elders, will be troubled by the fact that that corporation has borrowed extensively to finance its developments. It is quite possible that the investments that have been made by Elders are wise investments. I think it is unlikely that my friend at the table, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), will suggest that the investments of Elders are other than wise. Nonetheless, they are investments that have substantially run up the indebtedness of that corporation and they are the debts that are being aggregated and added together with the other corporate debts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the shadow Treasurer really suggesting? Is he suggesting that we should reregulate the financial markets and put some system of financial controls upon the capacity of Australian corporations to borrow outside this country or within it? Is he really trying to become a dinosaur, a throwback of the Liberal Party to the pre-Menzies days even? It was an extraordinary tirade. At the end of the day the Liberal Party seems to be looking for some fortunate ill-adventure that might befall the country. We have the extraordinary situation where the Opposition is seeking to sponsor a challenge to an arrangement between the Government and the banking sector that will keep down the cost of interest rates to the public. Quite obviously, what members of the Opposition would love to see for their own selfish and narrow political advantage would be another rise in interest rates. But what contempt does that show for the Australian public? With what gratuitous foolishness does it think the Australian public will greet that kind of mischievous malaise? We have the kind of approach that has been used in respect of credit rating, the gleeful seizing upon bad news, the selling of Australia short, the looking for opportunities for Australia to be brought undone. </PARA>

A point of order was taken on the previous speaker from this side of the House about the matter of relevance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thought it wise, however, in the course of this debate to throw a little cold water on Mr Hanrahan and his rather gloomy predilections. I will come back to the thrust of this Bill. It is a simple one. It implements just one more aspect of this Government's micro-economic policy, making sure that the public corporations of Australia are in a fit state to discharge their responsibilities at this time in Australia's economic development, at this time of the twentieth century. It is making sure that they are geared up, that they are efficient, that they have the managerial skills and the framework of economic and social responsibilities we require of corporations in this modern day to respond to Australia's economic and social needs. For all those reasons, this Bill deserves the support of the House. (Quorum formed)</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was nearly at the conclusion of my remarks. The interest of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) in my speech suggests that I continue, particularly for those who are interested in an analysis of Australia's economic problems. I found it particularly interesting when we discovered that the reason Australia was in difficulty in the declining years of the Fraser Government, when the present shadow Treasurer held the reins as an economic adviser, was the drought. It really does continue the fairly rural theme of this Ferrari-driving Hanrahan. He really is a man who has taken his responsibilities so seriously that the failure of economic discipline in the Fraser years can be attributed to the drought. His gloomy predictions of ruin for Australia, made on a daily basis, can be given as much weight as those of the apocryphal Hanrahan in the poem that we love so much. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that we still look forward to a bit of learning, a bit of growth in terms of the capacity of the Opposition to respond to Australia's structural difficulties. In the earlier debate we heard a suggestion that Australia was facing a wages blow-out. What a prescription for economic doom-an assertion from the shadow Treasurer that Australia is facing a wages blow-out. It comes from a party that has no policy whatsoever for wage containment. It has no constructive contribution at all to make in terms of wages policy. We hear the dire prediction that this year, under the system the Government has put in place, the accord, we are facing a wages blow-out. We cannot permit Australian political debate to be so debased that what passes for a contribution to debate in this House is merely a series of criticisms designed to create a climate of fear and misunderstanding in the community without any constructive response or contribution at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Treasurer was late to this debate. He has been late in making a contribution on tax policy. The Opposition is late in making any statement at all in respect of wages policy. We are still waiting as Australians to hear any constructive contribution at all in relation to the difficulties we accept we face but which the Australian Government is moving constructively towards resolving. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not originally intend to enter this debate. All that was necessary to be said was said so ably by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), and the matter was fully dealt with. Having listened to the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), with whom I have crossed swords before, I feel obliged to make a few remarks. The point the shadow Treasurer was making was that, with the imposition of this levy by the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Amendment Bill, Commonwealth authorities are thereby making some payment in return for the privilege of raising their money in effect under a Commonwealth umbrella as if they were the Commonwealth-in other words, getting the credit rating of the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it would be correct to suggest, as I believe the shadow Treasurer suggested, that they might well be asking just how this benefit they are paying for is faring. After all, until three years ago we had a AAA credit rating, which has now been downgraded to AA1 and further. That affects the terms on which they can borrow. So the authorities, along with the Commonwealth, are losing ground in the market in terms of the rate at which they can borrow. Of course, they might well ask what benefit they are getting from this levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for that downgrading, which affects the whole borrowing situation, is the misguided overall policy of this Government. That was the point the shadow Treasurer was making. The most telling index of that is the mounting overseas debt, which in gross terms is now approaching $140 billion. That is a vast sum. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9G4">Dr HARRY EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Owe no man anything, my colleague says. We are a long way from that precept. The shadow Treasurer did mention that if one does a simple division of $140 billion by the population of Australia, which is about 16.5 million, it is of the order of $7,500 per head. That is the simplest piece of arithmetic. One does not need to be a wizard to work that out. The incidence is about $7,500 per head; so for a husband and wife and two children it is a total of about $30,000. Directly or indirectly, this country as a whole has to pay the interest on that borrowing, the service on that borrowing. There is no escape from that. It is no good saying, `The Commonwealth is actually paying off debt. It is Bondy or somebody else who has incurred all this debt'. That may be, but directly or indirectly the nation has to foot the bill, as the Reserve Bank of Australia made amply clear in its recent report. All this stuff the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) says about the Commonwealth paying off debt, that it is mainly private debt, is totally irrelevant. The nation as a whole is responsible for servicing that debt. There is only one way in which we can service it, and that is in terms of an excess of earnings overseas over what we pay overseas. Otherwise, where are the funds coming from to pay it? In effect, the nation as a whole has to earn that surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That incidence, directly or indirectly, of roughly $7,500 per head for a family of four is about $30,000. The cost of servicing at 10 to 15 per cent would work out at about $4,500, or about $90 per week. The debt has gone up from $29 billion to $140 billion since the present Government has been in power. Is it any wonder that there is pressure on living standards, when there is a direct or indirect cost there of the order of $90 per week for a family of four? Of course, they do not write the cheques, but in order to make that payment, resources have to be transferred into net exports, into additional export production or additional production for the replacement of imports. Part of the process is that housing has to be cut back in order to transfer ultimately the resources. So the man in the street knows that housing rates at around 17 per cent are wrong. He does not know much about the national debt, but that is an indirect effect of the size of the national debt. Resources have to be transferred out of private consumption. People just cannot have as many VCRs and all the rest of it as they may want, desirable as that is for their quality of life. Resources even have to be transferred from domestic investment. </PARA>
<PARA> In point of fact, the quantum of that transfer amounts to about 4 percentage points of gross domestic product. Just as we have now a deficit in the current balance of payments of the order of 5 per cent, going on to 6 per cent, of gross domestic product, at least 4 percentage points have to be transferred into net exports to cut that back down to what is a historical norm of about 2 percentage points of deficit which can be reasonably serviced, especially to the extent that it is long term capital import. So 4 percentage points have in effect to be transferred. I stress that, from an economic point of view, it is not easy to effect that transfer. It is a lot easier to effect it, though, to the extent that we can more rapidly increase production and productivity in this country. The more rapidly we can increase the total of supply, the easier it is to bend some of it out of housing, some of it out of private consumption, some of it even out of private investment, though we are loath to do that, and a good deal more out of government, and put the extra four points into net exports. </PARA>
<PARA> If we have a good look at the economic history of this country, we are going well to bend resources from these areas into another area such as net export at the rate of about half a percentage point a year. That is why, as I recall the shadow Treasurer stressing, we are not going to solve this debt problem overnight. It is going to be a long haul. It could be all of eight years at that sort of rate I have mentioned. Bending half a percentage point a year to get 4 percentage points, that is eight years. Even the most optimistic scenarios that the Government can come up with would not suggest that we can stabilise this overseas debt-not start to cut it back but stop it going up and imposing a greater and greater burden, directly and indirectly, on the nation-probably before 1994-95. That follows from the analysis I have just given-that if one bends it about half a percentage point a year, if one is lucky, that is about eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty is that the Government does not sufficiently address this problem. Indeed, it tends to act as if it is unimportant. As I have said, the Prime Minister has said that the debt is mainly private and that we do not have to worry. We do have to worry because if we do not begin to generate extra net exports in order to pay for our debt we are in all sorts of potential trouble, particularly if there is any turn down in the world economy. With the most recent monthly balance of payments deficit at $2.6 billion we are in the worst strife ever. That is nearly $100m a day. From this time yesterday to this time tonight, at that rate, we have gone an extra $100m into hock. It is as if money grows on trees. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem has to be addressed directly and explicitly. Proper efforts should be made to convey to the Australian people where the problem lies. We got into a problem in 1986, when the Treasurer (Mr Keating) spoke about a banana republic and we heard the Prime Minister say on air that we had a situation akin to war. That was the very phrase he used in 1986. The same problem confronts us now but it is even worse, compounded, as the debt has risen to $140 billion. We are set to continue on that path. We have the same problems now as we did in 1986 but now the Prime Minister and the Treasurer do not want to say anything about it. They have an election coming up and they hope that, on their present course, they can get to the electors before the whole thing collapses around their ears. I say this particularly in light of the fact that the honourable member for Denison was talking a lot of absolute tripe. </PARA>

I hope that the honourable member for Denison reads their speeches because at the end of the day they both said the same thing-it does not matter how the debt is incurred, someone has to pay for it. That is the problem that we as Australians face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill 1989 and the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill 1989 are being debated cognately. They have had an interesting and long gestation period. The Opposition will support with pleasure both of these Bills. Later in the debate I will point out in some detail why that is so. </PARA>
<PARA> At least in this place concern about the matters covered by these Bills began back in 1982 when the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation investigated the matter of chemicals. It came forward with two reports-one in April 1982 and one that was tabled in December 1982, I think. Recommendations were made-which I would like to refer to in due course-that we ought to be far more concerned about chemicals, particularly hazardous chemicals, and that certain steps ought to be taken at the Commonwealth level. In 1989 we finally see the recommendations made in those two reports adopted, broadly speaking, and included in these two pieces of legislation. But since that time there has been a very deep and growing community concern about broad environmental matters and particularly about chemicals and their disposal, and about waste in general. Part of this broad international and Australian concern is reflected by the fact that this legislation has found its way to this chamber at last. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was passed under the jurisdiction of the United Nations. At least the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill picks up the convention. When we have passed the Bill it will enable Australia to become a signatory to the convention, and I will talk a little more about that later. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a broader point needs to be made first. Waste and chemicals of all kinds have become the focus of increasing public concern and media coverage in recent years. I suppose that most of us would be concerned about the volume of waste produced in our own households. That is something we can identify with quite easily. Who of us does not feel a pang of guilt as we flush chemical solutions down the sink, and who of us is not disturbed by images of waste in our municipal dumps where we are effectively burying real money in the ground in many cases?</PARA>
<PARA> Many of us who have followed the environmental debates and the chemical debates in this country will be appalled at the sight of ships such as the Zenobia, the Khian Sea or the Karin-B roaming the world seeking places to discharge their toxic cargoes. As some articles and comments suggest, we are seeing the development where people are looking to the Third World as a new dumping ground for poisons. Part of the concern that led to the convention earlier this year occurred because of these ships. If one has a look at the more popular press, one can see articles such as the one headed `The global poison trade', which talks about a voyage to nowhere of a ship called the Khian Sea which left Philadelphia on 31 August 1986 and as at November 1988 was still at sea looking for somewhere to discharge its incinerator ash toxic waste cargo. There are deep concerns about where that waste is going and the pressure that is being put on poor Third World countries to be the recipient of those wastes. This issue is not just an Australian issue; it is an international issue. Indeed, it is important to recognise that fact and to recognise the significance of this legislation and what it means. That is why all parties in this Parliament are supporting this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go back to the 1982 report of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. As I said, the first report was brought to this chamber in April 1982. The then Chairman of that Committee was a Liberal Party member, the former member for Petrie, John Hodges, who has now departed from this chamber. Interestingly, if I recall-I was not here at the time-he is a chemist himself. The report made many recommendations. As to the basis of it, I will quote Mr Hodges:</PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Committee is a unanimous one, with members feeling strongly about the inadequacies of the present situation. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the management of hazardous wastes, which falls between the ambits of the States. Clearly, something needed to be done. The report went on to say that there needed to be far more detailed work done on chemical waste storages, transport and disposal. The report detailed interesting international examples, at that time, where waste had caused grievous bodily harm to citizens in different parts of the world, and it quoted some examples in Australia. Since 1982 there have been many other examples. That was the start of the concern about hazardous wastes and their movement. I will come to the second committee report a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> I will talk a little more about the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill. Although it is order of the day No. 6, in my view it is the more important of the two Bills. This legislation proposes a system for the control of the import and export of hazardous wastes by use of a ministerial permit. The objective of the exercise is to ensure that such wastes are disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner. As I said, the Basel Convention of earlier this year basically put that proposal forward and national parliaments of various kinds are being asked to put legislation through to give effect to some control of the transboundary movements of such wastes. The method by which we are doing that is by putting this ministerial permit system into place. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Bill adopts definitions and principles found in the Convention, it should be noted that the Commonwealth clearly possesses the power to regulate this matter through existing constitutional powers over customs, exports and imports. Consequently, adherence to the convention does not, I believe, increase the Commonwealth's power over the States nor make improper use of the external affairs power. The permit scheme provides that all decisions made by the Minister are subject to judicial review, and the scheme will be self-financing as there will be a fee of up to $4,000 prescribed to cover the costs of administering the Act. It should be noted that the scheme excludes control of radioactive wastes as these are not dealt with under the Convention and, in any event, are the subject of other Australian legislation already in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I have talked a little about the background and the concern. As I said, it is broad concern to the international community that the Third World countries are being prevailed upon to take much of this toxic waste, and there are many examples of that concern, one of which I have already quoted. It has already been under scrutiny. Back in 1984 the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) had an agreement under the United Nations environment program which took over its work in 1987, and at the same time steps for a regional control mechanism were being developed within the Association of South East Asian Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this pressure we finally had the United Nations environmental program involved with this Convention. The final session was approved by 105 of the 116 participating countries. The Convention has so far been signed by 34 countries, including Canada, France, the Philippines, the European Economic Community (EEC), Belgium, Italy, Norway and Sweden, and several others are yet to sign. Concern has also been expressed about the need to develop a far stricter code within the EEC and for OECD countries, and a lead has been taken in this area by the British Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr Chris Patten. Indeed, I obtained a statement from the British Secretary of State for the Environment. Mr Patten makes this observation, which, given that this debate has some international significance, I think is worth reading into the record. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> Effective concern for the environment requires deep commitment, cool judgement and the sound application of scientific principles. If we proceed by panic and scaremongering we will only serve to discredit the cause of environmental improvement. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite important because several points need to be underlined. One is the scientific principles that need to be adopted to the environmental debate. As many members would realise, much of our toxic waste is shipped from our shores-that is because we do not have a high-temperature incinerator-to Pontypool in the United Kingdom. There are many issues that we could be involved in here such as applying our own scientific abilities to provide our own country with a high-temperature incinerator. Indeed, this Bill brings forward more quickly the need for Australia to address this issue in a far more positive way. I admit that there are working groups in place, but the need for Australia to be proceeding to deal with toxic waste in a far more effective way is now paramount. Indeed, in May this year when I spoke in the debate in this place about the Sea Installations Bill, we strayed a little from the topic then and we talked about the London Dumping Convention, which is all about the dumping of waste at sea. The Basel Convention does not go that far, but it does make an interesting observation. The front of the Convention instructs the secretariat of that Convention to proceed to review the London Dumping Convention. There perhaps needs to be more attention to that Convention as it relates to the dumping of waste at sea. </PARA>
<PARA> That is particularly important. Some Australians have watched this issue quite closely. Ships have come to Australia, picked up waste, and steamed out, and polychlorinated biphenyls have been incinerated and dissipated into the sea and so on. Dumping at sea is an interim measure. It is not a solution to the problem of toxic waste. The point I am making is that as a world community we cannot continue to allow a continuation of dumping toxic waste at sea. The best method is high-temperature incineration. We in this country ought to be utilising our scientific skills, in conjunction with the British or others, to develop a high-temperature incinerator. This will not only help our environmental needs but will also help many of the smaller countries in our region to deal most environmentally effectively with their wastes. There is a dollar in it, too. If that is not motivation enough, combined with the positive impact it would make on the environment, then I would be very surprised. I urge the Government, as I did in May, to accelerate consideration of how we are going to deal with toxic wastes in this country, because I think we have a very positive role to play. </PARA>
<PARA> I will return to the outline of the proposed scheme. An operator seeking to import or export hazardous waste must get a permit from the Minister, who must be satisfied that the applicant is a fit and proper person to receive a permit-indeed, that clause is subject to an amendment which the Government is proposing, which we agree to-that he has adequate insurance cover and that, further, the waste can be disposed of safely in an environmentally acceptable fashion, and that the receiving country has agreed to accept the waste in question. Decisions on permits will be subject to judicial review, but a permit may be refused if the Minister considers that, having regard to Australia's international obligations, the waste should be dealt with in another way, if it can be disposed of safely within Australia or the grant of a permit is contrary to the public interest. It is a wide discretion, but it is a sensible discretion and it does put in place at least some control on the movement to or from Australia of waste. It allows the Commonwealth to play a role. I might add that this Bill does have the support of all States. It also has the support of the Australian Environment Council and, in that sense, it is a big step forward for Australia and ought to be recognised as such. It should also be recognised that a lot of the hard work and the flag-waving on the need to act on this matter was done through the work of people like John Hodges in 1982. </PARA>

In these days of arm's length statutory authorities, we believe it is important that the Crown is not immune from prosecution and the reach of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move to talk a little about the second Bill. This Bill also picks up some interesting issues raised by the activities of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation in 1982. It is from the second report of that Committee that this Bill flows in part. That report was prepared under the chairmanship of the Hon. M. J. R. MacKellar, the honourable member for Warringah, who knows a lot about chemicals as he is an agricultural scientist of some note, I understand. He has been a member of this place for some years and is a very senior member. Reading the report and his tabling statement, one gets the flavour of the urgency of the issues he was raising. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall point out some of the issues he talked about. He said that occupational health was of particular interest to the Committee at that time because people wanted to make sure that the use of chemicals in the workplace-and there are many chemicals used in the workplace-was done safely. He said there needed to be a national coordination of approaches to chemicals. Indeed, as I recall, that Committee proposed a coordinating council to ensure that the range of information needed in Australia is met, that the cost is effective and that the best use is made of overseas data banks. Not a lot happened in that area, unfortunately, but finally something is happening tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> That Committee talked about the split of responsibility for occupational safety and health between labour and health authorities. The honourable member for Warringah said then that it contributed to the ineffective control of chemical hazards. In a sense, I think that problem still lies because the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill is to be administered by the Department of Industrial Relations and the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Import) Bill is to be administered by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. We still have not really got our coordination together. We have now started to get the principles into legislation and these Bills will pass both chambers, but the coordination in the approach to chemicals is not yet at a stage, certainly at a national level, that it could be. Progress is obviously slow; nevertheless, there is progress. </PARA>
<PARA> The point the honourable member for Warringah made in 1982 ought to be kept in mind by the present Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) and, indeed, the whole Cabinet as they consider the next steps to be taken to ensure that the approach to chemicals and hazardous wastes in this country receives the very best coordination, not just at a Commonwealth bureaucratic level but also between the Commonwealth and the States. As I said when speaking about the previous Bill, the States also support the industrial chemicals Bill, and that is an important step. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the industrial chemicals Bill is to establish a national scheme for notification and assessment of industrial chemicals. It is designed to ensure that there is adequate information on any possible hazards associated with chemicals imported or manufactured in Australia. The Bill will not directly regulate the use of chemicals; that will remain the responsibility of the States and Territories. However, under the scheme established by the Bill, the existing regulatory agencies will be provided with far better information on which to make decisions about regulating chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> If the information base were made more widely available, it would avoid the problem that occurred in Mississippi in 1972 when a waterhole was drilled next to a dump and, unbeknown to anyone, grasshopper killer poison which had been put in the dump many years before leached into the water supply and 20 people died from arsenic poisoning. That is the sort of thing that can happen and is still happening. We saw what happened with chemicals in Bhopal, and there are many other examples. That is the sort of thing these Bills are trying to avoid. If these Bills are about getting better information and making it available, then each and every Australian should be supporting them. </PARA>
<PARA> All new chemicals will be notified to Worksafe Australia, which is to administer the scheme, together with a notification statement of the intended use and properties of the chemicals. The information will be assessed to determine the potential hazard to occupational health and safety, public health and the environment. We are trying to have a legislative scheme which puts out information into the workplace to alert people to the hazards of using particular chemicals. The Bills go so far as to require details about labelling. Labelling of chemicals warrants far more attention than it has received. Any toxic-based chemical should be labelled with instructions as to what should be done if, by accident, in a household or other area there is improper human contact or use. All of us who have young children know the risks that are run. Worksafe will be obliged to prepare and distribute assessments of the chemicals within a specified time frame. Such assessment would normally include recommendations for the safe use of the chemical. There is also provision for the selective assessment of existing chemicals where there are particular concerns about possible hazards. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of issues that should be addressed. The chemical industry supports both pieces of legislation, but it must be understood that the chemical industry is already subject to a vast array of regulations governing aspects such as storage and transportation. It is important that any new legislation is not just legislation for its own sake. It needs to fit into a proper mosaic of regulatory control. This Bill was forwarded to the Business Regulation Review Unit, which supported the introduction of a national notification and assessment scheme. It believes such a scheme would lead to higher levels of public safety and lower costs in the manufacture and use of chemicals. We would all welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Regulation Review Unit proposed some modification to the scheme contained in the Bill. I do not know whether the Minister will have the opportunity to sum up, but he might like to comment on this point. The unit argued that all new chemicals should be automatically approved where they are already included in recognised inventories of major Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. It was argued that this would avoid duplicating work done overseas, reduce costs and release resources to develop information on chemicals that are already in use and are of concern. The counter argument is that the Bill already provides for the use of overseas assessments. Under the provisions of the Bill, where a new chemical has been notified and assessed under a recognised equivalent scheme of another country, that notification and assessment will suffice provided the assessment is accessible and relevant to the proposed use and exposure profile of the chemical in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty in automatically approving chemicals on overseas inventories is that simply being on the inventory of an OECD country does not mean that a chemical has been assessed for potential health or environmental hazards. Automatic entry for chemicals listed overseas without any assessment would perpetuate the current situation where chemicals can come on to the Australian market without any information as to health or environmental hazards and appropriate safety recommendations. That issue needs to be cleared up. I do not think any of us would want chemicals that may have been accepted in other jurisdictions coming on to our market without undergoing some scrutiny as to their environmental impact, given that they may be used in a completely different environment from that in which they have normally been used. That point needs to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Australian chemical industry has endorsed and welcomed the Bill as being consistent with the industry's policy of placing a priority on health, safety and environment issues. The Australian Chemical Industry Council is very concerned that failure to establish a national notification and assessment scheme would lead to the establishment of separate schemes in the States. According to a representative of the Council, this would be a disastrous outcome and would greatly increase the cost burden on the industry as well as leading to longer delays before new chemicals are brought on to the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that the Council was closely involved in the preparation of the scheme and considers that the final version of the Bill will meet all the significant concerns of the industry. The Confederation of Australian Industry has also been closely consulted in the preparation of the scheme and supports the Bill. As was so ably pointed out in 1982 by the honourable member for Warringah, who chaired the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, we need to concentrate far more on making available to the workplace information on the dangers inherent in dealing with many of the toxic chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the two Bills, as would all thinking members of the chamber. The Government proposes some minor amendments and I am proposing an amendment. I hope they will proceed. I again make the broad point that the issue is of international concern. The Bills have taken a long time to come to this place. No-one ascribes blame for that, and it is good that they are here. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to one other point that I believe is important-the future and the opportunities that Australia might have in dealing with waste. We need to concentrate on recycling where we can. Not all waste can be recycled, but much of it can be. There are great opportunities for Australia to be involved in the waste recycling business and the waste disposal business. As the Secretary of State for the Environment in the United Kingdom pointed out, a lot of that business will rely on our scientific abilities and the proper utilisation of those abilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay credit to some of those in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) who are involved in many different areas in waste disposal. In the manufacturing technology area of CSIRO they are developing an electric arc technology for hazardous waste disposal and an image analysis and waste reduction in a cutting operation. In biotechnology they are involved in research into the disposal of high strength organic wastes by biodegradation and genetic engineering of new microbial strains. In the coal technology area they are doing research into the upgrading of waste materials from coal processing, combustion and so on. In the mineral products area, they are researching high temperature processing. In environmental mechanics they are producing design rules for the construction of repositories to ensure long-term safe containment of wastes. In chemicals and polymers they are involved in water and water waste treatment, including magnetic ion exchange for heavy metal recovery from sludges and liquid effluence. </PARA>
<PARA> In the wool industry, an industry which is vital to Australia, especially when we consider the need to develop our external earnings from trade, new work is being done in wool scouring and wool grease treatment. We have been a world leader in the wool scouring industry, and new environmental methods may well mean an enhancement of that industry because the industry would add tremendous value to our primary wool product. There are many examples of our scientists already involved in the waste and recycling industry. I offer the encouragement of the Opposition to those involved to press on. They enjoy the support of the Australian community. These issues are now receiving far more community attention than they have done in the past. That is good, but we need to pursue the opportunities that are there, not only for our sake but also for the sake of our region and for the better environmental protection of the broader world community. I welcome the Bills and have pleasure in endorsing them and offering the Opposition's support for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in supporting the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill 1989 and the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Export and Imports) Bill 1989, the provisions of which are long overdue. As usual, I found myself in agreement with a lot of what the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), who preceded me in this debate, had to say. Perhaps there was only one difference of opinion I had with him. Whilst I do not want to denigrate the work of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), who was Chairman of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation when the final report was produced, I point out that he did not have a very big part to play in the total work of the Committee. The person who had a big part to play throughout the work of the Committee was the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), who is now the Minister for Social Security. A lot of the work that was done through both reports of that Committee was due to the very hard work put in by the honourable member for Batman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In brief, the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill establishes an inventory and assessment system for some industrial chemicals. The hazardous waste Bill establishes a permit system for the export and import of hazardous waste. Both Bills cover penalties for the unauthorised import or export of certain chemicals and waste. It is very interesting that the honourable member for Bass referred to the fact that our toxic wastes are exported to Pontypool in Wales in the United Kingdom. We are very fortunate tonight to have in the gallery Mr Paul Murphy, who is the member of parliament for Torfaen, which is the area which covers Pontypool. I am sure the honourable member for Bass was not aware that Mr Murphy was in the gallery. He would have been very interested in the comments the honourable member had to make and in the passage of these Bills through the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has waxed on in even greater strength since I have been Chairman. The inquiry into the management of chemicals hazardous to health and the environment was most extensive, involving some 2 1/2 years of public hearings and inspections all over Australia. At the public hearings evidence was taken from 170 witnesses and the Committee received 169 submissions involving 3,761 pages of evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 29 April 1982 the Committee tabled its first report on the storage, transport and disposal of hazardous chemical wastes. In its second report, tabled in December 1982, it covered all the other aspects of the nature of hazardous chemicals and the damage they can cause if not managed and regulated properly. I take this opportunity to commend the Committee on its reports and to note that the Committee has comprised present Ministers, ex-Ministers and an ex-Speaker of the House-a distinguished Committee indeed. There was a long delay. Some five years afterwards, in 1987, the reports were tabled. A joint task force was set up by the Commonwealth Government, and the New South Wales and Victoria State governments presented a preliminary report in July 1988. The report recommended comprehensive regulatory and management arrangements for hazardous and intractable wastes. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Bill provides a regulatory structure while at the same time giving Australia the opportunity to ratify the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. The Convention was approved by 116 countries giving their assent on 27 March 1989. The approving of both Bills by the Australian Parliament enables Australia to honour the provisions of the Basel Convention, which prohibits the export of hazardous wastes from the shores of convention countries to those countries which have not consented to the import. It requires countries treating and disposing of wastes to do so in an environmentally sound manner. </PARA>
<PARA> Inevitably, because of State and Territory constitutional responsibilities, it will be necessary for the present legislation to be complemented by State and Territory waste management legislation. I will define what is meant by hazardous chemicals. I can do no better than quote from the second report of the Committee on Environment and Conservation. It is important to give the full text of what the report has to say about the nature of hazards:</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Chemicals can be hazardous to man and the environment through their toxicity, through being bioaccumulative, persistent, carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, corrosive, radioactive, explosive, flammable or strongly reactive. Chemicals may create a hazard during part or all of their `life cycle' which includes their development, manufacture, handling, transport, storage, use and disposal. In fire and other emergency situations, chemicals may become more hazardous than they are normally . . . While many chemicals in commercial use have little or no adverse potential effects on man or the environment, others pose quite serious environmental and health hazards. These hazards are not always immediately obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Some substances, such as lead and mercury, accumulate in the body over time, consequently increasing their toxic effects. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to detail many examples of damage from hazardous chemicals involving severe ill health and often death for many human beings. Sometimes the incidents happen quite irresponsibly when the manufacturers of the hazardous chemicals attempt to dispose of them illegally. Often, however, they occur through sheer ignorance of the dangers of the chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> When I first became the Labor candidate for the seat of La Trobe in 1979, just prior to my election, a future constituent sought my help about the legal use of hazardous chemicals. The constituent owned a nursery, which was situated next to a disused quarry. The local fire brigade habitually used the quarry for fire preventive practice, using discarded materials from a paint factory to ignite large tree stumps. The resultant fires not only produced huge clouds of black, acrid smoke but also produced chemical runoffs which percolated through to a stream running through the nursery and very close to the local primary school. Fortunately, I was able to ensure that the practice was discontinued before any serious damage occurred. That is possibly the reason why I am now the member for La Trobe. This is an example of how the ignorance of the local fire brigade was traded upon by the paint manufacturers, who had found a cheap way of disposing of waste products from the factory. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the incidents described in the report are far more serious. One case from Michigan in the United States of America was particularly serious. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . in 1973 polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), used as a flame retardant, were inadvertently mixed with animal feed. Despite many thousand farm animals being destroyed, human food was contaminated with this persistent chemical. Ninety-seven per cent of the State's population still have PBB in their bodies. While some symptoms of poisoning occurred fairly quickly other long-term hazards such as cancer and nervous system disorders may take decades to become apparent. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of problem that these toxic chemicals produce. There have been similar serious cases in Australia, including in my State of Victoria. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) will not have time to speak tonight. When he does speak, when the Parliament resumes in two weeks time, he will detail some of the more serious occurrences quite close to, and possibly in, his own electorate of Dunkley. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) pointed out in his introductory speech, the Federal Government is considering the possibility of establishing a high temperature incinerator. This was mentioned by the honourable member for Bass. The Victorian and New South Wales State governments are also involved in the proposal, which could be sited in New South Wales and operated by a New South Wales Government agency. The construction of a national high temperature incinerator was proposed by the 1987-88 joint task force on intractable waste. Whilst I do not need to be persuaded of the need for such an incinerator, I do have some concerns. There is the danger that the establishment of the incinerator will encourage industry to continue with the same practices which produced the highly toxic waste in the first place with no incentive to minimise the waste. The cost of using a high temperature incinerator must be sufficiently high to act as an incentive for industry to engage in research into recycling intractable industrial wastes-I know that the honourable member supports me in this view-for example, changing manufacturing processes which will minimise the production of intractable wastes and identify substitute products, which can be manufactured without the production of hazardous wastes. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to quote from a discussion paper on policy priorities for the environment produced in my office by Ms Karen Large, my electoral research officer, in which she suggests the policies which should be given priority in the prevention or minimisation of hazardous and intractable wastes. Firstly, she advises;</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The establishment and implementation of national standards for the regulation of the generation, transportation, recycling and disposal of hazardous waste. </PARA>
<PARA>To some extent these Bills cover those matters. Secondly, she advises:</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The development of these national standards to include the establishment of detailed consultative arrangements involving industry, unions, environmental and other community groups. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not see that in these two Bills. Thirdly:</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) National standards should emphasise the following hierarchy of waste management processes: prevention, minimisation, recycling, treatment (physical, chemical, biological and incineration) and landfill as proposed by the Joint Taskforce. </PARA>
<PARA>Fourthly:</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Amendment of the AEC's National Guidelines for the Management of Hazardous Wastes to reflect this hierarchy of management. </PARA>
<PARA>Fifthly:</PARA>
<PARA> (v) The establishment of effective targets for the implementation of waste minimisation targets including financial incentives, subsidies, grants etc for research and schemes which promote waste prevention and reduction. </PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing like that in these two Bills. Sixthly:</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) Financial support for the development of processes which have a potential application to specific problems in hazardous waste management, such as on-site and on-line destruction of intractable waste and the in situ decontamination of soils (eg chemical or biological methods). </PARA>
<PARA>Seventhly:</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) Extensive public consultation prior to the siting of any high temperature incinerators. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that is going on in New South Wales. I expect that it is going on. Eighthly:</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) High temperature incinerators to be under Federal Government control. </PARA>
<PARA>The trouble is that the Government is not allowing this to happen; it will be under the control of the New South Wales Government. Ninthly:</PARA>
<PARA> (ix) The operation of a high temperature incinerator to include monitoring of pollution risks from airborne particles and waste sludge. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I expect that the New South Wales Government is doing that. Tenthly:</PARA>
<PARA> (x) The use of high temperature incinerators to be conditional on industry supplying plans for waste prevention and minimisation. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally:</PARA>
<PARA> (xi) A national strategy to identify contaminated sites and clean them up. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government should definitely become involved in that area. I thoroughly support those policies and I hope that the Federal Government can give urgent consideration to their implementation. It is particularly important that we draw to the attention of small nations, such as many of our Pacific neighbours, the need for overseas based manufacturing companies to adopt the preventative procedures I have outlined to avoid the import of hazardous and intractable wastes into Australia for the purposes of high temperature incineration, as mentioned by the Minister in his second reading speech. I am quite sure that the honourable member for Torfaen in Wales would agree. It is his electorate that has to suffer the import of these intractable wastes for high temperature incineration, to which his constituents are opposed. I can understand why they are opposed. </PARA>
<PARA> In reading through the hazardous chemicals reports of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation it is very clear that much remains to be done despite the present legislation in relation to the management of chemicals which are potentially hazardous to health and the environment. As I mentioned earlier in my speech, a number of serious incidents in relation to the dumping of hazardous waste have occurred in Australia. The Committee referred to the problem in its first report as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> In its evidence and during inspections the Committee was often told that the future use of individual waste disposal sites, while not decided on, would probably be for playing fields or recreation areas. This seems a common practice for closed municipal waste sites after a settlement period and it is said to be quite safe. The Committee is concerned about the safety of closed hazardous waste landfill sites being used for such purposes. Evidence was given that playing fields often become inundated through irrigation and/or rainfall, and some upward movement of leachate could be expected. In addition care would be required in digging trenches for facilities and other earthworks associated with playing fields. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It would appear little is being done to locate old dump sites. One reason might be the likely cost to governments in cleaning up these old sites. Regulatory authorities seem to prefer to wait for adverse effects to become obvious rather than locate old sites, assess their hazard and, where necessary, recover or contain wastes before their effects are widespread. </PARA>
<PARA>In this Parliament we all know that there have been many such cases since the Committee produced its report. Whilst it is true that the legislation must be implemented by State and Territory governments to ensure that standards are adopted for the safety of hazardous waste disposal sites after closure, I am concerned that the Federal Government does not appear to be taking a lead in these matters, particularly in the identification of sites of past hazardous waste disposal. The Standing Committee made several recommendations on the problems of past hazardous waste disposal sites which the Federal Government does not appear to have taken up. I would be interested in the comments of the Minister on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Standing Committee also dealt with the responsibilities of the Federal Government in relation to hazardous chemicals management. This is one of the areas where we get into the problem that we always have in Australia about Federal constitutional rights and State constitutional rights. The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the Commonwealth powers discussed above there remain several important constitutional responsibilities. One of the biggest single problems in hazardous chemicals management is the fragmentation of legislative, administrative, research and assessment efforts around Australia. Evidence before the Inquiry shows beyond any doubt that effective assessment and control machinery requires a well coordinated national approach with considerable reliance on effective machinery in other countries and at the international level. </PARA>
<PARA>These Bills identify that problem, and are overcoming it, which was set out in the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes the Implied Power to be an important one in connection with the problems raised by the present Inquiry. With this power must go an equivalent responsibility on the part of the Government which exercises it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee went on to make a recommendation which I think is important to relate to this Parliament. The Committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA>If State Governments fail to introduce effective and comprehensive legislation and administrative machinery for the regulation of chemical hazards by 1985, the Commonwealth legislate to control these hazards to the fullest extent of its power. </PARA>
<PARA>When we come to an important matter like this-a very serious matter-I think it is about time that the Commonwealth Government should be prepared to override the States in these constitutional responsibilities. Constitutional lawyers have made it quite clear that we have this power. I believe that the matter is so serious that we should exercise this power in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that the clock has gone well on and that I have only a few minutes in which to speak on the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill and the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill, there being a two-week break before I have the opportunity to finish my speech. In this House we are mostly familiar with a very common definition of Parliament; that is, it is a place where someone gets up to speak; says nothing; nobody listens; and then everybody disagrees. Tonight, with regard to these two Bills, we have heard the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton), who is also the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. Both speakers have had quite a bit to say that has been very relevant and very important. Everybody has listened and there has not been any disagreement. It is very pleasurable to get up-even though I have only a few minutes left-to speak on these two Bills which should be of interest to all of us who are concerned about developing legislation which meets the practical challenges of regulatory protection of the environment. That is something which is very much to the fore in the thinking of everybody today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first Bill establishes a national scheme for the notification and assessment of industrial chemicals. That Bill is designed to ensure adequate information on and regulation of any possible hazards associated with chemicals imported or manufactured in Australia. It is, quite simply, a response to inadequacies in the information and regulatory systems covering industrial chemicals in Australia. The second Bill proposes a system for the control of the import and export of hazardous waste by the use of ministerial permits. Its objective is to ensure that such wastes are disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner not only here in Australia but also overseas. It is the legislative embodiment of the domestic and international obligations to protect other humans and the environment from the dangers posed by hazardous industrial wastes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) and previous speakers have detailed the provisions of these two Bills. I do not want to waste time going over those details again. Instead, I want to make some general comments about the background and context of the two Bills. I want first to note the tardiness which still appears to have characterised the bureaucracy and the Executive in bringing this legislation before the Parliament. As two of my colleagues, the honourable member for La Trobe and the honourable member for Bass, have noted tonight, all the matters dealt with in these Bills were first raised in two reports by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation nearly seven years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> When one re-reads the two reports of the inquiry into hazardous chemicals one discovers a comprehensive analysis of the problem along with specific workable and urgent-seven years ago-recommendations on the three main areas covered by these two Bills. Those three areas are, firstly, the need for data bases, licences, monitoring, regulatory coverage and sanctions in the areas of chemical usage and waste disposals in Australia. This was an urgent recommendation made seven years ago. The second area was the need to clarify the Commonwealth's role and powers in this area and to structure coordination and cooperation with the States. This was pointed out very clearly by the honourable member for La Trobe. The third area is the need for international machinery to require international movement and disposal of wastes. </PARA>
<PARA> Two days ago in this place I raised the matter of the Executive's tendency to ignore the committee system in policy making, especially in regard to reports on environmental matters. Seven years ago the Executive was alerted to the policy and legislative responses needed to deal with the dangerous and immoral inadequacies of our regulatory framework in the areas of hazardous chemicals and wastes. If the Government and the bureaucracy had more respect for the committee system, the important work of the Environment Committee on hazardous chemicals and wastes-most of which has been incorporated in these Bills in any event-could have been benefiting this community and the global community for the past six years. I refer to these Bills and the reports of the Environment Committee in 1982 as a clear example of the important role of the parliamentary committee system and as a clear example of the way the Executive continues to ignore that system to the detriment of good government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today in the grievance debate I was questioning the desirability of the Government's moral and financial support for the communist-backed terrorist organisation, the South West Africa Peoples Organisation (SWAPO). That debate was cut short due to other matters being debated, so I take this opportunity to conclude my remarks on the subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My main concern lies with stories of SWAPO's brutal and dreadful atrocities now filtering through from returning refugees. Despite the ridiculous stance of the United Nations that SWAPO is `in the sole authentic representative of the Namibian people', it appears that that is far from the case. Even John Carlin, an anti-South African, has written in the Sydney Morning Herald of 19 September an article entitled `The liberators with blood on their hands'. That article states:</PARA>
<PARA>For many years, there has been a sort of international conspiracy to project SWAPO, the most pampered `freedom fighters' the world has seen, as the incarnation of all that is fine and noble and heroic. </PARA>
<PARA> They were fighting South Africa. They were black. They were the underdogs. They were sacrosanct. There was no need to examine the detail: the fact that they were a far-from-democratic organisation run along Stalinist lines of command; that on the battlefield they were ineffectual; that they milked huge amounts of money from international organisations, much of which they have been unable to account for. </PARA>
<PARA> Worst of all, no-one noticed, or chose to notice, the atrocities they were committing against their own followers. </PARA>
<PARA>John Carlin writes of beatings, torture and atrocities that many people he interviewed suffered at the hands of SWAPO. He says that prisoners were:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . dropped into hot, dank, stinking mud pits seven metres deep and incarcerated there for years. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>In the case of one 24-year-old woman I spoke to, Elizabeth Simasiku, it was eight years. Typically, a mud hole with the dimension of, say, a squash court would hold 40 people. </PARA>
<PARA> A trap door at ground level would be opened only to allow prisoners out to do forced labour, or twice a day, to relieve themselves. Food was scarce and vitamin-deficient, provoking all manner of illnesses, sometimes ending in death. </PARA>
<PARA>Another woman said that she would not confess to trumped-up charges for offences that she had not committed. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> They tied me naked to the back of a car and dragged me four times across a river. </PARA>
<PARA>John Carlin writes also of strong racist elements in the SWAPO leadership. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . what drove the SWAPO leadership to such madness? There is a clear pattern in the selection of the so-called `agents': they did not belong to the Kwanyama tribe, to which virtually the entire SWAPO military high command belongs and, in almost all cases, they were unusually well-educated. Thus there was a Pol Pot-like strand of anti-intellectualism, compounded by a consistent fear that these brighter SWAPO cadres would wrest power away from the ruling clique. </PARA>
<PARA>Elizabeth Endycott writes in the Spectator of 16 September of similar experiences. She says:</PARA>
<PARA> The holes, where so many dissidents were held, are room-sized pits, often dug by the prisoners themselves, covered with corrugated iron and scrub so that they cannot easily be seen, even from quite a short distance. Swapo never permitted the Red Cross to inspect their refugee camps. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The pits held as many as 36 people dressed only in singlet and underpants, which were never washed or changed. Tins were provided for lavatories and every morning prisoners had to climb a vertical ladder to empty them; otherwise they never saw the light. They were allowed to wash face and hands perhaps once in three months. Water was the only drink, and food consisted of rice or `mealies', cooked without sugar or salt and served in a communal bowl. Beatings were frequent, especially when the guards were drunk; many prisoners went mad, were taken away and never seen again. Deaths from TB, beri-beri and other diseases related to malnutrition were frequent. Medical care was non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Women and girls were frequently taken out and raped; children were born in the pits . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, I believe that this Government and the United Nations should open their eyes, take heed of these reports, stop their biased charade of placing SWAPO beyond criticism and cease their unwavering support for this corrupt and uncaring organisation. We should call for the release of all remaining prisoners. We should also cease pouring taxpayers' money down this communist sinkhole, such as the $1.8m that the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau recently sent it. Our time, money and energies would be much better directed towards working for free and fair elections in Namibia and a smooth and successful transition to independence in that country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 May 1989 I said in this House:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some time ago at Hastings in the Flinders electorate, the BP refinery was pulled down. A huge amount of toxic waste was pulled out from that refinery and put into drums which were supposed to be taken to the dump at Tullamarine.</PARA>
<PARA>That information was given to the local press and quite a story was published on 13 June 1989. An article on the front page of today's Mornington Leader, which is headed `Poison waste denial', states:</PARA>
<PARA> Claims in June by Dunkley MHR Mr Bob Chynoweth that toxic waste had been buried in Hastings were refuted last week by the MLA for Mornington, Mr Robin Cooper. </PARA>
<PARA>The article then states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Cooper has described Mr Chynoweth's claim as a `cynical beat-up about toxic waste dumping in Hastings'. </PARA>
<PARA>If my claims are a cynical beat-up, I would like tonight to describe exactly where that waste is buried. On 16 June I received a letter which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Chynoweth,</PARA>
<PARA>I have enclosed a map relating to my phone call to you on 14.6.89 concerning the toxic waste. There are three different sites in the same paddock. The squashed-up 44s are still there and the overturned soil is obvious and can be seen from the road when looking up the driveway. </PARA>
<PARA>I have a map of the actual site. The site-it has been described to me by another source, so I believe it to be correct-is in Graydons Road, Hastings, about 500 metres from the corner of Boes Road. There is a depot, a paddock, a small cottage, a dam, a row of pine trees and a driveway leading up to the dump site. There are three dump sites there and another dump site is believed to be in an orchard which is further away. This is about 500 metres from the corner of Boes Road heading towards Hastings. </PARA>
<PARA> From what I have been told from different sources, this land was sold recently, just before my speech was reported in the papers. It was bought back again by a certain person, at an extra cost of course; but that toxic waste is still there. It is believed that there are about 1,000 drums of waste from the British Petroleum Co. of Australia Ltd refinery. Some of it is believed to be bituminous waste and the other is believed to be lead concentrate. These substances, which are quite deadly and poisonous, are believed to be buried at this site. There have been rumours throughout Hastings for many years now in relation to this matter. Now that I have given its location, I believe that it is about time the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) in Victoria had a look at it. Recently there was a huge scare in Victoria as lead poisoning was found in Ardeer. The land which had been the site of a battery factory had been built on. Many people had to shift out of their houses as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this problem in Hastings has gone on for many years. It is time it was brought to the surface. If there is waste there, the EPA should have a look at it. I was told that, some time ago, there was an attempt to remove the drums. However, when some of the drums were dug up they actually split open. Pine trees were pushed over the top of the area and set fire to in an attempt to disguise the product that was spilt onto the ground. If there are 1,200 44-gallon drums there, that would represent a lot of waste. It is something that should be investigated very quickly and the land should be cleared. This matter should not be forgotten so that in future, whenever that area is built on or someone has a farm there, the people who live there should not be exposed to this sort of problem. Too much of this is going on all over the countryside. Many people and organisations are burying waste willy-nilly all over the place. It is about time that some severe action was taken against them and they were made to clean up the mess that they have created. If there is nothing there, I have made a mistake. However, I feel certain from the information that has been given to me that these drums are buried in and around this property and they should be cleaned up immediately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In November 1988 a woman in my electorate approached me in relation to the Child Support Agency. Her husband, from whom she was separated, had not been keeping up child support payments. The agency told her that they had to wait until her husband had reneged on two payments before they could issue a summons and then they would have to wait 28 days before the mother would receive anything. The Department of Social Security said they would see whether the former husband was employed. If he was, the agency would have the money deducted without summonsing him. It said the Department had a few teething problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On Thursday, 2 March, my office rang the agency. The girl spoken to in the Department in November was unavailable. They said they would check the case and ring back. On 7 March my office staff rang again as the agency had not phoned back. She was told legal action in the courts had been started. On 8 March the agency phoned and said it had issued a summons on 20 December but it had yet to be served. It said it appeared the husband was on sickness benefit and, if so, the wife would have to take him to court for a variation to the order. They would await the outcome of the summons before they advised further. On advising the mother, my office was told that the father was always on sickness benefit. When money was granted to her by the Child Support Agency he was on sickness benefit, but before the agency came into being she used to summons him to court every month and get the money quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> On 3 April 1989 we then rang the agency again and were told that it would check on the Department that had served the summons to see what was happening. My office told the agency that the wife had not received any payments since September 1988. The support agency said it would ring back. We then phoned the Department of Social Security for help because the mother had been without the payments for many months. It said it was making inquiries to the agency on several people's behalf, but getting nowhere. </PARA>
<PARA> On 5 April 1989 we received a call from the Child Support Agency. It informed us that it had contacted the father who said he had not received any letters from the support agency and because his letters had been addressed to a post office box number the courts would not proceed with a summons. The agency said it would reissue the letter to his home address but the father was going to take them to his solicitor for a variation because he was on sickness benefits. There was nothing the agency could do until the father went to court for a variation. In the meantime, the Department of Social Security informed my office that the mother was getting the full supporting benefit pension and was entitled to nothing else from them. </PARA>
<PARA> On 19 April we rang the outreach officer, who said he would investigate the case. On 26 May the Adelaide office rang and said it had arranged for the Sydney office to telephone us as a result of the outreach officer contacting them. On 2 June the Sydney director telephoned my office to tell me that it takes 28 days after catching up with a husband to serve a summons and that 30 per cent of cases were very difficult. Much of the difficulty is with Australia Post. The agency had to check that the post office box was the father's box and then get his address from Australia Post. This proved difficult until Australia Post was read the Child Support Act. There were also difficulties with the Privacy Act. He also said that because the mother was on social security benefits, she could not withdraw from the Child Support Agency. They realised how anxious the mother was but she was one of the 30 per cent who were difficult and costly to the agency. He informed my office that if the father did not pay up at the end of the summons and court action, the bailiff had the right to seize his property, including car, et cetera, and sell it to raise money. </PARA>
<PARA> On 10 July 1989 the agency telephoned and told my office that because of privacy provisions there was little it could disclose to us. It had started legal action. Whether the sheriff had served the action it did not know. It said it would be a long process but it would make every effort to recover moneys when his maintenance payment was registered with them. Because he was on sickness benefit the money could not be taken from his pay. It would have to seize some of his possessions which are not a necessity and then auction them to recover the money. That did not mean that the mother would receive all of the money owing. It was doing everything to recover the money but all cases were treated the same. Because of the Privacy Act there was little it could say. This could take months and the mother would have to be patient. </PARA>
<PARA> The mother was informed she could contact the Department of Social Security to see whether there were any payments coming for the future pay days, or could ring the Child Support Agency on the toll free number to inquire as to how her case was progressing. She would not be told much because of the Privacy Act. The mother was told, `Don't expect anything to happen in a short time'. On 10 September the mother phoned the toll free number. The agency told her that nothing, more or less, had been done and that she should go back to her Federal member as it was on the record that he had been inquiring. This has taken a year. </PARA>
<PARA> This case has cost my office, the Child Support Agency and the Department of Social Security countless dollars in lost time and effort, not to mention the frustration to my staff, and after one year the mother concerned and her child are no better off. I would be interested to know what other members are experiencing in relation to the operation of the Child Support Agency. If it is the same as my experience the whole child support legislation should be looked at to see whether it can be made to work. If it cannot it should be scrapped and let us start again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 4 and 5 September the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) rose in this House and posed a series of questions based on a transcript he acquired from Mrs Halfpenny in relation to her former husband, Mr John Halfpenny. The allegations contained in the questions posed by the honourable member were very serious. In answering those questions the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made a very valid point in saying that all Australians should be given the right to be considered innocent of any charge, that they have to be proven guilty of those charges, and that all honourable members should bear that in mind before making allegations. I imagine that the Prime Minister was being a little hopeful in suggesting that allegations of these sorts should not be canvassed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Later on that night of 5 September the honourable member for Parkes, during the adjournment debate, read into the Hansard  a series of allegations which he claimed were made by Mrs Halfpenny in relation to her statement to the National Crime Authority. One of those allegations concerned a Mr Eddie Kornhauser, a resident of the Queensland Gold Coast. I will read from the Hansard what the honourable member said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . she lists a remarkable series of events and pay offs given for reasons that we can only guess at. For example, in the 1970s she and her husband John lived for a period in Eddie Kornhauser's apartment in Spring Street, Melbourne, which she refers to as `an expensive apartment, taking up one whole floor'. </PARA>
<PARA>The clear allegation implicit in that statement is that Mr Kornhauser is in some way involved in improper, if not illegal, activities involving a pay-off concerning Mr Halfpenny. In response to that allegation raised in the House by the honourable member for Parkes, Mr Kornhauser's solicitors, Lyons of Brisbane, wrote to Mr Cobb pointing out that the statement had been made and also categorically stating that there was no truth whatsoever in that statement. I quote briefly from the letter from Mr Kornhauser's solicitor:</PARA>
<PARA> The statement which you attribute to Mrs. Halfpenny is not only completely false but demonstrably so. It is a matter of absolute fact that our client has never owned nor paid for an apartment in Melbourne. He has never provided Mr or Mrs Halfpenny with free accommodation and he certainly never `paid off' Mr Halfpenny. </PARA>
<PARA> With the greatest of respect, we would have thought that you would have accorded our client the courtesy of checking the basis of the allegations made by Mrs Halfpenny prior to making the statement referred to above in Parliament. The making of the statement and the clear imputation which arises therefrom that our client `paid off' Mr Halfpenny has occasioned serious and irreparable harm to our client. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, we urge you to take the first available opportunity to inform Parliament of the true position as regards our client, that is, that he has never owned nor paid for an apartment in Spring Street, Melbourne or anywhere else in Melbourne, that he has never provided free accommodation to Mr or Mrs Halfpenny and that he never `paid off' Mr Halfpenny. </PARA>
<PARA>It was made perfectly clear to the honourable member that there was no substance at all in that allegation. In response to that letter, the honourable member wrote to the solicitors saying that he noted the objection taken by Mr Kornhauser and had no reason to doubt his claim. He had no doubt that what Mr Kornhauser says will be easily established through such mechanisms as the Australian Federal Police conducting land title searches, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kornhauser then raised this matter with his local Federal member, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr White), who apparently also raised it with the honourable member for Parkes. An undertaking was given that the honourable member for Parkes would come into the House and make it quite clear that the allegations were not true and that Mr Kornhauser denied them. The honourable member has had that opportunity today. He has spoken in the grievance debate. He has also spoken earlier tonight on the adjournment. He has made no attempt to set the record straight. It is all very well in the cut and thrust to make allegations, but surely it is only decent, when those allegations are explicitly denied and said to be demonstrably false, that the honourable member should have the decency to come into this House and set the record straight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard in the Parliament tonight a debate about the environment and concerns about hazardous chemicals and so on. I would like to spend a few moments addressing the so-called great environmental statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) only a month or so ago. It is very interesting to have a look at that statement and go through the fine print of what was said with regard to planting trees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Everybody in this House would realise that in Australia there is a great need to have a lot more trees planted and that that would benefit this country in all sorts of ways. The statement was held up as a great and marvellous statement, and the goal was set for one billion trees to be planted in this country over a period of time. But when one has a look at the details of what was said, it is a complete con trick by the Government to say that this goal is a real goal. In reality, when one goes through the statement what one finds is that more than half, or 600 million of the one billion trees, are actually going to be natural seeding. The Government has made up an estimate and really tried to con the Australian public into believing that it is genuinely going to do something about the environment by planting trees, no doubt to help the greenhouse effect and to make a more beautiful environment for families to move around in. It is a great tragedy for a government and a Prime Minister, particularly at this stage of the environmental debate in Australia, to let Australians believe that it is going to do something about the environment when, in reality, it is going to do very little in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only are 600 million of these one billion trees going to be natural seeding, but 150 million are already being planted by the forestry departments in Australia at the moment. If this project had never been brought forward to the Australian people, there would have been 150 million trees planted by the various State governments. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be aware, being a member from Western Australia, at the State election it was said that 100 million trees were going to be planted by the Western Australian Government. So the one billion also includes the 150 million that the forestry departments were going to plant and the 100 million that the Western Australian Government already had in the pipeline. So it leaves us with a planting of 150 million trees. </PARA>
<PARA> So the real goal of one billion trees, that was given to us by the Prime Minister in effect may be even less. When one reads the statement one finds that the one billion trees was only a target anyway. It is a great tragedy that we are having the wool pulled over our eyes as a nation by the Government's statement that it is doing something in this area. In reality, there is very little substance in that part of the Government's statement. When there has been such a high profile debate on the environment and the need for more trees to be planted on our continent, it is a disgrace for the Government to mislead the country in such a way. It does not ring true at all, but it is typical of this Government that there is a lot of rhetoric and very little action. It gives the impression that we are going to green Australia over the next 10 years or so, but in reality very little is being done by the Government in regard to the environment. It is an absolute tragedy. It is a time to act in Australia, but this Government is not doing it genuinely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended to join in this debate this evening, but I was prompted to do so after listening to the comments by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). I did not hear his remarks in the grievance debate earlier today, but I did hear his comments this evening. I do not know why the honourable member for Parkes is such an apologist for the South African regime, or for whatever the South African right wing puts out. It seems that the honourable member accepts what is said at face value and without question and then comes into this House and repeats it. I am very surprised at this because I have a certain amount of respect for the honourable member for Parkes. In his own way, he is quite an intelligent member of this chamber. If he is so intelligent, I do not know why he always accepts what others say and then comes in and repeats it in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He was very critical of the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO). Whether he likes it or not, SWAPO is recognised by most world authorities as the legitimate representative of the people of Namibia. He has a tendency to make claims such as the ones he made this evening. He listed a number of brutalities and so forth which he claimed SWAPO was responsible for. He comes in here and makes these claims without documentation or he quotes some obscure newspaper article or journalist as his reference. That is simply not good enough. If he is going to make these claims, why does he not take as documented evidence one of the recognised world authorities such as the United Nations (UN), the Red Cross or some of the international human rights organisations instead of one journalist writing in some obscure publication. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is not uncritical of everything that happens in southern Africa. The Government has criticised and commented upon matters of human rights that do not accord with this Government's view. We do support SWAPO. We do support fair and free elections in Namibia. If the honourable member for Parkes wants to be even-handed about this, it is a pity he did not speak out some time ago about the denial of human rights in Namibia under the previous regime. He would have a lot more credibility if he came in here and was a lot more even-handed about the denial of human rights. I do not think I have ever heard him speak in this chamber about the denial of human rights in South Africa. I have not heard him talk about the detentions without trial there. I have not heard him talk about the whips used on protesters, the dogs that have been let loose, the electric shocks that have been used on people in South Africa. As I said before, his speeches in this chamber would have a lot more credibility if he were more even-handed in his criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> The question must be asked: Why does the honourable member for Parkes always think he is correct? He comes in here and makes these statements. In his opinion, he is always correct, but he is often a minority of one. He is a minority against world opinion, the opinion of the UN, and the opinion of the people and government of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the assistance that the Australian Government has given to the frontline states. Under SWAPO, Namibia will become a free and independent society. South Africa and its apologists will continue to put out their scare stories. It is a great pity that a member of this Parliament will stand up here and put these stories to the Parliament as if they were gospel when, in fact, they are just propaganda for the South African regime. </PARA>

<PARA> 2 (ii) Australian International Development Assistance Bureau</PARA>
<PARA> The Consultants and Contracts Section of the Bureau maintains the records of individual consultancies. The records are maintained with only certain details. The Bureau is therefore unable to provide information in the form requested without a detailed search of individual transaction records. AIDAB does not have the resources to conduct such searches to identify the cost of each consultancy by financial year nor to identify the exact period of time in each case.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau has, however, provided significant information concerning its consultancies, which has been collated for the honourable member, but which is too lengthy to be published in Hansard. A copy may be perused at the House of Representatives Table Office.</PARA>
