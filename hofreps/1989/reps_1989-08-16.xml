<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9G4">Dr HARRY EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Other events have transpired, such as the Budget performance last night. I drew attention then to the fact that this Bill has three main purposes. The first is to remove the distinction between trading and savings banks; the second is to provide the phasing out of statutory reserve deposits (SRDs); the third is to provide specific powers for the establishment of prudential requirements in respect of the banks and their administration by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The first part of this matter is rather dry and technical; I hope I can liven it up after that. The first part of the Bill is to remove the distinction between the trading and savings banks. This reflects the fact that in recent years most savings bank subsidiaries of banks have existed not as distinct physical or managerial structures but as different sets of accounts within banking groups. The removal of the distinction between them will enable banks to have better use and allocation of funds, more simple funding and accounting requirements, and greater flexibility in servicing customers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second purpose of the Bill is to phase out statutory reserve deposits. The statutory reserve deposit requirement dates from the early 1940s and was designed as an instrument of monetary policy. By adjusting the SRD ratio the Reserve Bank could add to or reduce liquidity in the banking system and, hence, banks' capacity to lend funds. This was a somewhat blunt but pretty effective instrument. With the recommendations of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System and the Martin Review of the Australian Financial System a more market-oriented approach to monetary policy implementation was adopted and the SRD lapsed as a tool of monetary policy. In the circumstances, the SRDs continued to have something of a distorting effect as they acted to increase the cost of trading bank lending because of the relatively low interest rates paid on SRD funds, thus diverting business to savings and other non-bank financial institutions and encouraging banks to fund their operations through sources other than Australian dollar deposits. </PARA>
<PARA> While the SRD was somewhat primitive and inefficient it nevertheless acted very directly on the quantity of money. In the context of the new deregulated order that began to emerge, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in January 1985 discarded-altogether too lightly, I suggest-taking account of the quantity of money; monetary targeting, as it was then called. Yet over the past 12 months, for example, we find-and we do not have to look further for this than the figures that always appear on the back page of the Economist-the money supply in Australia increased by 26.8 per cent, compared with 9.4 per cent in Japan, 5.3 per cent in Germany, and 4.2 per cent in the United States. The increase in Australia is a very large increase. It was at an annual rate of no less than 49.2 per cent in the month of June last. As one commentator put it, `Money has been loose beyond belief in this country'. Provided one is prepared to pay the high interest rates, credit funds have been very easy to obtain. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been a recipe for volatile speculation, especially in property, up to a few months ago, on top of the overheated economy. The Hawke-Keating Government, and I am unhappy to say the Reserve Bank of Australia, must accept a heavy responsibility for the loose credit availability which, over the past year or so, has so fed inflation and excess demand in this economy. At the same time average families with housing mort- gages have had to cope with increases of upwards of 40 per cent in their mortgage repayments making severe inroads into their budgets and standards of living. </PARA>
<PARA> The third major purpose of the Bill, as I said, is to provide for the prudential supervision of the banking systems by the Reserve Bank, as distinct from the implementing of monetary policy. In fact, it formalises what are already reasonably well established practices for the prudential supervision of the banking system. In these terms the Bill is a natural culmination of the process of deregulation of the system over the past eight to 10 years. I say eight to 10 years because that is at least how long-it has probably been even longer-the process has been under way. While the Australian Labor Party has claimed a lot of credit for the deregulation of the financial system, the matter needs to be seen in perspective. I give credit where it is due but not more than that. In fact, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), as Treasurer in the Fraser Government, began the process by setting up the Campbell Committee which reported in September 1981. This was followed by the Martin Committee. The relaxation of more direct controls of the system began in 1981-82 and applications for the entry of foreign banks were actually called before the Fraser Government was defeated in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the claims of the Government, there was an inevitability about all this. Even the freeing up of the exchange rate at the end of 1983 was largely because the number, size and sophistication of the players in the foreign exchange market were such that the Government, in the end, had little choice but to substantially deregulate the market. I will give credit where it is due: the Government took the necessary decisions in these matters with the minimum of disruption. The trouble is that, for reasons I will not elaborate on in this debate, the deregulation largely ended with the financial system and did not extend into other crucial areas of the economy, especially into the rigid and highly centralised wages and industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> The case for the Reserve Bank to prudentially supervise banks is unquestioned but there are not lacking people who would seek to limit this, maybe even to seek a measure of re-regulation, certainly a more significant monitoring of the banks-including in particular bank charges-in the present context of apparently record bank profits and murderously high interest rates. Of course, plenty of attacks are being made on the banks, as witness many Government speakers when this debate was held in the previous session, with the Treasurer, then quoted several times, leading the charge. I recall his statement of 17 April:</PARA>
<PARA> As soon as they (the banks) see some of that profit growth being threatened, they are out there squealing like stuck pigs on television every time they get a chance. </PARA>
<PARA>This comment was especially directed at the Treasurer's pet target, Mr Nobby Clark, the head of the National Australia Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> By and large, I believe that these attacks which are being made on the banks are ill-informed and without justification. If one relates profits to the capital invested, then one sees that there has been something of a decline in the level of bank earnings with the greater degree of competition in recent years. Again, if one studies the process closely one sees that the banks have, generally speaking, delayed rises in their rates in the wake of increases in the costs of funds to them. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, it is not the banks, nor the process of deregulation itself-a process which often attracts the criticism, wrongly, that the murderous level of interest rates is the fault of deregulation-but rather the wrong-headed and failed economic policies of this Government that are to blame for the very high interest rates and the very serious economic problems facing the country.</PARA>
<PARA> In referring to interest rates, the truth is that the 17 per cent mortgage rate is exactly what the Government was aiming to achieve in order to cut the demand for housing. But, in relation to overall policy, the basic manifestation of the Government's failure is the vast continuing gap, the deficit, in our balance of payments and the frightening growth in the overseas debt, from the order of $30 billion in 1983 to a gross debt in excess of $130 billion today, and rising. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be, as someone said on the radio this morning, that there is a wider understanding out there of this whole matter, but people need to get a very clear picture of this. The debt rises inexorably every second of every hour of every day, so that right now the country is some $50m more into hock than it was at this time yesterday. If the balance of payments deficit comes in today, as is widely predicted, at nearer $2 billion for the month, we are talking about going an extra $70m into hock every day. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9G4">Dr HARRY EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does worry the people. A suggestion is often made by the Treasurer that this matter of the debt is something that is not so serious, that it is rather remote from the man in the street. But that is very much not the case. There was a reference recently to the debt clock that was set up in New York. As the United States has moved into debtor country status, but with not nearly as great a problem as us, the clock ticks away over New York to bring home how fast and frighteningly the debt problem grows. We need such a clock here. This debt will forever be the monument to, if you can call it that, the measure of the failure, the lamentable legacy of, the Keating years-worse indeed than the Whitlam years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now we have this Budget which was brought down last night. It has as its centrepiece the $9.1 billion surplus, but that stems from the great revenue flows from the taxes imposed by this highest taxing government in all Australia's history. There is no doubt that it is something of a `fix' when we allow for asset sales in the phoney role as a reduction of Government spending or bringing tax payments by companies up front, having them pay early accounting for something like $800m-also the extent of last year's revenue brought into this year, and such factors. When we take all those factors into account, with no significant cut in the Commonwealth's own real spending-though let me acknowledge as good the programs for pensioners, homeless youth and the other social justice initiatives-we see that this is not a strong Budget; if anything, it is an easing of fiscal policy. So we have that easing, we have the prospect of continued murderous high interest rates to slow further private demand, since very little has been done to slow government demand, but in the key policy area of measures to increase production and productivity--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Webster" NAMEID="WJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WJ4">Mr Webster</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is central.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9G4">Dr HARRY EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague says, that is central, the key thrust of policy-there is nothing new other than a proposal to extend the Industries Assistance Commission into an Industry Commission. If aggregate output next year is projected to grow at 2 3/4 per cent, so also is employment, and so the very projection is for no measurable productivity growth. The key thrust of policy must be in increasing the nation's production through increased productivity. That production is the nation's income. When one is in debt, is it not the first priority to increase one's income, as well as to save more-to reduce one's spending, in other words-in order to meet interest payments and to begin to pay off debt? This applies to the nation as well as to individuals. It is in this critical area of increasing production, particularly through increased productivity, where the Government has failed abysmally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard much about the investment boom of recent times, but even Budget Statement No. 2 shows that the bulk of that is in the non-tradable goods area. Therefore, it does not bear directly on the important increased production for export or import replacement. Further, what is crucial in the process is the whole area of micro-economic reform, including changes to the rigid and inflexible wages and industrial relations system; changes to allow for increased productivity on the wharves, in coastal shipping, in virtually every form of transport and communications; and improved management practice and the ceasing of restrictive work practices which so hold back productivity across the nation and impoverish everybody. Such reform also includes the privatisation of publicly owned businesses for greater efficiency, and so on. As I have said, we only have to state those prerequisites of micro-economic policy to understand why fundamental economic progress has been so limited and productivity growth so abysmal under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, all we had in the Budget Papers last night was reference to a new Industry Commission. There was no advance on the weak approach to reforms on the wharves and shipping. Yesterday, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) referred to the so-called Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9G4">Dr HARRY EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, my colleague might well spurn it. It is a cosy cabal between the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and the stevedoring companies which does not bring into the picture at all the importers and exporters who are so disadvantaged by the arrangements which prevail there. When it comes to coastal shipping the Government says there needs to be consultation. That is what that industry was told to do in the statement in the chamber last May. There was no reference to the absolute necessity for increased competition, for exposure to foreign-Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-competition, which is the only way to any effective achievement in that area. We do get these things because, of course, by the nature of the Government's main constituency, the trade unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, significant change in most of those areas is `not on'; and privatisation is blackballed by the left wing of the Labor Party. As I have said, there is only one recipe for this nation: when the election does come about, it is to change the Government to enable this side of the House to implement these essential reforms for the future of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is usual to commence debate on a matter such as the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill by going straight to the heart of the subject, but I have been so delighted by the opportunities for cheap point scoring that the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) has placed in my way that for once I will give in to temptation and strike whilst the iron is hot. Essentially, what we have heard exposes the paucity of the Opposition's whole response to the economic environment that Australia finds itself in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard criticism of the Government's micro-economic policy, its waterfront reform and its plans to move cooperatively with the trade union movement and employers to make sure that Australia can respond effectively to what is a difficult, and accepted to be difficult, position on the waterfront. But what is the Opposition's solution? I suppose that it wants national strikes, in the same way as it wants national strikes as a consequence of its wages policy. The Opposition rejects entirely the accord proposals as a way of enabling government, the trade union movement and employers to accept moderation in wage outcomes in Australia, thus forgoing the bloodbath of industrial crisis that would arise from a wages free-for-all. The Liberals' wages policy is demonstrated by the airline dispute. The Liberals' wages policy would permit demands such as that of the pilots for a 30 per cent wage rise outside indexation guidelines. When the Liberals talk about deregulating the wages market they are talking about a bloodbath, a free-for-all, where the winner takes what he can, where the strong exploit their economic position and the weak accept what limited outcomes they can achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, some might say that, as a result of such a disruptive and unsettled industrial climate, in which the strike rate rises to what it was under previous Liberal administrations, with an economy damaged by strikes in key sectors such as airlines, ports and the like, somehow from this ruination the Australian economy might rise phoenix-like out of the ashes. I suggest that that is complete and utter nonsense. If one starts by smashing the underpinnings of cooperation that exist between those working in partnership in industry and sets those people against each other, one is hardly providing a recipe for a jolly, happy outcome. In fact, the obvious consequence of such a wages policy would be years of unsettled economic conditions in Australia, with Australia's competitiveness facing increased pressure as the powerful within the industrial wings of the labour movement take what they can by way of strike action and threats of industrial dislocation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us remember that there is still a time of significant firmness in the labour market. The labour movement is not weak and powerless. Its acceptance of the need for restraint so that the Australian economic position can be strengthened is one of the great successes of the Labor Government and one of the key reasons why all the prognostications and blatherings that we hear from the Liberal Party are as nothing in terms of its capacity to come to an effective outcome that would persuade the Australian people that it is worth its salt. </PARA>
<PARA> I now return to the Bill. The honourable member for Berowra identified in his initial remarks the three key elements of this legislation. The first element is to eliminate the distinction between savings and trading banks. Increasingly over time their functions have intermeshed. There really is no point in maintaining the paper fiction as to what was a savings bank and a trading bank function and, as those institutions have evolved and new banking products have come on to the marketplace, I think it has been broadly accepted that those distinctions are no longer appropriate. So this Bill undoes some of the technical rules that had limited the flexibility of banking institutions. It is welcomed across the board by this Government, by the Opposition and I believe also by the banking industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Berowra made some very interesting comments on the second major leg of the legislation-the statutory reserve deposits (SRDs) provisions. I think what he said on that point bears some further consideration. Certainly there is a case that the SRD mechanism was a relatively blunt instrument of policy, but at least it was a mechanism in the hands of government allowing the Reserve Bank to control money supply, or at least that part of money supply which relates to the amount of credit on loans extended by the Bank. However, the problem with that relatively blunt instrument is that the way of manufacturing credit and money in our society has so exploded with new instruments that, in a sense, controlling just one way of creating `money' was a relatively limited mechanism. The complexity is illustrated by the various ways in which money supply can be measured-the so-called M1, M2 and M3 measurements. The SRD system attracted condemnation from two review bodies set up to examine Australia's financial system-the Martin Review of the Australian Financial System and the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System-and as a result of the criticisms advanced in those reports it was largely disused as an instrument of government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, I do note the points that the honourable member for Berowra has made. Future governments may wish to intervene directly in the creation of money. In a deregulated market-place there are only limited ways in which governments can influence the direction of an economy. Some of those are obvious. For example, wages outcomes are capable of being influenced provided that government has an arrangement with the trade union movement and there is broad agreement between the parties. That is why I prefaced my remarks by pointing out the importance of actually having a policy in relation to wages outcomes. The second way in which governments can influence the macro-economic settings is through their own budget decisions. They can influence macro-economic savings either by accumulating surpluses and repaying debt, or by spending more and thereby seeking to stimulate growth within an economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, with the Australian economy growing dramatically and strongly, notwithstanding attempts to slow it down, the Government has brought in a Budget which has predicted a Budget surplus of $9.1 billion. It is one way in which the Government is saving on behalf of the Australian people. That contributes to a slowdown of the rate of economic growth and, to the soft landing which is predicted in the Budget Papers. Those are the first two ways in which governments can influence the macro-economic settings. </PARA>
<PARA> The third way is through interest rates. Because the Government has put as much weight as it can on its Budget and wages policy, the Government has had to lean fairly heavily on interest rates in seeking to influence the Australian economy to slow down, to take demand off imports and to create an environment where there is a capacity for productive investment to kick along within Australia but without placing the pressure on imports that has bedevilled the Australian economy over the last two years. Those are the three principal arms of economic policy in current use. </PARA>
<PARA> However, potentially there are other arms. One of those other arms would be a capacity to influence total money supply and money growth. To some extent, that is influenced through the Reserve Bank of Australia and by the way in which notes are issued or withdrawn from the market. The SRD was also such a mechanism, used during the 1950s to promote what were then regarded as credit squeezes. I do not think that anyone would wish to advance the argument that Australia is now ripe for a credit squeeze. I do not think that has been an argument advanced by anyone in the financial community, and certainly not, I imagine, by the honourable member for Berowra, who raised some concerns about the withdrawal of the SRD mechanism. Nonetheless, the availability of a mechanism to influence money growth does seem to me to be something that perhaps should not be too lightly discarded. It has certainly not been replaced by the one per cent non-callable deposit. That is a flat deposit which is there essentially for prudential reasons to ensure that there is a buffer in case of bad debts or the like in the banking system, rather than as a mechanism for controlling the rate of growth of the money supply. I therefore think there is a point worth noting in the remarks made by the honourable member for Berowra in relation to the SRD. It is a point that warrants some further reflection. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to one aspect of this Bill, namely, prudential management. With the deregulation of the banking system and the introduction of many new banking products there has been a need to update the way in which the banking system is monitored and regulated. The monitoring function is to be enhanced by a series of provisions in the legislation which provide that banks must supply the Reserve Bank with detailed information to enable the Reserve Bank to formulate policy responses to ensure that there is no default within the banking system. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 15 of the Bill, headed `Collection and publication of information about banks', I regard as one of the most important provisions. For the first time there is a firm legislative basis in the law which enables the Reserve Bank to identify exactly what is occurring in the marketplace with banks. It has become increasingly important because, more and more, banks have become the source of almost all consumer credit in Australia as well as driving commercial investment. About 80 per cent of all personal consumer credit is now extended through the banking system. There has been a significant change over the last five years. Before there was a deregulated banking system and various new products were attractively made available by the banks much of the personal consumer credit business was transacted by finance companies, building societies, credit unions, and the like. Eighty per cent of consumer credit transactions are now conducted by banks. As well as traditional commercial funding functions banks now provide most of the credit available to ordinary citizens. It is crucial that the Commonwealth and its agencies have full capacity to collect and publish information about the banks. Clause 15 of the Bill provides for those reporting provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides a legislative framework for the Government, through the Reserve Bank, to ensure that banks are properly monitored and that proper prudential arrangements are in place. Fortunately, in recent history banks in Australia have not closed because of bad debt. That has not always been the case. In the late 1800s several banks in Victoria fell to insolvency. There are a number of very interesting books about those very racy days of early bank financing. Several of Victoria's leading citizens of the day were involved in essentially piratical activities and in the sponsorship of banks which ultimately failed, to the detriment of those who had their savings locked into those banks. It is simply unacceptable nowadays to accept a situation where major financial institutions in which ordinary people place their savings can fail. The Australian Government, through its control of prudential arrangements, has to make sure that banks do not crash at the expense of ordinary customers who have lent their moneys to the banks. These arrangements under clause 6, which are influenced also by the licensing conditions provided by clause 5 of the Bill, are very important provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to say something about banking generally. Given that consumer credit is now generated through the banking system rather than through other institutions, I believe it is more important than ever to look at the consumer responsibility of banking. One of the realities that we have seen is a change in Australian business. The banks had been previously regarded as benevolent, rather lazy institutions but ones which were always looking after the interests of their customers. Under the pressure of increasing competition and deregulation they have become much more market oriented and much more profit oriented. But they are still not regulated by the ordinary rules about consumer credit that apply to other institutions. There are still on the financial market products that do not adequately disclose rates of interest or provide the sort of information that customers are entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA> Bank customers are being left in a position where they need greater protection. I hope that comes about through the work that is now proceeding towards uniform consumer credit laws, work that is occurring between the Commonwealth and State Ministers. If that process fails, I believe there is a need to establish a clear set of consumer credit laws to apply to banks. For example, banks' contracts are often vague, written in terms which many regard as unconscionably in favour of the banks. There are no effective mechanisms for consumers to be advised about the state of their transactions with banks. </PARA>
<PARA> One point that came to my attention recently from a number of my constituents is that they had been repaying on a monthly basis loans that had been extended to them and they had believed that those repayments would be sufficient to reduce the principal and to repay the loan. However, the bank, without notifying them, had increased the interest rate that was applicable on those loans so that they were not, in effect, repaying the loans at all. The principal was accumulating. They ended up owing more at the end of three years than when they began paying. </PARA>
<PARA> These people were business consumers. They borrowed money for a business purpose. If business consumers are the victims in such a situation then think of the thousands of small consumers that are not protected. The banks can extend better protection: they advise clients who borrow more than $100,000-the big customers-if their repayments are no longer covering principal, but the little customer can go swing. It is vital that we have effective coverage of consumer credit laws extended as soon as possible. If the process between the State and Commonwealth Ministers fails then this Parliament should legislate, and legislate quickly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, like former speakers in this debate today, would like to speak to the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill that is before the House and, perhaps, conclude with more general comments about the banking sector. As we have already heard in the contributions made by people, both those opposite and those on the Government side, there are a number of major changes proposed in this legislation. The first, of course, is to provide the Reserve Bank of Australia with the formal authority for the prudential supervision of banks. I do not think anybody could disagree with the need for supervision of some of the banks in Australia, particularly since deregulation and the emergence of a number of overseas banks and the decisions subsequently taken by some of them to close their doors and cease trading here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second major change proposed in the legislation is the removal of the distinction between trading banks and saving banks. My colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who has just spoken, went to some lengths to describe how those changes were to be brought about, and the need to have the distinction between trading banks and savings banks is therefore eliminated. Interestingly, it means that references to savings and/or trading banks in relation to different corporations, government entities and so on need to be amended. The legislation does just that. The third major change looks at replacing the statutory reserve deposit requirement on trading banks with a new non-callable deposit requirement on all banks. Again, I think that is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, a change is proposed which will make the arrangements for the collection and publication of banking statistics more flexible. I do not think anybody in the community could quibble with the concept of there being a need to collect banking statistics in this era of a requirement for a fairly substantial information base. In this day and age everyone's attention seems to be concentrated on the economy and economic matters. In days gone by, at this time speeches in this place probably would have been about the success of the Australian cricket team, but now they are centred on interest rates, the economy, and so on. It is important that there be a statistical base from which people can make meaningful judgments and come to conclusions. Perhaps governments also need that base from which to make decisions on what is necessary for the economic well-being of our country. </PARA>
<PARA> I will look very quickly at the impact of each of these changes as I perceive them. Firstly, obviously there will be a promotion of stability in the banking system. Clearly, that is necessary to the economy. As my colleague the honourable member for Denison has just stated, we cannot live with a situation where there is a temptation for banks to manipulate things. We cannot live with a potential situation of banks going to the wall or financial institutions finding themselves in some degree of difficulty. There must be stability in the banking system. There must be a balance in the economy. Given the role the banks now play in the provision of finance and their contribution to our economic well-being-whether simply by providing finance to home buyers or to small or large businesses looking to expand and take advantage of economic conditions-it is necessary for that stability in the banking system to remain with us. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a need for the continued protection of those who deposit funds with banks. People who deposit money in banks assume they will get a particular interest rate. The must have certainty in their minds that their money is protected and that they will have the opportunity to withdraw that money if and when necessary and that whatever is due to them will flow to them. Continued protection, therefore, under this amending legislation is quite appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of the distinction between savings and trading banks is also timely. No longer is any purpose served by having a distinction between them. They do the same basic tasks. Those who will ultimately benefit from this process will be the customers because lower costs should be associated with banking services. That is a very interesting point and one that I will return to in a moment when I address the contribution made by the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards), who talked about bank bashing and banks being subjected to a great deal of criticism which was perhaps unfair. One of the fundamental things to flow from the removal of the distinction between savings and trading banks will be lower costs to customers. The banks should no longer need to impose charges on transactions because the distinction will no longer be there. That in turn should promote efficiency in the banking sector. In all parts of the economy efficiency is now the key word, and it is certainly no different in the banking sector. As a result, the Government's ability to monitor the financial sector will also be improved. I believe that that is most important because it allows the general public to be better informed about banks, the roles which they play and the contribution they make to the economy in its broader sense. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn now to prudential supervision, perhaps with a bit more detail. The Reserve Bank up until recently has relied heavily on the cooperation of individual banks to fulfil its obligatory role of prudential supervision. However, due to the effects of deregulation, when we saw a number of banks come into Australia, which has meant more banks, more competition and so on, it is now desirable for the Reserve Bank to have a clear statutory base for its prudential supervision of banks. I think that is quite appropriate. Given deregulation and the fact that there are more players out there in the game, in the marketplace, we need to ensure that what is being done not only is within the law of Australia but also, even more importantly, is to the benefit of the people who use the banking system. Certainly it is not the Government's intention to alter the prudential standards or their administration; it is simply to ensure that they apply equitably amongst all banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the removal of the statutory reserve deposit, or SRD, also is included within this legislation. It was recommended, as has been stated in debate, by both the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System and the Martin Review of the Australian Financial System. I just point out that the latter committee did not involve me or any of my relatives, to my knowledge. The SRD requirement has had something of a distorting effect on the financial system for quite some time. It is to be phased out over three years and will be replaced with a system of non-callable deposits which banks will be required to maintain with the Reserve Bank. Again I think that that is sensible. It is a reflection of the banking system in the latter half of this century and is in keeping with modern practices. As the economy changes, as it expands, as the volume of money increases, it is necessary to ensure that the functions performed by the banks in this country are efficient and effective and meet the needs of the customers. The new arrangements represent further and significant steps in the process of financial deregulation. I know that there is some degree of criticism still about the process of deregulation in our economy. I think that generally speaking deregulation has been reasonable and that benefits have flowed to people but, as I will point out shortly, there are also one or two little problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally in relation to the legislation itself, the collection and publication of statistics about banks, as I have already remarked, will be quite significant, particularly for customers and consumers who look at what their banks do. They get the annual reports, but quite often they are uncertain what it all means. However, with the collection of statistics now being made available-and hopefully they will be-by the Government, there should be a clearer understanding as to just what role the banks play in our economy. The statistics will be simplified, they will be more flexible, and will keep up with the significant and rapid changes in the nature of the financial markets and the types of financial instruments used by banks. This measure is clearly designed to assist customers-that is, the consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated that, in the time that I have this morning, I wanted to make one or two comments about the banking industry in general and perhaps also respond to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Berowra in his contribution this morning. Firstly, I think that the honourable member indicated that he felt that criticisms of banks were not justified. Many people are concerned about interest rates and the possibility of problems with their industry or business or in maintaining home mortgage repayments and so on. I think that the honourable member is very much under the illusion, like so many in the banking industry, that concerns from people such as that about what part the banks have played in all this are not real and are not justified. I would just like to go to four specific areas where I think perhaps the honourable member might like to look to see whether the criticisms of banks are justified in some way. </PARA>
<PARA> The first relates to bank charges themselves. How many of us in this place receive representations from battlers, from pensioners, from people who kept less than $250 in bank accounts-particularly with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia-and were subjected to charges every time a transaction was made? Because of pressure from both sides of this House the Commonwealth Bank has relented to some extent and indicated that it is prepared to waive those charges for specific people, but not everybody. Battlers-people who have a minimum amount of money kept in their accounts-are being subjected to the $2.50 charge simply because the banks say-because of their lack of efficiency, I presume-that they are unable to process any of those transactions of their customers. Frankly, I find that is appalling. The banks, particularly the Commonwealth Bank, should look at that aspect of their operations. If that is being critical of the banks, and one bank in particular, is that not justified? Perhaps in the electorate of the honourable member for Berowra there are not too many people who have minimum balances of less than $250, but I can assure him there are many who do in other parts of Australia, and this is a concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue is that of debt. I used the line in my electorate last night after the Budget that the Budget surplus was being used in much the same way as a household which has a surplus but also a Bankcard problem would use that surplus. We will pay off some of the debt. When a household runs up a Bankcard debt there comes a time when it has to make a few payments. There is a minimum repayment every month, and the household hopes eventually to discharge that debt. The question of debt and the role that banks play, however, is also worthy of examination. For example-I am sure there are others, like myself, who have had constituents see them about this issue-how many of us can remember the old days when one went to see a bank loans officer or a bank manager and said, `Look, I am in the process of buying a home and I want to borrow some money to enable me to do it'? The bank manager or loans officer would go through a complicated set of calculations based, essentially, on the gross income of the worker in the family. It did not matter whether one's wife worked; she was excluded. It did not matter whatever else might have been around. If one had assets, they were included. A gross figure was arrived at and the amount of money that the banks were prepared to lend was no more than 25 per cent of that gross salary, in terms of the weekly repayments. </PARA>
<PARA> That does not happen now. One might go to the bank manager or loans officer and say, `Look, I have to buy a house'. In Sydney or Melbourne the cost of housing has been driven up because of the supply and demand question. The manager will say, `How much do you want?'. One may say, `I want $100,000'. The bank manager will say, `Look, it is only money, take $200,000. You can repay it and if interest rates go up we will extend the time for repayment'. What he does not say is that the amount to be repaid, therefore, will be a lot higher. Where is the responsibility on the part of some of those people in the banking sector to their customers, particularly to battlers? I used the figure of $100,000. In Sydney I think that is probably about the minimum that people now have to borrow in order to purchase a house. In electorates like mine $60,000 to $70,000 is probably about average, but the same principle applies. People who are looking to buy first, second or even third homes go to banks and say they need to borrow money. Instead of giving them a realistic figure, which will not get them into consumer difficulties later on in meeting repayments, the banks are prepared to go overboard. </PARA>
<PARA> The same thing applies equally to Bankcard and other forms of credit that banks offer. Recently I received a letter from my bank saying, `We notice you have a very low Bankcard limit. We think that should be upped, and we are making you this once in a lifetime offer. You can have another $3,000 or $4,000 on top of that if you want'. I declined, I hasten to add. Having a wife and four children, and a cat and a dog, makes it very hard to make ends meet at the best of times without getting into the issue of consumer credit. Again, I ask the honourable member for Berowra, as somebody in a normal family situation, whether I am being too critical of banks because they are saying to people, `We will make credit far more easy for you'. Of course, it often gets people into situations where they cannot meet their debts. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I want to address quickly is the banks' views on capital gains tax. I am reminded of an interview with Will Bailey of the ANZ Bank on Business Sunday on 23 April. This is just a passing comment in relation to capital gains tax-and it flows from my former comment on housing and housing interest rates. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> If we're going to have a capital gains tax, I believe it ought to apply equally across the board to all sorts of investments, and that includes a (owner-occupied) house. </PARA>
<PARA>Am I being critical of somebody like Will Bailey from the ANZ Bank who says that capital gains tax should apply to owner-occupied houses? I do not think I am. I do not think too many people in this place would agree to something like that applying. Even those on the other side of the House who are against capital gains tax as such would not, I am sure, agree with that statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I come to the question of the role that banks play in international profit shifting and the use of tax havens. This matter was brought to the attention of the Parliament in May this year when a document from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration was published entitled Taxpayers or taxplayers. That report goes to the heart of the issue about banks and the way they use money, and other people's money, and shift it around between Australia, tax havens and other corporations. It goes to the heart of the way in which the Australian Taxation Office has directed its attention to certain matters of concern, and its ongoing investigations. It also directs concern at the role which some banks play and the amount of profits which they hold in tax havens. I refer to page 63 of that report where table 1, entitled `Tax haven profits by companies', lists 15 companies which have over $100m, or greater than 100 per cent of their profits, contained in tax havens. A bank is one of those top 15 companies that use tax havens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the ANZ Bank. But if one turns to a table at the back of that document, one also sees that many other banks are listed, with the profits they derive from tax havens. This has been drawn to the attention of the Parliament. The Government has already announced that legislation will be put in place to crack down on the use of tax havens by Australian corporations, including individual banks, and rightly so. Again, I will probably be accused in the banking sector of bank bashing and criticising banks. The evidence that came before this Committee showed that the banks either have no idea or choose not to have an idea as to how money is moved around between Australia and tax havens and overseas corporations and subsidiaries. What clearly came out as well is that if one moves less than $50,000 from Australia overseas, one does not need a tax clearance certificate from Australia-one can just do it, and people have no idea as to where that money is going. It could come from illegal activities in this country, but banks do not know and do not want to know. Again, I will be accused of being critical and bank bashing. I am not. I am raising legitimate concerns of people. Those concerns will be continuously addressed to the Government and, certainly, by this Committee in its ongoing commitment to look at this issue of international profit shifting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation is good legislation. It proposes major changes, but there are criticisms of banks which I think are justified. I do not have time to go to the heart of the matter of profiteering by banks. There is ample evidence to suggest that is the case, and I do not think people should forget that either. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been explained by the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) in introducing this Bill and by other speakers, this Banking Legislation Amendment Bill will change significantly the Banking Act of 1959. There will no longer be that distinction between trading and savings banks and, importantly, the Government is addressing the problems brought to its attention by the banks concerning statutory reserve deposits (SRDs). Instead of SRDs there will be a new non-callable deposit requirement on all the banks. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) made some very valid points about the changes and how they will reduce costs. I hope that those changes and the reduction in costs will flow to consumers, because that should be the ultimate aim. We ought to see some of the hidden charges disappearing. We ought to see some of those other administrative costs being reduced. But it is an important change to legislation and I know it will be supported by members of the Opposition. It will certainly be supported by Government members and I think by the banking system generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No-one denies that the banking system is a very important part of our society. It is central to the operation of this nation's financial system. It makes a very important contribution to the nation's broader economy. At the same time, putting the banks on a pedestal, as the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) did, is really overdoing it a bit. He made out that the banks were squeaky clean-like Rinso, white. That is certainly not the case when one looks at the sorts of problems people have faced because of the banks' policies, including wrong advice on offshore borrowing and the difficulties of farmers who have been called upon to pay penalty interest rates. The interest rate for some farmers was 17 per cent but for others, because of financial difficulties, it was 22 per cent. The honourable member for Macarthur raised the matter of tax havens. They are totally un-Australian. Australian banks that are involved in offshore tax havens ought to have a hard look at themselves and question whether they are truly pro this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Berowra also tried to set aside any blame on the banks for high interest rates. One could almost believe that the banks are some sort of community charitable organisation, that if one goes along and asks them nicely one gets money for nothing. How ridiculous! The honourable member for Berowra either is a member of the board of directors of some bank or, because of his long accounting and economic background, is locked into a mentality that can see no wrong. He is wearing blinkers where the banks are concerned. He painted a picture of banks being perfect and pure. That is not the case. It is time people started to realise what is taking place behind the scenes. In fact, sometimes one does not even have to look behind the scenes at the hidden charges and the additional costs! One just has to look at the openly declared profits to see the sort of money the banks are making. </PARA>
<PARA> One needs to look too at the differences between the interest paid on on-call deposits and the interest charged to borrowers. That is the issue here. One only has to make the comparison to see who is doing the right thing and who is affecting interest rates. Not so long ago a woman rang me. She was irate because her daughter had to pay a higher interest rate with a building society. She informed me that her daughter would now have to pay 16 per cent. I said to her, `Maybe we should look at the building society's profits'. She thought that was an unfair comment and that I was just trying to protect the Hawke Labor Government. I was not. I asked her what sort of money she was getting on her investment with that building society. It happened to be the Rockhampton building society called the Rock Building Society. She said, `I'm probably getting 13 or 14 per cent'. I said that that would be nonsense. I asked whether she had less than $5,000 invested. She said it was none of my business. I said, `What would you have? I'm going to put it to you, lady, that if you've got less than $4,999 you're getting a meagre 6 per cent on your money'. She called me a couple of things and said I was telling lies, that it was untrue. I challenged her to ring the building society and find out what interest she was being paid on her deposits. She rang back about 15 minutes later and apologised. She had less than $4,999 in that account and she was getting 6 per cent interest. She started to understand that there was something wrong when she and tens of thousands of other depositors were getting 6 per cent on their money but the building society was charging 16 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I took the time to pull out some other figures because I did not want to target only the Rock Building Society. I wanted to make sure that this was correct, so I went back to the Reserve Bank figures to see what is taking place out there, what movement has occurred in the interest being paid on on-call deposits contrasted with the interest changes for people who have borrowed money. The Reserve Bank figures for June are quite exciting. In April this year there was about $9,000m in passbook accounts across this nation. Those $9,000m worth of accounts are getting only 3.7 per cent. If one looks at that as a percentage of the total savings one sees that 16 per cent to 20 per cent of total savings in this nation are attracting 3.75 per cent. At the moment the bank charges to someone borrowing for a home are 17 per cent. Yet the honourable member for Berowra told us that we ought to put the banks on some sort of pedestal. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the plastic card accounts. Plastic card accounts have some $9 1/2 billion in them. That amount has increased since these figures were pulled out. In 1988 those accounts were attracting 8.75 per cent. In a year when we have seen an increase of 3 per cent and 4 per cent in interest rates to borrowers, those plastic card accounts have gone from 8.75 per cent to 9 per cent. So if people have money in plastic card accounts they have gained a massive one-quarter per cent interest increase during a year, but those who are borrowing their money through the banks are paying 3 per cent and 4 per cent more. What has this meant for the banks? It has meant an additional $300m in profits for the banks who control and manage those passbook accounts. For the plastic card accounts it has meant a windfall profit of some $310m. So on two types of accounts-the average savings accounts with 3.75 per cent interest and the plastic card accounts-the banks have picked up a $610m profit. If one looks at the other types of accounts in the banking system one sees that in this year, when interest rates have risen by 3 per cent and 4 per cent, and in some cases 5 per cent, for those trying to buy a home, people with money in these accounts have gained between a quarter of a per cent and one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The building societies are no better. It is time we took a hard look at the building societies, which are supposed to be out there with the specific responsibility of helping people build homes. They were set up to provide money for homes. The average account rate they were paying last year was 8.3 per cent. This year, 12 months later, it has gone up to only 8.69 per cent-less than half a per cent increase in interest. In fact, it is a 0.39 per cent increase. Yet the lending rates during that same period have gone from an average of 13.05 per cent to 15.94 per cent-a rise of almost 3 per cent. That is a lot of money. There is $6 billion in these accounts I am targeting. This has meant an extra profit of $148m to the building societies in that 12-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us come back to some specifics. If a depositor has less than $500 in the Metway Bank Ltd, a metropolitan building society that became a bank with the idea of competing and serving the community in Rockhampton, Brisbane or any other part of Queensland, he gets 4 per cent interest. If he has between $500 and $1,000 he gets 8 per cent interest. It is only when he has more than $1,000 that he gets 11 per cent interest. If he has less than $5,000 in the Rock Building Society I mentioned before he gets 6 per cent. If he has up to $10,000 he gets only 7 per cent. If he has between $10,000 and $25,000 he gets only 8 per cent interest. </PARA>
<PARA> A depositor has to have more than $25,000 to get the 11 per cent interest rate that the bank keeps advertising. The advertisements talk about 11 per cent; they do not talk about 6 per cent or 7 per cent. The bank does not bother to tell people, except in the very fine print or unless they ring up and ask, that they need $25,000 to get 11 per cent. If a depositor has less than $1,000 in the Bank of Queensland-praised again for being pro-Queensland-he gets 3.75 per cent. If he has less than $5,000 he gets 6.25 per cent. This one is a beauty: if he has less than $50,000 he still gets only 7.5 per cent. What is the bank charging? It is charging 17 per cent. Is it any wonder that members of parliament, those involved in the consumer movement and people buying homes are getting fed up with the profiteering that is taking place in the banking industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Bank of Australia is not much better. If a depositor has less than $4,000 he gets 3.75 per cent. If he has more than $4,000-he can have $44,000-he gets only 6 per cent interest in the savings account. In keycard accounts the interest goes up to 8.5 per cent. It is only when one gets into the investment areas that the figures start to improve but that money cannot be withdrawn; so it is not the sort of money that most people have. </PARA>
<PARA> There are signs everywhere around Canberra and Queanbeyan about how wonderful the St George Building Society is. If a depositor has less than $500 he gets 5 per cent. If he has less than $2,000 he gets 8 per cent. I think the only bank I came across that deserves any credit is Westpac Banking Corporation. I do not usually pick and praise anyone, but at least with Westpac if a customer has under $2,999 in the bank he gets interest at 9 per cent; if he has up to $10,000, he gets interest at 9 1/2 per cent; and if he goes over that to the $20,000 mark, or over $19,999, he gets interest at 12 per cent. Westpac is creating the competition. It is a pity that some of the other banks did not follow suit. It is a pity that some of the building societies did not do the right thing by those who were depositing with them instead of ripping off those who were borrowing from them. </PARA>
<PARA> A person can have $9,999 in the Mackay Building Society and he will get only a miserable 5 per cent interest rate. The credit unions of Australia talk about the 14 per cent rates that they give, but if we go back to their on-call accounts we see that if a person has less than $1,000, he gets interest at 6 per cent. This is typical of what is to be found for the vast majority of Australians as we work through the building societies and the banks. I think it is time that the banks and the building societies started being fair with people when they borrow money, and they ought to start doing something about the little rorts that take place. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland, Suncorp has a policy whereby the moment the interest rate is increased to borrowers it charges the borrower to adjust his account. It is getting the extra money because interest rates have gone up, but it puts a special administrative charge on the borrower. It is the same building society that the Queensland Consumers Association is investigating at the moment because of its advertisements. It is advertising now that people can borrow at 16 per cent. What it does not tell them is that eventually the higher interest rate must be caught up with. After some three years built into this is an amount of money that has to be picked up. At the moment it is a lower interest rate, but later on the customer will be paying more. There is a need to have a hard look at the interest rates being charged. It is time that the banks started returning some of these profits to the people who allow them to make the profits; that is, the depositors. The 3.75 per cent interest rate is a nonsense amount. It does not even go anywhere near the costs of inflation; it does not help depositors in any way to meet the sorts of charges that they have to bear. As the honourable member for Macarthur says, if a depositor has a small amount in the bank, the bank does not even pay interest rates; instead it charges the depositor to have his money there. I suggest that we need to look at cocktail loans. As 20 per cent of the money in the savings accounts attracts interest at 3.75 per cent, it is time the banks started calculating the charges accordingly. The fact is that on 20 per cent of their money they are paying only 3.75 per cent in interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I have pulled out some figures that show that if a borrower took out a $50,000 loan and $10,000 of that, which is 20 per cent, was calculated on the 3.75 per cent interest rate, which is what the banks are paying for it, he should be paying interest at only 6 per cent or 7 per cent at the most on $10,000 of that $50,000 loan. The figures that I have given indicate that for some 20 per cent of the savings moneys that are in the accounts, the banks are paying only about 6 per cent, and another 20 per cent of that $50,000 loan ought to be calculated on the cost of the money to the bank. This would mean that the borrower should pay only some 9 or 10 per cent for that 20 per cent borrowed. As I pointed out also, there is some 20 per cent of the money in savings accounts for which the banks are paying around 8 per cent. Again, the borrower should have a lesser cost for the money borrowed and that should be brought back to 11 per cent, 12 per cent or, at the very most, 13 per cent. If a $50,000 loan were cocktailed, if I can use that term, so that parts of it were calculated on what the banks were really paying for the money, we would see thousands of dollars being saved. I did a test to show that a $50,000 loan based on these 20 per cent groupings would save the average home borrower between $2,000 and $3,000 a year in interest alone. If the banks did the correct thing, we would be talking about savings of $40 to $60 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not going to start calling for inquiries into the banks. I just want competition. That is what it is about. That is why the banks were deregulated, and that is why we allowed the banks to come in. I have yet to see the advantage of the deregulation process for the ordinary consumer, the man in the street, the family in the home. Except for a case such as Westpac, it seems that there is a policy out there that the banks and building societies pay the least possible interest rate for the money that is deposited with them and that they take every skerrick they can from those who borrow it back. The differences are massive. The banks are paying only 3.75 per cent to 20 per cent of their depositors. In many banks it is more. I spoke to a Commonwealth Bank manager recently who just happened to be holidaying in central Queensland. I said to him, `What sorts of numbers would there be of people who have less than $5,000 in your bank?'. He paused a moment and said, `Look, I cannot give you the actual figures, but I think that about 70 to 80 per cent of people would have less than $5,000 in my bank'. That is quite amazing because it means that 70 or 80 per cent of people who are banking with that bank are getting 3.75 per cent or, at the very most, 5.5 per cent to 5.75 per cent on their money. </PARA>
<PARA> It is almost criminal that this is taking place when we hear the honourable member for Berowra and others getting up and blaming the Government for high interest rates. Of course there is a need to increase the cost of money to try to dampen down the economy, to stop the imports and to stop people from buying video recorders, television sets and so on. We have a very real problem in this country when it comes to imported goods. For instance, not one square metre of vinyl floor covering is made in this country. I went to an electrical appliance store the other day and the manager said that there was not one product in his store, in regard to video recorders, televisions and those sorts of appliances, that was made in Australia. They are all being imported, and they are causing problems internationally for this country. I suppose that the more money people have the more they will spend on those items. But when it comes to housing, the basic catalyst for our economy, the dream of every Australian, surely there has to be a rationale that will reduce the cost of purchasing a home, and that begins with the banks. It is not an unfair task to put before them because it is not as if we are saying, `Reduce your profit margin and work on one per cent or 2 per cent'. Some banks are borrowing at 3.75 per cent from the ordinary public and they are charging 17.5 per cent. The building societies are no better. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need to look at this issue. I hope as the consumer movements across the nation are starting to campaign about this that the banks will listen. I ask them simply to become more competitive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Banking Legislation Amendment Bill relates to important amendments to the powers and responsibilities of the Reserve Bank of Australia and to the framework for trading and savings banks. I want to use this opportunity to discuss a related issue-the relationship between the Government and the Reserve Bank-but before doing that I would like to welcome the provisions of this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The principal amendment gives formal authority to the Reserve Bank for the prudential supervision of banks. The deregulation of the financial system greatly increased the risk of financial instability. In the first half of the 1980s a number of important changes were made to the regulatory framework for banks, including the removal of ceilings on interest rates on some deposits payable by trading and savings banks, and that happened in December 1980; the lifting of virtually all exchange controls and floating the Australian dollar in late 1983; the abolition of the remaining controls on bank deposit interest rates in August 1984; and the removal of interest rate ceilings on bank loans of under $100,000, other than those for owner-occupied housing, in April 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> The effects of this deregulation are still being worked through, but experience of financial deregulation overseas as well as in Australia suggests that it is essential that prudential supervision-prudential regulation of a more informal kind-be strengthened. The Reserve Bank is required to protect those who deposit funds with the banks. It also has responsibility for the stability of the financial system. To achieve those goals, the Reserve Bank has developed arrangements which require each bank to maintain itself in a sound financial position. These prudential requirements relate to such matters as the adequacy of capital, the structure of assets and liabilities, management of exposures to risk, the capacity of its directors and senior management, and the representation of shareholders by directors. </PARA>
<PARA> While prudential supervision has apparently worked well until now, there is clearly value and appropriateness in strengthening the position of the Reserve Bank vis-a-vis the commercial banks by providing a clear statutory basis for its prudential supervision. The amendment empowers the Treasurer, after consultation with the Reserve Bank, to establish regulations for prudential supervision. This power is also being supplemented by an increase in the scope for placing conditions on the banks. The Bill transfers power to conduct investigations of banks from the Auditor-General to the Reserve Bank. These powers will be reserve powers, available to the Government and the bank for ensuring that the private banks act responsibly, that their directors maintain a proper fiduciary duty towards not only shareholders but also depositors, and that financial probity and stability be maintained. Clearly, these are all centrally important aspects of an effective and stable financial system. This is a very important step towards a new pattern of regulation of the banks in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another of the amendments in the Bill abolishes the system of statutory reserve deposits, which has been used as a means of implementing monetary policy, and replaces it with a new system of non-callable deposits which at the end of a transitional three-year period will be required to be one per cent of bank liabilities. This amendment will reduce the burden on banks of the statutory reserve deposit arrangements while also providing a limited instrument for influencing bank behaviour. Other amendments in this significant Bill remove the distinction between trading and savings banks and make arrangements for the collection and publication of banking statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate on this Bill provides an opportunity for discussion of a central element of monetary policy management in Australia-the relationship between the Government and the Reserve Bank. Few people in Australia seem to realise that the Reserve Bank is not directly under government control. It is not like the Department of the Treasury, which is entirely responsible to the Treasurer for what it does. The Reserve Bank is a statutory authority, the functions of which are set out in the Reserve Bank Act 1959, the Banking Act 1959 and the Financial Corporations Act 1974. These Acts give the Reserve Bank a wide range of powers and responsibilities, especially for monetary policy, external policy and the stability of the financial system. Section 10 of the Reserve Bank Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is the duty of the Board, within the limits of its powers, to ensure that the monetary and banking policy of the Bank is directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia and that the powers of the Bank . . . are exercised in such a manner as, in the opinion of the Board, will best contribute to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the stability of the currency of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the maintenance of full employment in Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>These are fine, wide ranging and centrally important goals given to the bank by the government of the time which set it up. They are goals which are sometimes difficult to achieve simultaneously, but of course that is the problem of all economic policy making. The interesting point, though, is that it would conceptually be quite possible for the Reserve Bank to have a different view about how these goals should be achieved to that of the government of the time. The bank has a separated statutory existence and, as with any institution, will responsibly and inevitably build up quite clear views about how those goals should be achieved. Their approach could well be quite different to that of a government. </PARA>
<PARA> The drafters of the Reserve Bank Act foresaw that danger and made the bank ultimately subordinate to the Government in the determination of overall monetary, banking and external policy. First, the bank is required to inform the Government from time to time about its monetary and banking policies. Secondly, it is required to endeavour to reach agreement with the Government if a difference of opinion ever occurs but, thirdly, in the event of failure to reach agreement, the bank is required to pursue the Government's chosen policy. If such a disagreement occurs, which leads the Government to require that the bank adopt its policies, the Treasurer is required to notify Parliament of the view of both the Government and the bank. This provision ensures that the integrity of the bank is maintained. So far that requirement has never been used, because there has never been an irreconcilable difference of opinion of sufficient magnitude to require reference to Parliament. However, the bank does have substantial independent powers of action in the implementation of monetary, external and prudential policy. For example, the bank can decide how it is going to intervene in buying and selling foreign exchange to influence the exchange rate and how it is going to operate in the open market for government securities. So there are still substantial areas of potential conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> The structure of bank-government relations appears to work pretty well and to be satisfactory for most potential conflicts. The fact that the Secretary to the Treasury is a member of the bank board is another avenue for government influence, as are the multitude of informal contacts and forms of shared information which exist. Nevertheless, it is a strange inconsistency that one of the centrally important arms of economic management is not under direct and comprehensive government control. We believe in representative democracy, we believe in electing parliamentarians with responsibility for a whole range of policies including economic management, but we exclude from that direct control parts of the area of monetary and external policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the current position of the bank is probably that there was doubt at the time the Act was introduced that governments would be fully responsible about monetary policy-that because of political constraints they would not be prepared to pursue appropriately tight monetary policy when this was necessary. The United States of America is a particularly clear example of a country where that fear has led to a structure for monetary policy which is generally independent of the US Administration. The privately owned US Federal Reserve Board-and it is extraordinary that the central bank of the US is privately owned-must report twice a year to Congress on its policies but not to the President or the Executive. In practice the Federal Reserve is in frequent informal contact with all policy making arms of the government; nevertheless its statutory position is one of independence from the US Cabinet. In many other countries the central bank is subject to directions of government. For example, in the United Kingdom the Bank of England is subject to directions of the British Treasury, though in practice I understand decisions are generally reached jointly. In New Zealand the central bank is subject to directions from the Minister of Finance in carrying out economic policy. In France, the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and the Budget, through the Treasury Directorate, dictates even the day-to-day conduct of monetary policy. In contrast, in Australia the Reserve Bank has a legal obligation to keep the Government informed of its policies, but it is not subject to approval by any branch of government for much of what it does. The report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System included comment on what it described as `the bank's broad legislative powers'. That Committee, by the way, endorsed the present structure of the Government's relations with the Reserve Bank, but the description of the Reserve Bank as having legislative powers draws attention to the seriousness of the issue being discussed. </PARA>
<PARA> While I do not believe that this issue is one of immediate importance, or is one that is causing any significant difficulty at present, I am inclined to think that there is an inconsistency between commitment to representative democracy and the present extent of the Reserve Bank's powers. The time could come when the directness of the contact between the bank and Cabinet will need to be strengthened. The Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration recommended in 1976 that the Governor of the bank should have direct access to the economic committee of Cabinet on a regular basis. It would appear that since that time the amount of contact between the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Governor has increased, but it could well be that Cabinet itself should give more attention to the structure of monetary policy and also to the means of implementing it, and that the Governor should meet with Cabinet to discuss those questions. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians are suffering indirectly from the independence of the Federal Reserve Board in the United States because the United States Administration and the Federal Reserve had inconsistent fiscal and monetary policy during the Reagan years. Fiscal policy was expansionary, driven particularly by the rapid increase in military expenditure in the first six of the Reagan years. Monetary policy in contrast was tight and restrictive in an attempt to control inflation, so that interest rates were driven up in 1979-80 and were kept high by the pincer movement of expansionary fiscal and tight monetary policies. The high level of real interest rates in the United States during the 1980s has been the principal cause of high real interest rates in Australia during this decade. A greater consistency in economic policy in the United States, to which integration of economic policy-making might have contributed, could have reduced this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> A Reserve Bank economist, listening to this speech, might well argue that the problems of the United States illustrate the reasons for the independence of the Reserve Bank, in that the excessively generous fiscal policies, particularly towards the United States military-industrial establishment, led to the problem. However, if the Reagan Administration had been responsible for both arms of policy there would have been greater pressure on it to be more sceptical of the excessive claims for increased United States military expenditure. In any case, a structure which provides a sound basis for consistency in policy is better than one which generally tends to lead to conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian system is much better than the one in the United States but it still leaves a residue of concern about the potential for conflict. This issue may need to be addressed again one day. In the meantime, the strengthening of the regulatory basis for prudential supervision, which this Bill involves, is to be warmly welcomed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise, as have a number of Government members, to support the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill. The purpose of this Bill is to establish formal prudential supervision of the banks by the Reserve Bank, to abolish the distinction between trading and savings banks and, lastly, to abolish the statutory reserve deposit scheme. I believe that these reforms put forward by the Government have been long overdue. With respect to the prudential supervision of banks by the Reserve Bank, this has mostly been done by cooperation between the banks and the Reserve Bank, but this Government is formalising that system by legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What do we mean by `prudential supervision'? The prudential requirements observed by banks in Australia, like those applying in other developed countries, relate to matters such as the adequacy of capital, the structure of assets and liabilities, the management of exposures to risk, the capacity of directors and senior management, and the representation of shareholders by directors. There is very little difference these days between savings and trading banks, so that distinction is being abolished. They do not have the separate managerial structures that they used to have. In fact, maintenance of the distinction actually distorted banking patterns. Banks often relied on getting their money through commercial bills and offshore borrowings. The statutory reserve deposit requirement which I mentioned had that distorting effect. </PARA>
<PARA> My interest in banks is not limited to this piece of legislation. I noticed that the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) in his contribution dwelt on the role of the banking system and commented in particular on the national debt. He suggested that the current level of national debt was a matter of real concern. I want to expose some of the flaws in his logic. It must be said that the national debt of the Federal Government is diminishing; it is not increasing. The overseas borrowing component of Federal Government debt is more than offset by reserves. The honourable member for Berowra used the good old example of ordinary householders borrowing more than they can repay. We must make two points about the Federal Government: firstly, its debt is diminishing and, secondly, the level of debt is more than matched by the level of its reserves. Also, more than 60 per cent of overseas borrowings are by private companies, not the Government. The honourable member for Berowra said that there ought to be more deregulation but he is very upset about the level of overseas borrowings by private companies. I happen to share that concern but I think there is a gross inconsistency in his position. He says, `This Government hasn't gone far enough in deregulation; but we need to re-regulate this part of private sector operations'. Of course, he did not mention that we are now getting a dividend stream from overseas of about $2.6 billion a year. That did not exist in years gone by. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some room for concern on the national debt. But members of the public ought to be aware that the prime cause is not profligacy by this Federal Government or irresponsible management of the public purse; its debt is diminishing. The private sector is responsible for the majority of overseas borrowings. Hopefully, without wanting to reflect on any Appropriation Bill, the level of superannuation savings generated by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and proposed to be increased may make it even more attractive for companies to borrow domestically rather than overseas and thus increase the debt. The banking system has been exposed to a great deal of deregulation and this Banking Legislation Amendment Bill reflects a minor part of that. By and large, it has worked well for Australia. A lot of people forget that, in terms of generating well over 1.2 million jobs in the economy, deregulation of the financial market and the banking system was a prerequisite, but, like any move, it ought to be subject to review. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, whilst we are putting formally into place the prudential supervision of the banks, no-one seems to be speaking up on behalf of the banking customer-the ordinary mums, dads and children of Australia who bank with the banks. I am very keen to see a joint parliamentary select committee review those organisations, such as the banks, that offer consumer banking facilities. Building societies and credit unions would have to be included in the review because these days they operate very much like banks. That review could be done from a consumer perspective. Let me outline some of the reasons why I think we ought to have that review. I have already said that, when we implement something like massive deregulation, it is only appropriate that we review the results of it so that there is accountability and responsibility. I say in fairness to the Australian Bankers Association that it does not object to this scrutiny. I hope the Government will grasp the nettle in regard to this review. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the issue of housing interest rates. Quite a number of banks are offering new home buyers interest rates at 17 per cent, but at least one Victorian building society is able to offer those same householders an interest rate of 14.5 per cent. About a month ago, Citibank Ltd offered new home buyers a fixed term loan at 15.5 per cent. A month later it dropped that rate to 14.9 per cent. Citibank is not one of the four major players but it is doing this and its customers are benefiting. I am in favour of a five-year fixed term loan because in the first five years of home ownership home owners are most vulnerable and most exposed to any upward fluctuations in interest rates. Over the course of that five years it may cost home owners a little more to have a fixed interest loan, but they would prefer the certainty of that fixed interest rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Citibank has been criticised. It has been suggested that it is out after market share. Indeed it may be, and good luck to it. I think the move by Citibank is predicated on two things: one is a belief that interest rates will fall. I think that view is even shared by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock). Secondly, maybe the banks are making just a little too much profit out of home owners, particularly new home owners. I think there is a very good case for that too. In fact, I would like to see a committee investigate that and see whether the major banks should be getting into the fixed five-year term home loan for new home owners. I quote from the Daily Mirror:</PARA>
<PARA> Mortgage rates `can be cut to 14 per cent'</PARA>
<PARA>Australian banks could afford to cut mortgage interest rates down to 14 per cent, according to figures in a new confidential report. </PARA>
<PARA> The report, by stockbrokers McIntosh Hamson Hoare Govett, shows the bigger banks reaping double the profit margins of their foreign competitors while maintaining mortgage interest rates at record high levels. </PARA>
<PARA>Maybe that is just an irresponsible report. That is the question. But are the banks making exorbitant profits by penalising their ordinary customers? The banks acknowledge that there are cross-subsidies within the banking system. In whose direction do the cross-subsidies work? Are ordinary bank customers subsidising corporate accounts? Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be aware that the larger the corporate account the better the discount and that there is quite some competition for it. But what happens to the ordinary customers? Are they reaping the benefits of that competition?</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, quite a significant number of new banking products have been put on to the market and offered to people by the banks. I welcome that. Once again the question is: Does the ordinary customer really understand the benefits about each package? Have the banks really gone out to explain what they are offering? If a survey were undertaken in the electorate of Grayndler, would the banking customers of Grayndler really understand the different products? I hazard a suggestion that the answer is no. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, indeed. It could very well be in Chifley. The point is not that there is something untoward in that situation, but it may be a legitimate criticism that the banks have not gone far enough. Honourable members of this House would be aware that the banks propose to set up an independent ombudsman. It will be a voluntary system which the banks will fund, but it will be based on the United Kingdom model. The rub is that the United Kingdom model has been subject to extensive review by Professor Jack on behalf of the Thatcher Government, which is hardly the most radical government, on my side of politics anyway. The Jack report said that a self-funded, voluntary system is hopelessly inadequate and that the powers of the Ombudsman are inadequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may work in Australia, but we need to see in what way this independent ombudsman is going to protect customers. We ought to review the situation and form an opinion about it. We may say that this has been a good move. I want to thank the Australian Bankers Association for at least taking that step. But is this good enough for Australian banking customers? Will it serve Australia and Australian customers? I cannot answer that question. Reading the Jack report, the answer is definitely not, but it may have information that has not been made available to me, and it may work. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of automatic tellers and dispute resolution of the problems with automatic tellers, the banks make the quite legitimate point that, given the number of transactions, the number of complaints is very low. But I know personally of many complaints of customers. There has been an inadequate dispute resolution process. That is the good work that I think an inquiry should do. I do not think the inquiry should predetermine the outcome, but I think that the situation is ripe to protect Australian banking customers, whether they are banking with the banks, building societies or credit unions. Let us have a review from a customer perspective and then set down the groundwork for the system into the 1990s so that, with all the changes that have been accomplished, we in this House can at least have the satisfaction of knowing that these changes are definitely working in the interests of the customers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise today to speak on the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill. It affords me the opportunity of making some comments of an institution which, for generations, has had a very privileged position within our community. It is quite interesting that the majority of speakers on this Bill are Australian Labor Party members. It shows that we have a concern for the bank depositors. The Liberal-National Party Opposition-of course everyone knows its interest in banking-wants to remove the 13.5 per cent ceiling which the Government has forced the banks to retain. If it were to be removed, approximately 1.3 million people from all walks of life would be affected. If the Liberals ever got into power it is quite frightening to think what would happen to Australian families through the Liberals' manipulation of the banking industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me start with a definition of a bank. It is an institution offering certain financial services such as safekeeping of money and lending of money at interest. I thought that was a very interesting definition. Banks are certainly practising what they preach and what they have a charter to do. But are they making a bit too much? Are they providing a service to the public or just putting their profits before people? Some years ago the banking industry was deregulated or freed up so that overseas banks could come into Australia and create a bit of competition. It was assumed that services to the customers would improve, that competition would come about and that interest rates would drop. I suppose these things have happened. There is bigger competition now to see who can make the biggest profit. I suppose the banks are having a bit of a competition over customer service to see who can give the least service and make the customer wait the longest by closing down the branches in the various suburbs. On interest rates, I suppose the banks are seeing who can squeeze the most out of their customers without their really knowing. If honourable members have already picked up a hint of cynicism regarding banks, they are spot on. I have always believed that any organisation that receives your money and gives, say, 3.75 per cent to 5 per cent interest and then lends at 17 per cent to 22 per cent has a lot to answer for. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at some of the 1988 profits of the big four banks. The Westpac Banking Corporation's profit was $594m; National Australia Bank Ltd, $531m; the Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation (ANZ), $535m; and the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, $313m. I also read a few headlines in relation to bank profits. One headline reads: `ANZ boosts dividend 188pc on $505m profit'. The article in part reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Directors have rewarded shareholders with a 188 per cent increase in dividend in response to higher profitability and the introduction of dividend imputation. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANZ Bank is one of the top 15 players in relation to offshore tax havens. It puts its money offshore and does not pay any tax on it in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> A headline reading `ANZ lifts profits by 60pc' outlines the half yearly results to March 1989. Another headline reads, `Three big firms head tax haven lists'. This is an interesting article because it shows not only that the ANZ Bank is amongst the top 15 in the list but also that some of our biggest companies in Australia are using the banking system to shift profits offshore, make money offshore and not pay tax. At the top of the tax haven list are News Corporation, Bond Corporation, Elders-IXL Ltd and so on. A further headline reads `ANZ pays $6m to push Dalgety stake to 25 pc'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> ANZ has lifted its stake in Australia's second biggest pastoral house, Dalgety Farmers by four per cent to 25 per cent following recent share purchases. It paid more than $6 million for the parcel. </PARA>
<PARA>This could be a trend in banking as banks gradually move into those areas-Dalgety is probably one of ANZ's customers-and take over large companies that make good profits. Under the headline `NAB streaks away with $1bn profit performance' the article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> National Australia Bank yesterday became the first Australian bank to breach the $1 billion profit mark when it reported gross earnings of $1.01 billion for the year to September 30, a jump of 66.8 per cent over 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note who is one of the National Australia Bank's biggest shareholders. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> From its final dividend payout, which represents an annual dividend of 50c a share, the bank's largest shareholder with 12.8 per cent, Adelaide Steamship Co.'s Mr John Spalvins will stand to receive $32.9 million in tax free cash and scrip. </PARA>
<PARA>The name `Mr John Spalvins' rang a bell. I went back to my files and dug out this article from Australian Business dated 9 May 1984:</PARA>
<PARA> Adelaide Steamship, linchpin in a group of companies stitched together by John Spalvins, provides the least amount for tax of any tax-paying company in the Statex study. Its rate: a measly 0.11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>That is 0.11c in the dollar. Mr Spalvins is a tax winner. An article headed `NAB payout up as profit soars 52pc to $480m' and `NAB scorches ahead 62 p.c.' reads:</PARA>
<PARA> A buoyant year of interest income growth has catapulted the National Australia Bank past the $1 billion pre-tax profit level . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On the same page of the Melbourne Sun there is a heading which reads `Home rates could go higher'. The Managing Director, Mr Nobby Clark, said:</PARA>
<PARA> If one looked at the pure numbers, one would say that we are probably getting to the stage where some further assessment would be required. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, interest rates should go up. One must remember that, as the Managing Director of the National Australia Bank, Mr Nobby Clark's salary is a measly $420,000 per annum, or about $8,000 per week. He has the cheek to say that his customers should pay higher interest rates! It is unbelievable what these banks put over us. We sit here mildly and meekly and say nothing about it. Another headline reads `NAB tops Westpac's profit' with a sub-heading `Nobby Clark hits back over mortgage criticism'. I could go on and on, reading headline after headline, about the amount of money that these banks have made and what they are giving back to their customers. We see the headlines, `Westpac zooms to $693m profit', `Banks to show profit bonanza continues', `Banks big profit rise' and `Commonwealth lifts profit 38 pc'. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of saying good things about the banks such as how much profit they have made and what a good job they are doing for their shareholders, I would like to say a few nasty things that the banks may not like, such as advertising how much profit they have made. It is important that the general public is aware of what our banks are doing, what sort of service we are getting and what we can expect from them. I know that I will probably never get a loan from them after this speech but that does not particularly worry me. What about the report of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct? An article tucked away in a little part of a paper states that Mr Fitzgerald has criticised the banks. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> But Mr Fitzgerald reserves special criticism for the Australian Bankers Association and major State branches which had ``declined to cooperate'' with the Commission's investigation of false accounts used to conceal profits from crime. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from a question of amnesties for staff who might expose their own and their . . . bank accounts placed them at a disadvantage with building societies. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a little article of 4 July tucked away under the heading `Organised crime'. I do not know whether there is an omen there when it talks about organised crime and banks. However, it is about time, as the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) stated, that we had a close look at the banks to see exactly what they are doing to this country and to their customers. In the Melbourne Herald of 4 August 1989 there was a headline which reads `Banks ``can cut interest rates'' '. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's major banks could substantially cut interest rates and still make big profits, figures contained in a report released in the United States indicate. </PARA>
<PARA> Based on the figures, it would appear the National Australia Bank, Westpac and the ANZ could afford to cut mortgage rates by up to three per cent. Other interest rates could be cut accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The report, by Australia's biggest stockbroker, shows Australian banks have become among the most profitable in the world because they operate on much higher margins than banks in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In May, when the banks announced half-yearly profit increases of up to 60 per cent, they said mortgage interest rates had to stay high because of the Hawke Government's tight monetary policies. </PARA>
<PARA> It would now appear the policies of the banks also play a big part in keeping interest rates high. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course it does, and everyone knows it. How can we get the banks to change? I do not suppose that we could go as far as Jack Lang tried to go years ago. It might give them a bit of a shock now and again if they were reminded of what happened then. He was put out of government. It was something that upset the banks a bit. I believe that we should look at the banks closely and there should be an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Another headline tucked away in the financial section at the back of the paper, which no-one ever reads, states `Banks' binge behind debt blow-out'. It is an interesting headline. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA>A $3 billion foreign borrowing splurge by Australian banks-to finance the housing boom-appears to have been the main factor pushing Australia's foreign debt over the $100 billion mark in March. </PARA>
<PARA>All the time we hear that we have this huge overseas debt but the banks keep their debt and their borrowings tucked away very quietly. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Banks owed $22.19 billion to foreign lenders at the end of the March quarter of this year, 24 per cent of Australia's debt-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, 24 per cent of Australia's debt is owed by the banks-</PARA>
<PARA>according to figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>How many people know that? Not many. It is hidden away. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Net debt, excluding reserve assets and overseas lending, stood at $103.9 billion at the end of March. </PARA>
<PARA> Bankers were at a loss yesterday to explain the big plunge into overseas debt markets as there have not been any big ``one-off'' transactions. </PARA>
<PARA>They are at a loss to explain; they do not want to explain it. They are borrowing money overseas at low interest rates of 3, 4 or 5 per cent, they come back here and lend it to us at rates of 17, 18 or 20 per cent, and say nothing about it. They are increasing our foreign debt and making big profits for themselves. One of the areas in which they are lending this money is in the credit area. One of the biggest problems we have in overseas debt is in plastic cards. Bankcard and Visa card contribute to half of our problems. The banks are borrowing money from overseas, lending it to us at a higher rate and we are buying overseas goods in rapid numbers. We are buying television sets, new cars, video recorders and whatever else we can get on these credit cards. The banks are increasing the amount of credit they will give us. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give a few facts and figures about Bankcard in particular. There are now eight million credit cards on issue, which averages out at one card for every two Australians. This excludes the specialised cards such as those that operate in department stores. It also excludes the charge cards: Diners Club and American Express. The amount people have chalked up on cards has escalated quite dramatically. Ten years ago Australians using bank credit cards owed $776m. By December of last year this had soared by more than 350 per cent to $3.6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Spectacular though this increase was, it was exceeded only by the amount the banks were prepared to lend to their plastic carded customers. The limits on these cards grew from $2.1 billion in 1979 to $13.4 billion in 1988, an increase of more than 520 per cent. My Visa card credit limit was increased automatically. I did not ask for it to be increased. It was increased from $1,500 to $3,000. I can go out and borrow $3,000 now and pay it back at an interest rate of about 20 per cent. Most banks now charge about 22 per cent interest on Bankcard. This is due to go higher in the next few months. These are some of the things that are happening and some of the reasons we should be looking very closely at banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Summing up, we should have a look at whether the banks can afford to charge less and to cut interest rates. In the year ended 30 September 1988 Westpac had an increase in profits of about 49 per cent. In the half year to 31 March 1989 it had an increase in profits of 63 per cent. The National Australia Bank had a profit increase of 62 per cent in the year ended 30 September 1988, and in the half year to 31 March 1989 a 52 per cent increase. The ANZ Bank had an increase in profits in the year ended 30 September 1988 of about 62 per cent and in the half year to 31 March 1989 an increase of 60 per cent. In the year ended 30 September 1988 the banks on average paid 40 per cent of net profits to shareholders by way of dividends. As at 30 September 1988 this had increased to 80 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The banks are selling off all their premises. They are selling off their shop fronts all over the countryside and then they are leasing them back. The banks get a tax advantage from that. That is a pretty smart move, one might say. But why should we help the banks increase their profits? I have already mentioned the Fitzgerald report, which I can assure honourable members criticises the banks very strongly. The ANZ Bank, in particular, has been listed as being one of the top 15 companies that use tax havens. Maybe we should look at a couple of solutions. Maybe we should look at freezing plastic money transactions for a set period, with the exception of those by international visitors to this country and also with the exception of electronic funds transfers. This would possibly assist in returning the country to a cash based society rather than the debt based society that it has become. Maybe we should look at placing tighter controls on financial overseas borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give a good example of how the banks are ripping off the people. I went to my bank on a Friday afternoon some months ago and paid $1,000 off my Bankcard and another $1,000 off my Visa card-I just happened to get my pay at the time. Those amounts were debited to my bank account on that Friday. Bang! No worries! The bank took it out of my account and put it somewhere else. But when I looked at the Bankcard and Visa card statements I received, it showed that the money was not paid until the following Wednesday. So the bank had the money on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. It is quite easy for banks to set up a computer program so that, when anyone pays $1,000 on a Bankcard or Visa card, the money goes into a special account. Those funds get placed on the short-term money market and, bingo, the banks make a lot of money. These are the sorts of things the banks are doing. </PARA>

We have plenty of union bureaucrats in this place and we know them all. We hear their squeals every time one of their union bureaucrat mates gets pushed around. The Australian Labor Party does not represent the working class in this place. We have plenty of proof of that with 17 per cent housing interest rates. Let us get that straight. The Government wants us to say what we will do about the 13 1/2 per cent interest rate-but we will not. But its members do not want to stand up in this place and say that it is the Government's policy-not the banks' policy-that puts 17 per cent and 25 per cent interest rates on ordinary Australians. That is the Government's policy. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) stood up last night and said, `There is nothing I can do about it. It will stay that way. But continue to love me, please'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am saying to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that the honourable member for Dunkley is relying on the good old Goebbels principle: if he says it often enough, someone will eventually believe it. Let us get down to the written word because there has been quite a bit of discussion in recent times on this particular issue. I issued a press release on 27 June 1989 which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Shadow Minister for Housing, Wilson Tuckey, said today that the removal of the 13.5 percent home loan ceiling, which is applicable to about 30 percent of the monetary value of the housing loan commitments of financial institutions (approx. 17.3bn of the total $57.6bn-Reserve Bank figures March 1989) is not on the Coalition agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>We are not even giving the matter consideration, let alone making any commitment. That is what I said. That is on the record and we do not need Government members practising what Goebbels taught some of their mates in times gone by. If Government members want to continue their Goebbels practices, if they want to stand up and say `There are no policies in the Liberal Party' let me remind them that 27 have been published and one of them has the bureaucratic union mates of the Australian Labor Party terrified. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister at the table, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), discovers our policies when he thinks he can criticise them. The next day he stands up in this Parliament and says that they do not exist. Have your pick! Either we do not have policies and therefore people have nothing to worry about, or we have policies. The point is that the Minister wants to have his cake and eat it too. I will say to him, `Goebbels, Goebbels, Goebbels' every time he comes up with this sort of ploy. It is outrageous. It is wrong. </PARA>

I am not standing here as a defender of financial institutions but let us get one thing straight: banks deal with money in the same way as Coles and Woolworths deal with baked beans. They buy at a price and they sell at a price.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another misrepresentation in the honourable member's speech was the suggestion that the banks can borrow money at 4 per cent. In general, Japanese businessmen can borrow at 4 per cent in yen, but nobody in the world will lend money to an Australian bank at 4 per cent. We are charged interest rates as a nation, and under the economic management of the Labor Government our credit rating has gone right out the window. We have no national credit rating. We are just waiting for Moody's Investors Service Inc. to pass judgment on that again. It is the economic management of honourable members opposite that has done it. If honourable members opposite were to check the assets of the banking industry which, in effect, are their loans, they would find that those assets total between $270 billion and $280 billion. If that $280 billion in assets is divided by the profits of the banking industry, it will be seen that it could not reduce interest rates by even one per cent, even if the industry gave back every penny it made. How then could the honourable member for Dunkley come to some of his conclusions? His speech would make great reading for members of his electorate, who could say that their member was battling for them. If the honourable member wants to do any good for his electorate, he should convince the Treasurer to do something for people who own homes. There was nothing in the Budget announced yesterday to help home owners, the people who put their faith in honourable members opposite and voted for them once. They will not do it again. </PARA>

His callous disregard of people who are buying their homes is outrageous. The Labor Government's interest rate policy is the problem. The Government is laying down the rules. If the Treasurer had half an ounce of brain, he might ring up the Treasurers of some other countries and ask them how they can have economic growth equal to that of Australia and interest rates a quarter of those in Australia. The economic growth in Japan, the United Kingdom and America is roughly the same as that in Australia. The interest rates are half ours or even lower; yet honourable members opposite want to blame the banks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other great strategy of the Labor Party is to say that it is never its fault but always somebody else's. I am waiting for honourable members opposite to pick on Billy Hughes; he was a Liberal and the only one I can find who has not yet been criticised by honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Dunkley stood up here today and blamed the banks. It is the Labor Government's economic policy that has created the problem that is hurting Australia.

I might add that some of the lobby groups that would like to see the ceiling removed would not be too pleased with our stance, but they got it straight. The Liberal Party will not consider changing that ceiling. Our policy is to get interest rates down so that everybody enjoys a better interest rate, and not having to jack up the interest rates of those with a small privilege at present.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. To return to the subject matter before the House, I was responding to some of the comments by the honourable member for O'Connor. I simply want to make this point: the Budget the Government released last night contains a set of economic statistics which, although certainly not perfect, are immeasurably superior to the economic environment which the Government inherited in 1983. In 1982-83 under the previous Liberal Government interest rates were 23 per cent. The trade deficit as a proportion of gross domestic product was no lower than it is today. We had double digit inflation. We had double digit unemployment. Far from having a Budget surplus of $9.1 billion, such as the Government announced last night-the largest surplus ever in Australia's history-we had a $9.6 billion deficit. So there has been a dramatic turnaround in the Australian economy in the six years in which this Government has been in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tax levels in the Budget announced last night, at 26.2 per cent of gross domestic product, are identical to the proportions which existed in 1981-82 and 1982-83 under the previous Liberal Government. We have turned around a prospective $9.6 billion deficit in 1983 from the Liberals to a $9 billion surplus. We have done it through better government, smaller government, and proper targeting of government programs. We have achieved it without any real increase in overall taxation levels. I just say that in response to the honourable member for O'Connor because he came into the House with a housing policy. He said that the Opposition was committed to maintaining the ceiling of 13.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> What is really at issue in this debate is the Opposition's tax policy. For the last year, since August 1988, I have waited for the tax policy promised for release at that time by the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), to be released. It is now August 1989, some 12 months later; we still have not seen the tax and macro-economic policy of the Opposition parties. It is cant and hypocrisy for people to come into the House and say that they will bring down interest rates through their policies but then not elaborate on what those policies are. In fairness to the Parliament and the Australian people, it is incumbent on the Opposition parties to release that policy as soon as possible so that the public and the markets can make a judgment as to whether interest rates would come down. Interest rates are important because we are discussing a Bill in relation to banking, savings and trading banks, and so on. It is impossible to talk on a banking legislation Bill without bringing into the debate these questions of overall savings levels and macro-economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a few points in this debate about the question of savings levels in Australia. There is a need-and the Government recognises it-to increase private and aggregate savings levels in the Australian economy. In recent weeks there has been considerable interest in the issue of one alleged way to increase national savings through inflation adjusting the tax system. Comprehensive inflation adjustment involves changing the tax treatment of monetary assets and liabilities, stocks, capital gains and the depreciation arrangements for physical assets. In recent weeks we have seen a proposal-released, to be fair, only in broad form-by the Opposition parties which has focused on a partial inflation adjustment system. The key features of that system, as we can gather them from newspaper reports, are that the Opposition has proposed a reduction in tax deductions for interest expense, but with some provisos-with the grandfathering of existing borrowings, a reduction in the taxable proportion of interest receipts from banks and building societies, and possibly some form of phasing in of the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate, which concerns banking and savings, pursuing either a partial or comprehensive inflation adjustment scheme in my view would have disastrous implications for the Australian economy and would do nothing to lift either private or aggregate savings levels across the Australian economy. There are flaws in this inflation adjustment proposal. In academic circles a comprehensive inflation adjustment proposal is seen to have some merit but I believe that a partial inflation adjustment proposal is seriously flawed indeed. I will explain why I think that is so. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, such a proposal is somewhat lopsided. If one inflation adjusts certain interest but not stocks or depreciation, one will ensure that there are lopsided and erratic effects on the Australian economy. If one adjusted interest but not stocks or depreciation, the assets side of the balance sheet of Australian business would be taxed without inflation adjustment but the liabilities would be inflation adjusted. To adjust only interest rates, while leaving stocks and depreciation unaffected, would represent a major tax burden on business investments. </PARA>
<PARA> The second flaw in the proposal is that it would fail to recognise Australia's place in the international economy. Two things have become certain in the decade of the 1980s. One is that, in the decade of the 747, people travel much more widely all around the world; so there is a much greater movement of people around the world. The other phenomenon is economic-that, increasingly, economies have become integrated into a world economic system. Australia is not insulated from the rest of the world; we are very much part of the international economy. If partial inflation adjustment occurred in Australia this country would be throwing its lot in with a few of the high-inflation countries in the Third World which have so far experimented with these systems. A country such as Australia, which is exposed to international finance markets, cannot sustain a tax system which is dramatically out of line with those of our major competitors. The Hawke Government has achieved a great deal to move our tax system far closer to those applying in the major countries with which we do business. Even more importantly, if we could sustain such a position in the long run we would have to suffer the enormous costs of adjusting to that position. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an international commercial reality that companies combine equity funds with borrowings in order to maximise their returns for shareholders. In every developed country except Australia they would be able to get full deductions for interest on their borrowings. If only interest were adjusted, our taxes on business investments would be considerably higher than elsewhere in the world. That would have some implications. In many cases then shareholders would prefer to make their next investment overseas rather than in Australia, so more Australian equity would flow out of Australia and less foreign capital would flow into Australia. The sudden fall in the attraction of capital inflow and that increased incentive for capital outflow would cause a sharp drop in the value of the Australian dollar. It would in that sense increase inflation and probably bring about a decline in investment. Ironically, all of those repercussions probably would produce a depressed Australian economy. There would be a sudden shock in the Australian economy and the net effect, possibly and ironically, would be a drop in national savings-and certainly not an increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I want to make about this partial inflation adjustment proposal is that it would increase tax on certain forms of savings. The Opposition has indicated that, in floating this inflation adjustment proposal, it is motivated by a desire to increase savings levels. That is a worthwhile and commendable objective, but it is important that total national savings rise and not just savings of one kind at the expense of another. The Opposition proposal involves a reduction in the tax on saving and an increase in the tax on borrowing, as explained by the Leader of the Opposition. That explanation seems to stem from a basic misunderstanding. The Opposition's proposal involves a redistribution of taxes on savings and not any reduction in taxes on savings. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be understood that savings in Australia, if we analyse them, are undertaken by business and government as well as by households. A very large part of Australia's savings comprises the equity investments of Australians in large and small businesses and farms. The return on those savings in business is increased by the ability of businesses to borrow. It is a nonsense to claim, as some people have, that business savings would not fall because borrowed funds would be replaced by equity capital. If the tax on business is increased, the return on business savings is reduced and there will be less of it. If we look at the proposal from an economy-wide viewpoint, inflation adjustment of interest does not necessarily have much net effect on aggregate savings. The proposal would change the pattern of savings and may change the relative returns of different activities in the economy but would not necessarily increase total savings. Worst of all, if it were badly designed, the proposal could reduce overall national savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth flaw in the proposal is extremely relevant to the Bill before the House. It concerns the distortions that a partial inflation adjustment proposal would introduce in the Australian economy. The Opposition has floated a proposal that only some types of interest and some classes of debt would be inflation adjusted. But, as with anything of an economic nature, if one picks and chooses one creates distortion. There will be some winners and some losers. I think it is fair to say that in the proposal the Opposition has put up there would be massive distortions in savings patterns across the Australian economy. For example, the Opposition has said that it would inflation adjust interest only on bank and building society accounts and building society deposits. If we examine that proposition we see that it would seriously bias the tax system. For example, households would find it less advantageous to invest in shares, equity trusts, credit unions, friendly societies, life offices, unit trusts, cash management trusts and State and Commonwealth bonds and debentures. Even family borrowing arrangements, which are common among small businesses, no longer would be viable and the relative advantages of superannuation savings also would be eroded. Over time these changes would tend to break down longer term savings arrangements in favour of short term bank deposits, making the savings systems markedly less efficient than they are today. The banks would be the big winners because their competition would be weakened. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other implications of this proposal is that it would create some winners and some losers amongst households in the Australian community. For instance, when looking at the question of partial inflation adjustment for money in banks and building societies one needs to look at who would be the main beneficiaries of that plan. Obviously, people with the greatest amount of money in the banks would stand to gain the most. The well-off would get the maximum benefit from this proposal which has been put up by the Leader of the Opposition. Figures provided by the Australian Taxation Office, for instance, show that of the total cost to revenue of the Opposition's proposal 50 per cent would go to 20 per cent of taxpayers at the very top of the income scale. Looking at it another way, the Australian Taxation Office statistics show that taxpayers on $100,000 a year or more typically declare sufficient interest to benefit from the Opposition's proposal by around $90 a week. Someone on $100,000 a year, with savings in a bank or building society, would be better off by around $90 a week. However, taxpayers in the $20,000 to $30,000 bracket, which is where most taxpayers are in Australia, typically declare sufficient interest in their bank accounts to benefit by only $4 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, under the partial inflation adjustment proposal, as explained by the Leader of the Opposition, by providing a tax break to people with money in banks and building societies, the beneficiaries will be the very wealthy in the Australian community-people on an income of $100,000 a year or more. Under the proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition one will get $90 a week if one earns more than $100,000 a year, and $4 week if one is only an average income earner. For that reason alone this proposition is badly flawed. The banking system as a whole, for reasons which I do not have time to go into in detail, would also be a major beneficiary of the plan put up by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other flaws in this proposal. There would be a heavy burden on many small business people-farmers, small businesses and investors. The grandfathering is impossible to implement. There are problems of rolling over loans. How will it be decided whether a loan is an old loan or a new loan? There are problems with gearing levels between different firms. Of course, there are massive opportunities, in a partial inflation adjustment proposal, for tax avoidance on a grand scale probably, similar to the level that occurred in Australia in the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I want to say this about savings: obviously national savings are the difference between the value of what Australia produces-its national income-and what Australians spend. Households save, obviously, if they receive more income than they spend. Businesses save if they receive more from their sales than they pay out in expenses, wages and dividends. Governments save if they take more in revenue than they spend on outlays. There is a big difference between national savings and a simple bank account. To focus, as the Opposition has done, on a program to improve national savings simply by looking at bank accounts is a very badly flawed proposition indeed. In last night's Budget the Government announced massive changes to retirement incomes policy and superannuation in Australia. In time we will achieve considerable-indeed, massive-increases in aggregate and private savings levels in Australia. We will achieve that responsibly and sensibly through encouraging and providing incentives for people to save in the form of superannuation, and at the same time we will be providing individuals with the benefit through a better retirement income level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I would like to thank those honourable members who participated in this rather broad ranging debate both in the earlier session and this morning. The Government welcomes the support which the Opposition has given to the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill during the debate, but there are a few points upon which I would like to comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the removal of the distinction between trading and savings banks, the Government is aware of the wish on the part of the banks concerned for a further legislative provision to directly facilitate the integration of trading and savings banks. As I indicated in my second reading speech the Government is considering the possibility of further legislative action for this purpose. On the subject of re-regulation of the banking sector, I note there has been a suggestion that the proposed amendment to the Banking Act to introduce a power for the prudential regulation of banks could amount to re-regulation of the banking sector by the back door. The Government considers that any suggestion along these lines is quite unwarranted. Supervision of banks is directed at the protection of depositors and the stability of the financial system. The pre-1980s banking regulations involved determining the terms and conditions under which banks could borrow and lend funds. It is clear from a reading of the Bill that the new powers are confined to prudential matters which are defined in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed changes are intended essentially to give a clearer statutory basis for the arrangement for the prudential supervision of banks which have long operated on an informal basis. Given the increased number of banks now operating in Australia and the more dynamic market environment in which banks now compete, it is desirable that there should be a clear statutory basis for the Reserve Bank of Australia to supervise banks. At the same time it is envisaged that the Reserve Bank's supervision will continue to operate through informal consultation and cooperation, since that approach has so far worked well. The new powers will be kept in reserve to be used only as necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been concern expressed regarding the provision in clause 16 of the Bill which provides a power for the Reserve Bank to conduct investigations into specified prudential matters relating to a bank. The Government does not believe that the proposed new clause should give rise to concern. To put this question in perspective it is worth noting that powers to conduct investigations into the affairs of a bank or seek information from it are currently available under sections 61 and 62 of the Banking Act. Only two changes would be made by the Bill in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the power of investigation will be vested in the Reserve Bank rather than with the Auditor-General. It is logical that this power should be vested in the same institution which has the responsibility for the prudential supervision of banks. Secondly, the Bill will enable the Reserve Bank to obtain information about the affairs of an individual customer. However, I want to emphasise that this will be permitted only if the affairs of the individual customer are relevant to the prudential standing of the bank. In practice, this power is likely to be used when the exposure of a bank to an individual customer is significant in relation to the bank's capital. Exposures of this magnitude would usually be incurred in relation to corporate institutions rather than individuals. It is necessary that the Reserve Bank have access to such information because, in order to discharge properly its responsibilities in relation to the depositors in each bank and to the broader financial system, it may need to know the extent to which banks could potentially be affected by large credit exposures. I note that the Opposition shares this view. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not believe there is any reason for concern regarding the indiscriminate use of the Reserve Bank power as suggested by the Opposition. It is fundamental to the successful discharge of the supervisory duties of the Reserve Bank that it maintain close and constructive relationships with banking institutions. The Reserve Bank will have no reason to impair these relationships by making injudicious demands upon the banks. Both the officers and the agents of the Reserve Bank are required by regulations to protect the secrecy of information in the possession of the bank. We should recognise the exemplary record of the Reserve Bank over many years in protecting the information it has received in the course of its duties. Accordingly, the Government is confident that any information that the Reserve Bank may need to obtain for prudential purposes will be adequately protected. I thank those honourable members who have participated in the debate in the earlier session and this session, and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Clause 15, page 8, before proposed paragraph 51 (1) (a) insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(aa) requiring a bank to prepare, and to give to the Reserve Bank, accounts and financial statements;''. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Clause 15, page 8, line 8, insert ``accounts and financial statements are to be prepared and given or in which the'' after ``in which the''. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Clause 15, page 8, line 9, insert ``accounts, financial statements or'' before ``information''. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Clause 15, page 8, lines 12 and 13, omit ``such an obligation to give information'', substitute ``an obligation of the kind mentioned in paragraph (a)''. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments are intended to allow banks to prepare annual accounts in accordance with the requirements under the Banking Act rather than those established for companies generally by the Companies Code. Section 288 (3) of the Companies Code provides that if a bank is required to prepare accounts under a Commonwealth banking law and the accounts of the bank comply with that law, they are deemed to comply with the requirements of the Code. Banks are currently required by part VI of the Banking Act to prepare and deliver accounts to the Reserve Bank of Australia. The purpose of the new part VI proposed by clause 15 of the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill is to rationalise the arrangements for the collection of statistical information from banks and make them more flexible. To achieve this, proposed new section 51 provides for the Governor-General to make regulations specifying the information which banks would be required to submit to the Reserve Bank and the manner in which information would be submitted. However, proposed section 51 does not provide that banks may be required to prepare accounts. Unless amended, the new section may not have the effect that section 288 (3) of the Companies Code would apply to banks. The proposed amendment to clause 15 will ensure that the current position of banks in relation to section 288 (3) can be maintained through the regulations. I commend the amendments to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. If, as the Treasurer has stated, `every cent of the Commonwealth's $9 billion surplus will be used to pay back debt', how does the Prime Minister propose to fund the tax cuts in the wage-tax trade-off package he foreshadowed last week?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find the question almost incomprehensible. The simple facts are that, as far as the Government is concerned, we have taken the decision to create a surplus of $9.1 billion. As we said in April when we made the announcement, that will enable us to fund the tax cuts and still retain the thrust of the Budget to take that amount of money out of the spending capacity in the community. There is no question at all of the technical capacity of the Commonwealth to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Social Security aware of claims that the Government's retirement income policy, announced last night, does nothing for women? Given that the current labour force participation rate of women has reached historically high levels, could the Minister explain how the measures contained in the Government's retirement income policy will be of benefit to women in the work force?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="106" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is totally false to claim that the retirement income policy neglects women workers; in fact, their concerns are placed at the centre of our comprehensive and integrated retirement income policy. The measures developed by the Government will significantly increase women's superannuation coverage; implement arrangements that are more responsive to women's employment patterns; and improve the level of their superannuation benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Award based superannuation, initiated by the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, has extended superannuation to many women for the first time ever. The Government is committed to the further extension of award based superannuation and will consider the gradual introduction of a further 3 per cent. The Government will also change access to tax assisted personal superannuation to better reflect women's employment patterns. Women working as few as 10 hours a week or who are outside the paid work force for up to two years will be granted access to tax assisted superannuation from next July. Changes to superannuation reasonable benefit limits will also particularly assist women. These changes will allow funds to increase substantially reversionary benefits to widows and will base limits for tax assisted benefits on a worker's highest average salary in any three consecutive years rather than the final three years of employment.</PARA>
<PARA> Award based superannuation provides for full vesting and preservation to age 55 or later retirement. Many old schemes operating before the 1986 reforms have inadequate vesting and preservation arrangements. This particularly disadvantages women who stay for short periods with an employer or who leave and later re-enter the work force. These measures fully implement-I emphasise `fully implement'-the Government's commitments in the National Agenda for Women on retirement income matters. The age pension will remain for those who have not had adequate opportunities to save for retirement. As we know, 70 per cent of people who depend on the age pension are women. The Government has made a commitment not only to exceed 25 per cent of average weekly earnings but also, as conditions permit, to provide for further increases.</PARA>
<PARA> Women can also be confident that the Government will monitor the progress of women's participation in superannuation and labour market opportunities, particularly during the period from 1995, when improved vesting and preservation standards apply, before giving consideration to an increase in the age pension or service pension age for women.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Will the Minister for Community Services and Health inform honourable members whether the Government has taken steps to ensure that child-care remains within the reach of low income families?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="107" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BONYTHON" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity of saying that the honourable member for Phillip has been one of the Government members who have done much to develop the policy of child-care within the Government ranks. The theme of equity and affordability is central to the changes that have been made this year in the Budget as it relates to child-care. As all honourable members know, because they have experienced it in their own electorates, this Government has presided over a massive expansion of publicity funded child-care. Since we came to office we have more than doubled the number of places-from 46,000 to 114,000 today-and we are committed to another 30,000 over the next three years. A total of 8,200 will be in place by the end of this financial year, and the Budget provides for those extra places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, this year's Budget has concentrated on ensuring that child-care remains affordable to lower income families. Honourable members will recall that in 1984 this Government introduced fee relief for families in child-care centres, designed to benefit lower income families. This Budget announces that the Government intends for the first time to index this fee annually, so that the fee relief payments will be adjusted from now on each year. The fee relief ceilings for government funded child-care will rise to $92.50 for the long-day centres and to $68 for family day care schemes. Again, with the same point in mind, to make the system as equitable as possible we have decided to increase from $255 per week gross to $280 per week gross the threshold income at which users start to pay more than minimum fees. These initiatives will mean a rise of $7 per week per child in government assistance to families receiving that relief and that will be adjusted each year in line with inflation.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Budget also provides increases in operational subsidies for all kinds of government funded child-care, which includes occasional care centres, family day care schemes and long-day centres this year. Further, for the first time the Government has proposed a new fee relief scheme to assist lower income families making use of outside school hours care. We are approaching the States to cost-share this fee relief scheme in outside school hours care.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that these measures acknowledge the crucial role of child-care not only in our social policies but also in our economic policies and will extend the affordability of child-care to families in this country.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="108" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There seems to be a total misunderstanding of the Budget concept this year on the part of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition asked a question earlier about the tax cuts. The tax cuts are funded in this year's Budget. Were it not for the tax cuts, the Budget would not be $9.1 billion in surplus, it would be $14.6 billion. I then get a question from the shadow Treasurer asking what will be the effect of bracket creep over the course of the year, when the largest tax cut in our history is being funded from this year. So where the balance between collections and tax cuts finally lies, I am not certain. There is quite a clear commentary about some of these points in Budget Statement No. 2. The main point is that the tax share in gross domestic product this year will be the same as in the year when the last Government was in office; that is, in the last two years of the Budgets of the Fraser Government the revenue share in GDP was 26.2 per cent, which is the same as is forecast for this year. But instead of a Budget deficit of $9 billion plus which was bequeathed to this Government we have a surplus of $9 billion. There is a surplus of over 2 per cent of GDP on the same revenue share which the Opposition had when it was last in office. So how does that grab you?</PARA></TALK.START>

In view of the significance of the Australian live sheep trade to Saudi Arabia which is worth $130m per year-and I know my farmers in Ballarat are very concerned about this-can the Minister advise what steps the Government has taken to clarify quarantine issues raised by the Saudi Arabian Government in recent weeks?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. As honourable members would be aware, three shipments of live sheep to Saudi Arabia have been rejected by the Saudi authorities in recent weeks on the contention that bluetongue and sheep pox were present in some sheep. I stress that Australian authorities have been given no evidence that the sheep were in fact infected and, having regard to Australia's internationally accepted animal health status, we have not accepted the Saudi view. However, there is a clear need to ensure that the live sheep trade with Saudi Arabia is conducted on a stable, transparent basis. To that end the Government has been in close contact with Saudi Arabian Ministers and the Saudi Arabian Ambassador in Canberra. I have announced today that a high level delegation, to be headed by Dr Gardner Murray, an executive director of my Department, will shortly be leaving for Riyadh to hold discussions with the Saudi Arabian authorities. I should emphasise that the Government is concerned to ensure that an agreed means of handling any concerns which the Saudi Arabians may have about Australia's sheep disease status in future be established. The decision to send such a high level delegation to Saudi Arabia is supported by Australian sheep producers and export industry groups which met with my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Sydney yesterday. I would also like to assure the House that the Government is closely monitoring the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very interesting question from the Leader of the National Party of Australia as to the existence or absence of strategies, because he delivered a remarkable observation this morning when he was entering Parliament House.

He is telling the Australian people that the Opposition will not release its economic policies until the Prime Minister announces the election date. Have honourable members ever heard anything more politically irresponsible? I wonder whether that is the position of the Leader of the Opposition, because it is not what he has been saying, and it is not what the shadow Treasurer has been saying.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was just giving a nice introduction to the answer, Madam Speaker. It was a very relevant introduction. What I gently said about my good friend and soon-to-be colleague on this side of the House after the next election, whenever I announce it, was that Simon had not quite got it right. That is the case. We can have circumstances in which otherwise very erudite, learned, well-informed people can get it slightly wrong. My good friend Simon Crean, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, got it slightly wrong. In fact, the strategy of the Government is quite clear, in regard to both the question of inflation that he was particularly talking about, and lowering the current account deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Treasurer has had cause to say, we should not only look at the year-on-year average; it is very important in the financial year 1989-90 to look at what is happening through the course of the year. In regard to inflation, as I pointed out when commenting upon Simon Crean's observation, we expect that through the course of the year inflation will be trending down. Why do we say that? We can identify three specific reasons why that will be the case. Firstly, there will be, as we pointed out, a significant easing of demand pressures associated with the strategy of the Budget. In regard to the strategy of the Budget and reaction to the Budget, I make the observation that in the less than 24 hours that have transpired since the Treasurer delivered the Budget, two things have become clear. One is the responsibility and honesty of the Budget. The second thing that has emerged is the pathetic irrelevancy of the Opposition. The reaction is best summed up by what was said on AM this morning by a spokesperson for Shearson, Layman and Hutton, the United States firm.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, by way of a slight aside, to put it in context, on the two questions that Simon Crean talked about-that is, inflation and the current account situation-we expect through the year the inflation situation to improve. I said that that would be for three reasons. The first I have gone to, that is, the easing of demand. Secondly, the increased impetus to price movements resulting from the increase in the price of vegetables because of the floods in New South Wales will, if I can say so, wash out of the system this year. Thirdly, we believe that there will be a decline in house prices and, by the end of the year, a decline in mortgage interest rates. So there is a strategy; there is in operation a number of factors which will involve, through the year, a decline in the rate of inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the current account situation is concerned, I think it would be instructive if we looked at some of the figures that are contained in the papers associated with the Budget because that will give an indication of just what we expect to be happening during the year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1988-89 we had a 25 per cent increase in imports and a 3 per cent increase is projected for 1989-90. In 1988-89 there was a one per cent increase in exports and there is a projected increase of 7 1/2 per cent for 1989-90. That will involve a massive turnaround in net exports, which intrinsically is what Simon Crean was talking about and what the honourable gentleman has addressed his question to. We will have a turnaround of over 5 percentage points. In 1988-89 net exports contributed minus 4.4 per cent and they are expected to contribute three-quarters of a percentage point positive in 1989-90. So that is a turnaround of over 5 per cent, and that will be consistent with what the Treasurer and I have been talking about-that is, that we have been making the decisions in this country in a whole range of areas, including the mining industry, which have involved investment and which are now bringing into place projects which will have income and export streams starting this year and going on into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Specifically, if members of the Opposition want to talk about uranium, I have nothing more to say on that point than I have said before: that the policy of this Government has been properly arrived at. We have a three-mine policy and, under that policy, the existing producers are having difficulty getting adequate prices for their production. As you would know, Madam Speaker, the Labor Party is conducting an inquiry within its processes into the overall uranium policy. I will not pre-empt the findings of that inquiry but, in regard to the present situation, it would be manifestly absurd to suggest that to have any more uranium mines in this country would add to Australia's export potential.</PARA>

Last night the Treasurer announced a major restructuring of the interaction of the social security income test and taxation for age pensioners. Can the Minister inform the House of the basis of this reform, which will be achieved by 1995, and explain how it will improve retirement incomes for older Australians?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In some respects I think the difference between the Government and the Opposition on this issue is that we are interested in more than a question of attitude towards age pensioners or reform; we are interested in actually spelling out, in a clear-cut and fundamental way, what reform will mean in areas that are understood to be crucial, not only in terms of the work done by those responsible for reviewing the social security system but also in areas which are seen by people at the grassroots as being important issues for age pensioners today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have approached the question of reform in the relationship between the income test and the tax treatment of income in stages. In April this year we announced the first and extremely important stage. For all full rate pensioners the income test free area-$40 for single pensioners and $70 for married pensioners-will become tax free by July next year. Historically, for the first time we will ensure that there is identity of treatment for full rate pensioners, so that all full rate pensioners will no longer pay tax when that reform is completed in July next year. The Treasurer, in his statement, indicated a second stage in that reform. The Government will lock in the reform in terms of indexation. It will ensure from July 1991 that, henceforth, there will be no question of full rate pensioners paying tax and the value of that free area is to be maintained in real terms-an extraordinarily important reform. It is not a question of attitude or of saying `Somehow we will improve things'; it is a specific reform which will lock in the change announced in April this year, which I think gave pensioners a sense of credibility about this whole process.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Government has made it very clear that this business of reform will not be all over in a day or two, a month or two, or a year or two. This reform will be carried out over a period, and bringing about that change will not be costless. So, from July 1995 we will ensure that all pensioners are removed altogether from the taxation system. In terms of simplicity, we will achieve what has never been achieved before. In regard to any withdrawal rate, which effectively will be via social security, we will ensure that we do not exceed 50c in the dollar. The problem of effective marginal tax rates, often bleated about by the Opposition, will be resolved by this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> What do we get from Opposition members at this point in time? We get griping criticism about their having thought of it. There was nothing in the policy statement put out by the Opposition that went clearly to the mechanism that might be employed to achieve a solution to the problem of high effective marginal tax rates and a way of achieving the kind of positive incentives for retirement income savings which, over time, would enable a fundamental change in retirement income policy so that we get the right balance between the government pension and annuities or superannuation; a proper balance in terms of retirement income. This Government, more than any previous government, has shown that it can deal with the central issue that the population is ageing. In the next 40 years, as many people will be over the age of 65 as have moved into that age group in the last 80 years. All that additional cost can be sensibly resolved by a mechanism which will simplify, make more equitable and provide a positive long term direction. That is solid policy. What we have heard from the Opposition is emotional claptrap.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow Treasurer was banging this drum last night. Let me straighten him up on what it means. He is talking about a recession. He ought to know. He and the former Treasurer were the recession specialists. In 1982-83 they gave us the first negative growth for 30 years. As I have said in this House on a number of occasions, it takes an extra special talent to actually make an economy contract, but that is what the previous Government managed to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition was in office. Its members were around the corridors. They were around giving the advice. What we saw was less than zero. We had a contraction. That is what a recession is. We have got in here 2 3/4 per cent growth on average for the year, which is a respectable number by Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development standards. It is slower than last year, but not much slower. On the national accounts, last year's figure was 3.3; this is 2 3/4. That will imply some slowing over the course of the year, but it will not mean a recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The balance of payments figure today has no implication for growth in the economy. It only has the implication for demand conditions which obtained six or nine months ago when imports were ordered then. Today's balance of payments figure is well within the current account forecast published in the Budget last night. In today's number, exports were up 6 per cent, seasonally adjusted. They have been growing by 7 per cent on average for the last five years. It is the highest rate of growth for the last 25 years. In other words, we have accomplished the fundamental restructuring of the economy that evaded the Opposition for so long.</PARA>
<PARA> I gave the figures last night and I will give them again. In the five years to 1988-90, we had an average rate of investment growth of 10.8 per cent. In the Opposition's previous five years, it was 1.6 per cent. In other words, our growth rate in investment has been seven times stronger. In the five years before that to 1978, it was 2.3 per cent. If one extracts from that the investment boom in the mining sector which came by virtue of the fact that the Japanese wanted Australian coal to offset their Middle East oil imports, which had nothing to do with Australian domestic economic policy, one sees that the Opposition's investment record in the 10 years to when we took office was zero against 10.8 per cent a year on average. So the fundamental restructuring which has eluded the economy for 15 years has been successful in the last five years. It is there because of a pick-up in the profit share, because of a massive shift in the factor shares from wages to profits, because of a dramatic shift in public saving and because of a reduction of 8 percentage points in the public sector borrowing requirement, making the private sector of the economy so much bigger and more robust, with a reduction in company tax. Is it any wonder that we have got an investment surge of this dimension? That is what will maintain growth through the coming year. As domestic demand falls off, it will be net exports that will carry the economy as we shift our production into the external sector, to exports and to import replacement.</PARA>
<PARA> If the shadow Treasurer looks at the Budget forecast, he will find that exports are growing on average by 7 per cent through the year, meaning that later on in the year they will be growing faster than 7 per cent. It is that export growth that will hold up gross domestic product and avoid a recession. So the whole premise of his question is wrong. To have a recession, one has to get under zero to have the economy contract. I am afraid that only he and his colleagues, the honourable member for Bennelong and Senator Stone, are clever enough to do that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government provides support for the development of renewable energy and energy efficient technologies through the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council program. Since that program commenced in 1978, some $62m has been committed to projects in these areas. Examples would include, in the honourable member's own State, wind farm demonstration at Esperance in cooperation with the State Energy Commission of Western Australia, development of improved domestic solar water heaters, development of high efficiency photo voltaic cells and systems for remote area application.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's commitment to this area was further demonstrated by the announcement in December 1987 that an additional $5m would be made available over five years for research into renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy conservation. We also provide support for programs to encourage energy conservation. Over the past decade some $7m has been committed to these programs, much of that in close co- operation with the States. In recognition of the importance of conservation the Government has also announced a doubling of its commitment to programs in this area from $1m in 1989-90 to a further increase of $1.4m in 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA> Picking up the last point in the honourable member's question, there have been a number of claims that deficiencies exist in State electricity policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the number of haemophiliacs affected by AIDS in this country and the problems that that causes. Of course, those people have access to the full range of services that we are seeking to provide in responding to this disease in this country. There have been claims that the Government has not acted on calls for compensation by people infected with HIV through the supply of blood or blood products in this country. In fact, the issue has been the subject of continued consideration since this route of infection was first recognised and the blood supply protected, not just by this Government but by all the governments in this country. In February 1985 the Australian Health Services Council established a working party which recommended against a compensation scheme on the grounds that there were no precedents for disease compensation-people with AIDS were already entitled to normal welfare arrangements and such a scheme would not affect the legal liability for claims for negligence-and that it would be a complex scheme to administer. That was the consideration in 1985. These recommendations were noted by all the Australian health Ministers at their conference in May 1985 and have formed the basis to date of the Government's response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Compensation was again examined by the National Advisory Committee on AIDS working group in 1986 and a proposal for a compensation payment was considered at the Commonwealth level by an interdepartmental committee on AIDS in July 1987 and was not supported. The issue has also been the subject of a number of discussions between the Haemophilia Foundation of Australia and the Minister and departmental representatives. The Haemophilia Foundation lodged a submission with the Commonwealth Government in March 1989 to set out its grounds for special government assistance. This has been examined in the context of the Government's national HIV AIDS strategy, which is set out in the forthcoming White Paper.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no other comparable scheme for medically acquired conditions in this country. Honourable members in this House should be aware that if we move in this direction we will be setting a precedent which affects no other medically acquired condition as yet in this country. We have sought legal advice on whether people infected through the blood supply retain their right to seek compensation for negligence through the legal system. People do retain their common law right to pursue claims for negligence, though we all recognise that the difficulty lies in being able to prove negligence before HIV was known to be transmissible through the blood supply and the blood supply was secured. The universal coverage of medical and hospital needs under Medicare and the existing framework of income maintenance benefits provide support in this country for all eligible people. The basic criterion for any government assistance is the need of the claimant rather than the cause of the illness.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Government's position has remained consistent over a number of years. Nevertheless, we will pay close and continuous attention to what is perhaps one of the most difficult issues in the whole AIDS area.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports of the kind mentioned by the honourable member for Dobell in which the Chairman and the General Manager of the ABC have been claiming that through alleged underfunding they will need to cut television transmission time, reduce television program purchases, reduce expenditure on the second regional radio network extension and reduce expenditure on the proposed extension of the JJJ youth network. The Government does not accept in any way that the ABC has been underfunded. The Government decided last year that the ABC should be appropriated $450m for the year ended 1988-89 and that that amount should be cash limited-that is, that it would not be supplemented for unforeseen cost increases. That advice was given to the ABC on a number of occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government also decided that ABC funding should be maintained in real terms for the next two years but be subject to the efficiency dividend in the same way as all Government departments and most Budget funded agencies are required to be. Because inflation for 1988-89 was above the Budget estimate, the ABC claimed that its funding for that year should be increased by $30m and that that enhanced figure should become the base for which the price index should be applied for this year to get maintenance in real terms. The Government rejected that claim because it was not in accord with its earlier decision to provide the ABC with a cash limited appropriation of $450m for 1988-89 as it advised the ABC on several occasions.</PARA>
<PARA> In the context of this year's Budget the Government reconfirmed its decision to maintain last year's appropriation in real terms. This year's Budget allocation of $473.6m is an increase of 5.2 per cent, which represents real term maintenance minus the efficiency dividend. There is no breach of commitment by the Government in any way on the decision that was made last year and conveyed to the ABC. We totally reject the ABC's claim that it has been underfunded by $28m. That is not the end of the story. The resources available to the ABC total more than what comes from the Budget appropriations. The ABC has substantial receipts from other sources including its orchestral activities, bookshops and other activities. Last year those receipts amounted to $54m. This year the ABC's estimate for those receipts is $65 1/2m. The ABC keeps all of these receipts. They are cash receipts. They are not in any way taken from it by the Government. Furthermore, the ABC has cash balances. At the beginning of the last financial year its cash balance was minus $2 1/2m. During the last year it managed to improve on that situation. It had a positive cash balance at the beginning of this year of $5 1/2m-a turnaround of $8m. The total resources available to the ABC in 1989-90, this year, are $544.6m-that is, 8.6 per cent above last year. That has to be compared with the Budget forecast for the non-farm gross domestic product deflator of 6 1/4 per cent, so it is a substantial real increase in resources to the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA> I should also mention that the resources review which the ABC has committed itself to undertake is supposed to reduce staff by 15 per cent over a few years. That staff reduction should be producing salary savings of $24m this financial year. The ABC's resources for 1988-89 should be seen as being sufficient at least to provide for the same level of activity this year as last year. On any objective analysis the ABC has been fairly, indeed generously, treated. We reject absolutely the charge that there has been some underfunding of the ABC. The ABC should stop whingeing and get on with the job.</PARA>

What the honourable member for Wentworth is now saying by implication is that somehow those numbers are tricked up-that they are not an accurate reflection of the Commonwealth's programs or its outlays.This can be the only implication from these claims that the Opposition should need an audit if it were to come to office. It treated the Finance Department like dirt when it was in office. If something was a receipt it made it a negative outlay. It cheated on all the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development classifications. We have given the Finance Department real status. What you see in Forward Estimates is what you get. They actually mean something. It is the kind of public accountability that should always have been in place. Now the Opposition hides behind the fact that it is not prepared to declare its policies. The Leader of the National Party of Australia has the audacity to say that he will announce them in an election campaign. This is the kind of cynicism he would have learned from Jack McEwen, Anthony, Nixon and all the other Country Party thugs we saw in this Parliament for years.

<PARA> The Forward Estimates do mean something. There is a reconciliation table in the Budget Papers which reconciles every adjustment of the outlays from the Forward Estimates, through the April statement, to the Budget now. It shows that in terms of the main changes decisions were taken since 1982 adding $322m to outlays but with a negative effect in the out years-$1,621m of new policies, less $1,399m of savings. The result is that we are seeing another negative outlays year. They are the kinds of accounts the Opposition should always have had. There was no reason why the Opposition could not have revealed them and made the public and the commentators better informed about the nature of the public debate. Because it is always cheating on policy, it cheated on the documents as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are going to address as a matter of public importance the failure of the Budget to address Australia's fundamental economic problems. This Budget tried to perform a very difficult task. It tried to continue with what has been a blatant, politically driven early election strategy and to dress that up as being responsible. When we cut through the veneer of responsibility that has been painted by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in this year's Budget Papers, there is an overwhelming disappointment with the extent to which this Budget fails to address our fundamental economic problems. It fails to develop an effective anti-inflationary strategy; it fails to develop a strategy to stimulate national savings; it fails to have an effective strategy for reducing our total debt; it fails to develop an effective strategy for increasing our productivity and our exports; it threatens a recession; it offers little hope for all Australians on the interest rate front; and, finally, it has no answer-absolutely none-to the emerging wages break-out that is evident in this country at the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the brief time available to me today I want to pick up three or four features of the Budget and to focus on them as matters of specific comment. Firstly, I want to lift the veneer of responsibility. Secondly, I want to talk about the issue of recession ducked in an answer to a question to the Treasurer today. Thirdly, I want to talk about the rape of the corporate sector that is inherent in this Budget. Fourthly, I want to talk about the wages issue and the potential wages explosion and, if there is time, I want to have a look at this new concept for the Industries Assistance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> If we focus on the Budget and the veneer of responsibility I would emphasise to all in this House they should not be influenced by the size of the surplus. In fact, there are two elements to this veneer: the size of the surplus and more honesty in the forecasts. On the size of the surplus, it is important to recognise where the $9.1 billion has come from. The average Australian has every right to ask why he or she should be enthusiastic about a surplus of this magnitude, especially when it stands erect as a monument to the Treasurer's outstanding tax rip-off, to bracket creep, to sales tax excesses, to a decision to tax workers' superannuation as well as, in true Keating style, to his innovative accounting in respect of this year's outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night I showed the Treasurer a chart which summarises quite nicely his performance in government. It emphasises quite clearly that this surplus has come from a phenomenal rip-off in tax over the life of this Government. The only significant expenditure restraint has been on payments to the States. The effect of that has been that the States have been pushed into debt and have been raising government taxes and charges, all of which has impacted on all Australians. The restraint on the Treasurer's own expenditure has been absolutely minimal. In simple terms the Treasurer has set out to make himself look good and to doctor his budget performance at the expense of everyone else. It does not mean anything that he is running a surplus or retiring debt if everyone else is being forced to run up debts and being forced into debt. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the Treasurer's innovative accounting in this Budget, it is very clear what he has done. He has pushed a substantial amount of revenue from last year into this year. He has brought forward a substantial amount of tax revenue, in particular from the corporate sector, from next year into this year. If we look back at last year's Budget outcome, there was an underestimate for non-pay as you earn (PAYE) individual tax, which we notice in this year's Budget goes up by 20 per cent. That figure was shoved from last year into this year to the tune of around $1 1/2 billion. Then there were some Reserve Bank of Australia profits which were not collected last year which were brought into account this year. There is the payment from defence service homes of $1 billion. There was a choice to get it paid last year or this year. It was paid on 14 July this year. Of course, there is the $1.4 billion and the associated public sector debt interest savings of $400m that have been brought forward in a one-off gain. If we take those sorts of adjustments and, undoubtedly, a host of others from this Budget surplus, we find that this surplus is significantly less than last year's outcome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer definitely fiddled the books and he definitely set out to look responsible rather than to deliver the goods. The simple fact is that this Budget has eased fiscal policy. The Government has been about easing fiscal policy, irrespective of its rhetoric, for the best part of the last 18 months. The difference between last year's May statement and the 1988 Budget is that there was an increase in expenditure in that Budget. Once again, there is an increase in expenditure in this Budget. The Government is on an increasing expenditure tack.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point I want to raise is the issue of a recession. As the Treasurer pointed out in his answer today, his growth forecast for the year is 2 3/4 per cent. He boasts that that is pretty good by Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development standards. But he neglects to point out that the growth is working off a very strong base, that there is a possibility that that base will be upgraded and that the growth is carrying on strongly into at least the first quarter of this financial year. The fact is that, if there is no more growth in this whole financial year, that growth figure still comes in at 1.8 per cent. If there is a growth in the September quarter of 0.9 per cent, the next three quarters of the financial year have to be zero growth quarters in order to get the outcome of 2.75 per cent for the year as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> The truth behind this number is that the Treasury people have built in the realistic possibility of a recession in the second half of this year. Growth is still running quite strongly, on the Treasurer's own admission, in this half year. To the extent it exceeds those numbers that I drew attention to, the second half of the year will be negative to give the Treasurer his predicted outcome. If we look at the Budget in somewhat more detail and relate it to the employment and unemployment forecasts we find, although it is not explicitly stated, that unemployment is predicted to go up. The unemployment rate is presently around 6 per cent. The average unemployment rate for the year as a whole is to be 6 1/4 per cent. I think this implies a sizable increase in the unemployment levels through the year in order to get that predicted result. There is no doubt that there is, as Senator Walsh warned us some months ago, a very high risk of a recession under this strategy. Do not forget what that strategy is: it is to stay with high interest rates; it is to hope that those interest rates bite; it is to hope that they will slow down the economy and achieve a soft landing. It is basically to sit on interest rates and pray. There is no more substance to the strategy than that. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I would like to draw attention to is the rape of the corporate sector. The Treasurer needs investment. He tells us constantly how he needs investment. But the corporate sector is definitely being raped in this Budget. Taxes of $1.4 billion have been brought forward as a result of a desire to get the corporate sector to pay its tax earlier and to get the large companies to pay in their PAYE tax twice a month. This guy has no idea what that means to a lot of companies. It is a substantial increase in tax. Where will the corporate sector get this money to pay that tax? It will have to spend about $330m a year on interest because most of the corporate sector will find those earlier tax payments out of borrowings. There is a double slug: the Treasurer increases the tax burden by bringing payments forward and he slams the corporate sector with a high interest rate as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporate sector is also expected to live with a 3 per cent occupational superannuation increase and with the prospect of a wages blow-out. Despite the fiction in this Budget of earnings growth of 6 1/2 or 7 per cent, that growth is already running at about 8 per cent and we are about to get wage increases flowing through. There is plenty of drift out there. There is every chance that the earnings numbers will be well above the Budget forecasts. These forecasts are fictional. They are the weak point. There is a wages break-out in this country. There is an earnings break-out relative to the 6 1/2 per cent deal that was done with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. There is collectively, therefore, a substantial rape of the corporate sector. The bottom line is that the Treasurer needs investment to sustain productive capacity. When he most needs it he slams the group that is supposed to achieve that investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth point I want to talk about is wages policy. Last night I was influenced by the comment made by Simon Crean speaking on Australian Broadcasting Corporation television. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I personally don't think it does enough to get inflation down and that's one of the pressing problems facing this country. </PARA>
<PARA>Simon Crean has taken a direct shot at the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-and why wouldn't he?-because he has been duped. Simon Crean did a deal on behalf of the rank and file in this country based on an earnings projection of 6 1/2 per cent. He will have a lot of trouble holding that deal together when prices are now running at 7 1/2 per cent. When he agreed to the 6 1/2 per cent, the Treasurer was telling him inflation would be 4 1/2 per cent in the year to June this year and between 3 per cent and 4 per cent in the year to June next year. Mr Crean was totally duped. He agreed to 6 1/2 per cent. The pressure is on and the Treasurer knows that he cannot deliver. He has already had to back off once in the course of the last 12 months. Does the Treasurer remember his concept of a wage-tax trade off? He could not deliver on that because we ended up getting a wage increase across the board on top of the tax cuts from 1 July. The Treasurer gave ground to his mate in view of his special relationship with the trade union movement and he is about to do it again. These earnings numbers will come in well above forecast. </PARA>
<PARA> The most disturbing thing is the failure of the Budget to address our fundamental economic problem: the lack of production and the lack of exports in this country. All we get in the so-called micro-economic reform agenda is a new Industries Assistance Commission. Basically, the Commission is to receive a new name and a couple of years' worth of studies. One would not think that the studies on the list were the most important ones to be getting under way if we are serious about micro-economic reform. The concept seems to be, `If in doubt send it to a committee and hope it goes away'. There is no micro-economic reform strategy. We know why: the Treasurer got rolled. He got rolled when the discussion was held by the Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some fundamental impediments to production in this country, and until the Government brings in policies that will reduce or eliminate them we will never trade our way out of these difficulties. The Government should direct its attention at this time to six main impediments. The first is the tax system. The burden of tax is too high and it saps incentive. It discourages savings investment and it encourages consumption and debt. The Treasurer does not understand it. He thinks he has a national savings policy when all he is doing is taxing the life out of superannuation. The benefits we are supposed to get from the superannuation scheme will not be received until the early to middle 1990s. For all that time the Government will be collecting nearly $1 billion a year in tax from superannuation. The Treasurer does not even understand the issue of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area that needs attention is the role of government. The Government spends too much, regulates too much, and spends too much of its time trying to run businesses it should not be running-Australian Airlines, Qantas Airways Ltd, the Commonwealth Bank, and so on. We need policies that bring about substantial cuts in expenditure, that reduce regulation, that privatise these government businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, there is labour market reform, the need to tie wages to productivity, to decentralise the process, to restore some incentive at the workplace level in terms of wage negotiation. Until the Government does that it will persist with a floor of 6 to 7 per cent under our inflation rate. In the Treasurer's own Budget he says that the inflation rate this year will be 7 1/2 per cent in Australia and 4 3/4 per cent in the rest of the world. He is quite happy to go on year after year with our inflation rate nearly double that of our trading partners, and wage increases nearly double those of our trading partners when we look at them relative to productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, there is a desperate need to get interest rates down and to stabilise the currency. The currency has been going up and down like a yoyo in recent years. Why would Senator Button's investment in the manufacturing sector take place when the dollar goes down 40 per cent and comes back 26 per cent in the space of a few years?</PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, there are many infrastructure inefficiencies. There is too much competition or too much regulation of work and management practices in things like coastal shipping, the waterfront, road, rail and air transport, communications, a lack of airport facilities and runways, and so on. We have had no answers in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is the need for a revamped education and skills system. Our skills are in short supply. We have a rigid wages system that erodes incentive. We have an education system that does not have too much to do with excellence any more. The fundamental problem in this country, as I said, is the deficiency of production and the deficiency of exports. This Budget does nothing about those. Indeed, to the extent that it does anything in relation to the corporate sector, the vehicle for change in that regard, it rapes it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow Treasurer started by saying that the size of the surplus, $9.1 billion, came from fiddled numbers. That was the first claim. Again, that was another cheap shot at the Government and the bureaucracy. On page 5.4 of the Budget statements it is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1989-90 surplus of $9,122m or 2.5% of GDP principally reflects the cumulative effects of decisions to restrain the rate of growth in outlays. </PARA>
<PARA>So the surplus does not come about because of tax, but because of restraint in the growth of outlays. That is made quite clear. On page 4.42 of the same document, the Treasury states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . taxpayers as a whole will be paying less tax in 1989-90 than would have been the case if the tax rates scale in place in 1983-84 had been fully indexed for inflation. </PARA>

Honourable members opposite attack from their coward's castle. They have come back to attacking the bureaucrats who cannot defend themselves. That is the point about the tax scales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We can consider also the sheer outcome of the revenue estimates for the year. The revenue from gross pay as you earn (PAYE) tax collections is estimated to increase by 5.4 per cent-less than the inflation rate-and net PAYE revenue is to increase by 4.6 per cent-about 2 per cent less than the inflation rate. The increase in the total individual rate is 8 per cent, slightly above the inflation rate, but this is supposed to be a big grab for money when in the Budget there is a $5.5 billion tax cut. The shadow Treasurer cannot even understand that there is a $5.5 billion tax cut from 1 July this year accounted for in this year's Budget, the largest tax cut in our history. Is it any wonder net PAYE revenue is to increase by 4.6 per cent? The shadow Treasurer said also that the revenue from other individuals was estimated to increase by 20 per cent. In that category is the property and business income of unincorporated individuals from last year's very high level of activity. Overall the total increase for individuals is 8 per cent; the overall total income tax increase is 10 per cent, with the inflation rate at 6 1/4 per cent and the consumer price index running at about 7 per cent. So much for the business about fiddled numbers!</PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Treasurer went on to talk about Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) profits being moved from one year to the next. Wrong! In this year's Budget $440m was received from RBA profit. Last year it was $500m. It is actually lower this year. The RBA profit in the Budget is lower this year than last year. The shadow Treasurer was wrong again. He tried to disparage the decision with respect to defence service homes. The decision was made a couple of years ago and the payment arrangements were made then. It is just where the thing falls.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have dealt with the first 10 minutes of the shadow Treasurer's speech: a fraudulent claim about RBA profits, and a fraudulent claim about tax and about the surplus being derived from tax when, as the Treasury says, it is derived from cuts in government spending. Of course, that is true. The revenue share in gross domestic product (GDP) this year is 26.2 per cent, the same as in 1982-83 and 1981-82. What else do honourable members opposite need? What else can we say to defeat those points?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The shadow Treasurer then talked about a recession. I talked about that in Question Time. He said economic growth was at 2 3/4 per cent and that over the course of the year it would be slower. If it has averaged 2 3/4 per cent it will be slower. But there will not be a recession because we have net exports shifting and exports growing on average by 7 per cent. If the honourable member wants to talk about averages for growth, he has to talk about averages for exports. If exports are averaging 7 per cent, through the year they are higher than 7 per cent. That is what will keep production going and prevent a recession, a crash-landing like the one he gave us all back in 1982-83 and 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> We then heard a pathetic, hollow claim about the rape of the corporate sector. That claim came from this crowd who had corporate profits, the gross operating surplus, at the lowest level in the postwar years. In 1982-83 the share of private non-farm corporate sector gross operating surplus was 26 per cent. That figure can be found in table 5 on page 2.26 of the Budget Statements document. It has risen to 36.7 per cent, a figure higher than the average of 31.1 per cent achieved in the mid-1960s to early 1970s. So the shadow Treasurer talked about the rape of the corporate sector when it is enjoying unprecedented profitability. The honourable member says he is an economics professor. I have said this to him before: `Where did you get your ticket?'. If the honourable member cannot understand a couple of basic facts like that, it must have come from a lucky dip. Does he not understand that the corporate share is now higher than it has ever been? He is talking about the rape of the corporate sector! Why does he think people are out there supporting us in their thousands in corporate Australia? That is because they know what we have done for them. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget we are giving $5.5 billion in tax cuts, which comes off the corporate sector's wage bill. If that tax cut had not been there, there would have been a 12 to 15 per cent nominal wage increase. The private sector has virtually saved that $5 billion-plus tax cut. The company tax rate has been cut from 49c to 39c, which is worth $2 billion; and there is also $1 billion a year for dividend imputation. In the last year the corporate sector has picked up another $8 billion from us, and we are going to take $330m a year from that. And the honourable member calls that rape of the corporate sector!</PARA>

That has to be set against a $8 billion package in the last year, and the highest profits coming off a decline in unit labour costs, the largest we have seen in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. And members of the Opposition talk about the rape of the corporate sector! If they want to be incredible and foolish, they are doing a pretty good job of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Wages policy is where I really started to get giggly. The honourable member said, `What would they do with their wages policy if there were a breakout in the wage system?'. The question is: What would the Opposition do? We have been in office for 6 1/2 years. We have changed the factor shares to get investment and employment going. What would the shadow Treasurer do? What would he do with the pilots wanting a 29 per cent increase in wages? His mate the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) is sitting next to him. I know what he says: `Go for your life. That's deregulation'. Members of the Opposition would wreck the airline companies, move into all the metals awards, the airline industry, the transport industry. We would have a 20 per cent national wage increase. Honourable members opposite say, `Oh yes?'. That is the deregulated nirvana, Liberal style. It is just like the situation in Margaret Thatcher's Britain. Honourable members opposite all held that up as a model. The British have the same craft structure as Australia but in Opposition members' deregulated nirvana wages this year are growing at 10 per cent, with inflation going at 10 per cent. In other words, that structure does not work. People out there in the corporate sector know that it would not work. They know about productivity. </PARA>

Yet he disparages our outcome of 7 per cent. He wants to pay them one per cent but the market will pay them 15 per cent. When will honourable members opposite understand that being a member of the Liberal Party of Australia will not be enough to get them into office? They will have to think of some policies and realise that out there the corporate sector knows that we have rebuilt the structures, with profits and changes in the economy. Those people will not have the Opposition and that kind of sham policy. They know that all the riffraff on the conservative side of business are in the Liberal Party, and they will not have the Opposition managing their affairs. This is the least prepared Opposition ever for government. The honourable member for Kooyong, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), is the least prepared Leader of the Opposition ever to contest the Prime Ministership of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member then talks about failure to lift production and exports. I said in Question Time that exports have been running at an average rate of 7 per cent in the last five years, the fastest rate in the last 25 years. In relation to production, we have had on average twice the rate of GDP growth in the last five years that was the case during the term of the previous Government. Honourable members should have a look at the charts in terms of the components of GDP. On page 2.39 the chart shows GDP for the five years to 1988-89 at 4 per cent, under Labor, and for the five years to 1983-84 at 2.3 per cent. In the five years to 1978-79 it was 2.5 per cent. Honourable members opposite talk about production!</PARA>
<PARA> Then the honourable member for Wentworth says there has been no micro-economic reform. He speaks about the tax system. Fancy him having the hide to say that! He advised the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), for five years. Fancy having the hide to talk about the tax system when the previous Government had a 60 per cent top marginal rate, a bottom rate of 30 per cent, double tax on dividends and a 78c in the dollar tax on company distributions. We have cut that to 39c for companies with a 47 per cent imputation system by 1 January; we will have a top rate of 47c by January, not 60c, and a bottom rate of 24c, not 30c-and the honourable member talks about tax reform and the tax system! With the kind of tax system the Opposition had, the only expanding industry the Opposition had when it was in government was the tax avoidance industry. That was their one great creation in the years when they were in office. There is one thing about the liberals: when one gets a Liberal Party ticket, somehow one loses one's shame. When one signs on there is a kind of psychological drain and one loses one's shame. That is the only way these characters could ever get up and talk about wages systems, tax systems, micro-reform or exports. The gall of them is faint-making. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we hear talk about the stability of the currency. There is the old regulator out: the stability of the currency. The honourable member is on to the Governor of the Reserve Bank. He was used to telling them what they should do with interest rates and the currency. Stability of the currency? The honourable member would give us stability! He would be in there tricking up the foreign exchange market until they clobbered him to death. But he thinks that all those 24- and 25-year-olds sitting on the Reuters screens in New York and Tokyo will say, `Oh, the people in the pinstripe suits are back, so we'll leave them alone; we'll treat them kindly'. They would wash the Opposition away so brutally it would not know which way it went. </PARA>
<PARA> By the way, what did the Governor of the Reserve Bank say about the Opposition? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Throughout more than six years in office, this Government has been very correct in its dealings with the Bank. . . . There has been no interference in matters that are the responsibility of the Bank. Only an ``insider'' can know that that has not always been so!</PARA>
<PARA>The Governor said that he regarded the claims made against the bank as a slur against it. He was talking about the honourable member opposite. He has damned the honourable member in a polite but vicious way. He knows all about the honourable member and the stability of the currency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been a tragic response. It is tragic for the nation and tragic for the economy. Again the Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), has made a number of errors in his response this afternoon. Let me just look at one quote: `It is our money'. It is the great socialist ethic that somehow the taxpayers' money belongs to one Paul Keating, to the Treasurer. It is not his money. It may be taxpayers' money, but it is the people's money for which the Treasurer is a very temporary custodian. He will be even more temporary by the time the next elections come around. The arrogance of the Treasurer in saying here this afternoon that it is all his money, that it is all his to control in the interests of a narrow socialist agenda, should be rejected every time it raises its head.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the reference by the Treasurer to the piece of paper I waved at him and which he called `this pathetic bit of paper'. Let me tell the House what this pathetic bit of paper is. This pathetic bit of paper happens to come from Budget Paper No. 1, page 3.342, relating to the summary of major asset sales. It retails exactly what happened with the defence service homes scheme disposal. The figures are there for everyone to see. Those figures show that last year $400m was brought into the accounts and this year there is $1,015m from the defence service home loan transfer to Westpac Banking Corporation, a sale that was originally announced in May 1985-four years ago-and is only now being finalised. The Treasurer has been inaccurate, he has been arrogant, and we have come to expect that from him. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer accuses us of attacking bureaucrats. We do better than attack bureaucrats. We bring very senior Treasury bureaucrats to the Senate and, if we are not satisfied with that, we bring them from the Senate to the House of Representatives. I am referring to a former Secretary to the Treasury. We are not about the business of attacking the bureaucrats; we are about the business of the good governance of this country. It is a great pity that this Government does not get on with the good governance of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Treasurer had a bad afternoon. He was very worried about that person who covets his job, Simon Crean of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), because Simon spoke the truth in relation to this Budget. He said the Budget lacks a trade strategy. Those were accurate words, picked up by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt). Yes, the Budget absolutely lacks a proper trade strategy for this country. Simon was right, for once. `Simon says' was an accurate expression, for once. Simon obviously covets the jobs of both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). They should look out. But reality is that by the time Simon Crean gets here he will be a long-serving shadow Treasurer and nothing much more. </PARA>
<PARA> We also heard a reference by the Treasurer to the Forward Estimates. I would like to draw the attention of the House to some of those Forward Estimates. I particularly refer country members to the Forward Estimates for road expenditure. What do they show? They show, for example, for 1990-91 an amount of $1430.8m; for 1991-92, $1430.8m; and for 1992-93, $1430.8m. For three years this Government is proposing, in its Forward Estimates, no increase in road funding. That is this Government's attitude to country Australia and it will pay a price for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Treasurer said that what we see is what we get. I will tell this House what the nation sees. The nation sees a tired, out of touch government, hiding up here in Canberra, imposing a one-dimensional policy of high interest rates which is inflicting great agony across Australia, not only on the home buyer-and much of the media tends to focus on the home buyer-but also on small business operators and big business operators. The reality of the Government's interest rates is not 17 per cent or 18 per cent but 21 per cent and higher. The reality of its interest rates in the category of casual overdraft rate is 24.75 per cent at the moment. That is the agony flowing from the Federal Government's policy under this Treasurer. The Opposition totally rejects the approach of the Treasurer. I support strongly the submissions made by the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). </PARA>
<PARA> It is time to look at the facts, not the fiction, in relation to the Budget. Fact No. 1 is that under this Budget Australian taxpayers will have to pay an awful lot more tax this financial year compared with last financial year. Let me tell the House how much more. Individual income tax payments will rise by 8 per cent to $51.3 billion. Under the terms of this Budget total income tax will rise by $6 billion-that is, 10.1 per cent-to $65.5 billion. Under this huge taxing Government, this record taxing Treasurer, those are the facts on taxation in terms of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Fact No. 2, and this will interest the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron), relates to petroleum products. What is the Government doing in that area? The Budget figure is official and shows an increase of 9.3 per cent, from $4.82 billion to $5.6 billion. As the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) points out so accurately, very little of that has come back to roads; that allocation will be increased by a mere $116m. Again, that is not good enough in terms of rectifying the massive transport infrastructure problems imposed by this Federal Budget and maintained by Federal Labor Government policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at fact No. 3. I refer to social security and veterans' affairs. I realise that there are some good points in the Budget in those areas; I am prepared to concede that in the interests of accuracy. However, the more realistic approach is reflected in the comments made by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who pointed out that, in the Government's focus on social security and veterans' affairs, it took seven years for the Government to meet its commitment to raise the basic pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, and that will not be done until April of next year, the 75th anniversary of Gallipoli. Secondly, Labor continues to take nearly $1,000m a year in superannuation tax but will spend only $700m on retirement income improvements over six years. Thirdly, spreading retirement income reforms over six years is an act of gross arrogance which will infuriate retirees, who expect their legitimate problems to be overcome in the short term. These are all accurate points in respect of social security and veterans' affairs. Let me mention another area in passing, that of ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese. At long last those people get a small breakthrough, and I give credit to the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) and others for that. However, it is only a small breakthrough and does not apply to prisoners of war of Korea, Germany and elsewhere, so we now have different categories of ex-prisoners of war. </PARA>
<PARA> I move to fact No. 5 in respect of the Budget. This reflects the incredible priorities of this Government. There are millions of dollars of funding for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). I do not dispute the requirement for funding for AIDS, but while there is an increase of $7m in funding for AIDS, what is the situation in respect of the hideous and horrific Ross River contagion which exists in Australia, especially outside the capital cities? Two years ago there was an allocation of $600,000, one year ago $400,000, last year there were zero dollars, and in this Budget zero again. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some other priorities. On the one hand the Government can find $110m as an additional foreign aid package to black African front line states. On the other hand, it has effectively reduced, or failed to maintain fully, I should say, in the presence of the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown), adequate road funding, including the rural local road funding structure. This Government has plundered the standard of living of thousands of Australians. It is now plundering the standard of living of future generations of Australians with its totally inadequate and flawed Budget. This epitomises a government that is tired, out of touch and soon to lose office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing provides a better illustration of the contrast between the Government and the Opposition than the fact that the previous Government left this Government with a $9 billion deficit, which we have converted to a $9 billion surplus. The $9 billion deficit that this Government inherited from the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), has been converted to a $9 billion surplus. What a contrast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the days when the Liberal Party was in government, taxpaying became optional for the rich and powerful in Australia. That Government did not collect the revenue that ought to have been collected and taxpaying became optional. I heard the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) talk about the growth in revenue. The reason why there has been a growth in revenue under this Government is that people for whom it was optional under the Liberal Government are now paying tax. That is what has changed. I want to talk about specific percentages. In effect, individual taxpayers are not paying more tax; we have simply broadened the tax base and made tax collections more effective.</PARA>
<PARA> In contrast with the Opposition, we will use this surplus to pay off debt that was accumulated when the Liberal and National parties were in government. Australians know that this Government is managing their money in a way that was never possible under the Liberal and National parties. Over recent weeks we have had the spectacle of the English cricket team. This Opposition is like that team: it is without a strong leader; its batting line-up lacks strength and it certainly has no attack. Pensioners and juniors in the English cricket team have faced the might of the Australian side. That is what we have opposite-pensioners and juniors ill-equipped to face up to this Government. People ought to understand that contrast. </PARA>
<PARA> The first big test for the Opposition comes tomorrow night. It will be interesting to see what it has. Let us see whether it has anything substantial. I suggest to my colleagues on this side and to the Australian people that the Opposition, like the English cricket team, will lose the first big test. Honourable members opposite do not have it. They have not been training, they do not have the skills and they certainly do not have the leadership. That is what it will come down to. </PARA>
<PARA> We already know that the Opposition has a shortage of policies. Despite the fact that we have been in government for 6 1/2 years, we are still awaiting policies and they are not being put down. It is interesting to observe that today the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong, praised this Government's Budget performance. Why? Because he was prepared to grapple with policies. Given John Elliott's timetable, he was due to bring some policies before us in September. The test is now before the Opposition. Will it produce any policies tomorrow night? That is the big test. So far, in 6 1/2 years, those opposite have not come good. At the moment their record is just like that of the English cricket team: it is shallow; it cannot do anything. It cannot even bat through a day. That is the contrast in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us contrast what we have to offer with what the Opposition has to offer. I have already said that the surplus will be used to pay off overseas debt and domestic debt accumulated when the Liberal and National parties were in government. I say to the Australian people that that is very important. The money being used by this Government is certainly being used to pay off debt accumulated when the Opposition was in power. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to say something about the general statistics that this Government is putting before the Australian people. In the next financial year we face moderate economic growth and moderate employment growth. What really worries the Australian people and me is that when the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth, talks about economic growth he is really talking about doing what the Opposition did in 1981-82 when it plunged the economy into recession. People know that under that strategy people lose their jobs. It is all very well for the Opposition to come in here and talk about these statistical outcomes, but what about personal outcomes? The Opposition's strategy, as has always been the case when it wants to shift the economy towards its statistical outcomes, is to punish ordinary workers. That is what the honourable member for Wentworth and other members opposite are talking about. He wants to restrain growth through the very simple strategy of moving towards a recession. That means a loss of jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When those opposite were in government there was an enormous decline in jobs, which was manufactured by the Fraser-Howard coalition. There was a massive loss of jobs in Australia. The collection opposite has put up this proposition, `We can reduce growth in this economy and will go towards a recession'. They keep getting up in this place and challenging the Treasurer (Mr Keating) by saying, `Why have you got these growth projections of 2 3/4 per cent?'. The simple reason is that the private sector is growing and the Australian economy is being geared up for that growth. These statistics also demonstrate the enormous export growth that is flowing through in this economy. That was demonstrated even by today's statistics. This economy is getting itself into gear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also important to note that, when one looks at the underpinning characteristic of investment in this economy, one can contrast the period in which we have been in government-there has been an enormous growth in investment, in fact a 10 per cent annual growth in investment-with the period in which the Opposition was in government when there was growth of 1.6 per cent. That suggests that the private sector is prepared to put its money on this Government. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AG4">Mr RONALD EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. The private sector backs this Government and so do the ordinary workers, because ordinary workers have seen an enormous growth in the number of jobs-1.5 million since we have been in office. So ordinary workers have seen an enormous growth in the number of jobs and the private sector has seen growth in its profitability-we can take those figures up with the Opposition-and it has made a commitment by saying, `We will invest in this economy'. That contrasts with what happened when those opposite were in government. They have still not come up with any substantial policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it interesting that those opposite keep saying, `What will you do about wages?'. They want to do away with wages policy. They then jump up in Question Time and say, `What about the pilots? What about the air traffic controllers? What about teachers?'. One cannot do anything if one does not have a wages policy. Where is the Opposition's wages policy? It is opting out, as was the case with the tax system. People who were rich and powerful could opt out of the tax system under the Liberals and Nationals. It is the same formula: a rich and powerful union will be able to opt out of the wages system under the Liberals and Nationals. The pilots will be able to get a 29 per cent wage increase, as will everyone else. Where is the equity in that? That is a destructive wages policy in terms of the ordinary worker, who is left behind in that process. The ordinary worker has to pay the increased prices that result from that wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have said that there is a way through it. One of the ways through it-we have already put this strategy in place-is a wage-tax trade-off. It makes sense. That is the first element. The second element is that people will get a reward in terms of wage increases if the workplace is restructured and modernised. The third element of that strategy is that we are suggesting to Australian workers-it is contained in this Budget-that if they can negotiate a proper superannuation increase with their employer, we will support that by providing tax concessions. So the three elements come together: a wage-tax trade-off, rewards for restructuring and the superannuation process. People on this side of the House and in the Australian community generally understand that if we have a proper superannuation policy we will not have the disaster that would have been ahead of us had the Opposition stayed in power. </PARA>
<PARA> It did not address this fundamental question: What will we do in the year 2025 when 25 per cent of the Australian population is of pensionable age? We are saying that the answer can be addressed, and it has been addressed in this Budget. First, we have enhanced the area of superannuation coverage. The Budget forecasts an enormous increase. There will be a $60 billion growth in superannuation. That is an enormous change in strategy. Secondly, we also recognise that those in receipt of pensions deserve to be free of continual tax problems. They should also have some incentive to earn extra income. That is the other part of our retirement policy. This Budget states, `We recognise that. We've already put a number of measures in place and we're putting further measures in place'. Come 1995, all people who are in receipt of pensions will not be in the tax system. That was never addressed by those opposite. We get only quick fixes and gimmicks from those opposite. Not only do we have a wages policy; we also have a retirement incomes policy. We have done that on the basis of research; not quick polling, not working out which electorate one is in today, not reacting to the local pressure group, but by asking what Australians really need. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian people, when comparing this Government with the Opposition, should think of the English cricket team: the Opposition is without leadership; it is without any strength in its batting line-up and it certainly gets bowled over very easily because it has no policies. It is easy to get up and support this Government's policies and performance because the record is there, just like that of the Australian cricket team, and it is a very good record. </PARA>

<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 11-15 (1989) and Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Proposals No. 1 (1989). </PARA>
<PARA>The tariff proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987, and the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1980. Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 11 to 14 (1989) and Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Proposals No. 1 (1989) formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff alterations made by notices published in the Gazette during the recent recess. Customs Tariff Proposals No. 15 (1989) is new and introduces amendments for certain textiles, clothing and footwear goods. Customs Tariff Proposals No. 11 (1989), operative on and from 1 March 1989, introduces unrestricted duty free access for footwear and certain fabrics of New Zealand origin. These changes accord with Australia's obligations under the closer economic relations trade agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals No. 12 (1989), operative on and from 1 July 1989, contains the following:</PARA>
<PARA> Alterations to schedule one to take account of changes in the status and official title of a number of countries or places which qualify for preferential treatment;</PARA>
<PARA> changes to provide duty free and quota free access for apparel of New Zealand origin. This achieves free trade access a year earlier than originally proposed; and</PARA>
<PARA> alterations to give effect to the Government's recently announced decision on the Industries Assistance Commission's report on the mining, construction and agricultural equipment industries. These changes provide increased stability and greatly reduce cost for the industries concerned and resolve a number of tariff anomalies which emerged during the Commission's inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 13 to 15 contain changes to the administration of the textiles, clothing and footwear plan. This action follows the Government's acceptance of the recommendation by the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority. Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 13 and 15 operate on and from 1 March 1989. Quota restrictions on brassiere back replacements have been abolished and a 25 per cent duty rate imposed. Metal parts of footwear and anti-radiation suits, anti-contamination suits and similar protective garments have also been removed from quota and a 15 per cent rate of duty implemented. Additional notes have been inserted in sections seven and 11 to define these protective garments. </PARA>
<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals No. 14, operative on and from 1 August 1989, introduces a free rate of duty for certain fabric woven from PVC coated polyester, and woven cut corduroy. It also implements quota free and duty free access for certain ski boots and cross-country ski footwear. Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Proposals No. 1 (1989), which operates on and from 1 July 1989, increases the export duty on concentrate produced from uranium ore obtained from the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory. The duty is increased from $1.15 to $1.30 per kilogram and was foreshadowed in the 1988-89 Budget Papers. Summaries of alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for certain technical amendments which will ensure that the Commonwealth borrowing levy continues to apply to all Commonwealth authorities and their subsidiaries, as was intended by the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987. The levy is imposed on the borrowings of all Commonwealth semi-government authorities and government-owned companies, other than those engaged in the business of financial intermediation, such as the Commonwealth Bank and the Australian Industry Development Corporation. The levy, currently set at a rate of 0.125 per cent per annum, is designed to take account of the benefit these enterprises receive in terms of access to financial markets by virtue of their Commonwealth ownership. By ensuring that the effective cost of borrowings to these enterprises is more directly comparable with that faced by private sector borrowers, the enterprises are encouraged to take full account of the cost to the community of their investment decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments provided for in the Bill will expand the list of authorities subject to the levy to include the Civil Aviation Authority and Aerospace Technologies of Australia, two recently created Commonwealth authorities. The Bill also provides for the Australian Capital Territory Electricity and Water Authority to be excluded from paying the levy from 11 May 1989, the day Australian Capital Territory self-government was proclaimed. This will ensure that, under the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987, Australian Capital Territory authorities will be treated on the same basis as State and Northern Territory semi-government authorities. The Bill also provides for some minor definitional changes which will allow the levy to be applied to any new authorities through their enabling legislation, and to the subsidiaries of Commonwealth authorities. This will minimise the need for further legislative changes of this nature. These amendments will increase revenue raised from the levy in the 1989-90 financial year by an estimated $220,000 to $8,720,000. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

The purpose of this Bill is to provide that the ACTEW should also cease to be liable for payments of the former Commonwealth guarantee charge. Under the current legislation, the ACTEW is liable for the charge in respect of outstanding amounts of borrowings undertaken in 1986-87.

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Proposed fitout works at Box Hill and Moonee Ponds, Victoria, Adelaide and Perth. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a proposal for fitout works in six pre-commitment lease office buildings in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia for the Australian Taxation Office. The Commonwealth will be entering into agreements to lease base buildings designed to accommodate the Australian Taxation Office at Box Hill and Moonee Ponds in Melbourne and at two locations each in Adelaide and in Perth. Since 1975 the Australian Taxation Office has been decentralising its larger offices from central business districts of major cities to suburban or country sites in an effort to bring staff closer to their work and to provide a better service to taxpayers. Where relocations outside the central business districts are possible there is the added benefit of reductions in high rentals. </PARA>
<PARA> The first office to be established under the decentralisation program was Parramatta, followed by Newcastle, Chatswood, Albury-Wodonga in New South Wales, and Dandenong in Victoria. The location of offices at Box Hill and Moonee Ponds followed a staff survey which indicated that many employees desired to work in those suburbs. In South Australia staff preferred to work in the central business district. At this centre and in Perth the existing offices will be split into two smaller offices. The functional requirements of the Australian Taxation Office are similar at each location and in each building. Each building will provide some 20,000 square metres of office space, ground floor shopfront space, and a controlled entry point for staff. The total cost of the fit-out works at the six locations is estimated at $46.1m at July 1989 prices. I table all drawings of the proposed works and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has no objection to the referral of these proposals to the Public Works Committee and, in general, accepts that this is fit-out work associated with works or leases to which the Commonwealth has already made a commitment. In general, in taking the overall project, the Opposition also agrees with the proposal whereby this and other government departments are removed from the central business district where that is practical. I hold a personal view that if decentralisation, even of our metropolitan areas, is to succeed it will be as a result of the initiative of government in moving certain of its service industries, particularly those with which the public and the professions have dealings, away from the central business district, consequently encouraging other people-in this case tax agents and people of that nature-to shift their office requirements closer to these sorts of government service centres. In that process some of the pressure will be taken off our great cities which I think is necessary if we are to avoid pollution and the concentration of all those gases that concern us in the environment today. We will not stop producing them, but we certainly will not concentrate them to the extent we do today, which I think has caused many problems for our cities. I hold the view that Canberra may have some faults, but past efforts to provide office buildings and government exercises in association with shopping centres have made a major contribution to the type of city it is. We think that is a good idea and that the Government is going the right way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is only one down side that I have been able to identify so far and that was identified recently in the Chatswood branch. Apparently, the Commissioner of Taxation was not able to keep a close enough eye on the staff, and they started to think they were Matt Dillon or somebody else and wanted to take journalists on their raids. I do not think any of us approved particularly of that exercise, but it is apparently indicative of the style of the Taxation Office today. </PARA>

<PARA> Clause 43, page 16, omit the clause, substitute the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA> Transitional-Depositors' Unclaimed Fund</PARA>
<PARA> ``43. (1) In spite of the repeal of section 53 of the Principal Act effected by this Part, that section continues in force, after the commencement of this section, in relation to:</PARA>
<PARA>  (a)money standing to the credit of the Depositors' Unclaimed Fund immediately before the commencement of this section; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (b)money that became the absolute property of the Savings Bank before the commencement of this section; as if that repeal had not been effected. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) A reference in section 69 of the Banking Act 1959 to unclaimed moneys does not include a reference to money standing to the credit of the Depositors' Unclaimed Fund immediately before the commencement of this section.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has moved this amendment to ensure that in future the Commonwealth Savings Bank will be treated on the same basis as other banks in relation to unclaimed moneys. Consistent with the removal of the distinction between savings banks and trading banks, the intention in drafting the Bill was that all former savings banks, including the Commonwealth Savings Bank, should become subject to section 69 of the Banking Act 1959. This section requires that trading banks pay annually to the Commonwealth those moneys which have been unclaimed for seven years. It is not intended, however, that former savings banks should be required to pay to the Commonwealth the backlog of those moneys which have been unclaimed for eight years or more. </PARA>
<PARA> As it now stands, clause 43 (1) of the Bill requires that the Commonwealth Savings Bank pay to the Commonwealth all unclaimed moneys in amounts of $100 or more which it would hold at the time the amended legislation came into force. It is proposed that the present clause 43 be deleted so that the treatment of the Commonwealth Savings Bank will be brought into line with that of the other form of savings banks under section 69 of the Act as amended by clause 20. Proposed new clause 43 will relate only to the manner in which the Commonwealth Savings Bank holds moneys which are unclaimed for eight years or more. This amendment will not alter the financial implications of the Bill which I outlined in my second reading speech, since these were estimated on the assumption that all former savings banks would be treated equally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unclear what purpose would be served by the proposed changes to section 81 of the Reserve Bank Act, as intended by the amendment moved by the Opposition. On the one hand the amendment appears to require that the Reserve Bank of Australia report to the Treasurer on any investigation of prudential matters undertaken pursuant to proposed section 61 of the Banking Act. On the other hand, the Bank would be required not to report on the affairs of an individual bank or on the affairs of an individual customer of the Bank; that is, the strictures in proposed new subsection (1a) would seem to cancel much or all of the effect of the requirements in proposed new subparagraph (aa). This would leave the Reserve Bank with the obligation only to report details of persons appointed to investigate and report on prudential matters under proposed section 61.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is difficult to see that this represents a matter of such importance that the Reserve Bank should report on it invariably and mandatorily rather than according to its discretion. If the Reserve Bank were to appoint a person other than a Reserve Bank officer to conduct an investigation, it could be expected to appoint professional auditors and accountants, including auditors already familiar with a particular bank's accounts. In view of the doubt regarding the usefulness of the provisions proposed by the Opposition and the fact that there is already a requirement in the Reserve Bank Act that the Reserve Bank report annually to the Treasurer on its operations, the Government does not support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Bill. There are only two things that I wish to say. The first relates to clause 7 of the Bill which provides that the applied provisions do not apply in relation to a ship that belongs to the naval, military or air forces of a foreign country. We are told in the explanatory memorandum that this clause ensures that the Act applies to vessels belonging to the defence forces of Australia but not to those of other countries. With respect to the Act applying to vessels belonging to the defence forces of Australia, it is probably a suitable opportunity simply to say that this Bill will provide one level of limitations on liability, that is, in money terms. There are other limitations, of course, and the tragic history of the Voyager should remind us of one other limitation that is still being imposed. We trust that the Government, in view of the public debate that took place in this country some months ago, might still at this stage see its way clear to reassess whether it should still rely on the statute of limitations to bar claims arising out of that accident.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter relates to aviation claims. To some extent, this Bill regularises claims for maritime accidents and limits the liability for claims arising out of such accidents. The situation with respect to aviation claims still lags behind. We trust that the Government will give attention to this to ensure that that matter is also brought into line with modern needs and requirements. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OG4">Mr LINDSAY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Herbert)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(4.13)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Bill 1989 is proclaimed, Australia will become a party to the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims 1976 and, subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the 1976 Convention will then have the force of law in Australia. The 1976 Convention replaces and abrogates the International Convention relating to the Limitation of Liability of Owners of Sea-going Ships, agreed to at Brussels on 10 October 1957. The 1957 convention recognised the concept of limitation of liability of shipowners and set out certain rules relating to the limitation of liability for maritime claims. The 1957 convention also provided for upper monetary limits in respect of claims arising from a maritime incident in which loss of life, personal injury or property damage had occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The notion and principles of limitation of liability have their origins in the eighteenth century. In the Bramley Moore case, Lord Denning described the rationale of limitation of liability as `a rule of public policy which has its origin in history and its justification in convenience'. Lord Justice Griffiths in the Garden City (No. 2) case said that the right to limitation of liability `is of long standing and generally accepted by the trading nations of the world. It is a right given to promote the general health of trade and in truth is no more than a way of distributing the insurance risk'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the early days of maritime trade, ship- owners often faced far greater risks than today. Most times they would have no direct control over the ships operations in the course of a voyage. Shipowners would therefore be unable to take practical steps to reduce the risk of vicarious liability for the acts or omissions of the master or crew. This was in contrast to land transport operations, where employers could be directly supervised. There was also the risk that commercially astute shipowners could limit their liability to the value of the ships by vesting ownership of the ship in a company with no other assets. It would be obviously against the interest of public policy to permit a proliferation of one-ship companies with grossly underinsured ships. Furthermore, the hazardous nature of every sea voyage was a substantial impediment to the growth of international trade. </PARA>
<PARA> A legal framework had to be developed to ensure the commercial viability of a shipping industry. Limitation of liability by statute seems to have commenced in 1734 with an Act which limited liability for losses by embezzlement and theft by the master or crew to the value of the ship and her appurtenances and the freight of the voyage. This limit was later extended to cases of robbery in which the master and mariners were not concerned, and more general limitation provisions were enacted by the merchant shipping Acts of 1854 and 1862. </PARA>
<PARA> British law on this issue applied in Australia until 1981 when amendments to the Navigation Act 1912 came into force, implementing the 1957 convention. The advantage of limitation is that, with maximum liability known, adequate assurance can be taken by a shipowner without it being prohibitively expensive. It is of interest to note that the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe has currently under consideration a draft convention for civil liability for damage caused during carriage of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland navigation vessels. This draft, which was given particular impetus by a major road tanker casualty in Spain a few years ago reflects the same kinds of principles of limitation of liability that have been the practice in shipping. The 1976 convention, which is set out in schedule 1 of this Bill, was adopted by the International Conference on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims at London on 19 November 1976 and came into force internationally on 1 December 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> When the British ferry Herald of Free Enterprise capsized and sank outside Zeebrugge Harbour in Belgium on 6 March 1987 with approximately 459 passengers and 80 crew aboard, the Australian Government proceeded with a study to find out how much compensation would be available to victims if a similar disaster occurred in Australia. It was quite clear that the limits operating under the 1957 convention were absurdly low. Based on the passenger carrying capacity of the Abel Tasman, the total compensation that would be available for claimants under the 1957 convention would be little more than $3m. Under the 1976 convention, it would be nearer $40m. Compensation of the Herald of Free Enterprise victims was complicated by the fact that the United Kingdom is a party to the Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage. That convention places a limit on each individual claim. Therefore, although the United Kingdom had already become a party to the 1976 convention and thus the total compensation available was reasonably high, each passenger was limited individually to about $85,000. In the event, the United Kingdom Government came to a special arrangement with Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. ferries to increase this individual limit. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is not a party to the Athens convention, and does not propose to become one. Nevertheless, having regard to the apparent difficulties for claimants connected with the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster, the need for Australia to adopt the 1976 convention was now more urgent than before. Although the States and the Northern Territory had been haggling with the Federal Government for some time over their concerns that damage to harbour works would cease to be excluded from limitation under the 1976 convention and, indeed, had been lukewarm about the new convention generally, the inadequacy of the 1957 convention compelled transport Ministers attending the 75th meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council in December 1987 to agree that Australia should accede to the 1976 convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The most significant change under the 1976 convention is the substantial increase in the amount of compensation claimable. The amount is still calculable in terms of units of account and is linked to the tonnage of the ship. The limit which a shipowner may claim is calculated by multiplying the tonnage of the ship-as calculated under internationally agreed rules-by the units of account laid down in the convention. For instance, a ship of 10,000 tons attracts a limit for claims for loss of life or personal injury of 3,914,000 units of account, calculated as follows: 330,000 units of account for the first 500 tons; 1,250,000 units of account for the next 2,500 tons; and 2,331,000 units of account for the next 7,000 tons. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar calculation for property claims yields a limit of 1,753,500 units of account. If the ship carries 500 passengers, each passenger attracts a limit of 46,666 units of account, making 23,333,000 in all. The unit of account is identical to the special drawing right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund. Each day the IMF calculates the value of the SDR against the United States dollar by reference to a selected basket of world currencies. It then calculates the SDR against national currencies as reported by individual countries. The rate can be found in the Daily Commercial News, a newspaper published in Australia. For example, on 9 August 1989 the SDR equivalent was $1.6688. This would make the calculations on a 10,000 tonne ship $6,524,168 in respect of claims for loss of life or personal injury, $2,922,874 in respect of property claims, and $38,893,311 in respect of passenger claims. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) in his second reading speech gave some examples of amounts claimable. In addition to the persons entitled to the limitation of liability under the 1957 convention, article 1 of the 1976 convention extended the privilege to insurers and salvors. Salvors will now be entitled to the same limits as their insured. A salvor will be entitled to a limitation of liability when, for example, he puts members of a salvage team on board a stricken vessel, and they cause damage or loss. </PARA>
<PARA> Although this Bill applies the 1976 convention to all seagoing ships, it will still be open to the States and the Northern Territory to legislate themselves, if they wish, for ships in which they have a particular interest. The States and the Northern Territory have the option to legislate for the 1957 convention. Only Western Australia has done so. The States and the Northern Territory have not expressed a particular desire to legislate themselves for seagoing ships, but it is possible that there may be some State legislation to cover non-seagoing ships, such as harbour ferries. Claims which can be the subject of limitation include those in respect of death or personal injury; damage to property, including harbour works, on board or in direct connection with the operation of the ship or with salvage operations; loss of or delay in the carriage of goods or passengers; infringements of other non-contractual rights; removal or destruction of cargo; and efforts by third parties to minimise loss caused by the defendant. </PARA>
<PARA> Article 3 excludes certain claims from limitation such as those resulting from oil pollution or nuclear damage. Oil pollution damage is covered by its own convention-the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969. Australia is already a party to that Convention. Its provisions are implemented by the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981. Both the 1957 and 1976 conventions provide that under certain circumstances a shipowner is deprived of the right to limit his liability. The 1957 convention provides that a shipowner cannot limit his liability if the occurrence giving rise to the claims resulted from the actual fault or privity of the owner. Article 4 of the 1976 convention provides that `a person shall not be entitled to limit his liability if it is proved that the loss resulted from his personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such loss or recklessly and with the knowledge that such loss would probably result'. </PARA>
<PARA> The wording of the two conventions represents a major difference as to conduct which will bar a shipowner from the right to limit his liability. Under the 1957 convention, provided that fault can be laid at the door of someone sufficiently senior in the shipowning company to be regarded as an alter ego of the company, a claimant may succeed in breaking the limits. `Alter ego' was the phrase used in the Lennards Carrying Co. case. For example, if someone in an executive position who is normally the person responsible in the company for the management and control of the navigation of vessels and the training of the crews has instituted a system of checks and safeguards which is disregarded by those further down the hierarchy, such as masters, the fault cannot be attributed to the `alter ego' of the company. However, where no proper system of safeguards, checks, reporting, et cetera has been instituted, this in itself is actual fault on the part of the `alter ego' of the owning company. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the 1976 convention, in order for a claimant to break limitation the loss must result from the shipowner's personal act or omission. This probably means someone much higher up in the company than is the case under the 1957 convention. More importantly, it would seem that there must be actual knowledge, which would probably include the turning of a blind eye, as opposed to constructive knowledge, to acts or omissions which caused the loss. The claimant would also have to show that the owner either intended to cause the loss or was sufficiently reckless that he knew that such loss was probable. Furthermore, the burden of proof is on the claimant, which means that under article 4 of the 1976 convention if there were any doubt about the personal misconduct of the owner he would be able to claim limited liability. Under the old law the burden of proof lay upon the person seeking to establish the right to limit. So it was the defendant shipowner who had to establish that the loss occurred without his actual fault or privity. The shifting of the burden of proof may well turn out to be the most significant change between the 1957 convention and the 1976 convention. Many cases have failed on burden of proof in the past. Nevertheless, whilst a claimant seeking to break the limits under the 1976 convention will have a harder job than previously, the upper limits of damages are substantially increased. The Government, therefore, believes that the net result of the trade-off is a fairer deal for the victim and a more predictable risk to be covered by the shipowner. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister indicated in his second reading speech, the Bill will be proclaimed in the second half of 1990. The Bill provides for proclamation to take place within 18 months of the royal assent. The Bill is a tribute to the accomplishments of the Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support. I commend the Bill to the support of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know. It has indicated its strong support for this legislation through the honourable member for Menzies. I am pleased to speak on the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Bill 1989. This Bill will greatly increase the amount of compensation available to victims of a maritime accident, a matter that has concerned many people for some time. Australia is currently party to the International Convention relating to the Limitation of the Liability of Owners of Seagoing Ships 1957 and its 1979 protocol. The convention and protocol, which are implemented by part 8 of the Navigation Act 1912, establish upper limits for claims arising from a maritime accident in which loss of life, personal injury or property damage occurs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For some time now it has been felt that the limits set by the 1957 convention have been far too low. For this reason a diplomatic conference held in 1976 decided to adopt the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, which came into force internationally on 1 December 1986. To date there are 16 countries which are party to the convention. These include Japan, the Scandinavian countries, the United Kingdom, France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Liberia. With the passage of this Bill Australia will join these countries as a party to the 1976 convention. </PARA>
<PARA> A few simple statistics will illustrate just how inadequate and outdated the 1957 convention is. Under this Convention the total amount of compensation available to cover an accident to a ship of 10,000 tonnes would be little more than $3m. In the case of a major accident such as the disaster suffered by the Herald of Free Enterprise, already mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), in which there were 193 claimants, the average amount of compensation available to each claimant would be in the order of only $15,000 to $17,000. This is hardly enough to compensate adequately for serious and permanent injury or, indeed, for loss of life. Under the 1976 convention, which this Bill seeks to ratify, some $40m would be available to cover such an accident. The average compensation payment to each passenger would be in the order of some $200,000. The 1976 convention and the legislation now before the House make provision for both personal claims and property claims and set upper limits for both types of compensation. In the case of personal claims, the upper limit of total claim is based on the tonnage of the ship and in round figures ranges from $500,000 for a ship of 500 tons to $6m for a ship of 10,000 tons. In the case of property claims, which include claims for damage to other ships, general property and harbour works, the system for determining compensation is similar, ranging from $250,000 for a ship of 500 tons to almost $3m for a ship of 10,000 tons. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, article 7 of the 1976 convention makes provision for a separate fund to compensate for loss of life or personal injury to passengers. Once again, the level of overall compensation is governed by a sliding scale which is determined by the number of passengers a particular vessel is licensed to carry. For example, the maximum compensation available to passengers on the Abel Tasman would be just under $40m. As a trade-off for the greatly increased levels of compensation now made available, the convention sets in place a virtually ironclad system of limiting liability. Under this system a person will be deprived of his or her right to limit liability only if it can be proved that the loss resulted from a personal act or omission committed with intent to cause such a loss or else committed recklessly with the knowledge that such a loss would probably result. </PARA>
<PARA> While the legislation before the House deals with property damage and damage to life and limb suffered by persons involved in a maritime accident, I believe it is important to consider also the damage done to the sea itself, which very much affects the quality of life not only of seafarers but of every man, woman and child on our planet. I would recommend to the House that we need to be very concerned as to the adequacy of our legislation covering damage to the sea and to monitor the situation continually and closely. This is a matter of particular importance to Australia because we depend almost exclusively on shipping to move our exports and imports and we have, in terms of tonnes per kilometres, the fifth largest shipping task in the world. To fulfil our trade commitments there are some 11,000 ship visits to Australia each year. Prevention is a positive approach to pollution. The cleanliness of Australia's oceans can be maintained through the enforcement of legislation, through education and through the continued development of control procedures for the prevention and physical removal of harmful substances from the marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already indicated, the legislation now before the House is most commendable and I am sure it will be enthusiastically supported-indeed, I know it is enthusiastically supported. But by its very nature it is limited to a consideration of the need for adequate compensation for accidents connected with seagoing activities. I hope I have made clear that members of this House and people generally need also to be actively concerned lest there take place at sea those accidents for which there can be no adequate compensation: namely, those accidents that do irreparable damage to our entire marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to note that there is within Australia general support for the legislation now before the House which will ratify the 1986 convention. Such support was indicated at the seventy-fifth meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council held in December 1987. At that meeting Federal, State and Northern Territory transport Ministers agreed that Australia should accede to the 1976 convention. I now have much pleasure in likewise lending my support to this important legislation and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

Of course, the Bill enables Australia to become a party to the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, to which reference has already been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to express my very great appreciation to the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), two members on this side of the House who have indicated by their previous commitment to questions of this kind that their concern is a continuing one. The quality of their contributions to this debate indicates not only the understanding that they bring to it but also the great deal of time and effort that has clearly gone into researching the material that they have brought to our attention. The honourable member for Herbert gave an extremely valuable historic outline and indicated a clear understanding of the implications of the legislation. The honourable member for Throsby indicated the background to this legislation and I appreciate the clarity of his presentation. The importance to shipping generally in Australia was also noted. That is something which the honourable member for Throsby has pursued on numerous occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I want to express my personal appreciation to the officers of the Department of Transport and Communications who have been involved in the preparation of this legislation and for the advice which they have given to me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is general agreement amongst the livestock producers of Australia and the government departments concerned with the livestock industries that we need to improve the preparedness of this country to meet the very imminent threat of exotic disease which could decimate our livestock industries and our valuable exports. With that recognition there is an assumption of a need for more resources; hence the Exotic Animal Disease Control Bill and related Bills which we are now debating. There is also general agreement and recognition that better coordination is needed to maximise what is being done at the present time and what can be done to protect one of the great natural advantages of Australia in international trade: that is, our isolation as an island continent from countries that have particular diseases. Part of that improved effort will be to provide more complete and timely information and advice. That is all agreed. But there are questions that need answers. Who should pay for those additional resources? Should it be the Federal and State governments, or industry? What percentage should each pay? Which industries should contribute? Who should control the money that is collected?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition parties support this legislation because we recognise it is of the highest priority to protect the livestock industries and the exports of more than $8 billion that they so efficiently provide for this country against some very dangerous diseases-bluetongue, screw worm fly, rabies, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition and the livestock industries are concerned that the national Government of this country is transferring some of its national and public health responsibility to the farmers of this country. If one considers the developments in primary industry, one can see that the Government has moved very much to a user pays principle. We have an example in the dollar for dollar arrangement that is being proposed in the legislation when in the past the Government paid for all disease preparedness. The Government is not applying the same policy of transferring to the non-primary industries the cost of what have always been considered Government responsibilities. This is not the only example; there are earlier examples. For example, a couple of years ago the chemical residue problem had the ability to decimate our beef export. The problem came about not through farmers breaking Government regulations in relation to the use of pesticides and weedicides, but through their following the very best advice on the use of those chemicals that was available at that time; yet the industry had to pay all that great cost. The beef industry, in particular, responded magnificently, but the Government at least could have shared that cost with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The national market basket survey has always been considered a public health responsibility; it is designed to see how pure are the foods that everybody in Australia eats and to check that they are free from a range of things which we would not want Australians to be eating. It should be a public health responsibility, but the Government has put it on to the farmers through levies. The national residue survey on the foods we eat and export, which should also be a national public health responsibility, is also being palmed off on to the farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the best example is the fishing industry which has a range of problems with respect to the uncertainty of the resource. Basically, the industry is paying for the departmental employees in Canberra. It has no ability to control the number or cost of those employees; there is no accountability to the industry for the levies that are placed on it. With the additional amount of $1 1/2m-$750,000 from the designated livestock industries and $750,000 from the Government-comes the test of whether Federal and State governments will maintain their expenditure in quarantine and in exotic disease prevention measures as they have in the past or whether this provides an opportunity for the Government to transfer more of the cost to rural industry. It will also be a test of whether the Government will adopt the same policies for some of the other industries in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated, one of the purposes of the Bill is to levy a range of industries in related legislation so that they will pay 50 per cent, or $750,000. The representative of those industries is the National Farmers Federation (NFF). I accept that form of representation. I also commend the NFF for accepting the challenge of the Government in the May 1988 economic statement to combine with the Government so that there will be more resources against these potentially disastrous diseases. The industries which will pay, in particular, are the dairy, poultry, sheep meat and beef, pig and wool industries, which will pay about $300,000 of the $750,000. There is no doubt that those industries are all beneficiaries, but they are not the only beneficiaries. There are those who own horses, the equine industry; the deer industry; pets; the livestock breeding industry; and humans. There is a relationship between some diseases of animals and some diseases of humans, so there is certainly a general public health beneficiary with the provision of more resources. </PARA>
<PARA> More of the sheep and cattle livestock industry would be picked up if the livestock slaughter levy were replaced by the livestock transaction levy as a means of collection of money generally for the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, research and promotion, and so forth. It was announced today that the Government is increasing by 18 per cent the charges on the slaughter of animals because the kill will be down this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least I am bringing home the bacon better than the Treasurer (Mr Keating) did last year. To return to the debate, I would hope that when the kill of livestock picks up, there will be an equal 18 per cent reduction in the charges by Government and that the Government will not just use it as a way of reducing its commitment and increasing that of the industry. I believe, however, that the levy should be extended to the other industries which benefit. I know the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) indicated in his second reading speech that it will be considered. The fact that there is no research or promotion levy arrangement or legislation for those industries is no reason for not being able to obtain financial assistance. For example, only a few months ago in the Parliament with the extension of the Horticultural Corporation the nursery industry was made to pay a levy. By negotiating with the providers of pots and other equipment that everybody in the nursery industry uses, the industry was able to collect the required amount of money to pay the levy. There is no reason why the same could not be done in the horse industry and with the pet population and their owners. They are major beneficiaries of keeping these diseases out of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next question concerns who controls the money that is raised. We are talking about an exotic disease Bill and we certainly have some exotic titles in relation to it. We have the exotic disease preparedness trust account to look after the money and the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council which will advise on the use of the money as well as giving general and broader advice on priorities. That is one of the purposes of the broadening of advice-for it is a purpose to broaden advice-so that bodies other than the Australian Agricultural Council and the departments can be consulted about priorities and the best way of doing things. There will be eight members on the Council: one from the Australian Agricultural Council; one from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy; two from the National Farmers Federation; one who is expert in disaster and emergency management; one who is expert in communications and public relations; one who is expert in agricultural marketing; and one from the veterinary profession. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the concerns of the farmers of Australia, as represented by the National Farmers Federation, was that the Minister would be able to increase the levy unnecessarily or to transfer the responsibility from government or reduce the responsibility of government against the wishes of the industries concerned. I understand that one of the amendments which the Government has accepted and will be presenting is that the NFF representatives will have a veto on the rate of the levy-that is, the Minister will not be able to introduce a levy higher than that which was last recommended by the NFF representatives. I think that that is a sensible safeguard and certainly it improves the attitude of the Opposition parties to the legislation. Another sensible amendment is that any direction that the Minister gives to the council in relation to its duties must be a written direction by the Minister and must be tabled in Parliament as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of concern is the role of the States. The State governments have been involved very much in animal disease prevention over the years. After all, they have their own responsibilities for primary industries and livestock industries in their States. They provide finance and adopt measures and programs in their own right. They are also agents of the Commonwealth in this area. They will pay 50 per cent of the cost of the control programs if there is any outbreak of exotic diseases. The States are also represented through the Australian Agricultural Council and the Ausvetplan which will be put into place in any such outbreak. So it is important to maintain the commitment of the States to both financial and procedural involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received representations from State Ministers and concerned people in State parliaments concerning the duplication of advice from the proposed council and the Agricultural Council in relation to exotic diseases; the relationship of the Ausvetplan to the proposed preparedness council; and the fact that there will be only one Agricultural Council member on that consultative council. There is also a hint in the Minister's second reading speech that the financial arrangements between the Federal and State governments could be altered by this new levy and fund. I believe that it is important to recognise first of all that there is a need for a broader advice and expertise arrangement than was the case with just the Agricultural Council and the States, but similarly there should be a recognition that the States must continue to have an important role to play in which they feel that they are a continuing part of the process. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I want to make is that this legislation presents us with an elaborate mechanism-the procedure, the council and the collection of levies; the amendment of about eight Bills-to put in place a new procedure to prevent what is possibly avoidable, that is, these disastrous animal diseases or pests that could have such an impact on our animal industries. We support that. It is important. The farmers of Australia support is, although reluctantly, because they believe the Government should be doing that anyway. But we could do all this and then another arm of the Federal Government, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), through its policy of acceptable risk on the importation of animals and plants, could blow the whole thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise that most seriously. I am greatly concerned that we run a great risk of exotic diseases coming into this country officially through this policy of AQIS. This almost occurred with deer from New Zealand twelve months ago. There are other examples. I want to make that point in conclusion. What a disaster it would be if we collect all this extra money, set up all these procedures, do all these things for the benefit of the livestock industries of Australia and yet, through the official importation of animals, we allow the diseases which we are trying to prevent to be brought into this country. As I said earlier, the Opposition supports the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some years ago the then Livestock and Grain Producers Association of New South Wales, the predecessor of the present New South Wales Farmers Association, warned that an outbreak of some exotic diseases could devastate rural economies and ruin many of our country towns. It is very hard for people to visualise this but it could happen because an outbreak like that could virtually wipe out Australia's meat exports. An outbreak in the poultry industry could virtually wipe out chicken meat production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Heeding the views of organisations like the farmer organisations and a wide range of people, not long after the Hawke Government was elected in 1983 it recognised for the first time, under the capable guidance of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), the need to do something about Australia's feral animal problem and the potential of that problem to spread exotic disease. About seven years ago I recall talking in the local pub at Nimmitabel in Eden-Monaro to a couple of people, Bernie Owers and Col Hunt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nimmitabel pub. I do not know whether the honourable member for Farrer has been that far away from his border, but it is certainly not very far from it. Col Hunt, who lived there at the time, and Bernie Owers talked about the feral animal problem in the Nimmitabel area-not only dogs, which were a real worry to farmers, but also pigs. I am sure that the honourable members who are here in the House today-all of whom, I note, represent country electorates-are aware of the importance of dealing with feral pigs, which constitute a more subtle danger than feral dogs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just after the Hawke Government came to office in 1983 and then again in 1984 I convened two Search conferences on these matters with the encouragement of people such as Col Hunt. Following the conferences, the Government initiated a number of measures to work towards control of feral animals and exotic disease outbreak in feral populations. This occurred after two attempts-first by the Minister in the previous Government, Mr Ralph Hunt, and then by the present Minister himself-to get a national Federal Government program on the ground. The honourable member for Werriwa, the present Minister, succeeded with his third attempt. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with the success of that, we have developed a network of a whole range of experts inside and outside the government. State and Federal experts have come up with many of the answers that we need. Some of them were referred to by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). Col Hunt himself is now an expert in feral animal containment through electric fencing. It is great to have seen him involved in some of the programs which were developed as a result of the initiation by this Government of a national program. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Exotic Animal Disease Control Bill is to establish the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council and the exotic animal disease preparedness trust account. The Council is going to consolidate work which has already been done towards exotic disease preparedness. This includes the establishment of an animal resources branch in the then Bureau of Animal Health, now the Bureau of Rural Resources, under the very capable directorship of Dr George Wilson. Then there was the establishment of a wildlife and exotic diseases program in 1984, coordinated by the Bureau of Rural Resources. As well as that there was substantial funding for feral animal control under the community employment program. That is where Col Hunt had his entry into feral animal control. Then there were continuing employment programs in feral animal control. It is great to have worked with the Federal Minister and with people in his Department like George Wilson and David Murray so that we can have continuing employment programs in feral animal control. Not only are those people tackling the problem at the time; they are also training people in an area where we need plenty of expertise. In the past seven years my office staff and I have worked hard on the feral animal control issue because it is a matter of vital economic importance, and it is also important to the conservation of native flora and fauna, including those in national parks. I have been able to keep abreast of the excellent efforts being made under the exotic diseases program through the Bureau of Rural Resources to determine appropriate strategies and epidemiology priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Introduced-that is, feral-and some native wild animals pose a major risk in an exotic disease emergency for a number of reasons: they are widespread, they are abundant, they are thought to share disease susceptibility of domestic stock, and they often lurk close to domestic stock. The potential of feral animals to destroy our rural industries and the Australian economy in an exotic disease outbreak is very often underestimated. We need to look to control feral and wild animals if we are to protect our domestic animals, let alone our native animals. If we are to contain disease in domestic stock, then control in feral and wild animals is vital. The techniques for their survey, sampling, containment and control are of the utmost importance and will save our domestic farm animals in the event of exotic disease outbreak. The contribution of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, through the Animal Resources Branch, is matched by at least 50 per cent State or Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation funding, resources and equipment. The projects are considered by the Animal Health Committee and the Vertebrate Pests Committee before going to the Standing Committee on Agriculture. The results of all these projects, which involve scientific research on feral animal control and research into strategic possibilities for control, are the basis of operational plans for incorporation in Ausvetplan and State exotic disease control plans. </PARA>
<PARA> Ausvetplan, the Australian veterinary emergency plan, coordinated by the Commonwealth Government as an element within the national control counter disaster plan, is extremely important. It provides a comprehensive structure which brings together animal health and counter disaster arrangements at Commonwealth, State and local levels. It cannot be overestimated. The national plan is important to deal with an exotic disease outbreak-so near that one trembles-and I notice the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) was hesitant in calling an exotic disease outbreak avoidable. He said, `We hope it is avoidable' or `It is possibly avoidable' and that is about as far as we can go. One trembles to call it avoidable. </PARA>
<PARA> The objectives of the exotic disease preparedness program are to provide a rapid eradication capability and thereby reduce the time domestic livestock are subject to disease outbreaks and their associated costs to farmers. The program's objectives are also to prevent such exotic disease outbreaks becoming endemic within Australia, while eradication is considered to be reasonably feasible. Establishment of this Bill will give effect to a commitment announced in the Government policy statement entitled Primary Industries and Resources, Policies for Growth. This aims to raise Australia's preparedness in emergencies to an ever higher level of readiness. The Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council will consist of eight part time members supported by a national secretariat located in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Its role will be to provide an independent stream of advice to the Government on exotic disease control policy and operations. It is intended that advice from the Council will focus especially on the wider management, social and financial implications of disease eradication operation. It will complement the excellent work already being done in the Bureau of Rural Resources by the Animal Resources Branch. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we should not lose sight of the expertise in that branch or in any way diminish its vital work in exotic disease control planning. There are areas where the Government needs to be wary about replacing important expertise with people who may well be good administrators. It is important that we listen to those people. I can think of a range of areas within government-the forestry industry, for instance, engineering, pharmaceutical benefits and the health area-where we ought not to lose sight of the need for close contact between those who are doing the research and those who are implementing the results of that research. In some cases those who are qualified should be the ones to do the job. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) first introduced a national program in 1983-84 tremendous strides have been made by Federal and State Governments through the funding of the feral animal control programs. I believe that these ought to continue. If anything, the whole area has been underfunded. It is important that we maintain-indeed, increase-funding under these programs. It is particularly important that we support every measure that can possibly be taken to ensure that Australia is protected against a possible exotic disease outbreak. It is with great pleasure that I support the Bills before the House. </PARA>

<PARA> It is a little sad that I should rise to give this speech in a House as empty as this one is. I do not say that in any egotistical way. I do not expect honourable members to come flooding into the House to hear what I have to say, but I think the importance to the nation of the legislation currently before the House has largely been overlooked by the Parliament and the nation generally. We live in a veritable paradise. We live in a nation relatively free from the nastiest of exotic diseases. Because we have known nothing but this paradise for the produce of livestock we have scant regard for the real asset that is ours. The importance this House should place on quarantine and on keeping Australia free from exotic animal diseases cannot be overstated. The reason the Opposition supports the legislation presently before the House is simply that we recognise the importance of having a nation that continues to be free from exotic animal diseases and of having in place a committee that can act speedily if ever an exotic animal disease should be located in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is entirely topical that I should address this matter on this day. It is entirely topical that the legislation should have come into this House today, Wednesday, 16 August. While we speak here, quarantine officers, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and every Australian sheep farmer are concerned about the delay in the unloading of live sheep in Saudi Arabia-a delay that has resulted entirely from a rumour that those live sheep were infected with the blue-tongue virus. The Minister has given us an assurance, and we have no reason to doubt his word, that those sheep are entirely free from the blue-tongue virus and from any other exotic disease. In fact, Anita Poddar pointed out in Monday's Advertiser that rarely has any strain of the bluetongue virus been found in Australia and never in commercial livestock. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> Several strains of the virus have been found in midges in northern Australia but the disease has never occurred in any flock. </PARA>
<PARA>The impact of the live sheep industry on agriculture in Australia is not appreciated widely enough. Yesterday an Australian news broadcaster pointed out that Australia exported 7.1 million live sheep worth $250m to the Middle East last financial year and about half of this went to Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabian market is worth somewhere between $70m and $125m to our economy, not to mention the boost it gives to the sheep industry by providing this market for live sheep. The news broadcast said:</PARA>
<PARA> The troubles started a fortnight ago when edicts from King Faud prevented 192,000 sheep in two ships being unloaded after reports that they had a rare disease bluetongue. </PARA>
<PARA> Late last week another consignment of 33,500 sheep was rejected because of claims that they had sheep pox. </PARA>
<PARA> ``None of these claims has been supported by clinical evidence of any description . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Today we are dealing with a proposal to allow us to reassure the rest of the world that not only is Australia free from the worst of the exotic diseases but also were any disease to be found here it would be acted on promptly because of the establishment of the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council to be funded under the legislation presently before the House. Because of the importance of this legislation, because of the fundamental importance of maintaining a nation which has a reputation around the world for being vigilant in the way in which it deals with quarantine and disease control, the Opposition is prepared to support the Bill though we do not think it is a Bill that is in any sense perfect. In fact, we recognise that there are several amendments that would go a long way towards improving the Bill's overall efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not alone in the concerns we have expressed. We express them not purely for the sake of making a cheap political point but to echo concerns of the National Farmers Federation (NFF) and what it has already said to the Government about this legislation. I will quote briefly from a letter that Mr Prendergast of the National Farmers Federation sent to the honourable member for Murray when expressing concern about some of the detail of this legislation to establish the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council. Mr Prendergast said that the National Farmers Federation was largely in favour of this proposal. First, Mr Prendergast said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a prima facie case that more resources need to be allocated to improve Australia's exotic disease preparedness . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is what this legislation does. Secondly, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> That there is scope for better co-ordination between commodities . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Council will allow that. Thirdly, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> That in certain circumstances it is appropriate that industry contributes to the funding. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, this Bill ensures entirely that that will happen. In fact, the industry contributing to the funding is one of the areas of concern to which the Opposition wants to alert both the Government and the nation. The NFF, in its letter to the honourable member for Murray, has said that it has been concerned to ensure that the scheme is not used simply to fund Government responsibilities with industry moneys. The honourable member for Murray has alluded to this and expanded on this point. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a commitment by primary industry in Australia to find three-quarters of a million dollars for the establishment of this Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council-three-quarters of a million dollars that is coming from the livestock producers in Australia; three-quarters of a million dollars that is not being matched in any way by the livestock people who raise horses, deer or other breeding livestock. Even more significantly, this three-quarters of a million dollars is not being contributed to in any way by the millions of Australians who keep pets of one kind or another. All of those people will benefit because Australia will be exotic disease free and we have a guarantee that, should exotic disease occur, we have a Council that can act promptly to wipe it out. All of them benefit but the contribution to make this legislation and Council work comes from the livestock producers who are already paying levies and are therefore obliged to make an additional contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in his second reading speech, said that less than 0.01 per cent of the gross value of the industries would be required to fund this Council. That is perfectly true. One might say it is peanuts, but it is still an imposition being borne by primary producers on behalf of the total community. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Farmers Federation recognises, as did the honourable member for Murray, that while the Bill is not perfect, it is welcomed. Furthermore, the National Farmers Federation recognises, as did the honourable member for Murray, that the Government has agreed to make some amendments to the way in which levies are collected to ensure that a more equitable collection system applies than was originally proposed. We support this legislation because we recognise the importance of quarantine to Australia's export industry, particularly its livestock industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I grew up in an area that was quarantined and declared fruit fly free. That is unrelated to the Bill but it has this significance-in that area I recognised the importance of keeping the Riverland of South Australia fruit fly free and I recognised that this was only possible by diligent and vigilant exercise from the Department of Agriculture in ensuring that all people who entered or left the area did so through a road block that was policed. That has been invaluable for South Australia's horticultural exports. It has been invaluable for the region. This legislation has the capacity to be similarly invaluable for the nation. It allows us to declare to the world that we have a veritable paradise in terms of the control of exotic diseases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Lindsay review on quarantine gave us a national perspective of what our quarantine should be all about. This legislation protects an industry estimated to be worth almost $8 billion. It is important to have protections in place because the people with whom we trade are so fiercely competitive. As we have seen this week in the case of the live sheep trade into Saudi Arabia, the smallest excuse for a quarantine claim can jeopardise an entire industry. The quarantine wing of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has been diligent in the past and in 1985, for example, successfully stamped out an outbreak of avian influenza, which was prominent in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> We recognise that the importation of animals is a real risk to Australia. This sort of quarantine standard helps us not only to declare to the rest of the world that the animals we send overseas are exotic disease free but also to ensure that the animals we bring into Australia are similarly disease free. A real concern is being expressed-and it is relevant to this legislation that I say so-by the pig industry about the importation of pig meat into Australia and the possible occurrence in Australia of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) as a result of pig meats coming into Australia. The honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) alerted my office to say that he had been approached by the Darling Downs Pork Producers' Association, which was concerned that too little had been done to control the importation of fresh pork and the possible spread of TGE as a result. The honourable member for Groom and I have mutually agreed that a committee which I chair on behalf of the Opposition ought to be meeting with the quarantine wing of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to ensure that all that can be done is being done to satisfy pork producers across Australia that TGE and the importation of fresh pork will not pose a major problem. I know that the honourable member for Groom will be pleased to be able to reassure the Darling Downs Pork Producers' Association that this matter has not simply been conveniently overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to a comment made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) who preceded me in this debate. He said that the honourable member for Murray had been hesitant in reassuring the House that we could be sure that the legislation would keep Australia exotic disease free. The honourable member for Murray was responsible in being hesitant because this Bill contains no reassurance that Australia will be exotic disease free. This Bill allows us to put in place a consultative council that can reassure those who receive our produce that everything that can be done is being done to keep the nation exotic disease free. In fact, it is not possible to avoid perfectly the importation of exotic diseases; it is possible to be constantly vigilant as a nation. It is because this Bill allows us to be constantly vigilant and to be more efficient than we otherwise would have been in the policing, stamping out and, preferably, the total restriction on any exotic diseases, that I am pleased to support its passage through the House this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, like the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), have reason to be grateful to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service for the work which it has undertaken over the years to ensure that, as much as possible, our primary industry is disease free. I come from an area which has a very large potato growing industry. We know that Australia's potato growing industry has always been concerned about the possibility of potato nematode and diseases such as black wart coming in from places such as New Zealand. The golden cyst nematode is endemic in other countries as well. If those diseases were to come into Australia there would be very serious effects upon the economy of all potato growing areas. It certainly would mean that we would not be in a position to maintain the integrity of the industry. So, like the honourable member for Wakefield, I am very grateful to the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has served the nation particularly well in restricting the number of exotic diseases entering the country and threatening our very important primary industries. It has always been to our advantage as a marketer of primary industry commodities to be able to sell our goods on world markets with the knowledge that our history of clean products provided us with a competitive advantage over other nations. It has to be recognised that our farm products earn this nation about 40 per cent of our export revenue. While there might be some argument about whether that is something to be relied upon in the future, nevertheless it is and always has been extremely important to Australia's economy. I imagine that it will be that way proportionately for a long time to come, until such time as our manufacturing industries take up the offers that have been made to them to accept the challenge to restructure Australia's economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I need hardly remind the House that an outbreak of any of the exotic diseases covered by the then Prime Minister's Premiers agreement of 1955 would have had a devastating effect upon our economy as a whole and upon the livelihood of farm families and rural communities in particular. I applaud the amendment to the package of draft legislation which was tabled on 24 May 1989. Because of the likelihood that an outbreak of a new exotic disease would occur without warning, immediate response to that risk is vital if the outbreak is to be contained and controlled. The current mechanism for taking action is inappropriate to meet this contingency because it is too slow at the implementation level. Therefore, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has decided to amend the Exotic Animal Disease Control Bill to enable the new exotic disease to be determined by regulation, which means that action can be taken immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the importance of the industry sector to our economy it has been necessary to ensure that the most up-to-date plan for ensuring its secure future be in place. Of course, that is covered by the Bill. The establishment of the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council will mean that we have the basis for the mechanism that is necessary to ensure not only the maintenance of the high standards of our quarantine service, but also that it is improved. Given that there exists even greater threat to our livestock industry through modern travel and greater volumes of trade between nations, the need for such planning cannot be stressed too much. It is a very sobering thought that, as estimated in 1985, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease could cost Australia between $2 billion and $3 billion per annum. That is a very large number of bickies. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AI4">Mr MILDREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite true; as the honourable member for Wannon says, it could well be more. Our freedom from diseases such as foot and mouth disease has ensured that our industry access to markets has been as good as it is. The introduction to the summary document of the Australian veterinary emergency plan of 1987 stresses the difficulties posed by animal disease emergencies. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The economic impact is immediately national; not focal. </PARA>
<PARA> The operational phase of the emergency control is usually much longer, lasting weeks, months or years. </PARA>
<PARA> The demand for resources may be very much larger and may continue for a much longer time. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for many essential control measures will not always be obvious to the general public or to many of the people called upon to provide assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>If the disease becomes endemic the impact on the economy and communities is immediate and long lasting. In my own area, should foot and mouth disease break out, it would devastate the economies of Ballarat, Ararat, Stawell, Beaufort, Avoca and, I might say, even areas beyond the boundaries of my electorate-it is difficult to contain it-such as Hamilton, every small community on the plains of the great and extraordinarily productive Western District of Victoria and the communities to the north and west of the Pyrenees. I say `all of those communities', because all of them are integral to the kind of farming that takes place. </PARA>
<PARA> Ausvetplan, which is now in place, provides a comprehensive approach to coping with outbreaks of any of the threatening exotic diseases. To the individual farmer, understandably, sometimes the measures appear to be drastic. The necessary destruction of livestock can mean a whole life's work disappears, but on sober reflection every farmer knows that these measures are necessary. If it were not his farm, it might well have been someone else's. Australia faces problems that are peculiar to this country. Vast tracts of land are sparsely inhabited. Although much of it is composed of grazing properties, the carrying capacity of those areas is low. Stock roam over large areas as grasslands are seldom lush. But the same territory is also subject to the presence of feral stock such as brumbies, camels, pigs, goats, donkeys, buffalo, wild cattle and deer. All these animals are possible vectors, and control mechanisms of outbreaks in remote areas are logistically very complex. I know that my colleague the honourable member for Hawker would agree with me that if we were to have an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the north of Australia, its control would be almost impossible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am sorry. The honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Harvey) does not have a great number of farmers in her electorate, now that I come to think of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While farmers and farmer organisations, and meat processors and related unions are quite aware of the potential damage and cost of diseases such as foot and mouth disease, I doubt whether city dwellers know very much about it. But it is of as much significance to them as it is to anybody else. In fact, in some respects, it is more so. I stress to those who might be concerned about city issues who may well be listening tonight that they should recognise that we are still a nation which is dependent upon primary industry for a large proportion of its export earnings. Programs that are part and parcel of everyday expectations such as those associated with education, health, community services and social security would be hard hit in the event of an outbreak of a disease such as foot and mouth disease. Not only would control mechanisms be massively expensive, but we would also lose billions of dollars worth of trade. As a favoured supplier, our status would be lost and our premium markets would close. Hence the need for the most stringent of quarantine regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia enjoys a reputation for its high standards of quarantine, and this must be maintained and constantly enhanced by reviewing procedures and putting in place the most modern scientific knowledge and surveillance procedures. I am not surprised to learn of the cooperation of the various primary industry groups involved in producing livestock in being prepared to make their contribution to ensuring that our record is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister indicated, our exports of livestock and livestock products are currently worth $8 billion per annum. We do not want that jeopardised. He gave us an indication of the immediate trade implications of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease and what it would do to our United States market. Immediately our US market would close for 12 months-possibly longer, because we would have to get back into that market; we would have to demonstrate the integrity of our livestock. I emphasise foot and mouth disease even though there is quite a large range of new exotic diseases. I know that the Minister has demonstrated his capacity in regard to foot and mouth disease quite often. I want to stress how extremely important the establishment of the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council is. I compliment the Minister on having been able to gain the cooperation of the industry sectors in making their contribution to the Exotic Disease Preparedness Trust Account. With the Government being prepared to match its cost on a dollar for dollar basis, this will ensure that it has the money to draw upon to ensure that the kinds of programs that it wishes to put in place are able to get under way as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the way the Opposition has supported the Exotic Animal Disease Control Bill. It is understandable that occasionally Opposition members find an opportunity to say a few words here and there. It is an extremely important Bill and its implications are far reaching. As I said, we want to maintain the integrity of the quarantine services that we have in this country. This legislation will ensure that that takes place. I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting this legislation. I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is easy to support the sentiments of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Mildren) in many ways. In speaking to the legislation before the House I will be concentrating on the Exotic Animal Disease Control Bill. The points that have been raised already highlight the importance of maintaining Australia's exotic disease free status. I also commend the honourable member for Ballarat for making the point about the importance of this subject to people not just on the land, not just in small country towns but also city dwellers. That is a point that ought to be underlined. It should be brought home to all Australians more often, because, as has been pointed out already, an $8 billion a year industry is not one we can afford to see affected adversely, as it may well be if we were to have an outbreak of one of these exotic diseases or pests. This $8 billion industry, by any measure, is our largest export industry. Our present parlous current account status underlines yet again the importance of maintaining these exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also very important to realise how vigilant we must be in maintaining preparedness against exotic diseases. It is always difficult to assess that level of preparedness when we do not see a real outbreak. We can believe that we are properly prepared, but until our preparedness is put to the test, it is only our best assessment. Clearly, the moves that are being foreshadowed in this Bill are another step in the right direction. It is important that we not only support this step but also continue to build on that because there are so many ways in which exotic diseases can come into Australia. With increased air travel, with increased trade, with the increase in the number of people coming through our airports-not to mention some of the illegal visitors we seem to have from time to time along our northern shores-the risk of an outbreak is ever present. In many ways the risk is increased on a purely exponential basis by the growing number of people and articles coming into Australia every year.</PARA>
<PARA> While we talk about the effect that an outbreak may have on our livestock industries, we also have to consider the effect it would have on our native fauna. Again, this should be brought home to people in the cities who are concerned about our flora and fauna and about the environment in general so that they realise that the outbreak of an exotic disease in Australia would have dramatic effects right across the country, not just on our livestock industries but on all areas. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this and many other reasons that it is so important that we maintain our disease free status. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), the value of some areas of trade, such as the live sheep trade, is so important that we have to be ever vigilant. The recent concern over the live sheep trade to Saudi Arabia highlights yet again the dramatic impact that even a relatively isolated incident or two can have on the live sheep trade. Already the price of boat sheep, boat wethers, has fallen significantly-by anything up to 25 per cent-in the last couple of months. No doubt what is happening in the Middle East right now could well see that fall continue. So the danger is very real; it is very immediate. As has been pointed out by other speakers, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease alone would completely close off our meat exports to America and we would not be able to regain those exports for at least 12 months after we had cleaned up the outbreak. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to control an outbreak, if it occurs-hopefully we could avoid it in the first place-we have to consider three main factors: first of all, an adequate legislative framework; secondly, a workable plan to contain the outbreak; and, thirdly, current practices in relation to that control. There have been some flaws in that area and I hope that this Bill will lead to the setting up of a council that will rectify these problems. In fact, the legislative framework at a Federal level is primarily concerned with preventing the introduction of disease or anything that may carry that disease. Clearly, the States and the Territories have legislation that is concerned with eradicating disease should an outbreak occur at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, with the present system of quarantine and stock disease legislation we do not have a coordinated or blanket approach to this problem. So it is important for the Commonwealth and the States to have the necessary powers to contain promptly and eradicate an outbreak of any exotic disease or living pest. It is also vital that everyone realise that the consequences of any inadequacies in the preparedness of State and Federal governments will have to be borne by us all, not just by the primary producers. I think that is a point that should be reinforced again and again because it is so easy, particularly for those living in cities, to feel that they are immune from the effects of such an outbreak. We have to remember the enormous impact that an outbreak of an exotic disease would have on our trade. We have to realise that we are talking not just of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars a year but of billions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been pointed out, model plans aimed at controlling various diseases have been developed by the Commonwealth over the period since 1955. Regrettably, it seems to have taken an awfully long time to get from there to here. Maybe it is fortunate that we have not seen any serious outbreaks in that period. Overall, there have been a number of scares, and I would like to talk about one or two of those because I think they highlight some of the problems we could have. We have had some scares in Australia, including at Portland in my electorate. The likely cost of foot and mouth disease has been highlighted; it could be of the order of $2 billion to $3 billion per annum. I would suggest that, if screw-worm fly were to take hold in Australia, it could cost a similar amount. Of course, the effects would not just be on our livestock industry; they would be widespread throughout some of our native fauna as well. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recalling that in April last year some dead screw-worm flies were found on a ship in Darwin. While these flies were actually discovered on 4 April they were not sent to Canberra for positive identification until 12 May and that identification took until 18 May. I think that highlights the fact that we have to improve our preparedness; we have to improve our response rate. It took six weeks from the time those flies were found until they were positively identified-far too long if those flies had been only part of a group which had escaped. In another case, on a ship that left Darwin for the Philippines two cattle were found to have died. Those cattle, which were thrown overboard, had wounds that were consistent with screw-worm fly, but no samples of the maggots were taken so it is hard to prove exactly what the wounds were. On another occasion, nine dead screw-worm flies were found on a ship in Portland. Whilst they were dead-certainly for most of the year the climate in southern Australia is not conducive to the spread of screw-worm fly-it is not impossible for unusual climatic conditions to prevail at the time a ship comes into a southern port. On an occasion such as that it is possible to foresee a scenario where screw-worm fly could escape and take hold in Australia. As I have said, if that were to happen the cost to Australian industry would run into billions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about the effects on our major export industries of a disaster of enormous proportions. Accordingly, it is very important that the moves proposed in this legislation are seen to be effective. Industry has been asked to contribute three-quarters of a million dollars, which the Government will match. Whether that is adequate I think should be reviewed regularly, although, as I said at the beginning of my speech, without a positive outbreak it is always difficult to know whether the state of preparedness we believe we have is really sufficient. Nonetheless, it is a serious matter and one that we should continue to address. </PARA>
<PARA> The concerns of the National Farmers Federation should be taken on board by the Government-namely, that pet owners, horse owners and deer owners will not be paying anything towards the levy while they will stand to benefit from the work that will be done by the council that will be set up under this legislation. That is something the Government might consider looking at further. The level of funding has to be put in this light: it is not a question of industry picking up the cost of a service that should properly be borne by government. Clearly, while the livestock industry is the immediate beneficiary, Australia as a whole is benefiting by maintaining that exotic disease-free status. As I have said before, the possible effects, not just on the livestock industries but also on Australian native fauna would be dramatic. If such an outbreak were to move into the household pet area this would bring home the problem to people in the cities. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to add my support to this legislation. While I believe it has the one or two shortcomings I have highlighted, I think it is a positive step in the right direction. If we can maintain that exotic disease-free status in Australia we will be doing our livestock industries and our great export industries an enormous favour; we will be maintaining something that is for the benefit of all Australians. As the honourable member for Wakefield pointed out in his concluding remarks, no reassurance is ever sufficient to completely assure the livestock producers of this country that we can maintain that disease-free status. Every day thousands of people and thousands of objects are coming into this country from overseas, any one of which could bring with it the seeds of disaster. We have to be ever vigilant. I sincerely hope that this Bill is a positive step in helping to maintain the position where Australia's livestock producers can take advantage of markets right round the world. If we were to lose that position we would certainly find ourselves very much the poorer and this would affect all Australians, not just our livestock producers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to speak to the Exotic Animal Disease Control Bill and cognate Bills tonight. There is a series of amendments to existing Acts which cover a wide range of livestock, most of which seem to reside in the large electorate of Maranoa, including the wild ones as well as the domesticated ones. That probably includes some humans as well as the animals! I would have liked to have seen the Bill entitled the Exotic Animal Control Bill. What is needed in this country is an attempt by government to wipe out some of the exotic feral animals that are wandering our countryside rather than an attack on the diseases that they might be carrying. I would have thought it more sensible to spend the money and efforts of these people who are going to get together on the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council on looking at a program of attempting to annihilate some of these species.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, this is happening in the Northern Territory where the wild buffaloes, which were introduced back in the 1870s, are being brought under control. They are being shot out from helicopters. The Northern Territory and Commonwealth governments are spending a lot of money up there because of the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication programs which have been foisted upon us mainly by the United States Government. With those diseases present, it does not particularly want our meat. They are not exotic diseases, but they are quite prevalent. Both the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the primary producers of this country have done an excellent job in bringing these diseases under control. Of course, the annihilation of the buffalo in its wild state is essential. The only animals of that species that will be retained will be behind barbed wire and will at least be controlled to a certain extent. Obviously, a few always escape, which is how these diseases are introduced into this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is the biggest island in the world. For many years the Aboriginals migrated with their wild pigs, which came down from New Guinea and established themselves in the Cape York Peninsula area. The Indonesian islands to the north-west are full of foot and mouth disease. It is a miracle that we have not had some of these diseases introduced up to this time. That that has not occurred is only as a result of the vigilance of the quarantine services that have been established. An all-up amount of about $168m per year is spent. Of course, 60 per cent of that is recouped from the livestock and wool industries in Australia to help the taxpayer and the Government keep these diseases under control. Nobody likes being sprayed up and down with some exotic spray when he arrives in Australia from foreign shores. It is probably one of these sprays that escapes into the environment and causes all sorts of supposed problems including blowing holes in the ozone layer. There has always been a hole in the ozone layer. From the way in which some people carry on one would think it had only just arrived. None of us likes being sprayed up and down, but it has a distinct purpose, which is to help kill any foreign insects that might be on the aircraft. Of course, we do not want any of those insects to come to our shores. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the outbreak of some exotic diseases that is of concern. Some exotic diseases have actually been introduced to help control our feral animals. Probably the most successful was myxomatosis in rabbits. It is an exotic virus that eventually sends rabbits blind, gives them a fever and kills them. The cane toad has also been brought in. It was introduced as an exotic animal to help control beetles and some sort of insect in the cane industry. These things are not always able to be controlled. The cane toad seems to be wandering across northern Australia and will probably be a bigger curse than a plus when it is finished with. The cactoblastis was introduced in my own area from South America in the 1920s and 1930s. The cactus or prickly pear itself was introduced as an exotic plant. There are many species of plants which have been introduced as well as diseases that have to be controlled. The cactus loved our very rich fertile brigalow lands, went berserk and spread very rapidly from the centre of New South Wales right up into northern Queensland. The cactoblastis was introduced by the Department and the researchers who were involved in Queensland. They have managed not to wipe out the cactus but certainly to keep it under control. If the cactoblastis ever died out, the cactus itself would take off and become a pest again. </PARA>
<PARA> This new piece of legislation called the Exotic Animals Disease Control Bill 1989 will involve amendments to the Wool Marketing Act, the Dairy Produce Act and the Rural Industries Research Act. In this cognate debate there will also be amendments to the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Act, the Egg Industry (Hen Quota) Levy Act, the Laying Chicken Levy Act, the Meat Chicken Levy Act, the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act and the Pig Slaughter Levy Act. They are all being amended to include amendments to the levies that are collected from these producers to raise revenue. It is being funded dollar for dollar by the Federal Government. The industry is putting up $750,000 and the Government is putting in the equivalent amount to take it up to $1.5m. The wool industry is putting up about $300,000 of that $750,000, so one can see how important the wool industry continues to be to the nation. It is paying a very large percentage. The percentage which each industry will contribute is worked out in each of the Acts. The livestock industry is contributing 26 per cent, the wool industry about 30 per cent, the pig industry 4 per cent, and so it goes on. The percentage is tied roughly to the gross income of that industry, the percentage of the levy is applied and then the particular levy is collected. </PARA>
<PARA> From what I have read, I am not too sure what the council intends to do other than look at means and ways of continuing to help us control the outbreak of diseases. The council to be set up will consist of eight part-time members, two from the National Farmers Federation, a representative from the Australian Agricultural Council, an officer from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and three people with special qualifications. The council will terminate in June 1995. I am not sure why it should terminate then. I would have thought that something like this-I guess it is a sunset clause-ought to continue if it is regarded as useful. I object to the industries continuing to have to contribute so much. It is amazing that some of the exotic diseases around, particularly those associated with humans, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) which has been introduced into this country of late, have had an increase of $7m in the Budget. We are now spending up to $60m a year to control the exotic human disease called AIDS but when it comes to controlling livestock exotic diseases and looking after our animals which we depend on so much for our exports of wool and beef, et cetera, the producer has to contribute half. </PARA>
<PARA> The same applies to the inspection levies. The industry is currently putting in 60 per cent and the Government 40 per cent. There has been an announcement today that the inspection levies are going up. Since the Budget was announced there has been a trickling out of the increases. These can be called taxation or whatever we like but they are levies. They are in a sense attacks on the industry. There has been an increase of 18 per cent in the levy. It has gone up 18 per cent today. That is running well ahead of the inflation figure, even at 7 1/2 per cent. Inflation was meant to be 4 1/2 per cent last year. It turned out at about 7 per cent, about double what the Treasurer (Mr Keating) thought it would be. He has estimated that in the coming 12 months the inflation rate will be 7 1/2 per cent. We have seen an 18 per cent increase in these sorts of charges. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the Minister at the table, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), that I hope that this quango that is being set up will not increase the charges of the inspection people. We have seen a rise from $22 to $26 an hour for the meat inspection services and an increase in the inspectors' salaries of about $6,000 a year. That has been passed on to the meat producer. Our policy is to at least try to reduce that burden a little and go for a 50 per cent recovery. The Labor Party is presently opting for a 60 per cent recovery of the cost associated with that service. It is one of the biggest items. It is running at over $100m per year for our meat inspection services. That is a similar sort of thing. It covers the inspection of meat for diseases that might be in carcasses before they are exported to other parts of the world, particularly to America, which imposed these inspection services on us when we picked up the huge market that became available to us. It is very important for us to spend the sort of money we do to keep our product free of these diseases. At the end of the day, when the markets get tough, it is the quality of our product and the fact that we do not have some of these diseases such as foot and mouth in Australia that enables us to maintain our United States beef market. If ever foot and mouth broke out, overnight we would lose that market completely. Not until we can prove to the purchasers of our products that we have totally eradicated the disease will we be able to trade with them again. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important for us to understand that the Fraser Government spent about $350m when in office on the high security quarantine station at Geelong. It was established by the taxpayers of this nation to carry out all sorts of experiments and to breed some of the inoculates that are needed to combat some of these diseases. I still support the concept of not storing the foot and mouth virus in Australia. I think South Africa is the place we have to go to get the inoculant. It is important for constituents and members of the House to understand that in the event of an outbreak of these diseases, the scorched earth policy is the one that will be adopted. Any animal suspected of having such a disease will be shot on sight and buried as quickly as possible. That is extended to cover a radius. One of the jobs of the committee will be to increase the sort of work that is needed to determine how many livestock should be killed. The idea is that it should extend outwards-a bit analogous to the sort of clean-up that happens when an atomic reactor blows up. In the case of disease, everything within sight is buried, animals are killed and as the program extends outwards eventually a stage is reached at which inoculation is started. I guess if it ever happens practically every animal in Australia will have to be inoculated before we can continue to export some of these products. </PARA>
<PARA> Bluetongue has always been a problem in our sheep industry. I also mention the screw-worm fly. We now have a fly which comes further and further south. We have mosquitoes which spread exotic types of fevers amongst humans. Some of the members of this House have been wanting the Government to spend more money in that direction. We also have three-day sickness that breaks out amongst cattle, particularly when the climate becomes more humid and we get a higher rainfall. It encourages the spread of these diseases. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) in the work that he has done since he has been a member of this House to encourage the Government to eradicate more of Australia's feral animals. There is an awful lot of chat about the environment these days. All of a sudden it has become socially acceptable to be a greenie. Even the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), as white as he is, has become a born again green. He spends a lot of time on the golf course. Golf course fairways are totally flattened before grass is put in. It is amazing how all of a sudden we become interested in these things. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess that some of these exotic wild animals are doing more damage to our environment than most things. We have a huge wild pig population roaming this country. Wild pigs do enormous damage in my electorate, especially on my own property. We trap and poison them with 1080 and blast at them with shotguns. We have a game industry set up; people go out nightly to shoot these animals. At least it is keeping them under control. It is similar to the kangaroo quota that we have to keep our kangaroos under control. The Minister would know that there is an enormous population of wild pigs wandering around. They are great carriers of some of these diseases, particularly brucella. I guess that they would get foot and mouth disease quickly and would carry it around if it ever gets here. We should have a program to exterminate them. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a list of animals that I have seen while travelling around the countryside. We have wild pigs, camels, donkeys, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, foxes, rabbits, deer, dogs, cats and rats. There are probably half a dozen other animals we could add to the list. All of these animals that are not native to this country cause enormous problems to the normal livestock which we have introduced. A lot of them have gone wild. The buffalo is not on my list but that animal has caused enormous damage in Kakadu. One of the Labor Party senators said that some of that national park was just clapped out buffalo country. I spent a bit of time there in my younger days tranquillising them. There is no doubt that they did a lot of damage wallowing around and flattening the place generally. But, as I said earlier, they are just about under control. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister and the Government ought to be supporting the honourable member for Eden-Monaro in getting a feral animal control program under way. I know there have been some experiments and some trials have been run. There is a small levy which the councils pay but it is not much. We should be making a greater effort to exterminate some of these animals. The camels are being captured and exported to Saudi Arabia. There is some use in that regard. There are hundreds of them wandering the inland deserts. There are thousands of donkeys in Australia, particularly in the Kimberley area. There are wild cattle everywhere. They are going to be a problem if foot and mouth disease or one of the other exotic diseases breaks out. A lot of them have been brought under control by the brucella program. Those that cannot be mustered have been shot from helicopters or from horseback. There are heaps of goats. Some of them have been crossed with exotic mohair imports and all of a sudden we have some sort of stud goats. But most of the goats in Australia which are now quite popular at the shows have come straight out of the back blocks around Charleville and elsewhere. There are still a lot of wild goats around. It is amazing how many wild sheep one sees when one travels around, the big woolly things running in the scrub. There are many brumbies and they have to be shot. The animal liberationists do not like the sight of this but the brumbies have to be kept under control. Foxes and rabbits seem to be increasing. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that this new committee will do something for us. The Budget was brought down last night. It is a pity that some of the surplus of $9 billion could not go towards this sort of thing. It could have been better spent there than on some of the programs the Government has in place. We are not in government; we are in opposition. We are supporting the legislation tonight. I have much pleasure in doing so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I have been in the House and have heard the contributions of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Mildren), the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron). They have all made substantial points. I am very happy that the Opposition supports the Exotic Animal Disease Control Bill and the amendments that I intend to move to it when we go into the committee stage. The honourable member for Maranoa put a lot of emphasis on feral animal control, and the points he made are true enough. We are focusing attention on buffaloes as a feral population because of a disease affecting them. We have other programs under way in some other feral populations, particularly pigs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those programs are only being trialed and reference to those programs was originally associated with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). He also made reference to the rabbit population. We are looking at a new disease that has decimated the rabbit population in Italy and Spain: namely, viral haemorhagic tracheo-pneumonia. I think it is the disease that I currently have! We spend about $10.7m a year in other programs but mainly the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) screw-worm fly program. There is also foot and mouth vaccine in storage in Britain and a few other similar programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd), in the most comprehensive contribution to the debate, made a general criticism of the Government's policy and administration with respect to the quarantine and exotic disease preparedness response area. He made reference to the acceptable risk criteria and to a National Farmers Federation letter about industry levy questions, particularly with the owners of horses and deer being non-contributors. He said that he hoped the increased funding would not be followed by cuts in other areas. I refer honourable members back to my second reading speech, which makes it plain enough. If I could get horses and deer into levy programs it would be pretty good. But we just do not have the levy base or the organisation to do so. The reason we are going down the path we are is that we already have Bills in place for the collection of levies from the industries in question. We have a levy base which actually enables us to collect levies. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to explain in general terms what we are doing in response to the questions raised by the Deputy Leader of the National Party. The initiative is basically an honest attempt to supplement and augment existing expenditure programs in the exotic disease preparedness and response programs and to broaden the range of policy advice available to government. We were already spending about $700,000 to $750,000 per year. This initiative came from the industry development review I conducted in May 1988, which recommended that we should not only upgrade expenditure in this area but also involve industry more. That flowed from our experience with the introduction into AAHL of various diseases in relation to which there is a need to consult industry and to accept industry advice. Our action has been accepted by the National Farmers Federation and the relevant affiliates with whom we consulted quite comprehensively during the preparation of these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The Exotic Animal Disease Control Bill will not allow the Government to supplant funding of established programs with new industry levy receipts. It is not true to say that benefits will flow equally to all livestock industries, including those that are not making a levy contribution. Discretionary powers exist in the Bill to tailor new expenditure programs in a way which will stream direct benefits exclusively to participating levy payers. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already said, the honourable member for Murray made reference to the acceptable risk approval criteria for introducing new livestock genotypes. The alternative to acceptable risk-that is a pretty tough criterion-is zero risk. But that would simply preclude Australia from the ability to upgrade the livestock genetic base to keep up with overseas competitors. The brahmin herd in this country started with 28 head. With the facility that we now have in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and other facilities for the introduction of other genotypes, we believe that the acceptable risk criteria, if very tightly and scientifically applied, enable us to introduce new genetic material. I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate. </PARA>

Subclause 33 (3) inserts after section 53 of the Wool Marketing Act 1987 section 53a, which requires the Australian Wool Corporation to pay the prescribed amount to the account.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports and accepts the amendments. I hope that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) does not have an exotic disease! There are just two comments I wish to make in relation to what I said earlier and to what the Minister has said. First of all in relation to risk associated with new or better genetic material coming into this country, the Minister said that we need such material, and I completely agree with that. I have been a very strong supporter for many years of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands quarantine facilities. To my knowledge and my belief Cocos has always been acceptably severe in the criteria it has applied to material coming in through that facility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My complaint, my fear and my concern have not been in relation to importation of genetic material via Cocos but to those other arrangements whereby animals are coming directly into Australia after some period of quarantine or isolation, for example, in New Zealand and are then in Australia at an establishment with security arrangements that are not so strict. I am a very strong supporter of the need for new and better genetic material. Cocos provides a degree of security, but I do not believe we should risk the health status of a number of our important livestock industries through some of the importation procedures that have been applied recently. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I make concerns the ability to obtain money from the other industries that are beneficiaries of this greater degree of preparedness against these exotic diseases. The Minister in his second reading speech referred to horses, deer and domestic pets in particular. The Minister has indicated the difficulty of legislation not being in place for research and promotion levies for those industries. I acknowledge that. But the Minister also introduced legislation a few months ago which enabled the nursery industry to obtain finance, as part of its being in the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation, by applying a levy or a charge on certain items used by the nursery industry, thus obviating the necessity for specific legislation. These other industries benefit from the total good of Australia just as much as those that are paying, particularly when one thinks of the very dramatic example of pets and rabies. I hope that if there is to be a charge to industries that are beneficiaries, we will levy it so that all industries pay their fair share. The Government has indicated that there are other ways of collecting money than the traditional way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the absence of my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who is ill with the flu that is going around, I will be opening the debate on this very important legislation on behalf of the Liberal and National parties. The Child Support (Assessment) Bill is designed to implement the second stage of the child support scheme announced by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) on 24 March 1987. The first part of the scheme was implemented by the Child Support Act 1988, which came into effect on 1 June 1988. It provided for the registration, collection and enforcement of court orders for maintenance by the Child Support Agency, which is controlled by the Commissioner of Taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Currently, maintenance is assessed by two methods: agreement, and through the courts. A number of difficulties have arisen when the latter approach must be taken, including the cost of initiating the proceedings and the lack of uniformity in decisions. Difficulties with the first method relate to the low level of maintenance often accepted by mothers in the belief that it is the best they can do. These difficulties have contributed to child poverty and to higher levels of taxation as a consequence of the responsibility on the part of the Government to provide these low income, sole parent families with social security income maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA>Child Support Bill</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of an administrative assessment of the level of child maintenance payable aims to eliminate many of these problems. The development of a formula was referred to the Child Support Consultative Group, chaired by Mr Justice Fogarty of the Family Court, which released its report titled Child Support-Formula for Australia in May 1988. The group took the general approach that the formula should seek to approximate the situation where the parents live together by guaranteeing the child an appropriate share of his or her parents' income. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision by that committee to base its formula on trying to achieve an approximate similarity in the standard of support for children in intact families and those in separated families was very important. In its simplest form the formula will work by taking the non-custodial parent's income, reducing it by a self-support component and dividing the remainder by a relevant percentage, as recommended by the committee and adopted with some minor adjustments by the Government, ranging from 18 per cent to 36 per cent depending on the number of children. </PARA>
<PARA> There will also be provision for certain matters to be referred to a court, such as objections to the administrative decision, matters not covered by the formula, such as child seeking maintenance, and cases where departure from the formula is sought and grounds are found by the court to justify that variation. There will also be a limit on the amount of income that may be taken into account. It was recommended that the self-supporting component for non-custodial parents be related to the level paid under the pension scheme, both for age pensioners and for supporting parents, with adjustments for dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA> The aim of the legislative package is to increase maintenance payments to a realistic level, with particular reference to numerous studies examining the costs of children, most notably studies undertaken by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. The thrust of the Bill is consistent with the stated policy of the Liberal and National parties for reform of family maintenance arrangements. It is also consistent with the recommendations of the 1980 Ruddock Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act. The Opposition maintains its support for the objectives of the legislation, namely, to make people responsible for the outcome of their decisions, and to increase child support payments by non-custodial parents to a more adequate level. The Liberal and National parties support the fact that there is a voluntary element in the scheme. The scheme establishes a minimum, but it is voluntary to the extent that parents can come to their own arrangements so long as no more is claimed under the social security system than would be payable had the formula applied. </PARA>
<PARA> The payment of maintenance for children in this country has been monumentally inadequate, and the cost to taxpayers has been massive. For too long the social security system has had to bear the burden of people who have chosen to ignore their responsibility as parents-a responsibility which is left with all parents because of our inadequate tax and social security systems. Our tax system is not based on capacity to pay principles, and our social security system does not provide universal allowances equal to the reasonable subsistence cost of maintaining children. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the introduction of stage one, which established the Child Support Agency, 70 per cent of non-custodial parents were not paying any maintenance at all for their children. Of those custodial parents who had enforceable liabilities in the form of maintenance orders, 70 per cent were not receiving any maintenance. Court orders were simply ignored by many non-custodial parents. Currently, due in part to the implementation of stage one, 70 per cent of those parents with enforcement orders registered with the maintenance collection agency are paying maintenance. In terms of social security, the proportion of sole parent pensioners receiving maintenance has increased from 24 per cent to 34 per cent. There is still a long way to go before the cost of maintaining children is equitably shared. The present court system of maintenance determination and enforcement clearly is not and has not been working effectively. The assessment procedures aim to alleviate the present problems with the court system-the inadequate levels of maintenance, the lack of enforcement procedures and delays in the processing of cases. The formula seeks to simplify the present complex system. Also, under the present system there is a lack of updating which the formula will remedy because it will relate maintenance obligation to the level of the non-custodial parent's income. Furthermore, under the previous arrangements there was poor integration of social security and maintenance systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties support this Bill and endorse it because it will assist in the alleviation of child poverty. As we all know, there are approximately 500,000 children living in poverty in Australia, the majority of whom are living in sole parent households. Approximately 60 per cent of them are children of deserted or divorced parents. The responsibility of parents to provide for their children, to the extent that the social security system and the taxation system do not provide recognition on a capacity to pay principle, or through cash allowances, needs to be borne fairly and equitably by all parents. Quite clearly there needs to be a reduction in the burden on the social security system of the cost of maintaining children of parents whose income is at a level at which they could reasonably afford to support their own children. </PARA>
<PARA> It has long been recognised that there is an urgent need to reform the level of maintenance paid for children and to provide an alternative to the court system of maintenance determination. No formula is perfect, but the Bill provides an extensive appeal mechanism whereby people can choose to go outside the formula for assessment arrangements. The legislation looks ahead and, as proposed by the Government, is designed to operate from a commencement date as yet to be announced and confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA> Providing the legislation passes through Parliament on time, the formula, according to information supplied by the Government to members of the Opposition, is to apply from 1 October so that any couples who separate or have a child born after that date are covered by the legislation. A custodian covered by the legislation is entitled but not compelled to use stage two. At a later stage I will talk about the limited group to whom, in the first instance, the legislation will apply. Custodians on a pension will be required by the Department of Social Security to obtain at least as much child support as their entitlement under the formula or be willing to accept a social security payment calculated upon the basis of the amount that would be payable on the assumption that the formula is being complied with. If they cannot do this by voluntary arrangement, they will be required to apply to the Agency for assessment under the formula and they will lose their pension to the extent to which the formula applies and the maintenance is collected. Whatever the level of payments under the formula, those forced to pay will always complain. It must be remembered that the alternative is for the community to pay in the form of higher taxes to maintain children whose non-custodial parents have incomes from which maintenance can be afforded. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation does provide under clause 83 for departure from the administrative assessment in special circumstances. The special circumstances would apply if the assessment of the child's support would result in an unjust or inequitable determination of the level of financial support to be provided by the liable parent for the child because of the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of either parent of the child. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I thank the Minister for Social Security and, in particular, members of his staff for the assistance they have given to members of the Opposition and, in particular, to the health and community affairs committee, in understanding the detailed workings of the legislation. We have appreciated that; it has been helpful to us. We have had very useful exchanges in that consultative process. That does not always happen on all pieces of legislation. Some elements have been brought to our attention only relatively recently. Whilst we do not appreciate the lateness of information about some elements of the legislation, we do appreciate the fact that we were given the opportunity for a detailed explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one matter that I raise that was brought to my attention by my colleague Senator Walters. It arises out of some of the announcements in last night's Budget Speech and reflects upon some difficulties in the administrative arrangements being experienced by the maintenance collection agency. We noted that in the Budget Speech there was reference to the fact that the 800 or so large employers in the country were to be required to pay their pay as you earn tax by fortnightly instalments. We would like to know whether, in paying the PAYE instalments, they will also be paying any maintenance being collected for and on behalf of those who come within the ambit of this legislation. Currently, remittances under the child maintenance orders, which are deducted from employees' salaries by employers, are made on a monthly basis to the Child Support Agency, which then does not make the money available to the Department of Social Security until the end of the month in which it was received or early in the following month. This system in effect causes a minimum delay of five weeks from receipt of payment until on-passing to the custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of some administrative difficulties, the maximum delay can be up to nine or 10 weeks. If employers are required to pay PAYE tax instalments on a fortnightly basis, would it not be reasonable for them to be required to remit money that they have taken out of their employees' pay packets for the payment of the maintenance of their children on the same fortnightly dates, so that the payment passed on to the custodial parent can also be accelerated and custodial parents can benefit in the same way as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) hopes to benefit by getting payments earlier to reduce the interest bill that he has to pay on Government debt? We will be interested to hear the Minister's view on that. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to a concern that I have about the difference in assistance that government provides for children in intact families compared to the assistance it provides to those in separated families. I know it can be argued that there are many differences in cost burden in operating a separated family compared to an intact family but, to a large extent, they are and should be compensated for by the payment of the supporting parent's benefit, pure and simple, to the supporting parent and by additional rent payments and additional entitlements to tax rebates, if the supporting parent gets into a taxable income situation.</PARA>
<PARA> All carers of children are entitled, subject to an income test, to family allowance. This payment varies according to the number of children in the family. Additional levels of Government assistance to the carers of children vary according to whether the children are in an intact family unit or a separated family unit. It is this difference in assistance which I wish to draw to the attention of the House this evening. For ease of understanding, I will assume the carer of the children is not in the work force and that any children are under the age of 13 years. I will assume that the non-custodial parent in the separated family unit pays maintenance according to the formula.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us first consider children in the intact family unit and the Government assistance they receive over and above the family allowance payment. The working parent in this unit is entitled to claim an extra $200 rebate as part of the dependent spouse rebate in recognition of the costs of caring for children. In addition, the carer of the children is entitled, subject to an income test, to a family allowance supplement (FAS). This is paid at the rate of $24 a week per child for children under 13. It is withdrawn at the rate of 50c in the dollar once the family income exceeds $15,600 for one child, $16,624 for two children and $16,848 for three children. Therefore, the payment is fully withdrawn once the family income reaches $18,096 for one child, $21,216 for two children and $24,336 for three children. </PARA>
<PARA> These payments should be compared to those available to children in a separated family unit. The custodial parent is entitled to a guardian's allowance at the rate of $12 per week. An additional pension for children is paid at the same rate as the family allowance supplement payment. Payments to children in the separated family are subject to a maintenance income test. If maintenance is paid according to the new formula, payments are withdrawn once maintenance exceeds $15 per week for one child, that is, when the non-custodial parent's income is about $11,000; $20 per week for two children, that is, when the non-custodial parent's income is about $10,500; and $25 per week for three children, that is, when the non-custodial parent's income is about $10,800. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government assistance to children in separated families would be fully withdrawn once the maintenance payment reaches approximately $87 a week for one child, that is, when the non-custodial parent's income is $31,000, not $18,096, as in the case of an intact family; approximately $140 for two children, that is, when the non-custodial parent's income is about $33,000, not $21,216, as in the case of an intact family; and approximately $197 a week for three children, that is, when the non-custodial parent's income is about $38,000, not $24,000, as in the case of an intact family. Initially, before any income tests have effect, payments to the children in the separated family exceed those in the intact family by the extent to which the mother's allowance exceeds the child component of the spouse rebate; that is, by $426. Then the maintenance income test for payments to children in the separated family has effect and these payments begin to reduce. Thus the benefit to children in the separated family decreases and, in some cases, less assistance is provided to these children than was provided to the intact family. </PARA>
<PARA> Take the example of an intact family with three children and a working parent on an annual income of $16,000. If the parents separate and the father pays maintenance according to the formula, the rate of government assistance for these children is $404 less to the separated family than is provided to the intact family. However, once income rises above the point where the income test on the FAS has effect, government assistance to children in both the separated and intact family reduces at a rate of 50c in the dollar of income in the intact family but only of the maintenance paid in the separated family. The result of this is that FAS is fully withdrawn at a lower income level than the income level at which government assistance to separated families cuts out. This means that the bias in government assistance begins to favour children in separated families once again. Let us consider an intact family with three children and one parent working, with an annual income of $24,000, just marginally below average weekly earnings. If this family separates, the assistance for the children is $2,068 more than was received by them in the intact family. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, there are two major problems with the government assistance schemes to children in these situations. The children are paid different amounts according to whether they are in an intact family or a separated family. This occurs, firstly, because the income tests cut in at different levels of income and, secondly, because the taper or withdrawal rate in the case of the intact family is imposed on family income, whereas in the separated family it is imposed only on part of the proportion of the income of the non-custodial parent which is paid as maintenance rather than on the whole of his income, as would have been the case before separation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this bias against the intact family should be removed. There are two ways of removing it. My preferred way would be for governments to recognise the importance of Australian children, to recognise that Australian children should not be treated as the consumption goods of their parents, and through either the tax system or the social security system, or both being viewed as an integrated whole, to ensure that parents, whether in intact families or in separated families, are relieved of tax or paid cash allowances equal to a responsible subsistence level cost of maintaining children. If that were done, then there would be no need for these sorts of means tests, which have a different impact on two families who, but for their separation, have like circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be argued that that does not target the benefits, but targeting in relation to children allows a level of income at which children are treated as the indulgence, the luxury, the consumption goods of their parents. We live in a nation that has a negative population growth, and I think it is foolish for us to treat children in that way. I am not suggesting that introducing universal payments at the sort of level I am advocating would necessarily result in an explosion in our population, but at least it would reduce or remove some of the reasons why people today are choosing to have smaller families than would otherwise be the case. If we cannot achieve that type of universal tax relief cash payment through the social security system for those who have relatively low incomes, then we should look at introducing an income test that has a common impact on families that are separated and families that are intact in so far as it relates to the child benefits. If we want to identify some special costs that impact upon the supporting parent herself or himself, as the case may be, then let those be treated quite separately from the benefits that are paid for children. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that I wanted to touch on the ambit of this legislation. I have some concerns and in the committee stage I will be moving two amendments, but the amendment I wish to refer to at this stage relates to the coverage of the legislation. As it is presented to this House, it covers only those families which separate after 1 October, if the legislation is proclaimed to commence on that date, or, in some instances, if the children are born after that date. It is my view that the legislation should go further than that and that it should automatically impose the formula on all families where the supporting parent is receiving a supporting parent's benefit. I am advised that there are between 80,000 and 90,000 supporting parent beneficiaries to whom this would apply. For the most part, the great majority, if they are receiving any maintenance at all, are receiving maintenance that was set in an environment where the courts were being very modest and meagre in the level of the maintenance they were awarding. It is true that there is some evidence to suggest that the level of maintenance has kept pace with the consumer price index. That may not be in issue; what is in issue is the basic level of maintenance that the courts have been awarding. They made some change in the case of Mee v. Ferguson, and then the Government reinforced that change by introducing legislation, which the Liberal and National parties supported, calling upon the courts to take into account any studies that had been done into the appropriate level for supporting children. But the courts still have been slow and in many instances the supporting parents have been reluctant to make court applications to have their maintenance levels updated. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be true that large numbers entered maintenance and/or property settlements that were intended to bring finality to the arrangements between the separating parties, but I put it to the House that there are many others where the bottom line of the order stated `Reserve leave to apply to either party'. Because maintenance has not been paid, because the court collection system was inadequate, because women have applied for the supporting parent's benefit and have not believed that they could increase the maintenance payments for a whole variety of reasons, the benchmark level of many of those orders is totally inadequate. I believe that at least in those cases, if not in all cases, the Parliament should say that in respect of all people who are in receipt of a supporting parent's benefit the administrative formula should apply. Those who find that their circumstances were such that other arrangements were entered into would, under the very complex and comprehensive procedures in this legislation, have the right to go to the court and say why that administrative order should not be made. I hope the Government will rethink this matter in order that the children in these families can be lifted some further degree out of the level of poverty they are now experiencing, and in order that the burden of paying maintenance which is now being carried by the taxpayer is relieved. The fathers of those children often have incomes that would enable them to support their children to a far greater degree than they are now doing. This approach would relieve the tax burden on the intact families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very glad that the Child Support (Assessment) Bill is before the Parliament for definitive debate. It was introduced in June, at the end of the last parliamentary session, and was allowed to lie on the table to enable the public to comment. The Bill is the result of an extensive process of public consultation. In fact, over 500 formal submissions were received during the consultation process leading to the formulation of this Bill. When the Bill was first introduced into the House on 1 June, the then Acting Minister for Social Security, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), emphasised in his second reading speech that the Government wanted to ensure that all interested people had an adequate opportunity to comment once again prior to the House sitting this session. Time for consideration has passed and we now have the Bill before us for what I have described as definitive debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) rose tonight and endorsed the objectives of the Bill I thought, `Here we go again. Here is another opportunity for those opposite to recognise that we in Government have come up with something good. This is one of the major reforms to have come out of the Government's review of the social security system. It is a reform which will be sustainable because it will have the support of the Opposition as well as the public'. When the honourable member gave that endorsement I thought, `Here we go again'. However, he went on to propose his amendments, and I could not quite understand the change of approach. I admit that it was different from last night's hysterical `we thought of it first' approach to our retirement income reforms. Tonight it was more a case of some ideological difference in how we go about bringing in this reform. The ideological approach put forward by the Opposition is so often at variance with reality in Australia. In any event, for the Opposition to want to introduce an element of retrospectivity into the Bill is surprising to me. I am quite sure that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), who is at the table, will deal with that effectively when he winds up the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, in introducing the Bill the Acting Minister foreshadowed that a number of amendments would be moved by the Government. These amendments will have a number of effects. First, a new part 1a restates the availability to all parties of the counselling facilities of the Family Court of Australia. That is a very important part of this Bill. Then there is a mechanism for private agreements. The Bill will set out which agreements between liable parents and custodians would be child support agreements and therefore given effect under the Bill. This mechanism will mirror totally the flexibility and effectiveness of the Family Law Act. The Court will now have a broad discretion available to it to order support in any form whatsoever, including support other than cash. If there is a relevant change in the circumstances of the parties involved, such as changes in income or care arrangements for children, the Bill will now allow for assessments of child support to be amended immediately. This is another important amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment will provide for extremely tight secrecy of information to protect the confidentiality of, for example, tax information. The Child Support Agency will, however, still be able to provide information to the Department of Social Security to enable it to answer the queries of custodians. Another amendment will ensure that parents who are covered by the Bill will now have their rights in relation to child support determined under this Bill and not under the Family Law Act. That is a great simplification. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred to the extensive consultation process associated with this Bill. I must say that it has been going on for a long time. Since 1983 new policies have been developed in recognition of the special needs of sole parents, to promote their more active participation in society, and to address concerns over increasing costs associated with their rising numbers. The Social Security Review issues paper Bringing Up Children Alone: Policies for Sole Parents was a crucial part of the consultation process and, of course, has led to many other reforms. The objective of that issues paper was to examine ways of providing adequate income support for sole parents while assisting them towards long term financial independence. One of the discoveries of that review was that sole parents want most of all to get back into the work force, hence our programs such as the jobs, employment and training program. The reforms suggested by this issues paper, and especially those recommended in the report of the Child Support Consultative Group, which was chaired by Family Court judge Mr Justice Fogarty, are being substantially implemented by this Bill, that is, stage 2 of the Government's new child support scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The people involved in the consultation process have been very important. The Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS), in a recent letter to us all as members of parliament, referred to some of the research it has done as part of this whole program of getting it right. The AIFS talked about several major elements of the evaluation it has been doing of stage 1, including the maintenance and access arrangements pre-scheme, with an AIFS sample of divorced persons; a survey of 3,755 custodial parents and a control group of 2,536 on pre-scheme maintenance; initial responses to stage 1 of the scheme by some 2,000 `first-on' recipients; and a smaller sample of non-custodial parents paying maintenance. That is the scale of the work being done by bodies such as the Australian Institute of Family Studies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Law Council of Australia has offered a great deal of comment on the program which the Minister referred to when he was talking about the quiet revolution that this Bill is bringing about in child maintenance. As the Minister said, much of the Law Council's paper is concerned with the advantage under the present system of the right of parents to make private arrangements for child support. As I said earlier, stage 2 of the scheme will not change those rights in any way. It is also important to note that in every respect arrangements under this new program are voluntary for all non-pensioners. The Law Council of Australia had previously expressed concern over stage 1 of the scheme, but the Council now acknowledges that stage 1 is achieving its objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate to ask how effective stage 1 has been. Stage 1 of the Government's child support scheme established the Child Support Agency (CSA) in the Australian Taxation Office to enforce court assessed maintenance. It began in June 1988. The aims of stage 1 were to increase the levels of maintenance awarded and to increase the numbers of those actually collecting maintenance. According to the AIFS survey, the situation prior to stage 1 being implemented was that 24 per cent of custodial parents said that regular maintenance had never been received. A further 23 per cent reported having neither court enforceable arrangements nor a private agreement for the payment of maintenance. Another 19 per cent, for other reasons, also did not receive any maintenance. That meant that only 34 per cent of custodial parents reported that they were receiving regular maintenance payments. That is an appalling situation. The effects on the 66 per cent of sole parent families who did not receive maintenance were severe. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences of the Government's stage 1 child support scheme have been to increase the number of children benefiting from regular maintenance payments from 14,270 on 7 November 1988 to 45,514 on 3 July 1989. That is a 300 per cent increase. The average maintenance over the same period increased from $23.39 per child per week to $25.47. The result is that not only are many more sole parents receiving regular maintenance but they are also receiving more in dollar terms. So stage 1 has certainly been well and truly justified. </PARA>
<PARA> Stage 2, which is scheduled under this Bill to begin in October this year, introduces a formula to calculate the amount of maintenance that a non-custodial parent pays. The honourable member for Sturt, who spoke before me, detailed that formula to some degree. This will substantially raise the levels of maintenance received. For example, a non-custodial parent on average weekly earnings of $570 per week will pay up to $70 per week for one child. The formula also provides for indexation with the consumer price index to ensure that the real value of the maintenance increase is retained over time. But, most importantly, the formula caters for all types of circumstances-even the most complex-and it is undeniably fair. In addition, by allowing for an administrative assessment procedure, as opposed to a judicially determined procedure, sole parents should be in a position to enter the maintenance scheme so much earlier. However, the Bill retains the rights of parties to approach courts in child support matters, which was a major recommendation in Justice Fogarty's report from the Child Support Consultative Group. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic effect of stage 2 of this scheme will be: to simplify the procedures that a custodial parent has to go through to receive regular maintenance payments from the non-custodial parent; to update annually these child support levels in line with inflation to preserve the real value of the maintenance; to enhance the facilities for parents to make private arrangements between themselves about child support, if that is what they want; to integrate closely the processes of applications for sole parent pensions and child support; and to ensure that the level of child support obtained is directly in line with the capacity of parents to provide it-perhaps the most important element of all. </PARA>
<PARA> I will say a few words about the prospective operation of stage 2-the element that is under threat from the Opposition's amendment. The Bill aims to be entirely prospective in operation-that is, only people who separate or have a child born on or after the commencement of the Act will be affected by its provisions. The then Acting Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett), the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), in his second reading speech, said that, because of the prospective operation of the Bill, any delay in the commencement of the Act before 1 October would not merely cause inconvenience; it would actually lock out forever those people who would otherwise be in a position to benefit from the new maintenance payment scheme outlined in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The prospective nature of the Bill is one of those important elements to emerge universally from the consultations that have been going on for so long. For the Opposition to want to introduce retrospectivity at this stage is something that I find quite hard to believe. The prospective nature of the Bill is another reason why it has been allowed to lie on the table of the House so that all views can be canvassed, to enable public comment to be received and to allow passage of the Bill so that stage 2 of the child support scheme can commence on 1 October this year. I say: hooray; at last. I heartily commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always very pleasant to follow on the heels of the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) but, more particularly, close on the heels of the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) who, as is always the case, expressed from his heart very deep concerns about anything to do with child support and related issues. However, tonight I rise to speak on the Child Support (Assessment) Bill 1988, not to repeat the detailed explanation of the Bill already provided by the Acting Minister for Social Security at the time, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), and, as I have already said, by the honourable member for Sturt and others, but to make some general remarks about the nature of the legislation and the social problems that it is designed to address. I hope that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) is not getting bored; I saw him yawn, yet I have got through only one paragraph of my speech. I am sure that he is not bored.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I spoke 18 months ago on the question of maintenance arrangements then being legislated for by way of amendments to the Family Law Act. I return tonight to the observations that I made then. This legislation is before us tonight because, increasingly, Australian men and women do not hesitate to tear up marital commitments, shirk parental obligations and abuse their former spouses and their children by neglecting them. As a result, the reach of the state and its bureaucracy is extending into personal and family relations to an unprecedented degree. Henceforth, where post-separation conflict over parental responsibilities cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of the two adults involved, or to the satisfaction of the community acting on behalf of the children involved, the state will assert its authority and control over a family's relationships. This is no sinister conspiratorial attack on the family unit, although I do not doubt that those ideologically opposed to the traditional family will experience some satisfaction over this situation; rather, it is the natural and necessary response of law-makers acting prudently to achieve justice for the weaker parties, and children in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> We would do well to reflect once again on these words of the famous English member of parliament and political philosopher, Edmund Burke:</PARA>
<PARA>Society cannot exist unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere, and the less of it within, the more of it there must be without. It is ordained in the eternal constitution of things that men of intemperate minds cannot be free. Their passions forge their fetters. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like the House to reflect on the last sentence:</PARA>
<PARA>Their passions forge their fetters. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the best description of the situation before us tonight that I can think of. I do not think the Minister would disagree with that. Tonight we will put in place legislation which will determine, by statistical formula, the nature of the relationship between individual members of a broken family. Henceforth, where two adults cannot agree to fair and just post-separation custody and maintenance arrangements for their children, as determined by the state, they will be deemed to have forfeited their freedom. Their income and personal relationships will be governed and policed according to an administrative formula. I find that situation very disturbing. Indeed, I do not think we have reflected fully enough on the implications of that situation for the role of the family. I think the Minister will know exactly what I am talking about in that regard. We certainly seem oblivious to the continued erosion of those intangible bases of human relationships in marriage, the family and society, which this Bill both reflects and produces. Two years ago the Australian published an editorial on recommendations by the Australian Law Reform Commission urging that contracts be made by married couples in anticipation of a possible divorce or separation. The editorial considered the recommendations as `most dangerous to the institution of marriage' and it observed:</PARA>
<PARA>If marriage is entered into amid preparations for inevitable divorce, it is only to be expected that divorce will become more and more prevalent. Our social fabric will be weakened if the Commission and other public bodies devote more effort to preparing for the dissolution of marriages than to encouraging families to stay together. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a very resounding comment in that editorial. I raise this related issue because it reveals, as does this legislation tonight, the spiritual and moral vacuum within which people are increasingly entering into marriage and parenthood. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the legislation before us tonight. We cannot allow women, some men and many children to suffer poverty and hardship because former spouses refuse to contribute adequately to the care of children and sustenance of family life. However, I believe that it is our duty to alert the Australian community to what is occurring gradually, but surely, in Australia. As there is less and less compassion, self-sacrifice and self-discipline in human relationships, there is more and more bureaucratic intervention into those relationships. It is a very sad situation indeed. That intervention is in this instance necessary, nevertheless it should cause us concern as the State should never be allowed too much control over the lives of its citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> We are taking unpleasant, pragmatic, legislative action to tackle a serious social problem. We should pass this legislation tonight. We should then recognise the challenge of developing adequately resourced programs which will prevent marriage breakdown. If we are concerned for the tens of thousands of spouses and children abused by neglectful and irresponsible partners and parents after divorce and about the relentless extension of state control over the lives of individuals and families, we should be looking anew at programs to strengthen marriage and the family. That is essential for the well-being of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a Budget increase for the second year in a row for marriage education and counselling. I commend the Government for that increase. But what we need, more than the punitive, sanction based approach embodied in tonight's legislation and the relatively small marriage education and counselling services, is an integrated welfare, education and legal policy package designed to prepare people for marriage and parenthood and which undergirds them during marriage and parenthood. An interesting statistic that has come to light in recent years is that only six out of every 100 young couples planning to get married ever seek any kind of guidance, financial or otherwise, with regard to problems they may face. That in itself is a very deep tragedy and is something that the Government ought to take cognisance of with regard to Budget allocations. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to tonight's legislation and repeat the observations that I made about maintenance amendments in 1987. This legislation is about the community's and a parent's primary duty to maintain and nurture children and to ensure fairness and justice in situations of unequal power. Tonight's legislation is not just to protect revenue in the welfare sector; it is the legislation of morality. The American commentator George Will has observed that much legislation is moral legislation because it conditions actions and thought in broad and important spheres of life. He defined the legislation of morality as the enactment of laws and the implementation of policies that proscribe, mandate, regulate or subsidise behaviour that will over time have the predictable effect of nurturing, bolstering or altering habits, dispositions and values on a broad scale. He warns us that our society continues to live improvidently off a dwindling legacy of cultural capital which was accumulated in sterner and more thoughtful eras. He says that that legacy is a renewable resource but will not regenerate spontaneously. He says that regeneration is a political choice, a political chore, and that is the chore that we have tackled tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is not just a reaction to irresponsible behaviour by certain citizens or an intervention on behalf of the weak; it is also an attempt to set before the community what is right and wrong. It champions the values that we believe are crucial to the good of our community and to its freedom. This legislation is very important. It is bipartisan in origin and support, and I commend the Government for its introduction. I commend the Minister, for whom I have considerable admiration, although he might not think so at times, for taking the initiative in the first instance and for pursuing this matter, however fraught it might have been with all kinds of difficulties, as I have outlined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in supporting the Child Support (Assessment) Bill. In speaking to it, perhaps I could canvass very broadly some of the moral questions raised by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster). He mentioned that in this Bill, which he supported, we were somehow legislating for morality. I suggest to him that the morality lies in the hands of the non-custodial parent-usually the father-who does not pay maintenance. As a government, we do not make the decision that that family should break down, but I think we are bound to assist when a family has broken down. As for the legislation of morality, I think that the private member's Bill to be introduced tomorrow might be legislating for morality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I return to the Bill. It is a basic and known fact that many non-custodial parents in the past did not support the custodial parent and that the situation had reached a crisis point. Not enough mothers, who were usually single mums, were being supported by the father after the breakdown of the marriage. Somehow someone had to intervene and this Government, quite sensibly, felt that it should set up a mechanism which allowed for not only a better level of maintenance payment but also an ability to update those payments from time to time and to enforce payment, to make sure that the money was actually collected and paid through. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote some figures from a study by Gregg Snider of the Australian Institute of Family Studies who has indicated for us that so many custodial parents received no maintenance prior to the introduction of the first stage of this legislation and that the average amount of maintenance received at that time was just $7 per week per child. Of course, that was a consequence of two things-first, that only one in three custodial parents ever received any regular maintenance payments and, second, that those payments were on average only $20 a week. He felt that there were two main institutional factors for the low average level of maintenance payments. The first was that less then one custodial parent in two had a court order or maintenance agreement for its payment. The second was that less than one court order in two was actually complied with. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has asked the Australian Institute of Family Studies to undertake some evaluations of the first section of the child support legislation which was introduced in 1987 and commenced operation in 1988. There were two evaluations done. One involved a nationwide sample of custodial parents and looking at the pre-scheme situation; the other involved looking at a very large number of cases actually registered with the new Child Support Agency. Taking the second example first, the most obvious conclusion that was reached was that under the old system, whereby a couple might go to the court and an award be made by that court or an agreement reached, there was rarely any indexation built in to the level of payments so that after a period of time the level of maintenance would in reality decline. Of course, it was always a cumbersome procedure. One or other party would always have to go back to the court to have the payment indexed, disregarding any change in circumstances. So it was very difficult to achieve an ongoing re-evaluation of the level of the payment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second study, which perhaps is the most interesting, we looked at nearly 4,000 custodial parents and how they received or did not receive any maintenance prior to this scheme. The author, Gregg Snider, concluded that the single most important factor in determining whether a custodial parent received maintenance was how actively he or she actually pursued the level of maintenance. That surprises me somewhat. I guess he is indicating that the father in many of these cases was difficult to track down and to extract money from. In some cases the mother might not necessarily have chased sufficiently hard. </PARA>
<PARA> He provides us with some data which looks at the maintenance process and leakages from that maintenance process. I must admit that I think there is an error in his figures. I will run through them. He suggests that we look at the whole population of those eligible to receive maintenance. In his studies he found that 24 per cent of custodial parents said that regular maintenance had never been asked for. This means that 24 per cent of the group were receiving no maintenance because of that fact. A further 23 per cent reported having neither court enforceable maintenance arrangements nor a private agreement for the payment of maintenance. That is another 23 per cent leaking from the system who should be receiving maintenance. Then-this is a figure I do not quite understand after looking at this diagram-7 per cent, almost all with court enforceable arrangements, said that while maintenance arrangements had been entered into no maintenance had ever been paid. This is a further leakage. In addition, 12 per cent reported that having once done so they no longer received maintenance payments. Many of the cases that come to my electorate office concern women who at some stage were getting a reasonable deal-the old man had paid up but a year down the track he stopped, moved interstate and was not contactable. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Snider concluded that only 34 per cent of custodial parents reported that they actually and currently received regular maintenance payments. That is the position from which this whole process started. It is not good enough that only 34 per cent of custodial parents should be receiving maintenance from the non-custodial parents. I think there was a need for the Government to create a system whereby it could make the non-custodial parent pay up consistently and adequately. That is the rationale for the process. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme was not arrived at lightly. It commenced, at least in a formal sense, with a national maintenance inquiry which was established in 1984. That inquiry reported in 1986, along with a separate report of the Family Law Council, its discussion paper relating to child support. By 1987 this Government had announced the staged implementation of the whole child support scheme. Justice Fogarty from the Family Court was given a brief to look at the establishment and to advise on a formula for the payment of maintenance, which is directly involved with our second section of the introduction of the child support scheme that we are discussing tonight. In 1987 we actually introduced stage one of the legislation. In 1988 that stage commenced. We received a further report from Justice Fogarty, who arrived at a formula for child maintenance. At that stage the very difficult work of arriving at a precise and final formula was completed. Today it is being presented as legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that impress me most about the entire scheme is the degree to which we are saying to parents who have children after that family has broken down that they must maintain responsibility for their children. The previous speaker talked about morality. I suppose in a sense in this legislation we may be seeking to impose some morality. The morality simply is that if one brings a child into this world one should continue to maintain that child no matter what the family situation is. No matter whether one has left one family, moved off and joined another, one still must take responsibility for that initial child. If that is legislating for morality, I agree that that is what we do and I am glad we do it. </PARA>
<PARA> Our morality is stated quite clearly in the preliminaries to the Bill. I want to read those into Hansard. Under the heading `Duty of parents to maintain their children' it says that the parents of a child `have the primary duty to maintain the child'. That primary duty:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . is not of lower priority than the duty of the parent to maintain any other child or another person; and has priority over all commitments of the parent other than commitments necessary to enable the parent to support himself or herself, and any other child or another person that the parent has a duty to maintain; and is not affected by the duty of any other person to maintain the child; or any entitlement of the child or another person to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a common situation in a member's office for the non-custodial parent to come along and decry an agreement made in the Family Court or the Magistrates Court. The bloke says, `Look, I have got a new family now. I can't support my original children any more', or `My new family, we want to expand. We want to have two or three kids together in my new family'. I have to say to that person, `Do it, but if you can't support your first family then you must seriously think about having a second family'. That is the bit that has been missing. It has been easy for some people to establish a second family and unload the cost of the first family onto the Government and, by implication, onto the taxpayer. This legislation is saying that if people want to have a second family, their first duty is the bringing up of those first children which they brought into the world, and that that duty is not diminished by the fact that they want to have more children in a second family. I am glad that we have stated that boldly and right up front, because that is the way it should be. My constituents would agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA> The objects of the Bill also clarify what we hope to achieve here:</PARA>
<PARA> The principal object of this Act is to ensure that children receive a proper level of financial support from their parents. </PARA>
<PARA> Particular objects of this Act include ensuring that the level of financial support to be provided by parents for their children is determined according to their capacity to provide financial support and in particular, that parents with a like capacity to provide financial support for their children should provide like amounts of financial support. </PARA>
<PARA>We are trying to establish a scheme whereby there is some horizontal equity: that people in similar circumstances should give similar support to their children. We understand, however, that not all people can support their children equally. There is such a thing as those who are well paid and those who are poorly paid. The formula that arrives at a level of payment for children takes those matters into account. Further, the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA> that the level of financial support to be provided by parents for their children should be determined in accordance with the legislatively fixed standards; and that persons who provide ongoing daily care for their children should be able to have the level of financial support to be provided for the children readily determined without the need to resort to court proceedings; and that children share in changes in the standard of living of both their parents, whether or not they are living with both or either of them. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the inflexibilities of the current system. It is often difficult to return to court time after time to get a payment that reflects the new circumstances of the family. People's income does change, whether they are moving into or out of the work force, or whether they have remarried. Often a court order would have to be updated to reflect the new circumstances. It was a very cumbersome and slow system. Effectively it put a barrier in front of reasonable adjustments to maintenance so that people did not participate. They did not go back to court; they let it ride. Inevitably there was an inducement to let it ride, to suffer inadequate maintenance, because to some extent the Government was able to pick up the difference. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we have taken away the disincentive now. We have provided a formula for and a ready access to a renewed level of maintenance. There is no excuse now for persons not to register their case with the Office of Child Support, to have it reassessed and to have a proper level of maintenance arranged and maintained. We have great hopes for the legislation. I do not doubt, as was the case in the first stage of the implementation of this legislation, that there will be some difficulties. There have been delays in payments under the first stage of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The office of the Child Support Agency in Brisbane has been very cooperative indeed. I have had perhaps a dozen or more women come to my office and the Chairman of the Child Support Agency in Brisbane has come to my office and spent hours briefing those women. We have done a lot of work to convince people that the system is working, that despite delays they will end up with more maintenance, that we will track down the non-custodial parent, usually the father, and that we will bring the custodial parent a constant and adequate stream of income. That is what this system is about. I know that in some States cooperation has not been quite so good or that the level of contact between the Child Support Agency and members has not been as good as it might be. Certainly in Brisbane that is not the case. I am very pleased indeed with the way the office there is operating. </PARA>
<PARA> I will briefly illustrate the changes between stage one and stage two of the child support scheme. In a sense the first stage was cumbersome because we were still working through the courts and allowing them to make maintenance awards. At the beginning of the process under stage one a separation would be followed by an application for a pension-a single parent benefit-by the custodial parent. People in such cases would then take advice about maintenance action. They might then seek legal aid. They would then move to the court, and an agreement would be made. Then they would register with the Child Support Agency, and thereafter collections would be made by the Child Support Agency from the non-custodial parents and passed to the custodial parents. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not dig into cases prior to the introduction of this Bill but, prospectively, we will be able to foreshorten the entire process so that the process will now be separation, the awarding of children to one parent or the other, or even to the parents jointly, an application for a pension and, directly, an application to the Child Support Agency for child support, followed by collection of maintenance payments. The whole process will be concertinaed. It should be much quicker and, because of the mechanism of automatic indexation, there will not be a need to move continually back through the system, round and round, to the courts, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> We figure that through this system a person will have an adequate income. The system will be fairly based and certainly the formula is quite open. People can read it and work out some cases that might apply to them. They will not have to read cases of the Family Court of Australia to determine how these things are worked out. They will actually be able to do it themselves. The levels of maintenance, as well as being adequate, will be indexed so that they remain adequate over a period of time. I might say-and this is a great credit to all those who have been involved in the scheme-that an enormous amount of work was done to ensure that we got the formula right, that it truly and accurately reflected the real needs of children today and how they should be maintained by both parents when those parents were no longer living together. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I congratulate the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), his team and those associated with this legislation. I am very proud to be a member of the Government that has ushered in this legislation. I am sure that it will herald a new era in the maintenance and support of children in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before detailing a number of my concerns about the child support scheme and the way in which it has been implemented, I want to emphasise that the Opposition has supported the basic principles of the child support scheme. There is on occasions a clear need to enforce payments of maintenance where it is possible so that people's private responsibilities are not thrown onto the shoulders of the already overburdened taxpayer. The Opposition did not oppose stage one of the child support scheme, nor does it oppose the extension of the scheme through stage two as represented by the Child Support (Assessment) Bill. Indeed, it is hoped that many of the early problems with the scheme will be rectified as the scheme is developed further and with the benefit of experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That said, it is clear that the implementation of the child support scheme has been, at least to some extent, a mess which has detrimentally affected the lives of the families and children-already under considerable strain-whom it is supposed to help. The operations of the Child Support Agency have resulted in a number of complaints to my office, as I suspect is the case with my colleagues on both sides, usually from the party who is supposed to be the beneficiary of collections by the Agency. When this scheme was first introduced into the Parliament I raised-the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), who is at the table, might remember-my concern that a significant motivation for the Government's support of the package was the increased revenue as a consequence of the scheme rather than the independence and welfare of the participants of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the apparent virtues of the scheme has been that, if properly administered, it should not reinforce the poverty traps which are such an unfortunate feature of the social security system that has existed in this country to date. Research on the subject suggests that our social security system has created a natural rate of unemployment which might be as high as 5 per cent because of the strong incentives that taxation and welfare systems create for recipients to remain dependent upon the Government rather than to work. On the other hand no responsible government would want to introduce changes to child support which would reinforce this culture of dependence which in turn, in many cases, misguided government policies have created. </PARA>
<PARA> However, with this legislation there is an increasing emphasis on integrating the payment of virtually all maintenance with the payment of social security benefits. As such there is a grave risk that the dependence of families on government will be increased rather than reduced even if full payments of maintenance are made by the non-custodial parent. Far from increasing the self-reliance of people, the effect of this legislative package so far seems to have been to draw more people into the net of the social security bureaucracy. This is not an essential feature in the legislation which, as I have said, we have supported. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been largely through administrative action, it seems, that the child support scheme has become an imposition on people who want to remain independent of the Government's collection agency. I have had numerous complaints to my office about the work of the Child Support Agency. People who have dealt with that body have been left with the impression that it was actively trying to push people into the scheme. Women who have told me that they are happy with their arrangements and the payments made by their former spouses have complained that they are contacted, sometimes repeatedly, by the Agency seeking to act on their behalf. In many instances those who have chosen to deal with the Child Support Agency are not all that much happier. They have complained about long delays in payments, misleading information about their entitlement and an inability to deal reasonably with the party providing child support. People have found that the Child Support Agency can be so officious that the non-custodial parent who once generously provided more than the basic level of maintenance required, when faced with the big stick of enforced payment, is no longer willing to pay more than is required. </PARA>
<PARA> There was always the risk that the child support scheme would become a bureaucratic nightmare. It is far more desirable to encourage private arrangements with which everyone involved is happy than to extend the role of government even further. At the same time it is acknowledged that there is a need, limited to some identifiable degree, for a system which enforces maintenance payments when people do not meet their responsibilities. Such a system should take up its role when private provision fails. It should not replace private provision. Unfortunately, it looks as though this scheme will eventually lead to almost all maintenance passing through the hands of government. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) in his second reading speech emphasised that the legislation will allow for and even enhance private agreements about child support. So far, on the anecdotal evidence at the coalface, as it were, it has not always worked out that way. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the first stage of the implementation of the child support scheme, parents with a court order for maintenance were entitled to have it collected by the Child Support Agency. The second stage in this package extends the scheme so that it can cover virtually all maintenance payments which are to be assessed at a level determined by administrative procedures laid down in the Bill. The new scheme will work against private provision in two major additional ways. The first is by greatly extending the number of people eligible to apply for collection by the Government under the scheme. The second is by relating the level of payments to the capacity to pay in a way which, at least at the upper end of incomes, is probably more generous than one would expect through private provision. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also incentives to use the services of the Child Support Agency immediately rather than risk any uncertainty from private arrangements. Since an application for administrative assessment of child support is a unilateral action by one parent, it will often pre-empt conscientious attempts by the other parent to reach a private arrangement for the provision of maintenance. There will be all too many disincentives to private arrangements for such arrangements to proliferate. That is a shame because it distances people from their responsibilities and interposes yet another government agency between the interaction of individuals. It reinforces the involvement of government in the family, which involvement has compounded the break-up of marriages over the past two or so decades. Unfortunate though it may be, some marriages will always end in separation, with unhappy consequences for those involved. That, in itself, should not be a reason for government to become involved. The record of government involvement in these areas is one of failure and confusion. Once involved, government action will act either to encourage or discourage separation and will rarely, if ever, achieve neutrality. </PARA>
<PARA> The child support scheme seeks to offer support for children who are affected by the separation of their parents. However, the welfare of these children and the capacity of their parents to provide for them is largely determined by the wider economic conditions faced by all families. There is no doubt that the ability of all parents to provide for their children has been diminished in the last couple of years of the Hawke Labor Government. The economic problems which last night's Budget did nothing to redress have represented a drain on the resources available to all Australians. The worst effects of the Government's economic policy failures are yet to be met. The much touted employment growth is virtually finished. With this decline in the prosperity of all Australians, the integration of maintenance payments with the social security system will represent a greater burden on the taxpayer than might once have been hoped. </PARA>
<PARA> I have argued that the experience with stage one of the new child support scheme has demonstrated the bureaucratic problems which I warned against when the scheme was first introduced in the House. There is no sign that the Minister has done anything to address those problems before proceeding to stage two of the child support scheme. The second stage extends the bureaucratic procedures to include the assessment of maintenance. The experience of the past year suggests that the Child Support Agency will go so far towards encouraging people to use its services that parents will be led to believe that they do not have the choice of going outside the government agency. </PARA>
<PARA> I have little doubt that the number of complaints to the offices of members of parliament will increase dramatically. However, I have grave doubts about whether the Minister is aware of or concerned about the complaints that we have received so far and those which we anticipate in the future. Too often it appears that Labor governments see structures and organisations as ends. They are not concerned with the people who must deal with the endless organisations that they set up. The basic structure of this child support scheme is suitable to deal with those cases where a person does not meet his responsibilities as a parent, but when extended to a scheme which is effectively universal, we are talking about a very different proposition which has not been considered in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The procedure for the administrative assessment of maintenance will inevitably come to be seen as arbitrary and the cause of needless conflict. Such decisions will never be easy, particularly when conflict over the custody of the children has occurred and when the non-custodial parent has new children to support. The formula for child support artificially guarantees to non-custodial parents and any new families which they might have a proportion of their income equal to no more than the social security pension, as modified by the number of dependants. This will potentially cause dissension within the new family. People who take their responsibilities seriously would, I imagine, prefer to treat their children from each marriage equally. This formula will force them to give preferential treatment to the children of the first marriage, causing considerable resentment which should not be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Confirming this supposition, second wives of people liable under the child support scheme for the support of earlier children have been a significant source of complaint to me about the system. They say, often correctly, that their children would be better off if they were also covered by the child support scheme. The regulatory measure to use the inflation rate to calculate the child support payments under the formula for the subsequent year wrongly assumes that incomes will rise at the same rate as inflation. I presume that this is not an acknowledgment that we have de facto wage indexation. If it is not, it will represent a further inequity in the administrative assessment of child maintenance. Judicial review of the application of the maintenance formula is unlikely to provide adequately for these dual responsibilities. It will again reinforce conflict and leave people in uncertainty about the support which they might expect for their children. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Bill was introduced the Government had not even completed legislation for the introduction of stage two of the scheme. Indeed, no-one in this Parliament was aware of what the Government intended at that time. Since then the Government has had ample time to act. Surely the idea of a two-stage introduction is to ensure that time is available for people to know exactly where they stand with this very important legislation. One of the major considerations omitted from the legislation when it was introduced at the end of last session was provision for dealing with private agreements about the amount and form of child support. Surely this is far too important to be left up in the air. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarise, the Australian Labor Party has taken a sound principle and, when implementing it, caused upheaval, pain and uncertainty. It has gone beyond the bounds of prudence to undermine the ground for private provision for children without the involvement of a government agency at any stage. It has not shown any evidence, to my knowledge, that it has sought to deal with the considerable problems which have emerged in the operation of the Child Support Agency over recent months. I hope that, with stage two of the scheme, the Government will improve its performance so that children gain the stability and support which they deserve and which we all want to give them. </PARA>

The honourable member for Curtin refers to the fact that there is a whole variety of individual circumstances, particularly at the stage when we are attempting to build systems. It is a time in which there are circumstances which make it very difficult indeed for those responsible for administering a scheme such as this. I put it on record that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and I have been very impressed indeed with the efforts that have been made to ensure that any delays are kept to the absolute minimum and that non-custodial parents are treated fairly in each case. But at the same time we recognise that we are dealing with a situation in which there has been, as most speakers have suggested, terrible injustice perpetrated and where there is a need to put in place a system that is far in advance of what we have had in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second stage, with which we are currently concerned, will remedy many of the deficiencies that we have seen associated with stage one and will particularly overcome, at least in large part, some of the delays that I know have concerned the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter), who has drawn my attention to some of those problems in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to respond to the various contributions that were made in this debate; we can deal with specific questions in the committee stage. But Senator Walters drew one important issue to the attention of a Opposition spokesperson tonight, and that was the question of the movement from monthly to fortnightly collections. I think that the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) will recognise that we will need overall consistency. We and the agency will certainly consider whether we need to move from monthly to fortnightly collections and whether there are positive advantages in that move but we will need to ensure that we can actually do it without creating more problems than we solve. If it is feasible I am sure that we would like to go in the direction that Senator Walters has suggested to the honourable member for Sturt. </PARA>
<PARA> That is really the only issue raised in the second reading debate to which I particularly want to respond, except to reiterate that an enormous amount of work has gone into the scheme up to this particular point. I appreciate the efforts of honourable members, advisers and people in the gallery tonight who have a history of association with the scheme, which potentially could have been more controversial than it has been. It has been managed at every stage so far with a great deal of sensitivity on the part of everyone concerned. I appreciate particularly the acknowledgment by the honourable member for Sturt of cooperation from my office. I hope that people feel that they have been able to get on top of the issues involved. It is a fine piece of legislation, if I might say so, and is certainly a credit to those who have been responsible for getting it to this stage. I hope that, without too much acrimony in the committee stage, we can move the legislation on to the Senate and, by 1 October, put the new scheme into operation. </PARA>

<PARA>When the then Acting Minister for Social Security, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), introduced this Bill he indicated that the Government would be moving certain amendments. Firstly, a new part 1a would restate the availability of the counselling facilities of the Family Court or a Family Court of a State to parties involved in the administrative assessment process. Secondly, the new part 4a would provide for registration and enforcement of agreements between liable parents and custodians covered by the Bill. The private agreements regime provided for in amendments in relation to child support matters would mirror the effect of the current regime under section 86 of the Family Law Act. An agreement on child support matters in writing and signed by both parents could be registered with the Child Support Agency. Registration would make provisions of the agreement enforceable and variable as if they were provisions of consent orders of a court. Thirdly, a new division 4a and part 5 would provide that the courts could substitute child support informs other than periodic amounts. The courts would be able to order that child support assessment by the Registrar be reduced because of support provided in other forms. The division would also ensure that the custodian who is in receipt of an income tested pension, allowance or benefit is always entitled to apply to the Registrar to receive at least 75 per cent of his or her assessed child support by way of periodic amounts. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the amendments would enable the assessment process to take account of the changed circumstances of the parties such as changes in income or care arrangements for children. Fifthly, the secrecy provision would balance the need to protect the confidentiality of tax information and other information necessarily obtained in the administration of the scheme as it relates to each parent, with the need for all parties to be aware of the matters taken into account by the Child Support Agency in making an assessment. Sixthly, there are consequential amendments to the Child Support Act 1988, the Family Law Act 1975, the Social Security Act 1947 and the Taxation Administration Act 1953. Seventhly, there are amendments relating to the details of how courts exercising jurisdiction under the Bill would reach a decision to make an order. Eighthly, there are minor technical amendments. The amendments will complete the legislative package to implement stage two of the child support scheme. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) Page 8, after clause 19 insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA> Children declared deemed eligible children are eligible children</PARA>
<PARA> ``19a. A child declared, by a court, to be deemed to be an eligible child under section 31a is, for the purposes of this Act, an eligible child.''. </PARA>
<PARA>In my speech during the second reading debate I indicated that it was my personal view that clause 19 should be amended in a way that would ensure that a child is made an eligible child in these circumstances. I would have liked to have added clause 19a, which simply states:</PARA>
<PARA> ``19a. Where</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a person, on the commencing day, is in receipt of an income tested pension, allowance or benefit-</PARA>
<PARA>a definition we have now inserted in the legislation-</PARA>
<PARA> with respect to a child; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the child would not, apart from this section, be an eligible child;</PARA>
<PARA> such child is, for the purposes of this Act, deemed to be an eligible child.''. </PARA>
<PARA>That would have meant that all children whose parents were receiving supporting benefits would be entitled to an assessment under the formula that this legislation contains. However, the amendment I am proposing on behalf of the Opposition is a variant on that. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> ``19a. A child declared, by a court, to be deemed to be an eligible child under section 31a is, for the purposes of this Act, an eligible child.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Later, I will propose that we add new clause 31a. The purpose of new clause 31a would be to add the words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``31a. Where:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a person, on the commencing day, is in receipt of an income tested pension, allowance or benefit with respect to a child; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the child would not, apart from this section, be an eligible child;</PARA>
<PARA> application may be made to a court, having or exercising jurisdiction under section 64, for the making of a decree that the child is, for the purposes of this Act, deemed to be an eligible child.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Another clause would then have to be added to that:</PARA>
<PARA> ``31b. Where a court makes a decree under section 31a that a child is deemed to be an eligible child, the provisions of this Act apply to the child as if he or she were an eligible child.''. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been argued that my personally preferred option was retrospective. The amendments I am proposing on behalf of the Opposition put the matter for determination into the hands of the court. They enable every supporting beneficiary to apply to the court to have his or her children declared to be eligible children and the assessment maintenance then to be determined. In that sense, all it does is say to the court, `You can, on the application of the supporting parent, the custodial parent, make an order and declare the child to be an eligible child'. It is another way of making a maintenance order that says the maintenance that shall be payable will be lifted to the realistic level set by the formula. It becomes indexed because it is adjusted year by year. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree with those who argue that my personally preferred option was retrospective. It did not ever propose the retrospective application of the formula; it proposed that the formula be applied from a prospective date. It is argued that the retrospective application-I said I do not believe it is that-would create an injustice. There is no suggestion that maintenance payable under a formula should be paid in respect of past maintenance collected and that past maintenance should be collected under the formula. </PARA>
<PARA> It is argued that there are closely intertwined maintenance and property orders in respect of many of these supporting parents. If there are, let the courts vary the rate of maintenance payable in the light of these arrangements. That would have been appropriate if my amendment were the one I was currently proposing, but I am proposing the Opposition's amendment and the courts will be given the opportunity to determine whether there are closely intertwined arrangements. If there are, they do not have to declare the children eligible children. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been argued that for many thousands arrangements have been made which involve an attempt to pay out the maintenance arrangements in lump sum form. If that is the case, let the court examine the circumstances and the history and say that that is so. But if that is not so, why not do justice to children who are in poverty and to taxpayers who are overburdened by ensuring that non-custodial parents in those circumstances pay at a level of maintenance that is regarded by the Fogarty Child Support Consultative Group as a level which is equitable for separated and intact families. </PARA>
<PARA> It is argued that people will be upset because of the settled expectations and arrangements. That is a very novel suggestion. There were many age pensioners receiving means test free pensions even though they had substantial assets whose settled expectations were upset by this Government. We are suggesting that we perhaps upset the settled expectations of a few people who are failing to support their children. I have supported the Minister's legislation on this issue very positively. I cannot understand why he has turned a blind eye to these very poor families when it is clear that the fathers of these children can afford, under formula arrangements, to pay the maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the amendment I have moved, I hope that the Minister will reconsider the proposal. If it is appropriate to distinguish between custodial parents who have a right to apply for a maintenance order for the first time or a right to apply for a variation of a maintenance order and those who have arrangements paid out in lump sum form, let us do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, liable parents will criticise the proposal and claim it is unfair. But the mothers who are supporting the children will not criticise this Parliament for doing justice to them, their children and taxpayers, especially those in intact families who are disadvantaged in the way I described in my speech during the second reading debate by the withdrawal mechanisms in respect of the supporting parent. They will not be upset. They will see the whole thing as bringing some fairness into the overall system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Social Security administers a requirement that applicants for the sole parent pension take reasonable action to claim maintenance. This legislation is simplifying that procedure, giving the Department the opportunity to say to supporting parents, `You should apply to the court for your children to be declared eligible children'. Many people would make that application where there are circumstances that have brought about other arrangements that did not justify such an application or where proper advice was not given to the parents. Many thousands of supporting parents and many more thousands of children would benefit as a consequence of the proper application of the formula in these cases. If the Department of Social Security is not going to do that, what will its attitude be to the maintenance level being fixed by the court?</PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of this Parliament's support of this legislation I hope that the courts will now automatically, either on review or ab initio in respect of families that are not now caught under the Government's proposals, use the formula maintenance as the starting point upon which they should base their maintenance orders, for Parliament has determined that the amounts under the formula are regarded as appropriate in the light of expert advice that has been given. Parliaments have determined that non-custodial parents with the income that they have can afford the level of maintenance that is required under the formula. I therefore hope that this Parliament can do justice not only to children whose parents separate after 1 October but also to those children whose parents separated before. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, the thrust of what the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) is suggesting is that one can have a circumstance where a child is deemed by a court to be declared an eligible child under section 31a. He is effectively introducing the possibility of retrospectivity or applying the use of the formula to a whole class of cases that normally would not otherwise be included within the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think I will have to explain pretty clearly and firmly to the honourable member for Sturt that from the very beginning with respect to child support we have been very conscious of the fact that there are potential benefits to custodial parents and to their children in allowing the possibility that the honourable member has in mind, but at the same time one introduces, at least from the point of view of non-custodial parents, the possibility of not only perceived retrospectivity but also a sense of some injustice that will have to be worked out in probably thousands of individual cases in the terms of the way that the previous rules have operated under the Family Court of Australia. It just seems to me to be quite unrealistic. The whole scheme would never have reached the point it has at the moment if we had allowed that possibility. The reason that what potentially could have been a very controversial scheme has been non-controversial is that we made it very clear right from the start that our approach would be a prospective rather than a retrospective one-that is, that the formula would not apply; that even though superficially it may seem that some injustices might be exercised, we would not allow the court to apply or the Agency to operate in such a way that it could be said that we were introducing retrospectivity by our approach. </PARA>
<PARA> That is because under the previous regime there were a raft of arrangements that could be entered into to deal with the various ways in which people arrived at maintenance either in cash or in kind, a myriad of arrangements that may have been acceptable to courts at particular times and, indeed, might be varied by courts, but which I do not think should be varied in terms of the principles of this legislation as we move to an administrative system. </PARA>
<PARA> With the consent and the support of the Opposition, I think, we are making a very radical change. We are taking something out of a court-certainly allowing appeal back to the court in a range of circumstances-and essentially moving to an administrative system that treats a very high proportion of cases as standard cases dealt with in terms of an administrative formula approach where individual circumstances are not of interest to the Agency or of particular interest to the court. If we went the way that the honourable member for Sturt is suggesting, I think that he would be taking us down a track that could lead to an attempt to unscramble those previous arrangements and, indeed, could threaten what has essentially been relatively non-controversial legislation and a system which in the future will mean a revolutionary change in the responsibilities of custodial parents. On behalf of the Government, I indicate that I will not be supporting either this particular proposed clause or the consequential amendments that have been foreshadowed by the honourable member for Sturt. </PARA>

<PARA> Clause 29, page 11, lines 34-36, omit paragraph (c), substitute the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(c) child support is payable for the child by the liable parent to the custodian entitled to child support on and from:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) if the application was made to the Registrar within 28 days after the earliest day or the most recent earliest day, as the case requires, on which an application for administrative assessment of child support could properly be made by the custodian entitled to child support seeking payment of child support for the child from the liable parent-that earliest day; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) in any other case-the 28th day before the day on which the application was made to the Registrar or such later day as may be accepted by the Registrar, not being a day later than the day on which the application was made to the Registrar; and''. </PARA>
<PARA>Briefly, I just want to outline the amendment, which I have moved on behalf of the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) in light of his absence. It picks up words similar to those contained in the Government's amendments to paragraphs 29 (c) and (d) but it adds a subparagraph (ii). Subparagraph (i) states that, where a spouse is separated and within one month of the separation the custodial parent makes application for administrative assessment of maintenance, the maintenance so assessed is to be backdated to the date of separation. At a maximum, it can be backdated 28 days, but if that parent does not make the application until the twenty-ninth day there is no backdating of the administratively assessed maintenance that becomes payable. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Opposition think that is a little unfair, for a number of reasons. Firstly, it means that those people are disadvantaged by up to one month's maintenance. We think it is unfair because there are many circumstances when separations occur where, for at least a month and sometimes much longer, there is the hope, an expectation, a dream of the possibility of a family reunion, and there is concern that the very act of taking the step of asking for administrative assessment will be that final seal, that final sign that the spouse, with the children in her custody, acknowledges that the marriage has broken down. We think it is unfair and unfortunate that, if people apply within 28 days, the maintenance is backdated but, if they apply after 28 days, they get payment from the date of application. We would like a situation where, whenever an application is made, it can be backdated 28 days or to the date of separation, whichever is the lesser of two periods. We think that would not then put pressure on some families where there is that hope of those families reuniting. </PARA>
<PARA> We ask the Government to give serious consideration to accepting our amendment. It does not then make any substantial difference to a family that is separated if an application is made within 28 days or is made some time in the future. It is argued that there is a problem about determining what maintenance was paid in the intervening period. If that is a reason against our proposed new clause it would also be a reason against the Government's clause. Surely some administrative procedure-or some court procedure if need be-could be considered to bring into account any maintenance that may have been paid either during the first months of separation or a month preceding the date upon which the application was made. We therefore urge the Government to accept our amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As this is the second day of sitting after the winter recess I am sure that some colleagues wish to speak in the adjournment debate. It has arrived five minutes early and I will afford them that opportunity by addressing the House on this occasion in relation to the portfolio of Veterans' Affairs. I have always adopted a reasonably fair-minded approach to the portfolio of veterans' affairs by accurately representing to the House, to the Parliament and to the veterans community across Australia-I seem to have visited so many veterans during the winter recess-a fair and proper approach to fighting the battle to ensure that veterans and war widows get a fair go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that context, I support the Government's initiative to provide for a pilgrimage to Gallipoli on the occasion of the seventy-fifth anniversary of Gallipoli, on 25 April 1990. That project will now cost some $800,000 plus, as revealed in the Budget Papers last night. That seventy-fifth anniversary of Gallipoli will indeed be a very special occasion for this nation and should be properly commemorated. For that reason, at this early stage of the Budget session, I signify to the House the Opposition's support for the pilgrimage to Gallipoli next year. </PARA>
<PARA> The logistics associated with that pilgrimage will not be easy. They involve huge amounts of resources, including a Royal Australian Air Force Boeing 707 as well as medical resources while travelling overseas, while in Turkey and upon return. I understand that the Royal Australian Navy will be sending a ship to Gallipoli to stand off Anzac Cove as part of the seventy-fifth anniversary. I say again that I believe there is bipartisan support for the Gallipoli pilgrimage-a pilgrimage that I hope will go smoothly and successfully, involving, as it does, some very elderly people who served this nation well in World War I. </PARA>
<PARA> I forewarn the House that I think there will be some difficulties in reducing the list of applicants to the number which can be catered for in the Boeing 707. My understanding is that there has been a huge number of applicants. Whilst the original statement from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) indicated that priority would be given to Gallipoli veterans-in fact, World War I veterans were eligible whether they were at Gallipoli or not-and that there would be space for some war widows as well as some schoolchildren, and I support that concept, I understand that there have been over 80 applicants from Gallipoli veterans alone, quite apart from any other category of World War I veteran. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this nation and New Zealand sometimes need to be reminded that we owe much of our national identity to events that occurred at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. In a sense, in commemorating the seventy-fifth anniversary we are reaffirming our national identity and, at the same time, affording a unique circumstance to see just one more time some of the original Anzacs, some of the original soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought at Gallipoli, stand on that hallowed beach in Turkey as part of Anzac Day 1990-the seventy-fifth anniversary. </PARA>
<PARA> I place on record in this House on this second day of the Budget session that the Opposition supports the Government's initiative. I wish the project well. It will not be easy logistically. I hope that it will not be utilised for campaign purposes by any of the parliamentarians at various levels of seniority who will be participating, and I hope that it will clearly reaffirm the national identities of Australia and New Zealand. I pay tribute to the soldiers, sailors and airmen involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this adjournment debate to inform honourable members of my impression of the damage caused by logging and clear-felling to the southern rainforest area in New South Wales. In February this year I travelled through the area following a visit made by my colleagues the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) and Senators Bruce Childs and Bryant Burns. The devastation caused by the woodchipping is appalling. The area looks like a moonscape or the site of an atomic bomb test. Travelling through it is an eerie experience and one can sense that the decimation is unnatural and wrong. Such destruction should not be allowed to take place. One cannot imagine the visual pollution. The devastation that has been caused by woodchipping is horrible. It comes as no surprise to me that there is a strong and growing opposition in the region to the granting of further woodchipping export licences to Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd, which is seeking permission to extend its woodchipping into environmentally sensitive natural forest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I back the stand of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) that Tantawangalo, Coolangubra and Egan Peaks be exempted from logging. Many farmers in the Tantawangalo catchment area are concerned that logging will seriously affect local water supplies and that the initial clearing of forest will lead to soil erosion and the silting up of rivers, creeks and dams. The regrowth that follows will cause water levels in the area to fall. This same regrowth is also a serious bushfire hazard. Clear-felling also ruins the habitat of local wildlife. The Egan Peaks area, which contains a magnificent eucalyptus forest, providing a home to numerous threatened species of flora and fauna, would be destroyed by the proposed logging. </PARA>
<PARA> When will governments possess the courage and intelligence to stand up to the woodchipping lobby, which wants to ruin our environment for their profits? I welcome the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of the planting of millions of trees. The way to go about it is to replant and harvest trees and plantations and not to clear-fell our forest. The woodchippers pillage our natural heritage for only minor economic gain to Australia. In 1986-87 woodchips accounted for only 0.85 per cent of total merchandise exported. Yet we endure the destruction of environmentally sensitive areas and ruin a potential goldmine for the tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable members that the amount of forests in Australia has almost halved since 1788. The destruction of native forests must cease. I am not a dogmatic greenie who is against all development, but clear-felling is nothing short of environmental vandalism. We should utilise our scientific knowledge to enable us to harvest and maintain our forests at the same time. Until this is done, we should realise that woodchipping exports cannot continue to expand at the expense of our native forests. Alternatives to the logging of native forests such as the planting of cleared crown land should be seriously investigated. One should take account of the Prime Minister's recent announcement on the environment in which he proposed the planting of new forests and so on. That is the solution. It is not only a problem of a few people losing their jobs. It is also a question of how many jobs are going to be lost in the tourist industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in the House the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) had the good sense to ask the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) a question relating to a very important industry in South Australia known as Wye Industries Limited and the product that it has developed called Kixotol, which is the reverse of low toxic. I congratulate the honourable member for Hindmarsh on leading this charge to help retain an industry in Adelaide. I have certainly been heavily involved in several areas of South Australia. In this context, I mention bromine, a product of the harvesting and extraction of salt, which can be developed in Dry Creek, Lochiel or Whyalla.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Kixotol has some very important benefits. It is, to the best standards possible, dioxin free and is used in the blowing of polyurethanes. In the past, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the most dangerous of all chemicals, the trade name of which is Freon, have been used for this purpose. Now, polyurethanes are blown with CO2. Kixotol is a fire retardant chemical with amazing properties. It is used for the foam cladding that goes around refrigerators and for the foam on the dashboards of cars. Certainly, in terms of the legislation that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) is trying to develop and put together, this product has important fire retardant ramifications for soft goods and foam manufacturing industries. Its implication is being picked up all around Australia and the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Mark Weston and Mr Alan Truscott have invested several million of their own dollars. There is a possibility that multinational companies such as Dutch Shell and Roche Marg are looking to buy this company, which wants to remain in South Australia and manufacture in Adelaide. It has got forward orders. In fact, I believe that a deal is being closed today that will significantly enhance its sales. We have turned our back on the black box flight recorder, the marvellous work done by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the wet system of colour photocopying, the heart pacer which was invented in Australia, the Interscan airport radar system, and Mr Ralph Sarich's orbital engine, which has gone to the United States to be developed. </PARA>
<PARA> If Kixotol is used in polyurethane and hard foams, over 1,200 tonnes of CFCs will be taken out of the ozone layer straight-away. So it has important ramifications for the environment. This is a value added industry. This product is not in the research and development stage. Austrade and State development agencies need to look at some of the questions involved. The South Australian Government has preached locally that it has given a lot in terms of research. In fact, the Minister for State Development in South Australia, Mr Lynn Arnold, gave the company, which is looking for $4m, a quarter of an hour of his time. As yet, the open letters written by Mr Scott and me to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, have yet to be answered. That is most disappointing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was actually looking forward to going home early tonight. I was rather hoping that there would not be an adjournment debate. However, I find myself filled with a form of missionary zeal. I rise to debunk some of the nonsense spoken by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent). I was also confronted with some gobbledegook from the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Pratt). It is the good fortune of the honourable member for Adelaide that the honourable member for Hotham offended me first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to take up what the honourable member for Hotham said about the utilisation of our scientific skills. I think this is a very wise thing to do; it is very sensible. It is quite contrary to what the honourable member for Hotham was suggesting. He gave us a tirade against woodchipping. The tragedy is that the same gentleman would also be against pulping. On that formula there is no future. We were given the nonsense about the tourist industry replacing jobs. The tourist industry provides jobs for women and young people in the main. They are part time jobs and low paid jobs. It does not provide work for blue collar workers whose jobs in the timber industry have been lost.</PARA>
<PARA> We are confronted with another phenomenon-the perfidy of the conservation movement. I draw the attention of the House to a paper published by Dr Rolf Gerritson of the Australian National University. It is the first time I have seen an academic actually analyse the nature of the greenie movement. We have in Australia a very slothful media who tend to give the greenies the high moral ground because, after all, all they want to do is look after the environment. Nothing could be further from the truth. Their agenda is about naked power. They utilise people. In Tasmania we find that they promote tourism against the timber industry. Once having won the battle and got rid of the timber industry, they turn on the tourist industry and ban the construction of hotels. The reality is that in some cases tourism can be far more environmentally damaging than the well managed timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We continue to get this furphy that since the settlement of Australia the area of forest land has been reduced dramatically. Of course, that is true. Forest areas have been reduced dramatically, but they have not been reduced by forestry; they have been reduced by farming. Forestry has not been responsible for the reduction of forest areas; it has been farming, as it has been farming which has been mainly responsible for the rise in salinity. We are now recognising that, and I think the farming community is acting very responsibly in addressing the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> We talk about utilising our scientific skills, but we ought to utilise the skills of the people trained in this industry. I draw the attention of the House to the greatest dry sclerophyll forest in Australia. Many people may not know where it is, but it is by far the biggest forest of this type. It is far bigger than anything in Tasmania and it is in my electorate, in the goldfields. From this forest for over 40 years timber was cut at the rate of half a million tonnes a year, a rate which exceeded the felling rate in the great forests of the south-west of Western Australia. In those days no attempt was made at regeneration, yet that country has regenerated magnificently by accident. There are some areas where because of drought or fire or perhaps because it was taken over by bluebush it did not regenerate, but in the main it has regenerated very well indeed. Today it is still the biggest forest of this type in the whole of this nation. That is a consequence of logging. In those days wood was ripped out at an unprecedented rate. It was plundered to support the mines; it was burnt in the boilers; it was used for structure in the mines. Well over 10,000 tonnes a day-half a million tonnes a year-was felled, a rate which exceeds that of the south-west forests. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the things that ought to be recognised by people who come into this House and debate environmental issues without any rationality or sense. Not only do we do our own intellects a grave disservice; we also do the environment a very grave disservice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with great interest to the speech by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and I commend him on what he was saying. It is a pity that some of his colleagues do not listen to him. Tonight I want to speak about something Senator Button had to say today in answer to a question from my colleague Senator MacGibbon, who asked about the Government's treatment of Waltanna Tractors, a tractor manufacturer in my electorate. I have raised this issue in the House before and I have certainly raised it with Senator Button, something which he acknowledges. The Government has failed to understand what its tariff policy is doing to small manufacturers and, in particular, what has happened to this manufacturer since the Government removed the bounty that was provided to assist Australian tractor manufacturers, not to give them an advantage but to allow them to compete with imports.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just to give them a fair go, as my colleague points out. The Government has now created the ludicrous situation where a manufacturer of tractors in Australia-a manufacturer who has about 65 per cent Australian content in his tractors-has to pay duty on components he has to import because they are not available in Australia. Yet someone who wishes to import a similar tractor fully assembled pays no duty whatsoever. In other words, the Australian manufacturer is penalised for manufacturing in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is with great regret that I say that Senator Button fails to understand a very simple and fundamental fact about a small manufacturer's job. He has suggested that this manufacturer ought to apply for commercial tariff concessions. In fact, he has done that on one of the major components he is forced to import because it is not available in Australia. The fact is that if Senator Button thought about how long it takes for someone to go through the process of getting a tariff concession he would realise that that person would go broke long before he got around to getting the concession. In order to do it he has to go around to every person in Australia who might be able to manufacture the component and get him to sign a customs form, a declaration, saying that he cannot make it. Having gone back to the Customs people, he is then told to check with anyone else who might be able to make it. Here we have someone in a small business who is trying to get on with the job of manufacturing something and who is told that if he wants an even chance, a fair go, in comparison to others he has to spend his life running around Australia looking for a manufacturer who might be able to make these things and ask whether or not that manufacturer is prepared to sign a statement saying either that he cannot make it or that he will consider making it. This is just in the land of Noddy. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of Senator Button criticising my colleague in the Senate, he should take a long hard look at what his policies are doing to small manufacturers. There are many others in a similar boat who are just trying to have a go-to take up the challenge of improving manufacturing in Australia. Unfortunately, this manufacturer, whom I know quite well and who is a very genuine person, a decent and committed person, has been faced with a choice of either trying to compete on an unfair basis with a fully imported tractor or going to Canada, where he has been offered all sorts of concessions. Going to Canada is something that I am sure he would not do lightly, having lived in the Hamilton district all his life. Not only would he be able to manufacture those same tractors in Canada, with all sorts of incentives from the Canadian Government, but having done that he would be able to send those tractors back to Australia completely duty free. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to all honourable members that the Government's manufacturing policy is a farce when someone is faced with that choice. Where is this Government when it says that it wants to encourage manufacturing in Australia? The fact is that we have an example here of a small manufacturer who has been totally snowed by government regulation and by unfair duties on those parts for his tractors that he cannot get made in Australia and which he has to import from overseas, while at the same time a fully imported tractor attracts no duty whatsoever. I call upon the Government to have a long hard look at what it is on about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to raise a matter which affects a constituent in my electorate, a person who was a victim of Nazi persecution during the Second World War. Madam Speaker, I do not know whether you had a chance to see any of the series War and Remembrance, which was shown in recent months on the Channel 10 network. While it might have had some elements which were intended to appeal to a mass audience, it did not hide from the fact that the Holocaust occurred during the Nazi years. It sought to portray to the wider community the impact of those horrible years on people of Jewish background. It was nowhere near as good as that excellent, very long film called Shoah which was shown on Special Broadcasting Service television some time last year and which portrayed in very graphic detail what happened during that horrible time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My constituent-a Mr Jacob Swaab-was a citizen of the Netherlands. He receives from the Government of the Netherlands what I understand is called a restitution payment in compensation for the persecution which he suffered during the Nazi occupation. Under the current law, if a person receives a restitution payment from the Federal Republic of Germany that payment is exempt from the social security incomes test. That is the result of an amendment to the Social Security Act which this Government introduced in May 1988. I believe that that occurred as a result of urging by people such as Walter Lippmann from the Federation of Jewish Welfare Societies. At that time I am sure all members of the House congratulated the Government on taking out of the incomes test restitution payments from the Federal Republic of Germany.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that that has the support of the honourable member for Parramatta. I believe that there is an anomaly with former citizens of the Netherlands and Austria because a number of people who are now living in Australia receive restitution payments from the Netherlands and Austrian governments. Unfortunately, the Department of Social Security, under the law as it now stands, must take that income into account under the incomes test for pension purposes. At least under the Income Tax Assessment Act that payment is not taxable and the Australian Taxation Office is doing the right thing in not counting it as income which has to be assessed for income tax. But unfortunately it is being used to reduce people's pensions because it is being classified as assessable income. That is something I hope the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) and the Government can address at the earliest opportunity. I hope that a proposal to extend the exemption for restitution payments to payments received from the Dutch and Austrian governments would have the support of all honourable members. I know that my constituent, Mr Swaab, would be very grateful if consideration could be given to this matter in the near future.</PARA></TALK.START>

There are a number of Australians who served in Vietnam before 1971 and who should be entitled to receive the Infantry Combat Badge. Unfortunately, only those who served after 29 July 1970 are entitled to receive that Badge. I believe that Australians who served in Vietnam before that period should be entitled to receive it. Most of these people probably served longer than those Vietnam veterans who are entitled to wear the Badge. This is an anomaly which I hope the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) can address at the earliest opportunity, because I know that there are a lot of Vietnam veterans in my electorate who think this is an anomaly which can be fixed quite easily if the Government is prepared to attack it head on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I rise because in this House just prior to the winter recess I raised with the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories the question of what was to be done by the Government to compensate those furniture manufacturers who were dependent on hardwoods, particularly Australian quality hardwoods, for the manufacture of quality furniture and those who were dependent also on the importation of hardwoods for the manufacture of quality furniture. I have a quality furniture manufacturer in my electorate, located at Angaston. He trades under the name of Ruefenacht Furniture. He finds that the opportunity he had to produce furniture which is unique in Australian terms has now gone as a result of the raw material no longer being available to him.

I have seen some of Mr Ruefenacht's furniture. It is unique. It is obvious that it cannot be manufactured out of anything other than quality hardwood. As I indicated to the House, I am still awaiting a reply from the Minister on this question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said, Madam Speaker, that I only wished to preface my comments with those remarks. In fact the presence tonight of the honourable member for Parramatta, order of the day No. 3-the Exotic Animal Disease Control Bill-and a comment made by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Pratt) about the comments of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) 12 months ago when he promised to bring home the bacon have prompted me to rise and bring to the attention of the House a concern I have in my electorate as a result of a proposal by Metro Meats in South Australia to build at Two Wells, just north of Adelaide, what it hopes will be a super piggery. I know that the honourable member for Parramatta would understand some of the difficulties that Metro Meats faces in its endeavour to build a super piggery and the intention it has of producing what it hopes will be super pigs. </PARA>
<PARA> Metro Meats has a proposal to build a piggery that will house 1,200 sows at Lower Light, adjacent to Two Wells, just 40 kilometres north of Adelaide. It has chosen the site not because it simply wishes to have a large piggery-after all, a 1,200 sow piggery will very likely produce between 12,000 and 17,000 piglets-but because it wishes to have one which can be quarantine perfect and can allow it to undertake the technological advances in pig meat that we have become accustomed to seeing exhibited in the sheep industry, particularly at Collinsville by Mr Neil Garnett. Metro Meats therefore has formed a company called Metrotech. It is intended that this company should include representatives from the University of Adelaide along with those from Metro Meats in developing what it hopes will be a super pig for the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> The company has run into some difficulties because there is a great deal of concern in the region about a piggery of that magnitude. I am told by those who are responsible for treating the effluent outflow from this piggery that, with modern techniques, it is possible to get the effluent outflow down to the point at which it is almost possible to drink a glass of it at the end of the process and not be unduly affected. I have no intention of opening the piggery and testing the effluent by so doing. I do not know whether the honourable member for Parramatta is prepared to come into Wakefield and prove the point, but I do take the point that the company believes that it can treat this effluent outflow so that it will not be harmful to the environment or be unduly offensive. </PARA>
<PARA> An interesting aside is that since there has been some local resistance to this piggery an opportunity now exists for the piggery to be located on Commonwealth property--</PARA>
