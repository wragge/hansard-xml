<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will be aware that the unanimous recommendation of the official assessment committee was overturned to enable the advertising agent of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), John Singleton, to obtain the $2.4m contract for the Buy Australian campaign. Is it a fact that there is great disquiet concerning this latest example of favouritism and special support for ALP `mates'? In view of the clear conflict of interest which has emerged, will the Prime Minister support the decision of the official assessment committee and ensure that proper standards are maintained by his Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can say on behalf of the Government that the Government will continue to maintain an appropriate and responsible monetary policy, as it has done since the day it took office and as it is doing at the moment. But we have had less than honest responses from the Opposition on monetary settings. Usually there is no response. Usually the Opposition plays upon what it believes to be public discomfort with high interest rates while seeking to maintain some credibility with financial markets. Yesterday the normally slick presentation of this duplicitous approach was blown apart by an uncharacteristic burst of honesty coming from, firstly, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Senator Stone, who admitted that it would be irresponsible for the Opposition--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;to promise lower interest rates, which means that his economic training has not gone for nought. Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition, flushed out in a Parliament House doorstop-pitstop-admitted that it would be at least the first term of a coalition government before interest rates could be lower. Need I say that he had to be waylaid. He did not say that at a press conference: he does not do those things. Thirdly, the shadow Treasurer admitted that interest rates would be no lower for at least 14 months-that is, Christmas next year-under a coalition government. All this reflects the fact that, with a weaker fiscal policy and no wages policy, the so-called Economic Action Plan could deliver nothing but higher interest rates. All the notion about how interest rates could not be lowered responsibly, lowered in the course of the next parliament or lowered before Christmas next year, smothers the real issue which is that they would be higher. They would be higher because under a coalition government there would be weaker fiscal settings, weaker fiscal policy, and without a wage policy, of course, wage mayhem, with the only response coming from a tighter monetary policy. But all that said, it is a breath of fresh air in what otherwise has been a very tawdry part of the economic debate, particularly on the part of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am obtaining some briefing on this matter as a result of the first question that was asked, and I will be in a better position to answer this question when I get that. Let me say that obviously the major consideration in the decision was the fact that the agency to which the honourable gentleman refers ran a particularly successful campaign called the True Blue campaign, which was recognised within the community as being an absolutely outstanding and successful campaign. There has been no suggestion to the contrary, and I would imagine that that consideration was uppermost in the minds of those who made the decision. I would certainly believe that it was appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. What progress has the Government made in upgrading information and advisory services for senior citizens and those approaching retirement? What role do these services play in the implementation of Australia's first comprehensive policy on retirement incomes?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3000" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member's interest as a member of the Prime Minister's task force on these issues has been important to the Government. Indeed, the question of information is one that is important in almost all aspects of social security policy, given the active policies the Government is pursuing which require people to have accurate information. The policy in terms of retirement income, of course, places emphasis on the three-stage reform of the income test and tax measures, thus providing pensioners with the incentive to maximise their investment income, the concessional treatment of annuities under the income test, improvements with respect to the pensioners' earning credit scheme, the disregard under the income test of up to $40,000 received from home equity conversion loans, the indexation not only of the pension but also of the income test free areas, the fringe benefit limits and the asset test limits. Indexation provides pensioners with the security of knowing that the real value of these limits will not decline over time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting, if I might say so, that the Leader of the Opposition refuses to hold a press conference to spell out the Opposition's approach to this fundamental question of indexation, not just for older people but for families as well.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think there is a more important question than the question of indexation of not only pensions but also benefits. After all, the cost of indexation is of the order of $1.3 billion a year, and I would have thought that every member of the Parliament would have a very keen interest in what the Opposition plans to do or not do with respect to indexation of those issues I have raised. In addition to special pensioner hotlines, we have taken two particularly innovative steps to inform pensioners of the new opportunities for older people provided in our retirement incomes policy. Of course, there has been the Age Pension News, which has been very well received by age pensioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have also established a financial information service (FIS) for pensioners. FIS has a particularly important role to play. It operates now from 20 Social Security area offices and FIS staff will provide a very valuable service to pensioners by explaining to them how any investments they plan to make, loans they may receive or earnings impact on the income areas free of the income test and the assets test. They will also be able to answer questions with respect to tax matters. I am pleased to say that the various offices have now received more than 1,000 queries and have carried out about 300 interviews so far. That information is crucial. It is a very important part of our retirement incomes policy. Many questions that people ask will be questions that apparently the Leader of the Opposition would not expose himself to-questions about indexation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Prime Minister to the view expressed by the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Crean, that there `had never been any doubt in the ACTU's mind' that there should be some legislative protection for people who take industrial action. I also refer the Prime Minister to the support which the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Minister for Transport and Communications have given to Mr Crean's view. Will the Prime Minister clearly confirm to the Parliament that the use of legal remedies is available to key parties in any industrial dispute irrespective of whether they are acting inside or outside the centralised wage fixing system under the umbrella of the Australian Labor Party-trade unions accord?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3000" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us be clear as to what the Minister for Industrial Relations actually said on this matter. I quote from the transcript of A Current Affair on Friday, 24 November. The Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>What effect the decision has upon that we need to examine. We will need to discuss this with industry, with the trade unions, when the detail is available and then, if need be, we may have to take action.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>We would need to take a look at that legislation, talk to the parties involved, and if there is a need to act then we would consider it at that time.</PARA>
<PARA>If one reads the transcript, one will see that the Minister was saying that we would look at this matter, there would be discussion with those who wanted it and, if industry and the ACTU want to come and talk with us, of course, we will do so. We are prepared at all times to talk to people, be they from industry or the ACTU. The Leader of the Opposition should understand-and one would recall from his last disastrous press conference which dealt with industrial relations that he knows nothing about the area and that is why he will not hold another one-that the decision by the justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria created no precedent or new law. It has always been open for people to have resort to civil action outside the industrial relations system. Indeed, on 6 June 1987 the then Minister for Industrial Relations, the present Minister for Transport and Communications, when he was announcing the Government's decision not to proceed with the disputed compliance provisions of the Industrial Relations Bill-when we decided, after discussions with the employers and the trade unions, not to go ahead with that-said that there would be no limitation on employer access to common law actions.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Leader of the Opposition does not want to face up to the fact that we have in this country an industrial relations system which provides a process for the resolution of industrial dispute, including strike action. This is not a country where there is no right to strike. Strikes happen around the country reasonably frequently. Under us there have been 60 per cent fewer industrial disputes than under the previous Government, but strikes still occur. The overwhelming majority of employers and trade unions use the industrial relations system sensibly and intelligently. Where there is strike action, processes are provided for the sensible resolution of those disputes.</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, in this case one organisation, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP), said that it was about smashing the system. It was not that it just wanted to go outside the system; it was intent on smashing the system which provides protection for people who take industrial action. The Federation said, `No, we do not like that system; we are going to take action actually to smash that system by going outside it and trying to destroy it'. That was done against the warnings that were given, including those by the ACTU. When the Federation decided to go outside the system which provides protection for action, including strike action, it then incurred, as it had been warned about, the processes of civil action. I repeat: no-one gets any comfort from that.</PARA>
<PARA> The distinction between this side of the House and the other is that those opposite would be creating AFAP situations all the time; they would be inciting people, urging them to go outside the industrial relations system. The very essence of the Opposition's policy is that people should go outside the system and negotiate. The Opposition's industrial relations policy would be a recipe for AFAP after AFAP after AFAP. That is the very core of its policy. The distinction between this side of the House and the other is that we wholeheartedly support the industrial relations system, which provides a set of guidelines and principles under the centralised wage system which, while allowing-obviously as we must have-the right to strike, provides a process of resolution abided by by the overwhelming majority of employers and employees.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Employment, Education and Training inform the House about the success of the Government's policies on providing improved opportunities for young Australians in education and training? Is the Minister aware of any alternative proposals in this area?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3002" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There can be no greater responsibility for a government than to provide opportunities for its young citizens. What we know in Australia is that there is an enormous thirst for learning amongst our young people. They want the opportunities to pursue their learning, pursue their educational and training opportunities. The education and training system that we found when we came to office was fine if one was either very bright or very rich. But we knew that far too many of our young people were dropping out of school, and there were far too few places for those who did finish school. That of course is changing, and it is changing fast. Last week the Prime Minister took the opportunity to refer to the massively improved retention rates to year 12. The rates have increased from 36 per cent in 1983 to, the Prime Minister might be interested to know, 61 per cent in 1989. What does this mean in terms of increased enrolments? It means simply this: in 1983, 98,000 young people were enrolled in year 12; now there are 160,000. The figure has risen from 98,000 to 160,000. A massive 62,000 more young people are actually enrolled in year 12 of our high schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What about those who decide not to go on to the end of year 12, because not all do and not all will? There need to be other post-school opportunities for them. If we look at the area of apprenticeships, we see that in 1983 there were 35,000 young people in apprenticeships; this year there are 62,000. When one adds to that the 17,000 who are enrolled in the traineeship scheme which was created under this Government we see that there are 45,000 more post-school vocational training opportunities on top of what there were in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> The number of higher education students in 1983 was about 350,000; now the number is just under 450,000-an increase of 97,000 students; the equivalent of 10 new universities in the space of some seven years. During this massive increase in secondary enrolments, in apprenticeships and in higher education enrolments, technical and further education enrolments have also slightly increased. This has not happened by some accident, as a result of some ignorance or inactivity on the part of the Government; it has happened as a result of the Government recognising a problem and doing something about it. One of the most important things we have done is improve financial assistance under Austudy, which encourages young Australians from the age of 16 to remain in full time education and training. Total expenditure on Austudy has increased from $268m to a massive $744m during the period of this Government. What has that meant in terms of increased recipients in the various areas of education? In relation to secondary education, the number of Austudy recipients has increased from 53,000 to 142,000, which is an increase of nearly 90,000 young people who individually or whose families now receive Austudy whilst they complete the last couple of years of secondary school. In relation to higher education, the number has increased from 96,500 to 140,000, which is an increase of 43,500 or 45 per cent. This has occurred not just as a result of increased numbers-as the Prime Minister noted last week, we have also substantially increased the rates, particularly for those in secondary education.</PARA>
<PARA> I pause for a moment to acknowledge the enormous contribution made to these policy changes by my predecessor, former Senator Ryan, and also by the honourable member for Gellibrand, who had so much to do with reviving the training opportunities for young people. What has this meant in terms of unemployment amongst young people? We found when we came to office that 26 per cent of young people in the work force were out of work. That figure has fallen to 13 per cent or, if one takes it as a proportion of the teenage population, the figure has been reduced from 12.5 per cent to about 6.5 per cent and that is about the same ratio as for the community as a whole.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3004" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BONYTHON" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Perth for bringing the attention of the House to the rather scurrilous tactics used by some fringe elements of the medical profession in a last minute effort to stop the implementation of the GPs' register. I refer to advertisements of a quite alarmist kind and letters of a similar nature which have been funded by the New South Wales branch of the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Doctors Fund. They are simply last minute efforts to frustrate the implementation of the new GP register. I do not believe that it is really opposition to the register that motivates these people; they are obsessed with their anti-Medicare concerns and they recognise that the new system of registration and vocational training will in fact enhance the popularity of Medicare; through their blinkers anything that does that has to be attacked. That is the only reason for the grossly misleading advertisements which have been taken out by the News South Wales branch of the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Doctors Fund and for the quite dishonest letters writ- ten to doctors in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is extraordinary that the Australian Medical Association or some elements of it should take this action because the Australian Medical Association is one of the two medical organisations which have been charged with the responsibility of deciding how the new arrangements should be reviewed, yet at the same time some of them at least are simultaneously trying to persuade the public that the Government is acting to put the confidentiality of medical records at risk. Let us just look at the facts, which should interest the Opposition, because all members of the Opposition on the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance supported the recommendations the Government is now implementing. The Australian Medical Association itself welcomed the Senate Select Committee's report, which unanimously recommended that development of the review process should be put in the hands of the medical profession. The Government has accepted that recommendation and it has done that. As to the recommendation that it should not proceed without legislation or without the backing of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Australian Medical Association, the Government has given the commitment that it will not proceed without legislation or without the backing of those two medical bodies.</PARA>
<PARA> The Select Committee further believed that the review body should be within the medical profession itself-the Government has accepted that recommendation-and that it could be structured to carry out its work without breaching patient confidentiality or established ethics of the medical profession. The Government accepts that it can be so carried out. Let me make it crystal clear now that the Government will not introduce the legislation on the Descriptor Utilisation Review Committee without the backing of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the AMA. The sinister picture painted by the advertisements and letters is blatantly dishonest. The changes will not intrude into doctor-patient relationships and patient records equally will stay private.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department has referred this offending material to the Medical Board of New South Wales for its consideration and action, particularly because these letters and advertisements involve a denigration of doctors seeking vocational registration. I have also sent copies to the Treasurer as further evidence that contributions to the Australian Doctors Fund should not be tax deductable in light of the dishonest propaganda for which these moneys are being applied. The legal officers of my Department also believe that there may be further avenues for redress through the trade practices legislation, and this is being explored today.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to the second part of the question from the honourable member for Perth, I say that the Government is determined to fulfil the Select Committee's recommendation that doctors and the community should be fully informed about the new general practitioner arrangements. Again, of course, the AMA not only is suffering from a split personality but also is resorting to censorship. While the rest of the medical media have been happy to run explanatory advertisements for doctors, the AMA's own magazine, Australian Medicine, refused to publish the advertisements. So much for the rather hollow claim in the first editorial of the magazine some months ago, which claimed that the magazine was `a forum where all can contribute, where all voices can be heard'.</PARA>
<PARA> The doctor education campaign, which was recommended by the Senate Select Committee, will continue despite the AMA's attempts to sabotage it, and tomorrow I will launch a mass media public education campaign for patients under the title It Never Stops. The Learning. The Caring. These are the themes of the whole new approach in general practice. I am confident that the thinking members of the medical profession and the public will reject these actions of fringe elements of the medical profession.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3005" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I certainly refute any suggestion that the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority is not up to the task or is not achieving a substantial degree of reform. In relation to the particular episode he mentions, which relates to the manning of the bulk grain terminals, this was the first exercise to be put on the plate of the Industry Reform Authority after the negotiation of the in principle agreement. It was brought about by an attempt by some elements, I think, to engage in some confrontation and to undermine the reform process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that, before the very first bulk grain terminal was looked at, it was agreed by the parties involved in the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority process, who are the unions, the employers and the Chairman of the Authority, Mr Peter Evans, that they would go around to all of the bulk grain terminals, look at the manning requirements for each, and decide what was appropriate. The first one they looked at was the Fisherman Island bulk grain terminal in Brisbane. The previous manning of that terminal was six; there were six people involved on the ship in the loading process. After examination by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, it was agreed that that figure be reduced from six to 1.6, that is, a 70 per cent reduction in manning.</PARA>
<PARA> In the face of that, statements were made by various people that the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority process was a failure because there had been only a 70 per cent reduction in manning. I notice that all of the press statements that were put out by the various bodies seeking to denigrate the process refrained from actually mentioning what the reduction in manning was. They talked about how it had failed to meet their expectations, et cetera, but they did not say what the reduction in manning was. It was a 70 per cent reduction. How is that a failure, for God's sake? It was obvious that, in the very first test that it faced, the Authority surely met the reasonable expectations of just about anybody; that is, that during the free-pour process, instead of there being six men on the ship there would be one man, and during the trimming process, instead of there being six men, there would be two men-an average of 1.6. That obviously refutes absolutely the quote mentioned by the honourable member for Gilmore. I refute absolutely the claims that have been made by various bodies that this episode demonstrates that there was a failure on the part of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority to meet its obligations.</PARA>
<PARA> I should also mention that the other facility the Authority looked at was at Port Kembla, which is still in its introductory phase. It is a two-chute pour rather than a single-chute pour and therefore requires more manning. The Waterfront Industry Reform Authority recommendation there was that the manning be reduced by 17 per cent on an interim basis and, when it was fully functional, the Authority would come back, look at it again and probably make some further reduction. By any reasonable expectation, it is an absurdity to say that the Authority failed on its first test in relation to this issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Social Security to his answer yesterday to a question about measuring poverty, and I ask: What measures has the Government taken to ensure that poverty is no longer a question of inadequate incomes for Australian families, and are these measures sustainable into the 1990s?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3006" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has sought to put a number of measures into place, but primarily we have placed our focus on integrated family payments: the family allowance, the associated supplement and various other allowances such as rent assistance, orphan's pension and so on. The Government has set standards of adequacy, delivering a guaranteed minimum income for families with children. We have increased child payments for low income families from $15 a week to $33 a week and, for older children, to $43.10 a week. We have provided rent assistance to all low income families and, by September next year, they will receive $35 a week or $40 a week for families with three or more children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department commissioned a survey in northern Australia and I happened to note a quotation contained in that report which included a survey of some low income families. One mother was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>We eat a lot better. Normally all the kids' clothing is second hand, but for the first time, I bought them all a pair of new shoes. It makes the biggest difference in the world. If we didn't have all the debts we'd be living like kings. This is the first time the Government is actually helping families. They talk a lot about helping children, but this is the first time they're helping the little people.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has entrenched these gains which I have referred to as an integrated set of family reforms and indexed all the elements of the social security system that affect family incomes, such as the family allowance itself, pensions, benefits, mother's-guardian's allowance, rent assistance and so on. We have entrenched automatic adjustment for inflation of family allowance supplement and have also indexed the family allowance supplement and family allowance thresholds and pension income test-free areas. Like all of Labor's policies, these measures are fully funded on introduction. Under Labor, they will be guaranteed through indexation. As I suggested earlier in Question Time, that is not the position of the coalition. On 21 November the honourable member for Bradfield stated in careful terms the Opposition's position:</PARA>
<PARA>All coalition policies are subject to the Economic Action Plan. It contains no reference to indexation of benefits. It follows that Government' policies or proposals that are not specifically mentioned in the Economic Action Plan and that are now in force remain unaffected.</PARA>
<PARA>There are two important elements to that statement. The first is the coalition's commitment is limited to policies that are now in force, so there is no commitment to increases in or indexation of rent assistance, no commitment to the indexation of pension free areas, and no commitment to exempting pensioners from tax until 1995. The second element is the statement that all coalition policies are subject to the Economic Action Plan. We know from the honourable member for Wentworth that, if he were ever let loose, that plan would be only his first year's cuts. It would be his first instalment in a program of cuts. We know from Senator Stone that the real agenda is not just the abolition of indexation of family allowance but the abolition of family allowance altogether. The position is clear that, at best, under the coalition indexation is secure for one year. After that, there is no security.</PARA>
<PARA> The issues that I refer to in terms of family income support represent the most important set of integrated reforms in terms of families in the post war period. Never before have families been guaranteed a standard of payment. Never before has indexation been provided for families. The difference between the Government and the Opposition is not, at this point, academic; it is a matter of fundamental importance to know exactly where the Opposition stands, and that is why we all see the cringe of the Leader of the Opposition, who is unable to expose himself to a press conference and answer questions in detail but instead gets some spokesman in his office to say that there will be indexation for only one year-the reverse of what Malcolm Fraser did: push families back into the tax system and leave low income families. That is a fundamental issue. It is not a side issue. It is an issue which the Leader of the Opposition ought to have the guts to go out and explain to the people and answer questions on in some detail.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall reply to the first part of the question first. The value of the judgments made in the press statement to which the Leader of the National Party referred can perhaps be judged by the fact that the statement asserts that it speaks on behalf of the honourable member for Kingston. That is inaccurate. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie got it wrong. The honourable member for Kingston is not involved in the statement, so the fact that the Leader of the National Party cannot get quite right for whom he is speaking suggests that there may be some sort of shallowness and inadequacy in the judgment. I simply do not accept the judgment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie on this, as I have not on a couple of other matters. Generally speaking, he is a very good member but, in my judgment, this is an aberration from his otherwise generally good performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the important part of the honourable gentleman's question, not only today but also in the whole period between now and the election, I will be more than pleased that we have out there in the public forum the position of the Opposition and the position of the Government with regard to the environment. I will be pleased to have that because the public of Australia know that the Opposition's protestations of interest in the environment are a sham. They are a sham for the obvious reason, to be tested in terms of every important decision that the Government has taken in regard to the environment. We start from day one.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer is: to a very large extent. The Government has employed a dual response to the problem of the current account deficit in lifting the supply capacity of the economy and restraining demand. The most important thing about our economic policy objectives is to see Australia producing more goods and services because it is only by producing more goods and services that we have the capacity to meet our import bill and to export a surplus of goods which are not being demanded or sought in the Australian economy. That is why it has been important to hold demand in check and to lift the supply side of the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The policy has already succeeded in lifting business investment to its highest share of gross domestic product (GDP) since the war, and as far as we know ever, because we have been keeping records only since 1946. It stands at a high of 13.9 per cent of GDP. As we know, investment is the lifeblood of any economy. Without it there can be no hope for not only repairing our current account imbalance but also lifting prosperity, jobs and higher real incomes.</PARA>
<PARA> At least the shadow Treasurer has now acknowledged the investment boom. On Friday, 24 November, on the Howard Sattler program he was asked by Howard Sattler:</PARA>
<PARA>Is it not true that we have got an investment boom?</PARA>
<PARA>The shadow Treasurer replied:</PARA>
<PARA>We have. We certainly have had very strong investment.</PARA>
<PARA>Dead right, brother! He went on to say that he could not see that this investment is going to the traded goods sector of the economy. He is the only person in the country walking round with blinkers on, apparently. Access Economics Pty Ltd, which he relies upon for economic advice, has published a list of more than $90 billion-worth of investment projects. Thirty-four per cent is in tourism and 30 per cent is in manufacturing. It also details six major investment projects either just coming on stream or already under construction which, it says, should generate in a few years time nearly $5 billion of extra foreign exchange. That is equal to about 10 per cent of last year's exports of goods and services-in other words, the equivalent of a 10 per cent addition to the exports of goods and services from projects which are coming on stream or are already under construction.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, Access Economics is looking to the future, but its projections are already on a very strong investment base, because in the five years to 1988-89 the average growth of investment in the non-commodity tradable sector in Australia was 15.4 per cent per annum compared with a decline of 1.5 per cent per annum in the previous five-year period-that is, plus 15.4 per cent in the non-tradables economy compared with minus 1.6 per cent in the previous five years under the coalition Government. As well, the Bureau of Industry Economics indicated in its survey that manufacturing capacity grew by around 6 per cent last year and it projected a further 6 per cent growth this financial year. Also, the latest building approval figures show a welcome decline overall in non-residential building approvals of 9 per cent; but, importantly, factory construction, which houses investment and investment goods, is up by 10 per cent over that in the same period last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we use another measure-manufacturing employment-we find that manufacturing employment has risen by more than 3 per cent in 1987-88 and nearly 4 per cent in 1988-89, totalling now around 1,220,000 jobs. One has to go back a long way in Australian economic history to remember a period when manufacturing investment was growing at all, let alone at this inordinate strength. In the October balance of payments figures published last week, we saw that manufacturing exports-that is, exports of machinery, transport equipment and other manufactured goods-were up 39 per cent over the same month in the previous year. So, if the shadow Treasurer cannot see where this huge boom in investment is going, either he does not want to see or he needs some decent data put under his nose. I should imagine that in the job that he has he would be able to garner the kinds of statistics which indicate and confirm what I am saying.</PARA>
<PARA> One cannot have an investment phase this large which is not going into the traded goods sector when the traded goods sector is wholly preferred by economic policy, by a large real depreciation of the exchange rate, by the biggest fall in unit labour costs in the postwar years, by the highest profit share we have ever had, by a tax system making income fashionable again--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And, as the Prime Minister indicates, the best industrial relations performance for the last 25 years. Why would the traded goods sector not kick along? It is kicking along and it is a great thing for Australia that investment has been reignited. The Opposition could not reignite it. The Opposition always claimed to be the party of business, but it could never make the business community invest for it. The business community had to wait for a Labor government to come along to invest for us, to invest for Australia under Labor. The Opposition could never get business to vote with its cheque book, because the Opposition always thought that with businesses what it should do was gladhand them with cheques from the Budget, tariff preferences or tax preferences. But the Opposition could never make businesses invest. It could never really make businesses vote where it counted-with their cheque books. That is why the investment is there, and that is why we will turn around the current account imbalance. But we will not rebuild over 20 months what the oafs of the Opposition ran down over 20 years; and the public of Australia understands that there is a serious change going on. Anyone who is listening to the broadcast today would hear the answers on the tertiary institutions, on family assistance and on the shift in the traded goods sector. They would hear of the solid record of policy and performance from a government, not from a rabble that sits without ideas and generally without integrity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES FOR OFFICIAL WITNESSES BEFORE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES AND RELATED MATTERS</PARA>
<PARA>INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA>Accountability</PARA>
<PARA>1.1 In the Australian system of parliamentary government, and consistent with the traditional understanding of ministerial responsibility, the public and parliamentary advocacy and defence of government policies and administration has traditionally been, and should remain, the preserve of Ministers, not officials. The duty of the public servant is to assist ministers to fulfil their accountability obligations by providing full and accurate information to the Parliament about the factual and technical background to policies and their administration. The guidelines are therefore aimed at encouraging the freest possible flow of such information between the public service, the Parliament and the public. </PARA>
<PARA>Scope of guidelines</PARA>
<PARA>1.2 The guidelines apply primarily to the preparation of submissions and the giving of evidence to parliamentary committees by officials, although sections 3-6 also discuss their relevance to contexts outside parliamentary committees, including party committees, Royal Commissions, individual Members of Parliament, speeches, public inquiries and court appearances. </PARA>
<PARA>1.3 The previous version of the guidelines was tabled in the Parliament in August 1984. Changes have been made to take account of the Senate Parliamentary Privilege Resolutions of 25 February 1988 (see Appendix) and recent experience with the appearance of witnesses before parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA>PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES</PARA>
<PARA>Application of Guidelines</PARA>
<PARA>2.1 This section is designed to assist departmental officials, statutory office holders and the staff of statutory authorities appearing before parliamentary committees, by informing them of the principles they are required by the Government to follow. It is recognised, however, that the role and nature of some statutory authorities will require the selective application of these guidelines (see paragraph 2.49). </PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary rules of procedure</PARA>
<PARA>2.2 This section also takes into account the Senate Parliamentary Privilege Resolutions of 25 February 1988 which include procedures to be observed by Senate committees in their dealings with witnesses. (References to the Senate resolutions in these guidelines appear as r.1.1; r.1.6 etc.) At the time of tabling these guidelines, the House of Representatives had not dealt with the committee procedures which have been proposed by the Standing Committee on Procedure. These are broadly similar, with some additions, to the procedures adopted by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>2.3 These guidelines should, nonetheless, be read in conjunction with the Senate Parliamentary Privilege Resolutions, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure's Report on Committee Procedures for Dealing with Witnesses dated 4 April 1989 and the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, particularly sections 13 and 16. </PARA>
<PARA>Inquiries into administrative matters</PARA>
<PARA>2.4 Where a committee's inquiry is directed towards the examination of departmental administration and practice, it is for the departmental Secretary, with the general consent of the relevant Minister, to use his or her discretion as to the extent to which aspects of these guidelines, such as the clearing of written evidence and the selection of witnesses, are to be followed. In this context a witness should also be aware of the provisions of s.12 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act (see para 2.40). </PARA>
<PARA>Committees dealing with individual conduct</PARA>
<PARA>2.5 Where a committee is inquiring into the personal actions of a Minister (or official) and seeks information from officials, there may be circumstances where it is not appropriate for the requirements set out in para 2.14 for clearance of evidence to be followed. (Note also that the Senate resolutions provide that a witness may apply to have assistance from counsel during the course of a hearing (r.1.14 and r.1.15). See para 2.42. </PARA>
<PARA>Joint Statutory Committees</PARA>
<PARA>2.6 The Public Works Committee Act 1969, the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 provide for the summoning of witnesses and raise some special considerations. For example, s.23 of the Public Works Committee Act makes special provision for hearing of evidence on confidential matters and the Public Accounts Committee Act and the Public Works Committee Act have special provisions relating, among other things, to self-incriminating evidence (see ss.19 and 25, respectively). In these and similar cases, the special provisions of the relevant Acts take precedence. </PARA>
<PARA>Preliminaries to an inquiry</PARA>
<PARA>Requests for attendance</PARA>
<PARA>2.7 Generally requests for an official to attend a committee hearing in an official capacity, or to provide material to it, are made through the relevant Minister. There are, however, exceptions-for example the Estimates Committees and the Public Accounts Committee (see para 2.4). (Note also that the Senate resolutions provide that a witness will be invited to give evidence or produce documents, but may be summoned to do so if circumstances warrant such an order (r.1.1 and r.1.2).)</PARA>
<PARA>Choice of witnesses</PARA>
<PARA>2.8 A Minister may delegate to the departmental Secretary the responsibility of deciding the official(s) most appropriate to provide the information sought by the committee. it is essential that the official(s) selected should have sufficient responsibility or be sufficiently close to the particular work area to be able to satisfy the committee's requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>Preparation of witnesses</PARA>
<PARA>2.9 It is also essential that all witnesses are thoroughly prepared for hearings. Such preparation should include ensuring familiarity with probable lines of questioning, either by discussion with the committee secretariat or, in the case of Estimates and similar inquiries, by ascertaining from the committee secretary or from Hansard and other sources the issues that are likely to be of interest to committee members. Officers who have not previously attended committee hearings should receive briefing on the requirements, and senior officers should satisfy themselves, so far as possible, that all witnesses are capable of giving evidence creditably. </PARA>
<PARA>Consultation with Ministers</PARA>
<PARA>2.10 As appropriate, witnesses should consult the Minister before a hearing and, if required, the Minister representing in the other House. Examples of the need for such consultation would be in relation to possible claims that it would be in the public interest to withhold certain documents or oral evidence, or requests for the hearing of evidence in camera (see paras 2.22 to 2.38). </PARA>
<PARA>Senate resolutions</PARA>
<PARA>2.11 Officers appearing before Senate Committees should also make themselves aware of the Senate resolutions relating to the rights of witnesses (r.1.1-r.1.18) and matters which may be treated as a contempt of the Parliament (r.3 and r.6.1-r.6.16)</PARA>
<PARA>Preparation of written material</PARA>
<PARA>2.12 In the normal course, departments should provide a written statement on which subsequent oral evidence will be based (see r.1.4). In addition, where a committee asks written questions, written replies should be provided. All written material (authorised in accordance with these guidelines) should be sent to the committee secretary. </PARA>
<PARA>2.13 When the interests of several departments are involved, adequate consultation is to take place in preparing material and making arrangements for witnesses to attend. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearance with Minister</PARA>
<PARA>2.14 Submissions should be cleared to appropriate levels within the department, and normally with the Minister, in accordance with arrangements approved by the Minister(s) concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>Matters of policy</PARA>
<PARA>2.15 Such submissions:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) should not advocate, defend or canvass the merits of government policies (including policies of previous Commonwealth Governments, or State or foreign governments);</PARA>
<PARA>(b) may describe those policies and the administrative arrangements and procedures involved in implementing them;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) should not identify considerations leading to government decisions or possible decisions, in areas of any sensitivity, unless those considerations have already been made public or the Minister authorises the department to identify them; and</PARA>
<PARA>(d) may, after consultation with the Minister, and especially when the Government is encouraging public discussion of issues, set out policy options and list the main advantages and disadvantages, but should not reflect on the merits of any judgment the Government may have made on those options or otherwise promote a particular policy viewpoint. </PARA>
<PARA>2.16 In relation to the matters in para 2.15 (a) above, the proper course is for Ministers to make written submissions, to appear personally, to arrange for Ministers representing them to appear personally, or to invite committees to submit questions on policy issues in writing. </PARA>
<PARA>2.17 In relation to para 2.15 (c), the normal course is for Ministers to canvass the material in these categories, but if departments are to canvass such material, they should clearly bring it to the Minister's attention when seeking clearance for the submission. </PARA>
<PARA>Requests for more time to prepare evidence</PARA>
<PARA>2.18 The Minister (or the department on his or her behalf) may ask the committee for more time to prepare evidence, if the notice is considered insufficient. The Senate resolutions provide for a witness to be given reasonable notice and an indication of the matters expected to be dealt with (r. 1.3). </PARA>
<PARA>Conduct during hearings</PARA>
<PARA>General Principles</PARA>
<PARA>2.19 As described above (para 1.1), it is intended, subject to the application of certain necessary principles, that there be the freest possible flow of information between the public service, the Parliament and the public. To this end, officials should be open with committees and if unable or unwilling to answer questions or provide information should say so, and give reasons. It is also, of course, incumbent on officials to maintain the highest standards of courtesy in their dealings with parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA>2.20 These guidelines, and particularly paras 2.15 and 2.32-2.36, should be read in the context of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (the FOI Act). The Act establishes minimum standards of disclosure of documents held by the Commonwealth. It is not, however, a code governing release of documents or information generally as there are many other means of obtaining information from Government (e.g. press releases, annual reports, etc.). Any material which would not be exempt under this legislation should (with the knowledge of the Minister in sensitive cases or where the Minister has a particular interest or has been involved) be produced or given, on request, to a parliamentary committee. Moreover, it may be in the public interest to provide to the committee a document or information for which exemption would normally be claimed under the Act. The exemptions in the Act should therefore be viewed from the perspective of the proper role and functions of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>2.21 So far as relevant, the guidelines in paras 2.12-2.18 above relating to written material apply also to oral evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Limitations upon officials' evidence</PARA>
<PARA>2.22 There are three main areas in which officials need to be alert to the possibility that they may not be able to provide committees with all the information they seek, or may need to request restrictions on the provision of such information. These are:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) matters of policy;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) public interest immunity; and</PARA>
<PARA>(c) confidential material where in camera evidence is desirable. </PARA>
<PARA>The conduct of official witnesses in relation to these areas is described in detail below (paras 2.25-2.38). </PARA>
<PARA>Clarification or amplification of evidence</PARA>
<PARA>2.23 In addition, committees may occasionally seek information which may properly be given, but where officials are unsure of the facts, or do not have the information to hand. In such cases witnesses should qualify their answers as necessary so as to avoid misleading the committee, and, if appropriate, should give undertakings to provide further clarifying information. It is particularly important to submit such further material without delay. </PARA>
<PARA>Questions about other departments' responsibilities</PARA>
<PARA>2.24 It is also important that witnesses should take care not to intrude into responsibilities of other departments and agencies (see also para 2.13). Where a question falls within the administration of another department or agency, an official witness may request that it be directed to that department or agency or be deferred until that department or agency is consulted. </PARA>
<PARA>Matters of policy</PARA>
<PARA>2.25 The role of an official witness is not to comment on policy but to speak to any statement provided to the committee and to provide factual and background material to assist understanding of the issues involved. The detailed rules applying to written submissions (para 2.15) also apply to oral evidence. Note, however, that such restrictions do not necessarily apply to statutory officers (see para 2.49). </PARA>
<PARA>2.26 The Senate resolutions provide that ``An officer of a department of the Commonwealth or of a State shall not be asked to give opinions on matters of policy, and shall be given reasonable opportunity to refer questions asked of the officer to superior officers or to a Minister'' (r.1.16). The resolutions also prescribe the procedure by which a witness may object to answering ``any question put to the witness'' on ``any ground'' (r.1.10). This would include the ground that the question requires the witness to give an opinion on a matter of policy contrary to r.1.16. In such a situation an officer may ask the person chairing the committee to consider whether questions which fall within the parameters of policy positions (outlined in para 2.15) are in order. Moreover, the resolutions provide scope for a witness to make a statement about matters of concern to the witness in pre-hearing discussions before appearing at the committee hearing (r.1.5). </PARA>
<PARA>2.27 If an official witness is directed to answer a ``policy'' question, and has not (in line with para 2.17) previously cleared the matter with the Minister, the officer should ask to be allowed to defer the answer until such clearance is obtained. Alternatively, it may be appropriate for the witness to refer to the written material provided to the committee and offer, if the committee wishes, to seek elaboration from the Minister; or to request that the answer to a particular question be reserved for submission in writing. </PARA>
<PARA>Public interest immunity</PARA>
<PARA>Claims to be made by Ministers</PARA>
<PARA>2.28 Claims that information should be withheld from disclosure on grounds of public interest (public interest immunity) should only be made by Ministers (normally the responsible Minister in consultation with the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister). </PARA>
<PARA>2.29 As far as practicable, decisions to claim public interest immunity should take place before hearings, so that the necessary documentation can be produced at the time. The normal means of claiming public interest immunity is by way of a letter from the Minister to the committee chairman. The Attorney-General's Department should be consulted on appropriateness of the claim in the particular circumstances and the method of making the claim. </PARA>
<PARA>2.30 As a matter of practice, before making a claim of public interest immunity, a Minister might explore with a committee the possibility of providing the information in a form or under conditions which would not give rise to a need for the claim (including on a confidential basis or in camera, see paras 2.35-2.36). </PARA>
<PARA>Matters arising during hearing</PARA>
<PARA>2.31 If an official witness, when giving evidence to a committee, believes that circumstances have arisen to justify a claim of public interest immunity, the official should request a postponement of the evidence, or of the relevant part of the evidence, until the Minister can be consulted. </PARA>
<PARA>Scope of public interest immunity</PARA>
<PARA>2.32 Documents-or oral evidence-which could form the basis of a claim of public interest immunity may include matters falling into the following categories that coincide with some exemption provisions of the FOI Act:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) material the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause damage to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) national security, defence, or international relations; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) relations with the States;</PARA>
<PARA> including disclosure of documents or information obtained in confidence from other governments;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) material disclosing any deliberation or decision of the Cabinet, other than a decision that has been officially published, or purely factual material the disclosure of which would not reveal a decision or deliberation not officially published;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) material disclosing any deliberation of or advice to the Executive Council, other than a document by which an act of the Governor-General in Council was officially published;</PARA>
<PARA>(d) material disclosing matters in the nature of, or relating to, opinion, advice or recommendation obtained, prepared or recorded, or consultation or deliberation that has taken place in the course of, or for the purpose of, the deliberative processes involved in the functions of the Government where disclosure would be contrary to the public interest;</PARA>
<PARA>(e) material relating to law enforcement or protection of public safety which would, or could reasonably be expected to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) prejudice the investigation of a possible breach of the law or the enforcement of the law in a particular instance;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) disclose, or enable a person to ascertain the existence or identity of a confidential source or information, in relation to the enforcement or administration of the law;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) endanger the life or physical safety of any person;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) prejudice the fair trial of a person or the impartial adjudication of a particular case;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) disclose lawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or dealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law the disclosure of which would, or would be reasonably likely to, prejudice the effectiveness of those methods or procedures; or</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) prejudice the maintenance or enforcement of lawful methods for the protection of public safety; and</PARA>
<PARA>(f) material subject to legal professional privilege. </PARA>
<PARA>It must be emphasised that the provisions of the FOI Act have no actual application as such to parliamentary inquiries, but are merely a general guide to the grounds on which a parliamentary inquiry may be asked not to press for particular information, and that the public interest in providing information to a parliamentary inquiry may override any particular ground for not disclosing information. For a more detailed understanding of the above exemption provisions, reference should be made to the FOI Act and to separate guidelines on its operation issued by the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA>2.33 In addition the following considerations may affect a decision whether to make documents or information available:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) secrecy provisions of Acts: Attorney-General's Department should be consulted when occasions involving such provisions arise; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) court orders or subjudice issues: where the provision of information would appear to be restricted by a court order, or where the question of possible prejudice to court proceedings could arise, the Attorney-General's Department should be consulted although decisions on the application of the subjudice rule are for the committee to determine, not witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA>Classified documents</PARA>
<PARA>2.34 Documents, and oral information relating to documents, having a national security classification of `confidential', `secret' or `top secret' would normally be within one of the categories in para 2.32, particularly para 2.32 (a). Before producing a document bearing such a classification, an official witness should seek declassification of the document. (Note that it does not follow that documents without a formal security classification may not be the subject of a claim of immunity. Nor does it follow that classified documents may not in any circumstances be produced. Each document should be considered on its merits and where classified, in consultation with the originator.)</PARA>
<PARA>In camera evidence</PARA>
<PARA>2.35 There may be occasions when a Minister (or, on his or her behalf, the departmental Secretary) would wish, on balancing the public interests involved, to raise with the committee the possibility of an official producing documents or giving oral evidence in camera, and on the basis that the information be not disclosed or published except with the Minister's consent (see r.1.7, r.1.8 and r.2.7). It should be noted that Estimates Committees have no power to take evidence in camera or to treat documents submitted to them as in camera evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Matters arising during hearing</PARA>
<PARA>2.36 If, when giving evidence to a committee, an official witness believes that circumstances have arisen to justify requesting that evidence be heard in camera, the official should make such a request if the possibility has been foreshadowed with the Minister or should ask for the postponement of the evidence or the relevant part of the evidence until the Minister can be consulted. (The Senate resolutions provide that ``A witness shall be offered, before giving evidence, the opportunity to make application, before or during the hearing of the witness's evidence, for any or all of the witness's evidence to be heard in private session, and shall be invited to give reasons for any such application. If the application is not granted, the witness shall be notified of reasons for the decision.'' (See r.1.7 and also r.1.8 relating to the publication of evidence given in camera.)</PARA>
<PARA>2.37 These circumstances might include cases where:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) although a claim of public interest immunity could be justified, the Minister considers that the balance of public interest lies in making information available to the committee;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) while a claim of immunity may not be appropriate, other social considerations justify the committee being asked to take evidence privately. Examples, which parallel other exemption provisions in Part IV of the FOI Act, are evidence the public disclosure of which would:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) affect law enforcement or protection of public safety;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) have a substantial adverse effect on financial or property interests of the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) prejudice the attainment of the objects or effectiveness of procedures or methods for the conduct of tests, examinations or audits of a Commonwealth agency;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) have a substantial adverse effect on the management or assessment of personnel, or on the proper and efficient conduct of the operations of a Commonwealth agency including the conduct by the Commonwealth of industrial relations;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) unreasonably disclose information relating to the personal affairs of any person. Note also that the Senate resolutions provide that a committee may consider taking in camera evidence reflecting adversely on a person (see r.1.11-r.1.13, r.2.1-r.2.3). The Privacy Act 1988, in particular Part III which explains Information Privacy Principles, is also relevant;</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) reveal business affairs, including trade secrets or other commercially sensitive information;</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) reasonably be expected to have a substantial adverse effect on the management of the economy or on the conduct of business generally; or</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) disclose material obtained in confidence;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) similar or identical evidence has been previously given in camera to other hearings of the committee or other committees of the Parliament and has not been made public. </PARA>
<PARA>Committee requests for evidence off the record</PARA>
<PARA>2.38 An official who is asked by a committee to give evidence `off the record', unless this refers to evidence given in camera or evidence of which there is to be no transcript taken, should appreciate that technically there is no such category as `off the record' evidence which has any special protection or status. In the event an official is asked to give evidence `off the record', however, he/she should request a postponement until the Minister can be consulted, unless the possibility has been clearly foreshadowed with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of submissions and witnesses</PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary privilege</PARA>
<PARA>2.39 The act of submitting a document to a parliamentary committee is protected by parliamentary privilege: Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, paragraph 16 (2) (b). Any publication of the submission other than to the committee, however, is protected by parliamentary privilege only if that publication takes place by or pursuant to the order of the committee, in which case the content of the document is also protected: paragraph 16 (2) (d) of the Act. The protection of parliamentary privilege means that a person cannot be sued or prosecuted in respect of the act or the material protected, nor can that act or material be used against a person in legal proceedings. The unauthorised disclosure of a document or evidence submitted to a parliamentary committee, that is, a disclosure not authorised by the committee or the House concerned, may be treated as a criminal offence under section 13 of the Act or as a contempt (r.6.16). </PARA>
<PARA>Contempt of the Parliament</PARA>
<PARA>2.40 It is an offence against s.12 (1) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act for a person, by fraud, intimidation, force or threat, by the offer or promise of any inducement or benefit, or by other improper means, to influence another person in respect of any evidence given or to be given before a House of the Parliament or a committee, or to induce another person to refrain from giving any such evidence. It is also an offence, under s.12 (2) of that Act, for a person to inflict any penalty or injury upon, or deprive another person of any benefit, any person on account of the giving or proposed giving of any evidence, or of any evidence given or to be given, before a House or a Committee. It should be noted that the existence of s.12 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act does not prevent imposition by a House of a penalty (see s.12 (3)). In particular, those kinds of conduct are also punishable as a contempt by the Senate (r.6.10 and r.6.11 respectively) or the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Self incrimination</PARA>
<PARA>2.41 In general a witness cannot refuse to answer a question or produce documents on the ground that the answer to the question or the production of documents might incriminate the witness. The exceptions to this are witnesses appearing before the Public Accounts Committee or the Public Works Committee (see s.19 of the Public Accounts Committee Act, s.25 of the Public Works Committee Act and para 2.6). In such cases parliamentary privileges protects a witness against only that evidence itself being used against the witness outside the Parliament; (for example, as evidence in proceedings before the courts). A witness may request the committee to take the evidence in camera in those circumstances (see r.1.7 and r.1.8). The Senate resolutions also outline a procedure for considering claims by a witness that he or she not answer a question on grounds of self-incrimination (r.1.10 and r.2.5). </PARA>
<PARA>Access to counsel</PARA>
<PARA>2.42 A witness may apply to have assistance from counsel in the course of a hearing. In considering such an application, a committee shall have regard to the need for the witness to be accompanied by counsel to ensure the proper protection of the witness. If an application is not granted, the witness shall be notified of reasons for that decision (see r.1.14). If an application is granted, the witness shall be given reasonable opportunity to consult general counsel during a committee hearing (see r.1.15). </PARA>
<PARA>2.43 In normal circumstances officials should not need counsel when appearing before parliamentary committees. Should the need arise, however, the Attorney-General's Department should be consulted. </PARA>
<PARA>Correction of Evidence</PARA>
<PARA>2.44 After perusing the record of their evidence, official witnesses should propose for the committee's consideration any necessary corrections for incorporation or noting in the published record. Where these affect the substance of evidence previously given, it may be necessary to seek the agreement of the committee on the way in which the correction should be made, e.g. by tendering a subsequent statement. The Senate resolutions provide that ``Reasonable opportunity shall be afforded to witnesses to make corrections of errors of transcription in the transcript of their evidence and to put before a committee additional material supplementary to their evidence'' (r.1.17). </PARA>
<PARA>2.45 Also, if a witness believes, after perusing the record, that he or she has omitted some relevant evidence, the witness should, having consulted with the Minister (or departmental Secretary), seek leave of the committee to lodge a supplementary statement or to give further oral evidence. All supplementary written material (authorised in accordance with these guidelines) should be forwarded to the committee secretary. </PARA>
<PARA>Publication of evidence</PARA>
<PARA>2.46 Evidence provided to committees in a public hearing is normally published in the form of a Hansard record. </PARA>
<PARA>2.47 Authority for the publication of evidence, whether taken in public or in camera, is vested in Parliamentary committees by virtue of s.2 (2) of the Parliamentary Papers Act 1908. Evidence taken in camera is confidential and its publications without a committee's consent constitutes a contempt (see s.13 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1947 and r.6.16). Note, too, that s.46 of the FOI Act provides for documents to be exempt if disclosure would infringe parliamentary privilege. </PARA>
<PARA>Proposals to publish in camera evidence</PARA>
<PARA>2.48 If a committee seeks an official witness's concurrence to publish the witness's in camera evidence, he or she should ask the committee to delay the decision to enable the witness to consult the Minister or the departmental Secretary. A committee will not normally authorise the publication of in camera evidence without the concurrence of the witness, although such concurrence is not a binding requirement (see r.1.8). </PARA>
<PARA>Official witnesses from statutory authorities</PARA>
<PARA>2.49 Members of authorities which have statutory public information and education roles clearly are able to express views on the policy responsibilities of their authorities. However, care should be taken to avoid taking partisan positions on matters of political controversy. In other respects these guidelines should be followed as far as is relevant including in relation to claims of public interest immunity (see para 2.28). </PARA>
<PARA>Appearance in a `personal' capacity</PARA>
<PARA>2.50 There is no intention for there to be any restriction on officers appearing before parliamentary committees in their `personal' capacity. An officer so called, however, should pay heed to the guidelines relating to public comment contained in the Guidelines on Official Conduct of Commonwealth Public Servants (July 1987). As the guidelines emphasise, it is particularly important for senior officials to give careful consideration to the impact, by virtue of their positions, of any comment they might make. Indeed heads of agencies and other very senior officers need to consider carefully whether, in particular cases, it is possible for them realistically to claim to appear in a `personal' rather than an `official' capacity, particularly if they are likely to be asked to comment on matters which fall within or impinge on their area of responsibility. An officer who is appearing before a committee in a personal capacity should make it clear to the committee that the officer's appearance is not in an official capacity. </PARA>
<PARA>PARTY COMMITTEES</PARA>
<PARA>3.1 It is quite appropriate for officials, subject to ministerial authorisation, to make themselves available to brief party committees to assist them in understanding the technical and factual background to government policies and proposals, including details and/or explanations of proposed legislation. Departmental officials will not be expected, or authorised, to express opinions on matters of a policy or party political nature (see paras 2.15 and 2.25). The guidelines for submissions to and appearances before parliamentary committees apply to briefing of party committees, subject to paras 3.2-3.7 below. </PARA>
<PARA>3.2 Committee requests for such briefing should be directed to the Minister concerned. It will also be open to Ministers to initiate proposals for briefing of committees, where they consider this to be desirable. </PARA>
<PARA>3.3 Where considered appropriate or desirable, Ministers may elect to be present at discussions with Government party committees, to deal with questions of a policy or party political nature. </PARA>
<PARA>3.4 Where the Minister does not attend the committee proceedings, officials should keep the Minister informed of the nature of the discussions and of any matters the officials could not resolve to the committee's satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA>3.5 Party committees do not have the powers or privileges of parliamentary committees. Consequently officials appearing before them do not have the protection afforded to witnesses appearing before parliamentary committees (see paras 2.39 and 2.41). Party committee hearings, however, are not generally held in public. </PARA>
<PARA>Individual members of Parliament</PARA>
<PARA>4.1 Members of Parliament usually request information through the responsible Minister, but direct approaches to officials for routine factual information, particularly on constituency matters, are also traditional and appropriate. When a request amounts to no more than a request for readily available factual information, the information should obviously be provided, although depending on the nature or significance of a request, an official may judge it appropriate to inform the departmental Secretary of the request and response. Ministers should be informed of any matter which is likely to involve them. </PARA>
<PARA>4.2 There may be other occasions where a Member of Parliament's request raises sensitive issues. For example, where expressions of opinion are sought on government policies or alternative policies, as distinct from explanation of existing policies. Officials will not be expected or authorised to express opinions on government policies, policy options or matters of a party political nature. Information provided may, however, include details of administrative arrangements and procedures involved in the implementation of approved policies or legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>4.3 If a Member of Parliament seeks expressions of opinion on government policies or policy options, it would be appropriate to suggest that the Member pursue the matter with the Minister. Similar action would be appropriate if a request raised other issues of a sensitive nature, or where the answering of a request would necessitate the use of substantial resources of the department or authority. </PARA>
<PARA>4.4 Care should be taken to avoid unauthorised disclosure of classified or otherwise confidential information-for example, where a breach of personal or commercial privacy could be involved. </PARA>
<PARA>4.5 Where an official considers that the terms of a request would require going beyond the authorised scope of the above arrangements, the official should so indicate to the Member, and would be at liberty to raise the matter with the departmental Secretary and the Minister and, if desired, with the Public Service Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Special arrangements for pre-election consultation with officials by the Opposition</PARA>
<PARA>4.6 On 5 June 1987 the Government tabled in the Parliament specific guidelines relating to consultation by the Opposition with officials during the pre-election period. These guidelines, which are almost identical with guidelines first tabled on 9 December 1976, are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The pre-election period is to date from three months prior to the expiry of the House of Representatives or the date of announcement of the House of Representatives election, whichever date comes first. It does not apply in respect of Senate elections only. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Under the special arrangement, shadow Ministers may be given approval to have discussions with appropriate officials of government departments. Party leaders may have other Members of Parliament or their staff members present. A departmental Secretary may have other officials present. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) The procedure will be initiated by the relevant Opposition spokesperson making a request of the Minister concerned who is to notify the Prime Minister of the request and whether it has been agreed. </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) The discussions will be at the initiative of the non-government parties, not officials. Officials will inform their Ministers when the discussions are taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> (v) Officials will not be authorised to discuss government policies or to give opinions on matters of a party political nature. The subject matter of the discussions would relate to the machinery of government and administration. The discussions may include the administrative and technical practicalities and procedures involved in implementation of policies proposed by the non-government parties. If the Opposition representatives raised matters which, in the judgement of the officials, sought information on government policies or sought expressions of opinion on alternative policies, the officials would suggest that the matter be raised with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> (vi) The detailed substance of the discussions will be confidential but Ministers will be entitled to seek from officials general information on whether the discussions kept within the agreed purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>Appearances before the Bar of a House of the Parliament</PARA>
<PARA>5.1 It would be only in exceptional circumstances that an official would be summoned to the bar of a House of the Parliament and each case would need individual consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>5.2 As a general rule, it would be appropriate for these guidelines to be followed insofar as they apply to the particular circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>Non-Parliamentary Public Inquiries (including Royal Commissions) and speeches</PARA>
<PARA>6.1 The guidelines for submissions to and appearances before parliamentary committees generally apply to submissions to and appearances before other public inquiries, and to the preparation and presentation of speeches by officials in their official capacity. </PARA>
<PARA>Speeches</PARA>
<PARA>6.2 Subject to these guidelines, officers, other than those employed in areas where national security or other reasons demand confidentiality, should be prepared to make themselves available to attend and address conferences in their areas of professional expertise. Speeches in such circumstances should aim to provide the necessary factual information and analytical material to promote informed public discussion. Such activities should be regarded as part of the normal interchange of information between government and community groups. </PARA>
<PARA>6.3 The Minister may decide to authorise the departmental Secretary to clear material for speeches. Subject to ministerial guidance, the Secretary is responsible for instituting appropriate departmental rules. Officials will often also find it necessary to speak in their official capacity without having the opportunity to clear the substance of their comments (for example, in open discussions at public seminars). In such cases officials should heed the rules laid down by the departmental Secretary and the Guidelines on Official Conduct of Commonwealth Public Servants concerning public comment by public servants. In particular, they should avoid taking partisan positions on policy issues or matters of public controversy. </PARA>
<PARA>Foreign Service</PARA>
<PARA>6.4 Heads of Australian diplomatic or consular posts and senior officials serving abroad have the responsibility in countries to which they are accredited to explain, advocate or defend the Government's international and domestic policies through public speeches, conferences, media enquiries, appearances before host government parliamentary committees, etc. It may not always be possible for officers to obtain ministerial or departmental clearance. It is expected, however, that public comment will be consistent with authorised policies in all respects. </PARA>
<PARA>Royal Commissions and bodies with Royal Commission powers</PARA>
<PARA>6.5 Officials appearing before Royal Commissions established by the Commonwealth should take note of the provisions of the Royal Commissions Act 1902. The categories of evidence enumerated in para 2.32 above are also appropriate to claims of public interest immunity before a Commonwealth Royal Commission. The circumstances in which the Commission might be asked to hear evidence in camera are also likely to be the same as those listed at para 2.37 above. </PARA>
<PARA>6.6. An official appearing before a Commonwealth Royal Commission or similar body may not refuse to answer a question (or to produce a document or other item) on the ground that the giving of the answer or the production of the document or item might tend to be self-incriminatory. This rule does not apply where an official has been charged with an offence and the charge has not been officially dealt with by a court or otherwise disposed of. </PARA>
<PARA>6.7 Where guidance is required regarding counsel for officials-including about legal aid-advice should be sought from the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA>State inquiries (parliamentary and other)</PARA>
<PARA>6.8 Where additional guidance is required regarding appearances before State inquiries, advice should be sought from the Attorney-General's Department. Such advice should also be sought where a claim of public interest immunity may be under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>Courts and tribunals</PARA>
<PARA>6.9 Where officials require further guidance or counsel in respect of their appearance before and giving evidence to courts of law and tribunals-particularly concerning possible claims of public interest immunity-advice should be sought from the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As the House will recall, guidelines on these matters have been tabled in the Parliament for many years now, by the previous Government and by this Government. Broadly speaking, the basic principles of the guidelines have remained unchanged throughout this period, and the Government is not proposing any fundamental change in this new version.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The revised guidelines take account, first, of the Senate's resolutions on parliamentary privilege of 25 February 1988 and, secondly, of experience in recent years in the interpretation and application of the guidelines when official witnesses appear before parliamentary committees. This latter consideration has led to the objective of making the guidelines a simpler and clearer exposition, for both officials and the Parliament, of the responsibilities and rights of officials providing evidence to parliamentary committees, party committees and other inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I draw the attention of the House in particular to the first paragraph of the guidelines which refers to the fundamental issue of accountability. Indeed, since the concept of accountability provides the philosophical underpinning for these guidelines, as it has with their predecessors, I read that paragraph in full. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>1.1 In the Australian system of parliamentary government, and consistent with the traditional understanding of ministerial responsibility, the public and parliamentary advocacy and defence of government policies and administration has traditionally been, and should remain, the preserve of Ministers, not officials. The duty of the public servant is to assist Ministers to fulfil their accountability obligations by providing full and accurate information to the Parliament about the factual and technical background to policies and their administration. The guidelines are therefore aimed at encouraging the freest possible flow of such information between the public service, the Parliament and the public. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise here that the Government is fully committed to the objective just enunciated of encouraging as free as possible a flow of factual and technical information between the Public Service and the Parliament. I believe, however, that all members of parliament will accept-as they have in the past-that a basic underlying premise of our system of government is that Ministers should be accountable to the Parliament for the administration of their departments and for their ministerial conduct, and in particular that it is Ministers and not officials who are responsible for public promotion or defence of government policies. </PARA>
<PARA> While these basic concepts can be stated relatively simply, putting them into practice in modern government is not nearly as simple as it used to be, principally because the size and complexity of government have grown so much. The legitimate role of the Parliament in scrutinising the activities of the Executive has also become more demanding and more complex, and part of the response has been to expand the structure and functions of parliamentary committees. Inevitably, also, there has been a significantly growing requirement for officials to be involved in parliamentary committee processes. The Government welcomes these developments which it regards as both proper and inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA> I note here, however, that it is often the case, when officials appear before parliamentary committees, that parliamentarians seek to gain political advantage from their interactions with officials by seeking to draw them into policy debate or otherwise seeking to elicit comment from them which goes beyond the bounds of their role of providing factual and technical information. When this occurs, it can place officials in an invidious position. Clearly, they have a duty, as set out in these guidelines, to be helpful to the committee and provide as much relevant information as is available. But at the same time departmental officials are, rightly, aware of the established position of law and principle that their primary obligation is to the Minister and government of the day-whatever its political complexion. What these revised guidelines seek to do, against that background, is to provide clear and unequivocal guidance as to the respective roles of Ministers and officials in their relationships with parliamentary committees. They seek to explain, as simply as possible, the practical implications of the basic concept of accountability which I referred to at the outset. </PARA>
<PARA> I am, of course, conscious of the growing interest in the Parliament-and particularly in some of its committees-in seeking ways to improve the processes of scrutiny of the Executive and to give more practical meaning to the concept of accountability. The Government has, from the very beginning of its period of office, taken very seriously its responsibilities and accountability to the Parliament. Many of the reforms which it has introduced in public sector management have been designed in a way which increases the amount of information available to the Parliament-and to the public-of relevance to the establishment of an effective scrutiny process. In particular, I draw attention to the innovations of the Government in publishing forward estimates of expenditure and in moving progressively towards the provision of far more comprehensive material on the outcomes of government activity. This enables, of course, better assessment of the effectiveness of government activity where such material is added to the material traditionally available on inputs. </PARA>
<PARA> Also of particular importance have been the increasing moves towards taking authority from central agencies and placing it in operating departments, in relation to both financial management and general management responsibilities. The Government acknowledges, however, that some of these reforms, including those just referred to, have made it necessary to reconsider the most effective approach to scrutiny, and to consider how best to clarify the practical application of the established principles of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, against that background, I am confident that these guidelines provide both the Parliament and officials with a sound basis for a continuing productive relationship which, amongst other things, will encourage proper consideration of the issues just referred to. As I said at the outset, the Government is determined that the Parliament and its committees should have full and proper access to the factual and technical material that officials are able to provide. For their part, senators and members should be conscious in their dealings with officials that the Commonwealth is fortunate to have a Public Service that is apolitical in the best sense of the word. Ultimately, that is what the guidelines seek to preserve and protect. That protection will be the greater if all participants in the process understand and support by their actions the underlying principles which the guidelines espouse. I commend the guidelines to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Opposition welcomes the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on guidelines for official witnesses before parliamentary committees. At the outset we note that the Government does not propose any fundamental change in the guidelines. It is, nevertheless, useful to have set down both the principles upon which the Government is acting and the detailed guidelines to which witnesses, Ministers, members and senators can have regard when witnesses come before parliamentary committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic principle underlying the guidelines is that, no matter how much facility is given to public servants in giving evidence before parliamentary committees, at the end of the day it is Ministers who are responsible to the Parliament and the public for government decisions, not public servants. Ministers are accountable to the Parliament and we should remind ourselves of this fact time and time again, particularly during Question Time. After all, this principle is at the basis of our system of government. It is particularly important to note-and I acknowledge that the Prime Minister has said this in his statement-that Ministers and not officials are responsible for the promotion and defence of government policies. Governments have policies but Public Service departments do not. I believe that in recent years a very unhealthy trend has developed whereby at least some departments seem to have come to hold the view that it is the department's policy that prevails. In fact, sometimes I receive-as do, I suppose, other members-letters from departments where the statement appears that `the Department's policy is so and so'. Of course, this is quite contrary to our system of government and departments should be reminded that they do not have a policy. It is not the departments but the elected government that makes policy. So, the principles set out in the Prime Minister's speech, by and large, are principles with which we can agree and it is timely that they should be set down in this manner. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the guidelines which have been tabled. They are a detailed series of rules to which officials will refer when requested to give evidence to parliamentary committees and whilst they are giving that evidence. We support most of the guidelines, but we will keep them under review. It may well be that changes are needed from time to time. The guidelines start off with the principle of accountability stated again-the principle that policies are the proper province of Ministers and not officials. The guidelines then set out the limitations on officials' evidence which must be imposed because of public interest immunity, where that arises, and because of the confidential nature of some evidence. They explain where it is appropriate for witnesses to qualify their answers. They note that witnesses should not intrude into the responsibilities of other departments and agencies and that the witnesses' role is not to comment on policy. They describe situations where, for instance, the disclosure of material could damage national security, defence, international relations or relations with the States. They deal with the use of classified documents and the D-classification process and with parliamentary privilege and offences against the Parliamentary Privileges Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines also deal with the collection of evidence given before committees, the publication of evidence, the process of providing separate information for individual members of parliament, arrangements for providing pre-election consultation with the Opposition, and appearances before non-parliamentary inquiries such as royal commissions and State inquiries. As I say, the guidelines seem to be a useful and practical guide for witnesses who give evidence before parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be said that the guidelines are only the bare bones. The flesh will be put on by the way in which the guidelines are applied. If they are applied in a constructive way to assist the Parliament and to advance the free flow of information, the guidelines will be useful and valuable. However, if they are applied in a restrictive and limiting way, then they will be counterproductive. Therefore, we will scrutinise the practical application of the guidelines and we will expect the Government to apply them in a constructive manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice, for instance, a report in the newsletter Inside Canberra dated 24 November which states that the guidelines may be a challenge to the demands of Senate committees to examine bureaucrats on the administration of their departments. That is, in effect, a very timely warning for members of parliament to be alert to what is going on around them. On their terms, the guidelines provide scope for assisting parliamentary committees and not for challenging them. Therefore, we trust that they will actually be applied in a helpful way and not in an obstructive way. We certainly will not be a party to any guidelines that improperly or excessively restrict the work of parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is one matter of concern in the Prime Minister's statement which is also referred to in the guidelines. The Prime Minister gives his Government a pat on the back by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has, from the very beginning of its period of office, taken very seriously its responsibilities and accountability to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister goes on to say something that is sure to give honourable members an even heartier laugh. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government is fully committed to the objective . . . of encouraging as free as possible a flow of factual and technical information between the Public Service and the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I am afraid that I have not found that the Government takes very seriously its accountability to the Parliament. I certainly have not seen any evidence of the Government contributing anything at all to the free flow of information between itself and the Parliament. To take a random example, if we look at the sad history of the way in which the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has responded over the recent months to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron)--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And, of course, to senators when they have simply sought factual information, one could not by any stretch of the imagination come to the conclusion that the Government had done anything at all to encourage the free flow of factual and technical information. Likewise, Question Time by no stretch of the imagination could be described as a period in the Parliament's day now where there is any attempt whatsoever to give any factual information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to refer to these particular matters, but to the way in which the Government has applied the Freedom of Information Act. This is specifically referred to in the guidelines. The guidelines state that the Freedom of Information Act establishes minimum standards of disclosure of documents held by the Commonwealth. One can certainly say that a very minimum standard indeed is applied by the present Government. It is true to say that this Government, like the Cain Government in Victoria, has stood in the way of a full and beneficial use of the Freedom of Information Act. In fact, it has continually resorted to an almost never ending list of shabby devices to frustrate the proper workings of the Act. The Government has done this particularly to members of parliament. It is no exaggeration to say that it is an act of deliberate policy of the present Government to prevent members of parliament from using the Freedom of Information Act. In the first place, the Government has imposed excessive charges and fees on those using the Act. Secondly, it has ensured that the burden of those charges falls on senators and members in a very heavy way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was about to refer to a case where an honourable member was charged $7,000 for simple documents relating to the exchange of information between the Soviet Union and Australia on the War Crimes Act. Now we find that an attempt was made to charge the honourable member for Moreton $11,000 for documents under the so-called Freedom of Information Act. I well remember a couple of years ago under the present Government one department writing a letter to me saying, in effect, that if I made more applications to the department under the FOI Act I would be charged for them. That threat has been carried out by not only that department but also virtually all departments. Quite apart from the Government being responsible, as the Prime Minister said, for `encouraging as free as possible a flow of factual and technical information', on my experience the Government has done everything it can to prevent the free flow of information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I need to refer only to an example that arose yesterday. I received a letter from one agency of the Commonwealth to which I had submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act. The letter sent in reply contained nine paragraphs, seven of which referred to charges that it expected me to pay. So much for the spirit of the FOI Act and the spirit of the free flow of information! These are not just isolated incidents; they are now a matter of regular practice. In addition, the conscious policy of the Government is to scour the FOI Act to dredge up every conceivable objection and ground for refusing to release any documents at all or, alternatively, for refusing to release really interesting documents that might embarrass the Government or throw the spotlight on what has happened in the deeper recesses of the Government. These are not isolated incidents to which I am referring. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, I have here a response I received only yesterday to a request under the Freedom of Information Act which says, in the first place-it gets off to a good start-that to process my request `would substantially and unreasonably divert the resources' of the agency from its other operations. So it will not even try. In the second place the letter goes on to give a page and a half of additional reasons why documents will not be released under this Act. There is, of course not a word-not a syllable-about how the agency might help, not a word about contributing to this great free flow of information that the Prime Minister speaks of-no, a page and a half of excuses as to why I cannot be given anything at all. </PARA>
<PARA> If, of course, the persistent user of the Freedom of Information Act gets to the stage of actually getting any documents out of the Government, which is a rare occurrence, frequently they look like the one I have in my hand. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might like to have a look at this. This is an example of the sort of thing that one gets. Parts of it are completely blacked out. Honourable members should look at this, because this is freedom of information Labor-style. This resulted from an attempt to find out what deal the Government had done with some of those involved with the yachts in the America's Cup contest by way of avoiding paying customs duty and sales tax. I thought that was a legitimate thing to inquire into. Of course, in those days Mr Bond was on the official guest list. Things have changed a bit since then. This document is an example of what one gets-two pages of blacked out material, material that is covered in printer's ink so that little can be read. One of the very few things that can be read on this document, however, is that it is signed by Mr G. Hope. I suppose it is appropriate enough that there should be `hope' on it, because there is not much sign of any faith or charity. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the Freedom of Information Act has become a farce and a charade under the present Government. It is now the principal instrument that it uses to prevent the free flow of information, which is quite contrary to the proposition of the Prime Minister that the Government is committed to encouraging a free flow of information. As I come to the end of these few remarks, let me say that I hope that, if the Prime Minister is in fact announcing that the Government is turning over a new leaf today on the free flow of information, it will start from today with an honest and constructive use of the Freedom of Information Act, rather than the shabby use that the Government has made of it in the past to frustrate the actual release of information and to prevent the disclosure of what the Government is really up to. We hope, therefore, that the Government will now stop using the Freedom of Information Act to conceal from citizens what it is in fact doing, which is undoubtedly the present use that the Government is making of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This, of course, is a very severe qualification of the Prime Minister's statement but, with that qualification and the other reservations that I have made in the course of these remarks, the statement and the guidelines that have been tabled are supported by the Opposition. But we in the Opposition will be watching their application and their administration very closely indeed. </PARA>

Recently I made application to the Department of Finance for documents. What were those documents about? I wanted to know what the instructions were which were given by the Ministry to the Department of Finance on the Opposition's Economic Action Plan.

Since that very successful plan was launched-a plan widely accepted and applauded by the Australian public-there has not been a day when this Government has not sought to destroy it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I make is a very simple one. It underscores exactly what the honourable member for Menzies has said: this is a government which is determined, so far as it can, to hide what is happening from the Australian public. If ever there was an application under the Freedom of Information Act which, on the public interest, had to be justified as one on which fees should not be imposed, it was the one I made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a statement to the House on my recent visits to the United States, Japan and Thailand. The major focus of each of these visits was to discuss progress in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. However, I also used the visits to advance bilateral trade issues of concern to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The visit to the United States immediately preceded the tabling by the United States in Geneva of its proposal for world agricultural reform in the GATT round. The United States proposal is a bold but pragmatic approach. It includes many of the elements that the Cairns Group and Australia see as essential to any reform of agriculture in the round, including fairer access to markets, reductions in domestic subsidies and removal of export subsidies. The United States proposal was most welcome as it provided a necessary impetus to the Geneva agricultural negotiations, which had fallen into a hiatus and a period of backsliding since the April trade negotiations committee meeting. It also provided a basis on which the Cairns Group could formulate its own proposal, knowing the approach of at least one of the other major players. </PARA>
<PARA> In my discussions with United States Trade Representative Ambassador Carla Hills, Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter and members of Congress, I also raised several bilateral concerns. I might say that the number of issues was less than in recent previous similar meetings in the United States. I flagged Australia's concerns that the United States should frame a less protectionist 1990 Farm Bill. I also raised our concerns that any redistribution of sugar quotas in the United States should be on a non-discriminatory basis; that the United States should soon review its sugar program in the light of the recently adopted GATT panel report; concerns over the use of the export enhancement program, and particularly recent initiatives on malt. The United States agreed to further consultations on these recent malt initiatives and undertook that Australian interests would be taken into account. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that, during my visit to the United States, officials initialled an agreement on steel exports to the United States which will be highly advantageous to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In Tokyo I took part in the informal meeting of Trade Ministers on the Uruguay Round. The purpose of this meeting was for Ministers from around 25 countries to assess the current state of negotiations in the round. Many of those present shared my view that there has been very little progress since the mid-term review of the round concluded in April. There was general agreement in Tokyo that Ministers did not want this round to drag on beyond its scheduled closing date of the end of 1990. Unfortunately, there was little sign of the political will needed to make substantial progress on such contentious issues as agriculture and textiles. </PARA>
<PARA> Some countries have not yet started to explain to their domestic constituencies the benefits of reform. It has to be stressed again that without progress in these areas there will be no balanced results in the round and many countries, particularly developing countries, will just not accept that. In fact if Ministers in the European Community and Japan needed to be reminded of the outcome at Montreal-and it appeared some did have short memories-the message was clear. The agenda for the meeting did not list agriculture as a separate item. Cairns Group Ministers made it a major issue, debating the matter for half a day of the day meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministers and senior officials of the Cairns Group of Fair Traders in Agriculture met in Chiang Mai, Thailand, from 21 to 23 November. I had the honour of chairing this meeting. The focus of the meeting was to consider the terms of a Cairns Group negotiating proposal on agriculture and to discuss the Group's future strategy. At the meeting, we agreed on a comprehensive Cairns Group proposal for the global reform and liberalisation of agricultural trade over a period of 10 years or less. This proposal is being tabled at the meeting of the GATT agriculture negotiating group currently taking place in Geneva. The Cairns Group believes this proposal should give new and much needed impetus to the negotiating process during the final critical 12 months of the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA> The main elements of the integrated package of reform measures include:</PARA>
<PARA>substantial improvements in market access opportunities and greater transparency in the provision of border protection, including through the conversion of non-tariff measures to tariffs, combined with subsequent reductions and bindings of those tariffs at low or zero levels;</PARA>
<PARA>prohibition of new, and phase out of existing, export subsidies;</PARA>
<PARA>substantial reductions in, and disciplines on, the internal support provided to agriculture, with a focus on policy specific cuts to the most trade distorting forms of support and allowing scope for flexibility in the choice of reform mechanisms;</PARA>
<PARA>greater disciplines on countervailing duty procedures and enforcement of all trade reform obligations through multilaterally agreed provisions;</PARA>
<PARA>elaboration of the development dimension of trade in agriculture of interest to developing countries. The concerns of net food importing developing countries are also taken into account; and</PARA>
<PARA>modalities for special and differential treatment for developing countries which are integrated into elements of the proposed reform process. As with other elements of the proposal, these will be developed and specified further as the negotiations evolve. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposal is a challenging yet realistic negotiating document. In conjunction with the Cairns Group paper on sanitary and phytosanitary measures tabled in September 1989, it constitutes a complete and pragmatic approach to reform and would provide a sound basis for negotiations in 1990. It fully meets the trade liberalising objectives for agriculture agreed at the April meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Cairns Group Ministers are disappointed by some recent proposals and statements which indicate little more than a desire to maintain the status quo. As I said, we welcome the constructive United States proposal tabled last month and call upon other participants, in particular the European Community and Japan, to advance comprehensive proposals that would give effect to the mandate for substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection agreed at the April meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee. The Cairns Group, for its part, will continue to work closely together to achieve a fairer and more liberal world trading system for agriculture. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The coalition welcomes the report by the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy). By way of introduction, let me say that we regret that it is the only statement that he has made in this place in the past six months. For a country that has a current account deficit forecast this year to be $18.5 billion and a country whose fortunes rest so heavily on its capacity to trade internationally, it is to be regretted that the Minister has not had more opportunity to speak in this House and keep honourable members more fully and comprehensively briefed on the Government's policy and its activities overseas. However, having regard to his statement I understand perhaps why there has not been more formal reporting to the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We certainly welcome the moves that have been made towards liberalising trade but, regrettably, as I am sure the Minister acknowledges, not all in his statement was rosy. In fact, his acknowledgment that little progress had been made since April was of considerable concern to me. Australia is a natural trading nation and we have a natural advantage in our resources and primary industries. Since 70 per cent of our export earnings come from these sectors, we must do all in our power to ensure that we maximise our comparative advantage and negotiate trading relationships that reflect our place in the international marketplace. It is worth noting that Australia does not have an edge in the manufacturing sector and this has been recognised in the recent Australian Manufacturing Council report The Global Challenge. We continue to support an inefficient manufacturing sector at considerable peril. It is essential that we clearly prioritise our economic--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WE4">Mr BLUNT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can well understand that the Minister is embarrassed that in seven years this Government has achieved the sum total of having agriculture listed on one agenda. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to remind the Minister that I listened in silence to his speech. If he wants to debate this issue, I am more than happy to do so at any time. But of course the Government will not run trade as a debate in this place. It rarely makes a statement on the issue. The opportunity to debate what is in fact an appalling trade performance does not exist under the Government's running of this Parliament. The Minister knows it. Yet he sits over there, reclining on the bench, interjecting and attempting to defend an appalling record. He ought to be ashamed of himself. If he wants to debate the subject, let us debate it. Let us have a full-blown debate with a couple of speakers on each side. That would be a much better way of going about it because, as we all know, there is a high degree of bipartisanship in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing that I lament quite sincerely and genuinely is the Minister's very partisan comment which was totally unnecessary. In his term as Minister for Trade Negotiations, I think that he would find it very difficult to find any explicit criticism of the way the Government has progressed Australia's interests in this area. If the Minister is so sensitive that he has to respond in such a way, I wonder what he is trying to hide. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, for too long there have been inadequate developments or changes in the international trading sector. There has been virtually a total lack of preparedness by our trading partners to move towards genuine reductions in protection. I acknowledge the difficulty of negotiating in the face of vested political interests. However, over recent years there have been some movements in this regard, albeit slow ones. The development of the Cairns Group in 1986 was a positive step in this regard and I am happy to acknowledge it. The recent round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations was a further significant step. The Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting held recently in Canberra also provided a positive step in a forward-looking approach to Asia. Despite these positive moves, the Minister in his speech has identified some areas where additional initiatives are required. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out that the coalition was disappointed to note the absence in the statement of a reference to our important resource industries, particularly coal. The coalition would have welcomed an announcement with respect to the developments in the United States in this regard. It should also be remembered that these industries are vital to a positive outcome in the Uruguay Round. I remind the Minister and the Parliament that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has often mentioned-in fact grandstanded on-our energy sectors during his overseas visits. Yet when it comes to reporting to the Parliament on trade negotiations, it does not rate the priority of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Minister has done a good job with regard to steel in the United States of America-I repeat: he has done a good job with regard to steel in the United States of America-and he should be congratulated on it, there is no basis for the Government to become complacent with these results. We need to keep our efforts going strongly in other markets. It is a great pity that the Minister reported that at the informal meeting of Trade Ministers he was advised that since the mid-term review there had been little progress. I believe that that would be a genuine disappointment to all honourable members who are concerned about progress for the liberalisation of trade internationally. What is needed is a real political commitment to deal with hard issues and inefficient agricultural protection methods used overseas. Nevertheless, the coalition is pleased to hear of the reform package tabled at the meeting of the GATT agriculture negotiating group. We recognise its potential and urge the Government to pursue, for the time that it remains in office, Australia's interests in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Of particular significance to primary industry in Australia are proposals for a prohibition of new and phasing out of export subsidies; substantial reductions in support to be provided to agriculture; enforcement of multilaterally agreed provisions; and consideration of the special position of Third World countries. The coalition welcomes the document and will be watching with interest the Government's actions to advance its fortunes at meetings in the near future. It is all important to ensure that Australia's interests are considered and protected by a comprehensive and coherent negotiating stance in these areas. While we break down our trade barriers, it is essential that we press for reciprocal action to be taken by the governments of our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I make one point: whilst I agree with the Minister's comments concerning the proposals of the United States of America for, as he described it, `bold agricultural reform', I strongly urge him and the Government to consider taking every action possible to ensure that the United States does not enact a more protectionist farm Bill this year. On behalf of the coalition, I assure him that we will support his endeavours in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of all the policy differences between the Government and the Opposition none is more clear than our views on the need to fix up Australia's industrial relations system. In fact, the first matter of public importance for this Budget session was on the question of industrial relations. Eighteen months ago we launched the most comprehensive industrial relations policy that any Opposition has ever presented to the Australian electorate, and in the highly successful Economic Action Plan what is up there as one of the high priorities but, of course, our industrial relations policy. The policy is designed to help Australia address some of our basic problems-our massive international debt, higher and higher inflation, the need to arrest the decline in living standards facing the ordinary Australian family, and the need to reverse Labor's low wage policy. By way of contrast we have Labor's policy on industrial relations-a policy of mere chaos and confusion.</PARA></TALK.START>

Who was he pointing the gun at? None other than the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) and this Government. He said that they had acted disgracefully, that they had acted stupidly, and, as I said , that it was the worst handled dispute he had ever seen. Who will ever forget the words of our Prime Minister at the commencement of this dispute? He saw a flickering flame and threw a can of petrol on it. We will never forget the ridicule with which he treated the pilots. Remember how he had had a few hours lessons in a Chipmunk, and his line was that any idiot could fly; a bus driver could run us back and forth on a Boeing 747? Do not forget the way he itched for a fight with the pilots and the way in which he dumped at such speed the Industrial Relations Commission, only to come back to use it later to justify his policy position. What a contrast it makes to the way in which this Government handled the Builders Labourers Federation and the Prime Minister's abandonment of the right of freedom of association and all that goes with it. </PARA>
<PARA> The pilots dispute reveals that when it comes to a weighing up of the balance between the national interest, the interest of taxpayers who are funding through their taxes the perpetuation of this dispute, and the interests of his mates in the ACTU or at Ansett Airlines of Australia, on each and every occasion it is the interests of his mates that always win. The Prime Minister thought that this was going to be an election issue; he was going to be the Ronald Reagan of the 1980s and 1990s. He was going to be the Antipodes answer to Margaret Thatcher and the coalminers. He was going to use this dispute as a leg into an early election, and he was prepared to go to any lengths to achieve that position. He was certainly prepared, and has been prepared, to sacrifice the tourist industry in his quest for a political victory, and when it comes to his own principles they just go out the door, out with the wind. This is the man who used the accord back in 1983 to knife his previous Leader and who said in the accord:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will encourage the settlement of disputes between employers and unions by conciliation and without recourse to legislative or common law penal sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA>It was the same man who, on the Mudginberri dispute, said as follows as quoted in the Age of 23 July 1986:</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, yesterday described the Mudginberri abattoir decision as important but criticised the use of `harsh legal sanctions'. </PARA>
<PARA>He is also quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't believe that better industrial relations are brought about by the method of harsh legal sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA>So those principles, that position that he adopted previously, went out the window when it suited him. This is the man who in 1987 was moving legislatively to limit recourse to common law remedies. This is the man who embraced common law remedies when it suited his political purposes-and when he embraces them he does so in a really big way. This is what the great conciliator said on 20 August:</PARA>
<PARA>I say without equivocation that when the airlines decide to institute those legal processes with significant, very drastic financial penalties against individual pilots and their organisation, the airlines will be pursuing those legal processes with the full support of my Government. </PARA>
<PARA>So he was in there boots and all. Then what do we find? He declares war. Even while the pilots are still within the so-called system, the Prime Minister declares war. What a mockery that makes of his pathetic defence in the last few days that one can have common law actions if the matter is outside the system but, by implication, not if it is within the system. What he does not seem to want to realise and face up to is that the Australian Federation of Air Pilots did not become liable because it stepped outside the accord but because of a breach of the law of contract. The accord is just another fix, like the fix at Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd or the fix with the bank executives. The accord is the biggest fix of all. This Prime Minister's claim that there is some sort of in-and-out defence in respect of those who can be subject to common law actions is nonsense, as is the rather more extraordinary claim that we find in today's press about the right to strike being somehow enshrined in domestic convention. If ever a dispute exposes a Prime Minister's phoney reputation as a conciliator, it is this dispute. It shows the lengths to which he will go for his own political purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister is not on his own in this dispute. Some very interesting remarks have been made by the Minister for Industrial Relations, who is at the table, the Minister who I might describe as the weakest link in one of the worst front benches we have had in this country in history, and a man who is of such high reputation that he found himself under public attack by the powerful Secretary of the ACTU as being a Minister who had little understanding of industrial relations issues. Having had Mr Kelty clip him over the ears on the issue of award restructuring, it was no wonder that when the decision of the Supreme Court came down on Thursday this Minister was determined to avoid another clip over the ears from Mr Kelty. So what is his knee-jerk reaction to the Supreme Court decision? The Minister says that he would support the ACTU and the right to strike and he would be happy to bring in legislation if that is what is required. He knows where his bread is buttered, if any Minister ever did. The Minister started off by saying, `We may have to start action. We would have to look at legislative action if the court impugned this right to strike'. Then the confusion really set in. What did the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, then do? He admitted that there was an inconsistency between what the Minister was saying, about the necessity for some legislative action, and what the Prime Minister had said in terms of regret. </PARA>
<PARA> We then had a situation where, thirdly, the Prime Minister's response was, `Look, it seemed a good idea at the time'-a sort of streaker's defence-and backed off. The Prime Minister put the Minister back in his box, he sent a private circular to members of the Cabinet in the last few days, and his position now is that the court case has changed nothing and there is no need for legislative measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomes that statement, because we support the principle that all persons should be equal before the law. What the Minister will not acknowledge is that a clear legal framework where everybody knows where they stand legally is absolutely essential to reducing industrial action, the level of disputation, and curbing union bully boy tactics. Generally, common law remedies are only going to be used as a last resort, but the certain knowledge of their existence will encourage more reasonable conduct. One of the great myths of the failed accord is this claim that Labor has achieved by some miraculous means a reduction in the level of disputes-and I am sure that we will hear the Minister say that. Why is it that for some years in Australia, as has happened overseas, we have had a reduction in the number of days lost? It is because people in the trade union movement, as has been admitted by Mr Kelty, are starting to realise that cases like Mudginberri and Dollar Sweets mean that they have obligations and that those obligations can be enforced through the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it was this side of politics that introduced section 45d and some of the statutory remedies which started to make the point that people-unions in particular-were not beyond the law. In a moment the Minister will say that we are confrontationist. That is the standard response from this Minister and all those on his side. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a cliche, as the honourable member for Menzies properly characterises it. It really hides the fact that the real confrontationists are the trade union leaders who believe that industrial action is the way ahead. Who has been the symbol of that policy position on the other side of politics? None other than the former President of the ACTU, the present Prime Minister of this country. The Government follows that up by having the audacity to say to the electorate, `Don't vote for the coalition because, if you do, all hell will break loose'. Of course, that is a very predictable line. It is one of the standard lines from the other side. It brings a smile to our faces because the reality is that what this Government endorses by implication is that the trade union movement every day of the week would prefer to have this Minister, this Government, in power for one simple reason-that is, that this Government is putty in its hands. This Government does what it is told. The trade union movement does not want to face a coalition government with a fair industrial relations policy, which deals properly with people regardless of their circumstances and which will really introduce some meaningful reforms to our industrial relations system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The chaos and confusion are very apparent in the area of the Government's industrial relations policy. They are very clear wherever one looks. Take, for example, the whole question of compliance provisions. In 1987 this Government introduced a Bill which had two major components. One was to introduce a directions and injunctions process, a sensible measure to give the then Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission some teeth. The other part was to provide some restrictions on access to common law remedies. We all know the history of the Bill. The Government had to dump the second part because of controversy, particularly within the business community. We have now reached a point where the Prime Minister is accepting common law remedies anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> One would think that that would leave the first part, the directions and injunctions process, as a proposition the Government could support. So we introduced a Bill just a month or so ago. If the Government had adopted it, it would have been of great assistance in dealing with the pilots. The Government declared war on the pilots, but when we offered some legislation actually to deal with the situation the Government rejected it because its mates in the ACTU will not allow the implementation of a decent compliance provision in the legislation. It is hypocrisy. The Government itself initiated such a Bill, but it had to say no when we introduced a similar Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> If one wants to see further evidence of confusion one can look at the whole question of enterprise agreements. The Government thinks that it can run a line to try to keep up with the debate which the Opposition has been setting for some considerable time. We had great confusion from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on the whole subject of enterprise agreements, only to find that the Minister for Industrial Relations, on the AM program the other day, said that reform was in fact naive, irresponsible, provocative and blinded by dogma. That says much for the suggestions from the Treasurer and reveals much as to the confusion on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that industrial relations reform is high on the agenda. This country is crying out for that reform, as it is for many other reforms. Common law remedies are an important part of a proper, sensible industrial relations system. We endorse the concept of common law remedies. I say to the Prime Minister that, when Bill Kelty rings him this week to give him a blast over common law remedies, he will be able to say, `Well, mate, we support common law remedies and we have the support of the Opposition in doing so'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not mind the personal abuse from the gentleman who has just resumed his seat, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith); but I think it demeans the debate on an issue of such importance as the industrial relations policy of this country and the alternatives when the best the honourable member can do is abuse the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his absence. If the honourable member for Flinders really has guts and has something to say, he can stand up in this place and move a substantive motion. That is the honourable way to do it. His use of abuse is cheap and demeans the Parliament, but it is what we have come to expect from him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member says that the industrial relations policy of the Opposition is highly successful. It is so successful that industry leaders do not want a bar of it. They do not want to know about it; they do not want to talk about it. They are the practitioners, the people having to manage industrial relations in the workplace, and they know what it is all about. The honourable member quoted from a statement by the Prime Minister but carefully neglected to detail to the House the preceding part of that statement. By way of preamble the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>I expressed the strong wish and hope to the air pilots and their Federation that they will, on consideration, decide to stay within the system like the rest of their fellow Australian workers. Now if against that wish and that hope they make the decision to go outside the system then they must do so in the recognition, as I have said in the Parliament of this country, that they will have left the system which carries not only obligations to which I have been referring, but which also carries rights. Once they go outside the system, if that is their decision, which I hope they do not take, then we have then discussed the next steps which must be and will be taken to defeat this entirely unacceptable campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>Later followed the comments which the honourable member related to this chamber. It is typical of the performance and presentation of the honourable member and of the Opposition to have that kind of quote presented in this chamber. We caught the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) at the same thing the other day. </PARA>
<PARA> I want quickly to contrast the Opposition's approach to industrial relations with that of this Government. Through policies of consultation and cooperation, this Government has transformed industrial attitudes and practices in this country over the past 6 1/2 years. One indicator of our success is shown in the dramatic reduction in industrial disruption compared with that under the Fraser Government. Under this Government there has been a reduction of 60 per cent in the number of working days lost per month per 1,000 employees. That is the test. That is what industry sees and what reflects favourably on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The period of the Fraser Government was a period of conflict and engineered confrontation. Nobody on the other side of the House should try to tell me otherwise. Any reasonable person who sat here and watched what went on in the old Parliament House saw that there was engineered confrontation. It is very clear from listening to the honourable member for Flinders that the Opposition has learned nothing and forgotten nothing from its experience from 1975 to 1983. It is proposing an industrial policy which is even worse than the path followed by the Fraser Government. It is the same old thing: confrontation, conflict, division, pitting Australian against Australian. Let members of the Opposition go back, as I said the other day, and negotiate shop by shop, farm by farm, factory by factory and mine by mine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not what the Treasurer (Mr Keating) says. Let them do that. That goes back to the nineteenth century, to the circumstances of exploitation and abuse that brought about the development of the conciliation and arbitration court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's policy proposes no credible national wages policy. It proposes bargaining outside the national industrial system. The Opposition says that there will be some sort of wages control and supervision but that some sectors of the work force-those with muscle, naturally-can go outside and do their own private thing. It says that that will not have any effect upon wages policy. That is like being a little bit pregnant. Either one has a wages policy or one does not. Either one has the oversighting of national economic policy and industrial relations or one does not. One cannot sensibly have a system where part of the work force has to be before the Commission and others can break out if they wish-if they feel they have muscle, they can go and do their own thing. That is what is being put forward by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition proposes reliance on unlimited penalties in Federal law and in common law to restrain industrial action. The Opposition puts forward a system of getting whatever one wants regardless of the national interest-in other words, let wages rip. Those with strength and power will do well and the rest of Australia's working men and women will be left to struggle to get what they can. That is the contrast, the lack of fairness; but that is the irresponsibility in terms of economic management as well. Those opposite say that if wages ripple they will contain it by sanctions and legal remedies. They are really saying, `Let's get back to the Fraser big stick: tougher powers, more discipline, more common law actions, a tougher Industrial Relations Commission Act and back to the Trade Practices Act'. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, Senator Chaney, who changes daily on industrial relations issues, is out there saying to industry, `We're not confrontationist. We want to work with industry and trade unions'. But the real policy is not coming from Senator Chaney; the real policy is coming from the New Right, from the McLachlans, the Costellos, the Copemans and the Elliotts. They are the people driving the Opposition's policy. One has to have a great deal of sympathy for the honourable member for Flinders and certainly for Senator Chaney. He has to go out there and market that policy in a gentle way as if it is reasonable. In practice, it is the absolute opposite. It is the essence of confrontation and brute force. Back they go to the big stick. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government does not condone or encourage industrial action. We support the peaceful resolution of industrial differences through negotiation, conciliation and, where necessary, arbitration. Through our policies and in cooperation with industry and unions we have brought about a transformed industrial climate in Australia without resort to the draconian approach that the Opposition considers essential. It is a fact of industrial life that strike action will occur. In democratic societies it is accepted that, subject to certain reasonable limitations, workers are entitled to withdraw their labour to defend or promote their economic interests. Workers can reasonably be expected to comply with the requirements of a system for dispute resolution and balanced compliance measures, which may legitimately exist within such a system to deal with the refusal to accept those processes. This approach is consistent with the accepted principles of freedom of association. Let me underline that the overwhelming majority of disputes in this country are settled through the industrial relations system, through the respective industrial relations commissions. </PARA>
<PARA> What industry wants and what this nation needs more than anything else is stability, predictability. They want a system in which we can get change and improvement, but where industry has predictability because it needs to plan its investment, it needs to plan its market development, it needs to plan for the upgrading of its training facilities, and it needs to plan for the growth that is necessary to improve our export trade. As I said earlier, it is no wonder that four out of five chief executives of Australian business do not want a bar of the Opposition's industrial relations policy. That is not me saying that, it is not a political statement; it is a fact of life. They are the people out there in the real world, not the world the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth, says that we live in and are part of, but the real world of business, of trade, of employment, of living; and out there, chief executives do not want a bar of what the Opposition has put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> If one goes a little further one comes to enterprise agreements-the proposal put forward by the New South Wales Government. The legislation is in the New South Wales Parliament today. It has a childlike belief that in some way an enterprise agreement between employers and employees-any deal that they want to do-can be kept secret from the rest of the community and will not have flow-on effects and lead to a wages breakout. That is a grand experiment, a dangerous experiment, for the Federal Opposition. That proposal is not wanted by the Metal Trades Industry Association of New South Wales. It is opposed by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales, by the Employers Federation of New South Wales and by the trade union movement. Again, it is the practitioners out there, the people making the decisions, who do not want anything to do with what the Opposition has put forward as its industrial relations policy. </PARA>

<PARA> The Government's position on the use of common law action in the pilots dispute has been completely consistent. The Government pleaded with the members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. As I said earlier when quoting the Prime Minister, we pleaded with the Federation to stay within the system, to accept the processes for dispute resolution of the legislation under which the Federation was registered. The Federation refused to do so. We have an extraordinary situation, one of significant national importance, which has caused major disruption to our airline services and one that is demonstrably different from most other industrial disputes in Australia. The Federation has deliberately chosen to operate outside the Federal industrial system. The consequence has been that the ordinary civil laws have been used by the airlines to address the situation. We made it clear at the outset that this could have been avoided. But in the light of the Federation's position, in the unique circumstances of the case and in the national interest, the Government was not prepared to shield the Federation from the consequences of its own actions. The Government's overall policy remains unchanged: it encourages the parties involved to operate within the proper processes for dispute resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn away from the pettiness of the honourable member for Flinders, who has tried to illustrate some sort of confusion on the part of the Government. I have rebutted that; the Government is utterly consistent. I will not go through the detail and recount to the House the statement I made on television the other evening, which some have misunderstood, misinterpreted and misreported, but the detail is there. I refer to the Federal Opposition's schizophrenic approach to industrial relations and to the pilots dispute. I want to say, as firmly as I can, that the Federal Opposition carries a large share of responsibility for whatever damage has been done to the airline system, to the tourism industry, to people generally. It began by supporting the Government's action. It then switched from that. By its aid, encouragement and support for the Federation, it has lengthened the dispute. It has prolonged the delay in resumption of normal air services. Opposition members have gone around this country saying what a terrible thing this dispute is. When the airlines put aircraft into the air, Opposition members rushed off and tried to convince people that the air services were not operating and, they said, `But if they are operating, they are unsafe and you ought not to fly in them'. Similarly, when the Royal Australian Air Force provided alternative services, Opposition members ran around the country trying to convince people that these services were not safe. Those opposite cannot have it both ways. Fair and square upon this Opposition rests responsibility for the lengthening of this dispute. It has encouraged the Pilots Federation and it has delayed the speedy resumption of normal services. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, those opposite have betrayed our tourism industry. While the tourism industry is rapidly trying to get people back into their premises, using their services, this Opposition has been trying to convince potential clients that the services are not operating. We have seen Senator Chaney regularly changing on this dispute: How will he get out of it? How can he make a point? We have seen the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) go from supporting the Government, to opposition, to a nine-point plan, to a nine-point plan with private negotiation. We have seen the honourable member for Wentworth saying that the pilots would not get those increases under the Opposition's policy, but then changing to a six-point plan. The one consistent person in the Opposition, the only person with any dignity on this matter, is the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). Contrary to the rest of those opposite, he said, `Dump the Federation, destroy it. Let them do their own thing'. There is the conflict: the former Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this Government, through its consultative and constructive approach to industrial relations and the orderly process of award restructuring, is determined to improve substantially productivity, to help Australian industry to be more competitive, to continue to add to the 1.6 million new jobs we have created over the past 6 1/2 years, and to add to the 860,000 new jobs we have created for women. From the Opposition we have the continuation of the confrontationist divisive policies on industrial relations, which inevitably will produce an industrial relations conflict situation, a wages explosion, the old economic recession and will bring us back to the Fraser level of high unemployment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose that we have to give the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) at least two marks for the speech we have just heard-one mark for novelty and one mark for clarity. Honourable members will be mesmerised to hear that the mark for novelty is for the revelation from the Minister that of all the people and parties who were responsible for the pilots strike and dispute, who should it be who is really responsible, according to the Minister, but the Opposition. It is not the pilots, not their union, not the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), not, of course, the Minister, and not the airlines; it is the Opposition. I do not think that I have ever heard a more craven attempt to sheet responsibility away from where it should be to a party who, in the final analysis, really does not have anything to do with the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Oppositions have to carry many burdens, but surely one of the burdens that an opposition should not be expected to carry is the blame for a major industrial dispute occurring at a time when the Opposition is in opposition and when the Prime Minister, the Minister and all their friends have been most intimately involved in the dispute. We say that the blame for the progress of the pilots dispute rests fairly and squarely with the Government, its ham-fisted performance in being responsible for the administration of the dispute itself, and the Government's response. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one of the marks we give to the Minister-a mark for novelty. But we give him another mark-for clarity. Honourable members who were not in the chamber are not aware of the revelation that we have just had from the Minister, and that is that the pilots dispute is still under way. I thought that the Prime Minister had already put the position when he stated that the dispute was over-even though he had continually been ridiculed by every sane thinking person in the community for his suggestion that the dispute was finished, because that suggestion was contrary to all the facts. We now have the proposition from the Minister that it is the Opposition that is still responsible for the lengthening of this dispute. We will give the Minister two marks out of 10 for his contribution-one for novelty and one for at least making it clear to us, and the Minister might go down the corridor and make it clear to the Prime Minister, that the pilots dispute is still in progress. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we do not want to talk all day about the pilots dispute-it is important, but let me wrap it up and make it clear to honourable members just what this dispute has shown. It has demonstrated three things. The first thing that the dispute has demonstrated is that the Minister himself is now absolutely discredited. Frankly, if I were in his position and were a Minister, in view of what has happened over the past two days, I would resign. After being kicked in the teeth by his own Prime Minister yesterday, I do not believe that any Minister could maintain his self-respect and retain his position. </PARA>
<PARA> After this whole matter arose following the decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria, we had the Minister on the record-and he was not misreported; we saw it on television and read it in the press-stating his position very clearly. He maintained that this court decision was an outrage and that the Government would look at legislation. That proposition lasted, I suppose, about two days before the Prime Minister got hold of the Minister by the scruff of the neck and said, `No, this shambles has gone on long enough. We are not going to go in any deeper'. As the Age and every other newspaper in the country said this morning, the Minister was absolutely rebuffed. If he has any self-respect as a Minister, I suggest that he very carefully examine his position in the Government, because he now does not have any respect amongst the public, the industrial relations club or the unions. The Minister does not have the respect of anyone. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, a Minister who is responsible for such an important field as this needs the respect of the constituency. In so far as this Minister has now lost that, we suggest that he very seriously consider his position. On reflection, we would probably rather have him there because, if we see any more performances like those of the past few weeks, frankly, it builds up our votes by the thousands. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing that the pilots dispute has highlighted is that the Prime Minister has demonstrated a very special skill. He has now alienated virtually the whole of the Australian Labor Party's natural constituency. From time to time some of us alienate parts of our party and we are all responsible for that; but it takes a very special type of skill, which has been honed over years of practice, to alienate one's whole party as the Prime Minister has alienated the whole trade union movement. That is what he has done. Let me remind honourable members of the words the Prime Minister used at the very beginning of the dispute. These words were uttered when this dispute was still in the clutches of the Industrial Relations Commission. He said, `Go on, go for the legal remedies; go for the common law remedies and you will have the support of my Government'. The airlines may have received the support of the Government, but the Government no longer has the support of hundreds and hundreds of thousands of its own supporters. That is another clear result of the whole pilots dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The third thing demonstrated by the pilots dispute-and this is very interesting historically-is just how hopeless this great Prime Minister and consensus builder is when it comes to dealing with real industrial disputes and real tough nuts. He is used to the old days when, in the morning, one rolled down the hill to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and said, `Thanks very much; we'll have $20' and that was the beginning and end of the case. He was rather good in that situation. He was also rather good in situations where he would come along at midnight after a dispute had been in progress for three weeks and then do what he called settling the dispute. However, let us look at the Prime Minister's record in relation to this dispute. First, he gets into league with only two employers; secondly, he takes on vast masses of Australian industry, namely, the tourist industry; thirdly, he takes on the union movement; and, fourthly, he declares war on the union. It requires a very special type of skill to do all those things at the same time. Some people can do it in different cases, but very few people can do it in the same case. But oh no, the great conciliator achieved it all in the one case. We really have learned a lot about this industrial relations system and about the Prime Minister as a result of the pilots dispute-which the Minister has just told us is still under way. </PARA>
<PARA> We contend that common law remedies do have an important part to play in industrial relations and in solving intractable disputes which cannot be resolved by any other means. We say that common law remedies are necessary for three reasons. The first is that, in any civilised society, the one law should apply to all people and, in so far as the Australian Labor Party tries to depart from that principle, which it continues to do when it thinks it can get away with it, so it departs from one of the very basic principles upon which our society is built. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason why common law remedies are so necessary is that the situation often arises where the trade union movement, or at least some of it, does not pay much regard to the industrial relations tribunals but, by jove, it takes the real courts seriously. That is why it is so important to get some of these intractable disputes into the real courts. One of the features of the Dollar Sweets case that is not very well known is that, before it went to the Supreme Court of Victoria, the dispute was before the Industrial Relations Commission. A commissioner ordered the union in that case to lift its industrial bans, to stop terrorising the workers, and to stop trying to destroy the business. The union officials said, `Go jump in the lake', and it did not make any difference whatsoever what the Industrial Relations Commission said. But when the company took that mad left-wing union to the Supreme Court of Victoria, it was a different story, because the Supreme Court of Victoria is a real court with a real judge and real powers. It has the ability to make independent decisions based on the evidence. When that injunction was ordered by the Supreme Court of Victoria, it was complied with within 24 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> The third reason why common law remedies are so necessary in appropriate cases is that, frankly, it is the only way in which workers can be protected-and it is about time the Minister woke up to that fact. It is the only way workers can be protected from union thugs and bullies who want to put them out of employment and who want to control the whole industrial relations structure. </PARA>
<PARA> We hope that the Minister has learned a lesson from this dispute. It has done enormous political damage to the party. In addition, it has virtually destroyed his own standing as a Minister, and it has shown the Prime Minister in his true light and that is an utterly incompetent handler of difficult industrial relations. It has also re-established in this community a very basic principle: that the law is there and available to all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) made a case that was very strong on rhetoric, but very weak on reality. He claimed that the Government was to blame for the pilots strike. I would have thought that the pilots themselves were the people to blame for it. Surely they are the people who are on strike; they are the ones who made a claim for a 30 per cent pay increase, an increase bigger than the average Australian worker receives in a year. They are the people who went outside the industrial relations system, who would not abide by the guidelines and who put themselves beyond the law in every sense. They must obviously carry the blame for that dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said in a motion, the terms of which are on the Notice Paper, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) should lift the bans on its members seeking re-employment with the domestic airlines and should accept the invitation of the Industrial Relations Commission to become a respondent to the new award. Those are the steps that are necessary to resolve the dispute and they must be taken by the AFAP itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of the matter of public importance put forward are strangely inconsistent. They are also naive and suggest ignorance in the Opposition's approach. If we think about the goal of good industrial relations, we must find that it is dispute settlement on a fair basis that takes account of the interests of not only employees and employers but also the rest of the community, the whole economy. The central issue is whether disputes should be settled by compulsion or by negotiation. The centrepiece of the Opposition's proposed policy for coping with industrial relations problems and many economic problems is what it calls liberalisation of the labour market. What it means by that, apparently, is decentralisation of decision making, which sounds fine until we think about what it means. It means abandoning government responsibility for incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> At present wages and salaries are determined by the Industrial Relations Commission, where account is taken of not only the arguments of employers and unions and the nature of disputes but also the economic interests of the nation. The Industrial Relations Commission has been acutely aware, for example, of the balance of payments problem and of the need to reduce inflation. Its careful, responsible decisions have linked wage increases with productivity increases. At present, award restructuring is linking productivity growth even more closely with wages growth in the workplace. The effect of the policies has been that real unit labour costs have fallen by 13 per cent since 1982-83. That has been a major factor in the growth of investment and employment. Everyone in the House knows that one of the major achievements of the Government through the accord has been the increase in the level of employment of one and a half million people. In addition, higher profitability has led to increased confidence levels and a quite unprecedented increase in business investment. The average increase in business investment during the last five years has been 11 per cent a year, which is an extraordinary growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord has been central, therefore, to achieving not only increased investment and increased growth in employment but also reduced industrial conflict. During the last six years we have had a much lower level of industrial conflict, a lower number of strikes, than we had in the period before the election of the Hawke Government. The success of that approach is shown by the experience arising from the time when the industrial relations system was allowed to lapse in 1981 and also, to some extent, in 1974. During that time there was a blow-out of wages, a wages explosion, which led to rapid inflation. The lesson of that should surely be that it is essential to have recognition of the national economic interest in wage determination. </PARA>
<PARA> I was struck a couple of weeks ago by an editorial in the Age on the subject of industrial relations and the public interest. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the central issue that industrial relations policy-makers must deal with in the present economic environment is how to control macro-economic wage outcomes while maintaining the momentum of labour market reform at the enterprise level. </PARA>
<PARA>It then praises the Government's approach which recognises both those requirements and draws attention to the fact that many people in the business community as well as the union movement are very sceptical about the Opposition's approach, one which involves abandoning recognition of the national interest in wage negotiations. The editorial reports Senator Chaney as saying that there would be no need for unions and employers to take enterprise agreements to the Commission for registration. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>This apparent abandonment of a public interest test for enterprise agreements has understandably alarmed employers, who are all too familiar with the wage flowons and coercion . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial draws attention to the need for the Opposition to reassess and change its policy on industrial relations because it clearly is not adequate as it stands. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Financial Review today reported on research done by scholars at the Australian National University on the benefit of the accord. It reinforces in a rigorous, empirical way what I have been saying. It estimates that over the last six years an extra 300,000 jobs have resulted entirely from factors caused by the accord. It also led to a reduction in inflation by 3 per cent a year since 1983. The report also draws attention to the fact that, whilst it is true, as the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) said, that the level of industrial conflict has fallen overseas as well as in Australia, the fall has been greater in Australia and the greater fall has been due to the accord, to the prices and incomes policy. Therefore, the framework in which Government industrial relations occur is far from being confused; it is consistent, as the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) said, and it has been rigorously applied in ways that have led to entirely desirable results. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has taken a quite inconsistent approach. It proposes free collective bargaining in the workplace on the one hand, but on the other hand it proposes imposing all kinds of legal controls which would prevent effective free collective bargaining. I emphasise that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly right. What the Opposition proposes, so-called collective bargaining, would lead to industrial anarchy. However, the Opposition is running true to form. It is also saying that it wants all kinds of legal common law enforcement of disputes settlement which would lead to imprisonment of strikers and so on. Such draconian measures would make any kind of industrial relations bargaining an impossibility. In its package of economic measures, the Opposition talks about re-establishing and upholding the rule of law in industrial relations. I am astonished to see that it then goes on to talk about employees negotiating individually or through a union of their choice. If the Opposition went as far as encouraging individual wage negotiation, it would be a recipe for the abandonment of the industrial achievements of the whole union movement of the last century. That is a recipe for absolute exploitation-an extraordinary proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite clear, however, that in Australia we have not only a rigorous industrial relations legal system but also one which has effectively led to disputes settlement in a most conciliatory way. The central difference between the Opposition's approach and that of the Government is that the Opposition wants a draconian suppression of industrial conflict, whereas the Government wants negotiated, reasonable dispute settling. Surely that has been shown to work during the last seven years. That is the approach that we should continue to apply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the twenty-third and twenty-fourth reports of the Committee for 1989, relating to, respectively, fitout works at Box Hill and Moonee Ponds, Victoria, Adelaide and Perth for the Australian Taxation Office, and development of additional domestic apron facilities at Sydney Airport.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The report relating to the fitout works for the Australian Taxation Office in six leased office buildings in Box Hill and Moonee Ponds, Victoria, Adelaide and Perth is the first of a series of similar proposals the Committee will be examining. As the functional requirements of the Taxation Office are similar at each location, each building will provide approximately 20,000 square metres of office space, ground floor shopfront space and a restricted staff entry point. The need for the fitout proposals stem from three factors. These are: the Australian Taxation Office's computer re-equipment program, office decentralisation policy, and modernised accommodation requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office is undertaking a major computer re-equipment program and a survey of its office accommodation has shown that the majority are technically unsuitable for the installation of new equipment. The Government has approved a leasing program for the Australian Taxation Office which will enable it to place staff and equipment in purpose-designed buildings by mid-1992. At the same time the Australian Taxation Office is implementing a policy of decentralising its larger offices from the central business districts of major cities to suburban or country sites and modernising its accommodation requirements based on a space allocation of 20 square metres per employee. The Committee believes that the proposal will provide a better working environment for staff, lead to improvements in efficiency and productivity and provide a better service to the public. The estimated cost of the proposal is $46.1m at July 1989 prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report relates to the need for the provision of an additional apron facility at Sydney Airport. There is currently a shortage of domestic apron facilities at Sydney Airport to accommodate jet aircraft ranging from small corporate jets to large, wide-bodied domestic aircraft. The situation is expected to become more critical following deregulation of the domestic aviation industry on 1 November 1990. The Federal Airports Corporation has received 23 applications from existing and potential new tenants for expansion of existing facilities or for new developments where apron frontage sites are required. The Committee believes that this need exists regardless of whether a third runway is built in the future. It is proposed to build the additional apron in the north-east sector of the Sydney Airport at an estimated cost of $9.6m at May 1989 prices. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The previous speaker, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), raised the question of airport capacity in relation to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. We know what the situation is there. We do not need airport capacity at present because planes simply are not running as they used to back in those days months ago when we had an airways system operating in this country. What we do need, and what we have needed since this Government came to power, is a far-sighted view about the development of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1982 a decision was made by the Fraser Government to build a third runway. When the coalition aviation policy was written by me in 1983-84, it was policy that we should go ahead with the third runway. What has happened? This Government has been in power for almost seven years. Sydney Airport is the point of entry for 50 per cent or more of planes coming from overseas. The problems of that airport are notorious. Delays are getting worse. No relief is in sight once this catastrophic air strike is over-I beg your pardon, I should say `once this catastrophic, non-existent industrial dispute is over'-and services get back to normal; we will be in precisely the same position. That is because of the failure of this Government to take a decision in the national interest, and that decision was to go ahead and develop a third runway at Sydney Airport. What happened? Because of a desire to appease interests around the airport and one or two members of Caucus, it was put to one side. That has been a disaster for this country and it is one of the many disasters which we will inherit, and have to deal with, when we come into government in a few months time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I am pleased to table the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled Fair Shares For All: Insider Trading in Australia. The report presents the Committee's findings and recommendations in relation to its inquiry into the adequacy of the existing legislative controls over insider trading. The inquiry was initiated following concerns expressed by the National Companies and Securities Commission that proving insider trading under the existing legislation was a matter of extraordinary difficulty and improbability. The inquiry also followed a study into insider trading in Australia by Professor Roman Tomasic and Mr Brendan Pentony of the Canberra College of Advanced Education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst these may have been the direct catalyst for the Committee's investigations, the Committee's interest in these matters reflects an increasing awareness within the community that white-collar offences such as insider trading are serious crimes and should be treated accordingly. With the October 1987 share market crash still in our minds, the need to promote investor confidence in the securities markets has brought about calls for an improved effort to prevent practices such as insider trading. In its report the Committee has responded to the challenge by recommending sweeping changes to the existing insider trading laws. While in the past decisions about the shape of these laws have been deferred pending further experience with the legislation, and while some suggest that this should continue to be the case, my Committee considers that there has been sufficient debate and speculation; the time has come for decisive steps to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The overwhelming body of evidence provided to the Committee leaves little room for doubt that the corporate spiders who prey upon ordinary shareholders are currently able to act with a degree of justified confidence that insider trading can be embarked upon with little risk of prosecution or conviction. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to take a broom to the cobwebs which hang in this area of corporate law. To this end, the Committee's primary recommendation is that the existing insider trading provisions be redrafted and simplified, with clear and practical definitions of the offence of insider trading. The Committee found that much of the uncertainty which currently exists can be attributed to the confusing language and format of the provisions. Minor amendments to the legislation would, in our submission, be insufficient to overcome the range of deficiencies identified. </PARA>
<PARA> As many of the separate definitions relating to insider trading are of a technical nature, it is not my intention to explain all aspects in the short time available to me today. However, I would like to highlight the more critical areas. In particular, the Committee has recommended a broader definition of who should be considered an insider; a statutory definition of inside information incorporating a reasonable person test for determining materiality; a definition of when information should be considered generally available to be determined on the basis of whether at the time of trading the information was available to a reasonable investor and whether a reasonable time period for the dissemination of the information had elapsed; extension of the insider trading prohibition to unit trusts and other prescribed interests; exchange traded options and convertible securities; and extension of the Chinese wall defence to non-corporate dealers. Explanation of the more technical definitional matters is provided in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> In practical terms the Committee has made a number of recommendations aimed at clarifying and simplifying the existing provisions on insider trading. Many of the recommendations remove the more difficult elements of proof for the prosecution. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended against reversing the onus of proof in relation to insider trading prosecutions. Another area of major reform is in relation to the penalties for insider trading. The existing pecuniary penalties are to be substantially increased and in that context, in an environment in which the motives are profit related and in which the levels of profit or losses avoided can be considerable, the existing pecuniary penalties were found to be totally and utterly inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason the Committee has recommended penalties which are, for a natural person, removal of the profit realised or loss avoided, plus an additional penalty of that profit or loss or $100,000, whichever is the greater, or five years imprisonment, or both, and, for a body corporate, removal of the profit realised or loss avoided, plus an additional penalty of that profit or loss, or $500,000, whichever is the greater. These penalties will ensure that all those who would contemplate insider trading will be put on notice that they risk losing everything which could be gained from that transaction, as well as damaging their capacity to operate within the securities industry. In addition, as an extension of the existing civil remedies, the Committee has recommended that the courts be empowered to make a wider variety of orders in relation to insider trading matters. These could include, for example, orders restraining the exercise of voting or other rights attached to shares, directing the disposal of shares, vesting in the National Companies and Securities Commission-the soon to be Australian Securities Commission-cancelling a contract or arrangement for the acquisition or sale of shares, and removing a professional's licence to operate in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In recommending all these changes to the legislation, the Committee has drawn together the many suggestions made to it by leading participants in the securities industry. The Committee has adopted proposals from organisations such as the National Companies and Securities Commission, the Australian Stock Exchange Ltd (ASX), the Business Council of Australia, the Law Council of Australia, the Institute of Directors, the Securities Institute of Australia, the Australian Merchant Bankers Association and a number of others, including the Attorney-General's Department and leading law firms such as Mallesons Stephen Jacques, Clayton Utz and Blake Dawson Waldron. I am pleased to say that there was broad agreement on many aspects of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recognises that, for the legislation to be effective, there must be rigorous enforcement of the provisions. In this regard the Committee welcomes the increased focus on insider trading adopted recently by the NCSC and its State delegates. If Australia is to increase its levels of investment-the importance of which cannot be overemphasised-then potential investors among the public must have confidence in the integrity of the securities markets. That confidence can be guaranteed only if investors are sure that they will not be placed at a disadvantage by those who are in possession of inside information. For this reason the Committee has recommended that the detection, investigation and prosecution of insider trading be retained as an enforcement priority of the regulatory agencies. While there are a range of corporate practices which require appropriate attention, this should not mean that insider trading is given less attention than is currently the case; rather, it indicates that sufficient resources need to be made available and need to be appropriately targeted to ensure that insider trading remains an enforcement priority. </PARA>
<PARA> On the issue of resources, the Committee considers that Australia's capabilities in relation to computer monitoring and surveillance can be improved. It is evident that, if those with the potential to engage in insider trading are to be deterred from such activity, there must be significant likelihood of detection. With the complexity of today's financial markets, this necessarily involves detailed computer systems and sufficient staff to operate those systems. A recommendation to this effect is included in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also acknowledges the need for greater international cooperation in relation to the detection and prosecution of insider trading with the growing reach of the world security markets. Insider trading is a problem which has extended beyond national boundaries. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended the development of memorandums of understanding with other countries in which there are active securities markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the securities industries in protecting against insider trading is also addressed in the report. In particular, the Committee has highlighted the vital role which the stock exchanges have to play in protecting the integrity of Australia's securities markets. The nature of this role demands an adequate investment by the securities industry itself in the regulation of its own activities. While some doubts have been expressed about the industry's commitment in this regard, the Committee is encouraged by the advice of the ASX that additional and improved resources are being devoted to surveillance, along with more effective management structures. The introduction of a system such as the stock exchange automated trading system is clearly a step in the right direction and should be commended. Nevertheless, given the importance of its role, the Committee has emphasised that the Australian Stock Exchange must pursue a rigorous approach to market surveillance. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Committee also sees merit in the proposal that codes of conduct be adopted and rigorously enforced by the securities industry as a supplement to the laws on insider trading. In too many situations the issue of ethics is neglected. Such neglect has helped to fuel suspicions and doubts about the integrity of our markets. The Committee considers that, just as ethical standards have proved effective in the regulation of the legal and medical professions, they should also be considered relevant in the field or corporate activity. Therefore, the Committee has recommended that representative groups within the securities industry develop codes of conduct to be applied on an industry-wide basis. In this regard it is commendable that some organisations, such as the Australian Merchant Bankers Association, have already adopted or initiated the development of such codes. </PARA>
<PARA> In making its recommendations the Committee has responded to the substantive evidence before it and the report reflects the wide body of opinion which was canvassed during the inquiry. On behalf of the Committee I take this opportunity to thank all those who contributed to the Committee's investigations. The Committee is indeed grateful for the specialist advice provided by Professor Roman Tomasic and Mr Brendan Pentony. As Chairman, I wish to thank the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), as well as my fellow Committee members for the time and effort they devoted to the inquiry. Thanks are also due to the Committee's Secretary, Mr John Stanhope, as well as to Mr Andres Lomp, principal research officer for the inquiry and Ms Natalie Raine, who are all sitting in the advisers box at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Fair Shares For All: Insider Trading in Australia is a report which calls for substantial reform at a time when recent examples of corporate activity have focused our attention sharply on the integrity of Australia's markets. It concludes the first stage of a major inquiry by the Committee into corporate practices which impact upon the operation of those markets. The recommendations in the report are aimed at substantially improving efforts to prevent insider trading in Australia. Adoption of the recommendations will contribute significantly towards rebuilding investor confidence in the securities markets. The prevention of insider trading is vital if the public is to view the stock market as a place in which they can invest in the potential wealth of their country and from which they can gain a fair share of the actual wealth which is created. I commend the report to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I join the Chairman, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), in commending to honourable members the Committee's report on insider trading. In the report, the Committee is seeking to introduce important and much needed changes to Australia's laws on insider trading. The Committee's recommendations follow much debate in the community on the adequacy of the existing provisions. The debate on insider trading has continued since the first laws specifically prohibiting insider trading were introduced in Australia in 1971. Indeed, the pathfinding work of a former senator for Tasmania, Peter Rae, who chaired the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, known as the Rae Committee, should be recognised today. His efforts in this area of commercial practice were mammoth. He was interestingly ahead of his time. The Committee at that time sought the establishment of effective insider trading legislation. Ultimately, an election intervened to halt the reforms suggested. It is hoped that this will not happen on this occasion. For the historical file I mention that Peter Rae and I were partners of one of the leading commercial law firms in Tasmania and it is thus a special pleasure to me that this report makes recommendations to complete in part the work he so ably undertook in the early 1970s. I pay a tribute to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite often expressed concerns about the scope and effectiveness of those laws, the insider trading provisions have remained virtually unchanged since the enactment of the Securities Industry Act in 1980. In that time, there has not been a successful insider trading prosecution in Australia. This remains the case, despite more vigorous enforcement activity by the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) and the State corporate affairs commissions in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> While it was unclear as to how much insider trading is practised in Australia, it was evident to the Committee that, in pursuing insider trading matters, the regulatory agencies face a heavy burden in attempting to bring prosecutions under the existing provisions. The complexity of the legislation has also created considerable uncertainty within the community about what constitutes insider trading. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's primary recommendation for simplifying and clarifying the legislation seeks to overcome this uncertainty. Simplified legislation containing practical definitions of the offence of insider trading will generate greater awareness in the community about what the law is attempting to achieve. The definitional changes recommended by the Committee remove many of the complicating elements which have created so much difficulty for the regulatory agencies. It is also important for market operators and investors to more clearly understand the effective reach of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also responded to the overwhelming view that the existing penalties for insider trading are of little, if any, consequence. An often stated view to the Committee was that a pecuniary penalty based on an arbitrary sum is inappropriate in this area of the law. Accordingly, the Committee considers that a penalty expressed in terms of a multiple of the profit realised or loss avoided, as has been recommended, would be a far more appropriate deterrent. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the administration of the legislation, the Committee has highlighted the continuing need for the regulatory agencies to adopt a proactive stance towards enforcement. Any digression of enforcement activity in this regard would be an inappropriate signal to the community about the level of commitment towards the prevention of insider trading in Australia. Of course, the efforts of the regulatory agencies need to be supported through the provision of adequate resources, particularly in the area of market surveillance. If Australia is to increase its current levels of investment, it must be able to promote confidence in the integrity of its securities markets. To achieve such confidence, Australia must be prepared to make the investment in the systems and personnel which will guarantee that integrity. The question of having sufficient resources to do the job has been a constant concern of the regulators in the business sector, namely the NCSC and the Trade Practices Commission. As a nation we must, as a priority, fund such bodies if we want to ensure competition policy is effectively administered and that our security markets are conducted with integrity. I refer particularly to recommendation 16. </PARA>
<PARA> The securities industry also has a vital role to play, and this is recognised by the Committee in the report. Indeed, the recent appointment of the former senior NCSC staffer, Mr Ray Shoer, to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) highlights the strong commitment of that industry. In particular, the Committee has emphasised that unless participants in the securities industry are guided by the principle that insider trading is unacceptable, and unless this attitude is rigorously enforced by the industry itself, it is unlikely that insider trading will be eradicated, regardless of the degree of effectiveness of the legislation and its administration. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to draw attention to recommendations 17 and 18, on international cooperation. Business is mobile, capital is mobile, and national boundaries do not mark the limits of activity in the business world. Australia, if it is to ensure it is a partner in Pacific Rim growth, must ensure our security markets play a prominent and effective role. We do not want a reputation as the cowboys of the South Pacific, where anything goes. To quote from one submission to our Committee, from Mallesons Stephen Jacques, solicitors:</PARA>
<PARA>Extensive co-operation between international regulatory agencies is required to deal adequately with international white collar crimes, including insider trading. It seems likely that the only long term solution lies in the establishment of a network of multilateral treaties on securities fraud, insider trading and corporate disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view, this area requires more urgent attention. A close liaison with New Zealand in this area and in corporate law generally is of paramount importance. It may be a matter for further Committee scrutiny. It is certainly a matter for attention by Government at the earliest time. </PARA>
<PARA> In deciding that major changes are required in Australia's insider trading laws, the Committee has responded to the numerous concerns expressed during the inquiry about the adequacy of those laws. The evidence gathered by the Committee clearly supports the recommendations which have been made. It is notable that the call for major reform in this area of law has attracted bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA> I join with the Chairman in extending the Committee's thanks to all those who contributed to the inquiry, especially the dedicated and hardworking staff. This has been a technical and detailed report focusing on the heart of corporate life. It has generated much interest, even some controversy. In the recommendations it achieves a better path to a sensible balanced approach to law reform of a vital area of commerce in our nation. I commend the report to honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA> I apologise for speaking so quickly but there are rather pressing engagements that await the presence of the Chairman and me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-We are observing the exit from the chamber of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to attend to business unexplained and mysterious. I shall address myself to three short but important topics. The first is the question of resources. It does not matter what system we have and it does not matter how perfect the laws are or how well expressed they may be, if we do not have the resources for the detection and prosecution of crime, we may as well not have those laws. Resources are the underpinning of the legal system. The position in respect of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) is really summed up in something that appears at page 51 of the report, where it is said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>ASX, for example, commented that, while the NCSC has grown in stature over recent years through the manner in which it has discharged the duties required of it by both the Securities Industry Act and the Companies Act, it has been critically short of adequate resources ever since it commenced operations in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not a novel charge. It is something that has been known to this Government for years. The Government has been in power for close to seven years and the failure of the Government to provide resources for the NCSC can be sheeted home to one body, and that is the Government itself. It comes to this House and says, `Look, we are doing all that is necessary. We are enacting laws to cover this and to cover that.' But, when it gets down to the critical question of the resources needed for the purposes of making sure that the laws work, what happens? The Government says, `No, we will spend the money elsewhere.' Always, it seems, this Government, and I am sorry to say other governments as well, falls into the trap of scrimping when it comes to giving resources to the legal system. I know something about the need for specialised resources in this area as, on behalf of the New South Wales Government, I spent two or three years of my life unravelling corporate fraud. It requires a high degree of expertise, a high degree of training and a high degree of dedication. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter that I should like to address briefly is the need for simplicity and clarity in the law. That is emphasised in recommendation No. 1, where it is said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that the existing insider trading provisions be redrafted and simplified, with clear and practical definitions of the offence of insider trading. </PARA>
<PARA>Laws which are unintelligible to the informed reader, laws which are unintelligible to the lawyer, are simply a burden to the community. What we need to do as a parliament, regardless of which party is in power, is concentrate on simplicity and clarity in the drafting of laws. What is proposed is markedly better than we have seen in the field of taxation. I do not wish to be partisan on this subject, but this Government has enacted a plethora of laws in the area of income tax, the effect of which is to catch certain transactions. So detailed are these laws that it is now quite impossible for anyone to understand how the Income Tax Assessment Act works, for anyone to understand the extraordinary complexity of provisions which are designed to catch certain transactions. It is far better to state the general principle and to leave the courts to work out the application of that general principle. If there is a significant omission one must meet that by stating the laws in terms of principles and statements which are clear and intelligible. Our tax system is utterly unintelligible. That works in favour of no-one except sometimes those in authority who seek to abuse their position and sometimes those who seek to use the complexity of the laws to evade the clear intention of the Government and the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> We need the right legal framework in this country because we depend on investment and are an advanced economy although, God knows, looking at what the Government has presided over in the almost seven years it has been in office, we sometimes have doubts about that. We need rules which strike the right balance between fairness and certainty so that those who invest, be they Australians or foreigners, know what the rules are. We need foreign investment in this country; not simply because of its intrinsic benefit to this country when it is directed to the right areas-the productive areas-but for the purposes of meeting some of the huge debts that we are piling up on the current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that it will be a triumph for the Government if it brings in a current account deficit of $18.5 billion during this financial year, although I point out that, unless the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) decides that the option of desperation of an early half-Senate election is the one that he will go for, by the time the final figures come in we will be in government and it will be our job to clean up the mess. Some people think that the deficit for the full year could go as high as $25 billion, which would be--</PARA>

It is an evocative expression, and may get a run in the media. But we need to understand that the subject we are looking at, which concerns money and investment, is not to be considered in terms of a prosecutor's charter. The NCSC has complained, as I understand it, that there have been great difficulties in the prosecution of insider trading cases. One must always treat complaints made by prosecuting authorities with a degree of scepticism simply because zeal can sometimes overcome judgment. I would accept that that has taken place, but we need always to remember that in this House when we deal with a subject such as this we are not laying down the prosecutor's charter: what we are seeking to do is to set the right balance to provide the right framework of certainty and fairness and, in cases where the rules are broken, to provide the right kinds of penalties. I think that the report goes a considerable distance to meeting those objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>

The honourable member will have noticed that yesterday's Australian Financial Review published my reply. I do not know whether the honourable gentleman has had a chance to read it, but it makes the point that the NCSC is subject to the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities on which the Commonwealth has one vote out of eight. The Ministerial Council, after some delay, agreed that additional resources should be given to the NCSC, not necessarily to investigate insider trading but for the whole of its operations. The only member of the Council which has passed legislation to provide those resources is the Commonwealth. The other seven members have failed to pass any legislation which would enable the fees, which is how they get their funds, to be used to give the NCSC additional resources. It is quite wrong and without foundation to suggest that the Commonwealth has not pulled its weight in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree. I have been a member of the Council for most of that time and have argued that we should provide the resources. We have always paid our way. The Commonwealth pays half. It is the one losing member of the Ministerial Council. The cost of half will in no way be recompensed or reimbursed by any moneys that we get through the Australian Capital Territory Corporate Affairs Commission. The States make a profit of between $100m and $150m at least. On that basis there is a good case for the States giving more resources. The legislation under which they operate, which was passed in 1978, also makes it very clear that the State corporate affairs commissions are expected to give support to investigations made by the NCSC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The NCSC has never been able to get additional help in that sense from the State corporate affairs commissions, which have 1,500 employees and many investigators. These things should be known. The Parliament does not get a chance to debate these matters because basically they are controlled by the States. When we go along to the meetings and the NCSC asks for more resources, the first thing we say is, `Can't you get them from the States?'. The NCSC says, `No'. When we say that the States have 1,500 employees in that area, it says that it acknowledges that. When we say, `There is an obligation under the legislation and the arrangement is that the NCSC should have access to those resources', the NCSC says, `That does not operate in practice and, therefore, we cannot carry out our function'. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not here to criticise anybody, but I think it ought to be a matter of record that never at any stage has the Commonwealth reneged on its responsibility. In fact, the Commonwealth pays half. It is the one member of the Council that loses in the whole proposition. As I have said, the States and the Territories make a profit of about $150m. They will not disclose their profit. </PARA>
<PARA> We have passed legislation that would enable the Commonwealth, if successful in a High Court challenge, to take over the administration. There will be no inadequacy of resources because the proposal is that we will use the resources already paid by the business community in filing fees which will be more than adequate to guarantee that there are adequate resources for the Australian Securities Commission. Further, I have even made an arrangement that the Commonwealth will retain only 5 per cent of the residue and will reimburse the States that cooperate with us-based on the companies incorporated in those States. That means that Queensland will get a proportion, because it is cooperating; Victoria will get a proportion-perhaps to the extent of about $28m-and if New South Wales comes in it will get a proportion of about $30m-odd. In other words, I am not getting any money from this arrangement. I want a guarantee that the business community of Australia gets a very efficient piece of law and a very efficient administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission will be administered by three commissioners, who will be appointed for no longer than three years and who will then be replaced by three others. There will also be an advisory council from the business community, with a statutory base and with resources. Members of that council will be appointed from business communities around Australia, and they will advise as to the administration of the legislation. There will also be a Federal parliamentary committee which can investigate all matters that might be raised-and one could not get a fairer proposition than that. </PARA>
<PARA> The only disappointing aspect is that the Opposition cannot see its way clear to support those proposals. I am sure that, if the legislation survives the High Court challenge and if Mr Hartnell can commence operations next year, the legislation will be adopted by any government worthy of its salt in the national interest. It is quite wrong to suggest that the Commonwealth has never pulled its weight; it has done more than that. A lot of misinformation has deliberately been given. Are we to blame for the problems of insider trading or other activities? Let me make it very clear: good administrations never have to have any excuses. There are a lot of problems with administration, most of which would be related to the unfortunate leaking of information about people, which I do not think is very fair, but insider trading and matters of that nature can be properly dealt with. There has never been a suggestion that the Commonwealth is in any way trying to avoid its responsibilities. I hope that the honourable member for North Sydney understands that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, I present the reports of the Committee entitled Review of Auditor-General's Report on Aboriginal Student Assistance Schemes, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee, and Aboriginal People and Mainstream Local Government-An Issues Paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the reports be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IJ4">Mr SNOWDON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Today I table two reports of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. Aboriginal People and Mainstream Local Government is a further report on the Committee's current inquiry into support services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The report canvasses issues concerning Aboriginal involvement with and participation in mainstream local government. The discussion in the report highlights the importance of this area and the relative neglect there has been of these issues. It also demonstrates the complexity of the issues involved and the need for a more thorough and detailed examination of them. We have, therefore, asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) to implement speedily the Committee's recommendation for a comprehensive inquiry to be referred to the Committee on this important subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other report is the result of the Committee's review of the Auditor-General's recent report on the administration of the Aboriginal student assistance schemes by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The Committee concluded that the Department's management and administration of the schemes have been poor and that this has limited the potential of the schemes. The Committee makes recommendation to improve the administration of the schemes and also expects the Department to implement the findings of the Auditor-General. The Committee places the Department on notice that it will review progress after 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from these general comments, there is one specific issue that I wish to refer to and that arose during this review. The Auditor-General's report and earlier reports on the Aboriginal student assistance schemes have raised the issue of verification of Aboriginality as a problem in the administration of the schemes. In raising this issue, there is an implication that fraud could be occurring, in that non-Aboriginal people could be receiving benefits to which they are not entitled. When questioned on this issue representatives of the Audit Office offered no evidence that fraud is in fact occurring. The Audit Office provided hearsay evidence based on second-hand information with no proof to validate the suggestions or assertions which had been made in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that the Auditor-General, in raising this issue, is concerned not with demonstrated fraud but with the possibility of it occurring because of the procedures that are in place. Nevertheless, the evidence from the Department of Employment, Education and Training showed that there was little possibility of fraud occurring, given the safeguards that are in place. My own experience in northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory, is that such fraud would be almost impossible, as a non-Aboriginal person attempting to claim benefits would soon be exposed by the Aboriginal community. It is important to note that the Aboriginal community, whilst being diverse in terms of the groups involved, is also very close-knit in that people recognise almost immediately those people who are part of the Aboriginal community. Indeed, in my view it would be extremely difficult for non-Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander persons to impose themselves on the Aboriginal community by going to the Department of Employment, Education and Training and suggesting or asserting that they are Aboriginals or Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is of the view that this issue of Aboriginality should not continue to be the focus of attention by the Auditor-General unless there is demonstrable proof of fraud taking place. We would not want to limit the work of the Auditor-General or impose restrictions, because that would be totally improper. However, it is true to say that this subject has been raised on at least three occasions in Auditor-General's reports, and on none of those occasions has there been any evidence that would confirm the suggestion that fraud has taken place. The report suggests that the Auditor-General may wish to consider a different approach to this issue in future reviews of Aboriginal student assistance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank Committee members for their cooperation, the bipartisan manner in which the subjects which the Committee has been inquiring into have been addressed and the support which has been given by all members of the Committee. I thank the secretariat, particularly David Elder, Peter Stephens and Peter Ratas, for their continuing contribution to the work of the Committee. I also thank Hansard for providing accurate reports of the Committee's proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been involved with this Committee since I was elected to the House, although I have only been Chairman for a matter of months. It has been one of the most profitable experiences I have had during my time in this place. There are occasions when honourable members are able to face each other across the chamber and make political points about what one or other side might be doing in Aboriginal affairs, but this Committee works extremely well. Despite opposing political views often being expressed on this subject, there has been real bipartisan commitment by members in making sure that this Committee works effectively. I hope that that continues. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, I support the comments that the Committee Chairman, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), has made with regard to the support from the secretariat in the preparation of this report and the work that is done by this Standing Committee. As I am sure people in Australia realise, Aboriginal affairs is a very important issue for this country and has received a lot of attention during the life of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make some brief comments in regard to the conclusions and recommendations of the Review of Auditor-General's Report on Aboriginal Student Assistance Schemes, which comes down really to how important education is for Aboriginal Australians and that they receive the necessary support. It is unfortunate that we are reporting that there has been poor management and administration in this area of public administration in Australia, because, of all the people who really do need to have excellent management and administration, Aboriginal Australians are the people most in need. As a Committee, we hope that the Minister concerned will take to heart this report and will significantly improve the administration of Abstudy. We will certainly be monitoring this and we trust that changes will be made there so that the Aboriginal people in need of Abstudy will actually get its full benefits and that therefore we will be able to see some improvement in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report we are tabling today is entitled Aboriginal People and Mainstream Local Government. We recommend that we receive direction from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). In regard to making progress in the area of Aboriginal affairs, particularly infrastructure in communities around Australia, it is very important that we get a much better understanding of the role of mainstream local government and local government in Aboriginal communities so that we can do away with much of the duplication and sometimes try to ensure that there are no gaps in the administration in this area. I believe that this will be a very worthwhile project for the Committee later on. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to support the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), in relation to the reports of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs entitled Aboriginal People and Mainstream Local Government and Review of Auditor-General's Report on Aboriginal Student Assistance Schemes. The short time available does not allow one to do more than canvass briefly some of the main issues involved in these reports. The report on Aboriginal people and mainstream local government arose from a matter referred by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), which was to inquire into and report on the effectiveness of existing support services within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. It soon became clear to the members of the Committee that this reference was so wide-reaching that it had to be split up into four distinct areas. One of those areas is the present reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The role of local government is crucial in the provision of services to Aboriginals as over two-thirds of Aboriginals live in major urban cities and other urban communities within mainstream local government boundaries. Because the Commonwealth provides financial assistance to local government by way of general purpose and specific purpose grants it is important that the Commonwealth play a role in ensuring that incentives are given to local government to develop services for Aboriginal people. This, of course, is very much in line with the recommendations of the Self National Inquiry into Local Government Finance in terms of incentive grants. This will help to redress the balance in areas where local government is not providing services to Aboriginals on an equitable basis. As the report recommends, there is a need for the Minister to refer to the Committee a detailed inquiry into the interaction between mainstream local government and Aboriginal communities. I am sure that the Minister will see the merit in that recommendation, which will allow the Committee to pursue its further inquiries in a far more detailed way. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Auditor-General's report on Aboriginal student assistance schemes, which was also reviewed by the Standing Committee. The Auditor-General's report was based on an audit of the administration of the scheme undertaken in the Victorian office of the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) in 1988. As has been pointed out earlier, it follows similar reviews in one or two other States. A number of problems emerged, including, as we heard from the Chairman of the Committee, the question of proof of Aboriginality and the claim that this proof was not sought in many cases, DEET relying on a declaration on the application form as proof. I agree with the Chairman of the Committee that this information appeared to be based on hearsay evidence and to a large extent can be discounted. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other important areas emerged as problems in terms of the Auditor-General's report. In particular, there were undue delays in correcting problems associated with DEET's computer system for processing applications and payments. This becomes important when one considers that Aboriginals are a deprived and disadvantaged group within our community and that the delay in processing of applications and payments must be overcome very quickly in order to rectify some of the problems in that area. The Committee felt that the Auditor-General's report limited the potential of schemes such as the student assistance scheme and decided to place DEET on notice that it would review progress on implementation of the recommendations of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I, too, would like to pay tribute to the members of the Committee. As the former Chairman, I have grown to enjoy the comradeship that has been displayed on the Committee and I confirm the comments made by the present Chairman that bipartisanship prevails. I think I have had something to do with that process over the years. I pay tribute to my fellow Committee members. I will not name them because of time, but I appreciate their cooperation with me as Chairman and as a fellow member of the Committee. I also would like to pay tribute to David Elder, the Secretary of the Committee, with whom over the years I have had a close relationship in terms of the Committee's work, and also to Peter Stephens, Peter Ratas and Mrs Jurek. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Chairman of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs has tabled the Review of Auditor-General's Report on Aboriginal Student Assistance Schemes, which I will not comment on; but I am very interested in the issues paper, Aboriginal People and Mainstream Local Government. I rise this afternoon with a view to making a few brief comments relevant to the issues paper on the Aboriginal people and mainstream local government issue. As has already been pointed out, the Aboriginal Affairs Committee has urged the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) to refer an inquiry to the Committee to deal with the provision of essential services by mainstream local government to Aboriginal communities with Aboriginal participation in local government, funding questions relating to servicing Aboriginal communities and employment of Aboriginals by local government. I add my voice to the calls for the Minister to give this recommendation his immediate attention and support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have travelled around the country with the Committee I have been struck by the still dominant objective we must all pursue in our endeavours to provide equal opportunity for Aboriginal Australians-the objective of self-determination and self-management. Of course, I am not talking about sovereignty in that regard. In community after community I have been struck by the wisdom and the practicality of the Aboriginal elders and leaders. The Australian community in general, and our bureaucracies in particular, are still struggling to come to grips with the nature and extent of the problems which beset attempts by Aboriginal communities to achieve the same life style opportunities that other Australians enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's inquiries confirm once again that two of the major hurdles faced by Aboriginal communities are, firstly, the overlapping and competing white bureaucracies and, secondly, the inability of those bureaucracies to respect and tap the commonsense and expertise of Aboriginal leaders. It seems that, with all the weight given to market research and client sovereignty in normal business and Public Service planning, there is still a legacy of paternalism, usually unconscious, or outright disregard for the views, ideas and decision-making participation of Aboriginals and Aboriginal communities. That is why I consider the recommended inquiry as important. The Committee wants to focus on an area of great relevance to the quality of life in Aboriginal communities and, under the criteria of self-determination and self-management, to do some bipartisan thinking on how we can improve the relationship between mainstream local government and Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, we would wish to focus on practical matters such as the employment of Aboriginal liaison officers and the development of Aboriginal input and representation at local government level. My guess is that the Minister would support such an endeavour. So I merely add my comments by way of affirming bipartisan support and urge that the reference of the inquiry be expedited. I also heartily second all the remarks made so far in commending the secretariat for the excellent work it has done in servicing this Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, I, of course, have some interest in the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs reports entitled Aboriginal People and Mainstream Local Government and Review of Auditor-General's Report on Aboriginal Student Assistance Schemes. I am also a member, albeit a recent one, of the Committee. I would like first to comment on the review of the Auditor-General's report concerning Abstudy. It is of considerable concern that successive Auditor-General's reports-Queensland in 1987, Western Australia in 1988 and now Victoria in 1989-have identified poor management and administration by the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) of the Aboriginal student assistance schemes. The result of this poor management and administration is twofold: it limits the full provision of assistance to students who qualify under the schemes; and it wastes millions of dollars of taxpayers' money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I proceed I want to emphasise-so that what I say can in no way be interpreted as criticism of the recipients who qualify to receive Abstudy-that the committee of which I am a member has the full backing of the coalition in its support for the continuation of the Aboriginal student assistance schemes. These are a vital component in raising the educational standards of Aboriginal peoples, just as the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) outlined. What the Auditor-General's latest report into Aboriginal assistance schemes found, and what the Committee has confirmed, is that proof of Aboriginality was generally not sought from students; eligibility checks on enrolment, attendance and progress were not made; administrative procedures were not working effectively; and the education student assistance system computer system used is inadequate for processing benefits, recovering overpayments and providing essential management information. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point is particularly serious. Previous audits have highlighted the failure of DEET to institute appropriate measures to minimise, identify and recover overpayments. Departmental officers confirmed to the Committee that DEET had no figures on outstanding payments as it had no methodology to identify them. How long is it going to take to develop the measures necessary to tackle this problem.? The Government has identified the significant savings that can be made by fraud control measures, reducing overpayments and improving debt recovery. The Budget Statements for 1989-90 estimate that these measures should reduce outlays on Abstudy by $2m this financial year and $2.6m in 1990-91. This estimate may be conservative. About $5m may be saved by administrative and management efficiencies without affecting in any way the provision of Abstudy to the 41,500 students currently assisted by the scheme. These efficiencies include reducing the administrative complexity of Abstudy; formulating simpler Abstudy application arrangements; more effective monitoring of enrolment, attendance and progress; verification of students' independent status, tutors and payment of excursion fees; and better delineation of DEET staff roles and responsibilities along with more rigorous training of field staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I wish to make is that concerning the definition of Aboriginality. The problem of verification of Aboriginality has been raised in all Auditor-General's reports. It is not a new issue. DEET officers, however, stated that there was little evidence of fraud in this area-mainly because the benefits received by Abstudy students were no longer significantly greater than those received by students in receipt of Austudy. The Committee, too, considered that the current procedures for establishing a person's Aboriginality for the purpose of Abstudy benefits were adequate. The definition of `Aboriginal', however, is extremely broad, having the following three components: descent from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people; a self-identification as an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander; and a recognition by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island community that the person is Aboriginal or Islander. Perhaps when the Auditor-General next looks into one of these schemes involving Aboriginal people, he will look at the issue a little more closely and provide a more detailed analysis. Indeed, it might be timely for the Department to look more closely at the definition. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to the other report about mainstream local government. This is a further report on the Committee's current inquiry into support services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. The report outlines information and ideas on the interaction between mainstream local government and Aboriginal communities-a much neglected but important theme, which is deserving of the more detailed inquiry requested by this Committee. The issues identified in the report include: the role and functions of local government; financing of local government; provision of services to Aboriginal communities by local government; Aboriginal representation in local government; local government-Aboriginal community relations; and the employment of Aborigines in local government. Australia could make great gains to the benefit of both Aborigines and other Australians from the employment of Aborigines in local government. I join my colleagues on the Committee in thanking the Committee secretariat for the detailed work that has been undertaken to this stage on those two reports. I commend those reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I would like to add to the comments by previous speakers on the reports of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. In particular, I support the recommendation of the involvement of Aboriginal people in mainstream local government. Apart from education, I believe that this is the most important aspect that our system can offer to Aboriginal people and communities. I point out to the House that the Queensland Government was the first State Government to amend its Acts to allow separate Aboriginal local governments to be established. This has happened throughout Queensland. A number of such local governments have been set up and are running very successfully, particularly in the north of Queensland. Also, in my electorate of Maranoa there is the local government area of Woorabinda. Today I have with me councillors from that area-Councillor Gail Nixon, who is Chairman of the Bauhinia Shire, and Councillor Ted Staal, who is Chairman of the Emerald Shire. They will be speaking with Ministers and Opposition members regarding funding for local government and road funding for central Queensland and the highlands. Woorabinda is one of the more advanced Aboriginal settlements in Australia. That local government is doing a wonderful job running that community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People wonder why Aborigines take so long to come to decisions. Aborigines, as we know, do not have elected heads or chiefs; they sit down, do a lot of talking and come to an agreement on what they will do. I believe that this is what should happen. This is one of the reasons that we did not support the Government's introduction of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, which has finally gone through both Houses after months and months of wrangling. </PARA>
<PARA> As someone who has taken an interest in this area over many years, I have always felt that it would have been sufficient for the States to set up local government areas for Aborigines. In fact, some Aborigines in the desert area of Western Australia have won sufficient support to run for council and hold the balance of power in local government. Community governments have been established by the Northern Territory Government in the Territory, though they do not have the power of a fully fledged local government set-up. In Queensland Aboriginal local governments are now fully fledged members of the Local Government Association of Queensland and they attend annual conferences. They receive separate funding through the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which is a great help to those communities. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been very interested in local government for a long while. I have been a member of my own local government, the Tara Shire Council, for nine years. If local government were set up in other States as it is in Queensland, it would be of tremendous help to the Aboriginal people. I can do no more than give this report my full support. I thank the secretariat for the work that it has done, in particular David Elder and his support staff. He has been very supportive in this area for a number of years now. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Stage 2 development of Commonwealth Government Centre, Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposal relates to the construction and fit-out of a 13-storey building to accommodate the Australian Taxation Office in Townsville. The building will be located next to the existing Commonwealth Government Centre and will provide a readily identifiable focal point for government business. The Australian Taxation Office currently operates from three separate locations in Townsville. The proposed development would place the entire office under one roof and so enhance delivery of services to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially, the Australian Taxation Office will occupy eight of the 10 office floors. The two remaining floors have been designed to permit separate tenancy until required for a planned 20 per cent growth of the Townsville Australian Taxation Office. Stage 1 of the existing Townsville Commonwealth Government Centre is fully utilised and occupying departments are required to lease other premises in order to satisfy their expansion needs. A number of these premises are below the standard necessary for efficient delivery of public services. In total, the Federal Government currently occupies some 24,000 square metres of office accommodation in Townsville, made up of around 60 per cent leased and only 40 per cent owned space. This proposal to construct a new building is consistent with Government objectives of increasing the proportion of owned office accommodation and reducing overall rent costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The project will provide some valuable employment opportunities in the Townsville construction industry. Some 300 people will be employed on site at the peak of construction. On 15 June this year this House agreed to refer this proposal to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for examination and report. The Public Works Committee tabled its report on the project on 27 November last and accepted the need for the project. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Works Committee has recommended the construction of the stage 2 development of the Commonwealth Government Centre in Townsville at an estimated cost of $31.5m at May 1989 prices. Tenders will be called in April next year and the project is expected to be completed in March 1992. I believe that this project demonstrates the Federal Government's ongoing commitment to the people of north Queensland. It also reflects the tenacity of the local Federal member, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who is present today. He has lobbied long and hard to ensure that this project achieved today's Budget funding and today's approval in this House. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This new project is testament to the sagacity of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West). It is a wonderful project for north Queensland and is a major example of the faith that this Government has in the development of north Queensland. The completed cost, including escalation, rise and fall, construction contingencies, and fees and professional charges, is estimated to be nearly $42m. As the Minister at the table said, it will provide up to 300 jobs at the peak of construction and, after construction, it will provide employment for a large number of people in north Queensland. It will serve an area extending from Gladstone to Thursday Island in the north and to the Northern Territory border in the west.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OG4">Mr LINDSAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should read the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works report. This is a wonderful project and adds to stage 1 of the Commonwealth Government Centre with which the Minister for Administrative Services was associated as Minister for Housing and Construction, as the portfolio then was. He has led the way in developing Federal government infrastructure on this site. As the Minister said, this is further evidence of the Government's objective to increase the proportion of government-owned office accommodation and to reduce overall rental costs. Over a 15-year period the estimated savings will be $21.2m for an equivalent leased space at current prices. That is a significant saving to the Australian taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now want to make some observations about the significance of this building to the people of north Queensland. Let there be no mistake about this matter when debates occur in this chamber about the value of private development in north Queensland compared with government development in north Queensland. I am a north Queenslander, and the development of north Queensland has been associated with fortitude, isolation, tenacity and Federal and State government faith in the development of north Queensland. Every major industry established in northern Australia has been established with the assistance of government, including the sugar industry, rail and road transport and communications. When I look at the Townsville skyline and count the number of multi-storey buildings, they are almost exclusively government constructed. Indeed, government investment in north Queensland virtually sustains the infrastructure to support other industries such as mining, the sugar industry, dairying and various secondary industries in that area. What this motion means to the people of north Queensland is a continuation of Government faith in the development of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give a name to the Minister for Administrative Services for the work that he has done for the people of northern Australia. I would like to call him a nation builder; he has become a nation builder for the people of north Queensland. Although people living in the southern parts of Australia may curl their lips or sneer at the increasing requests from people living in isolated areas of Australia for recognition by government, I assure people listening to these remarks that, from the perspective of people living 2,500 kilometres away, the efforts of the Minister for Administrative Services and of the Government in the development of northern Australia have earned their enduring gratitude because they are willing partners with the Government in the development of that very significant and important part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I also take the opportunity to thank the former Minister for Administrative Services, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown), for his part in urging the construction of stage 1 of the Commonwealth Government Centre at Townsville. I assure the House that the current Minister's adoption of the project from the very beginning and his tenacity and enduring fortitude in obtaining funds for the project from Cabinet have been welcomed by the people of the area that I represent. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was in the chamber recently I heard somebody-I do not remember who-make a silly reference to pork-barrelling. Although such people may mention pork-barrelling with a sneer or a curl of the lip, the people of north Queensland-whether in Cairns, Mount Isa, Darwin, Port Hedland, Townsville, Mackay or Rockhampton-know that the major development of infrastructure for communications, transport and the establishment of new industry has always been at the instigation and initiative of government. North Queenslanders have great respect for the capability of Government, whether Federal or State. That is why I have great pride in supporting the motion and in conveying to the Minister for Administrative Services again the enduring gratitude of the people of north Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) for making available to me the information that was covered in his speech today. I am tempted to say that the Minister was back to his old tricks because in speeches in the last few days on similar motions he has referred to the local Australian Labor Party members when projects were to be developed in their electorates. I notice that he did not do so yesterday in relation to a project for the Northern Territory. I do not know whether that was because the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) made no contribution or because the Minister's conscience pricked him. Little did I realise that today not only would the Minister be back to his old tricks in mentioning the tenacity of the local Federal member, but also we would have a Punch and Judy show. Not only did the Minister say what a great job the local member was doing, but the local member said what a great job the Minister was doing. It is the first time I have ever heard anybody say that this Minister is doing a great job.</PARA></TALK.START>

They would know that north Queensland is bleeding because of the pilots strike and the consequent decrease in tourism. If they can fix the pilots strike and persuade the Prime Minister that we still have a strike and get him to fix the problem as he ought to have done a long time ago, they may be able to come in here and say that they have made a contribution to north Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA>The proposal to construct a new building is consistent with the government objectives of increasing the proportion of owned office accommodation and reducing overall rental costs. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the fourth or fifth time I have raised this matter in the last few days, and every time I raise it the Minister interjects saying that we have to have a proper mix. I do not know where the mix is because every time this matter has come before the House it has been with reference to government owned office space. I make the point to the Minister and the local member that every time we increase government owned office space we increase government expenditure. This means that we have a weaker fiscal policy. As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has pointed out to us time and again recently, every time we have a weaker fiscal policy, in order to compensate, we must have tighter monetary policy. We can talk about the perceived savings of owning versus leasing to the community in north Queensland, but the overall penalty that the country, average working families and the homeless pay, in terms of the Government's actions, is higher interest rates and higher mortgage rates. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Defence Housing Authority housing developments at Randwick, Holsworthy and East Hills, Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government established the Defence Housing Authority in January 1988 as the first step towards providing a better standard and increased choice of housing for defence personnel and their families more in line with community standards. In taking over responsibility for defence housing, the Defence Housing Authority adopted a portfolio of about 23,000 houses and has at present an investment program in excess of $100m per year. Over the past 30 years there have been problems associated with defence housing, to the point where today nearly 50 per cent of defence homes require either substantial improvements and repairs or replacement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Housing Authority recently purchased a six-hectare site at Randwick, a 166-hectare site at Holsworthy and a  70-hectare site at East Hills in Sydney at a total purchase price of approximately $40m. Those properties were purchased from the Australian Property Group in my Department. The intention in purchasing these sites is to develop medium density housing at Randwick and a mix of housing densities at Holsworthy and East Hills. The three sites are expected to yield a total of some 2,070 houses for both civilian and defence families. Of this total, about 650 houses will be for defence families. </PARA>
<PARA> Development of the three sites will be undertaken by the Defence Housing Authority and one or more developers under joint venture arrangements. In so doing, significant opportunities for developers and local businesses in each area will occur. Some 600 jobs are expected to be generated at the three sites during development. The Defence Housing Authority has been actively pursuing approval of these developments to minimise costs incurred through holding charges, which at present amount to some $19,000 per day. Failure to gain approval for these projects by the end of this year could delay development by at least three months and cause associated increases in holding charges. The Public Works Committee commended the Defence Housing Authority on its willingness to negotiate-(Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA> I was saying, before I was so irresponsibly interrupted, that the Public Works Committee commended the Defence Housing Authority on its willingness to negotiate with environmental groups and made special mention in relation to development of the East Hills site, where sensitive freshwater wastelands could be threatened if development proceeded without involvement and input from environmental groups. The Defence Housing Authority advised the Public Works Committee that it acknowledges the environmental significance of this East Hills site. Discussions with environmental groups and experts are proceeding and all appropriate action will be taken. I would like to thank the Public Works Committee and its Chairman for their support of this proposal and the expeditious way in which they have handled it. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the proposal before the House concerning the provision of improved housing for Defence Force families at Randwick, Holsworthy and East Hills in Sydney. I would like to make only two points in relation to the proposal. The Opposition is encouraged by the innovative joint initiative which the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) is embarking upon with the development of housing in the Sydney area. As honourable members will have read in the press of last weekend, the Defence Housing Authority is to join with Delfin Property Groups Ltd in a joint venture worth some $350m to develop a mixed civilian and military residential area at Holsworthy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This initiative is a worthy reflection on the management of the DHA, for two reasons. First, it is a credible attempt to blend service families into the wider community, of which they are a very vital part. Second, in an era in which new housing starts are increasingly suffering from the Hawke Government's prohibitively high mortgage interest rates, the DHA will bring housing relief to service families in the Sydney area through these joint venture arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The second general point I want to make relates to the need for the Government to provide the DHA with further incentive to expedite the provision of improved housing for our Defence Force families. As honourable members will be aware, the Opposition's released defence science and personnel policy provides such an incentive scheme. As the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) stated, the DHA invests some $100m per annum in the provision of defence housing. He also pointed out that, in spite of the work of the DHA, nearly 50 per cent of defence homes require either substantial improvements and repairs or replacement. This is an immense task and a vital one. In the interests of service personnel and their families, the DHA must be given every assistance to address the needs of providing a high standard of defence housing. A Liberal-National Party government will provide an incentive to the DHA to speed up improvement of defence housing based on its capability to improve its operating performance year by year. It will seek to allow the DHA to retain a portion of any additional earnings as a result of improved management through schemes such as the joint venture with Delfin. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the Opposition supports this proposal before the House, as it does the fine work of Mr Bill Kirby-Jones and the DHA in providing better housing for our service personnel and their families. </PARA>

Indeed, the site at Holsworthy is an excellent choice to link both the private sector and defence housing in one significant development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would seek to make some brief remarks in connection with this report, and I understand that the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) may also be speaking on this matter. Time will not permit me to extensively debate report 296, entitled The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament. Reform of the Australian Audit Office. It was unashamedly a high-minded document and unashamedly a document which sought greater resources and independence for the Auditor-General. In the course of the first inquiry ever into the Australian Audit Office, the Public Accounts Committee brought down 78 recommendations for reform of that institution. I join with the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, Senator Watson, in saying that the Government has turned the first stone and has made some very significant reforms in responding to the Committee's report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I very much believe that the report of the Public Accounts Committee-and to a very large degree the response of the Government-is in keeping with the mood of the times. It seems to me that all around the world people are demanding more democracy, not less, and that what the Public Accounts Committee set out to do in its report was to urge that reforms be undertaken to give more power to the Parliament and a greater degree of accountability. While welcoming the Government's very commendable reforms-which I will refer to briefly in a moment-it is also important to say that we need to follow up those reforms. I am very optimistic that the independent review that is being undertaken of the Audit Office as a result of the Government's decision will give further vindication to report 296 and the reports of the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee proposed the repeal of the Audit Act 1901 and the enactment of two new laws, a financial administration Act and an audit Act. It is heartening to see that the Government has accepted the first, and indeed one of the most important, recommendations of the Committee's report. The Audit Act was the fourth Act passed by the Australian Parliament. It has become outdated and its repeal and replacement by new legislation is overdue. The acceptance of the Committee's recommendation will provide the Government with a unique opportunity to reform Commonwealth Government administration and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommended a proposal to create an audit committee of the Parliament, and the Government has recognised that it is more appropriate for the Parliament, rather than for the Government, to respond to this recommendation. The establishment of such a committee would indicate that the Parliament acknowledged the importance of auditing for effective budgeting and as a means of ensuring the accountability to the Parliament of public sector managers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Accounts Committee put forward a proposal for greater resources for the Audit Office, and the Committee found that the Audit Office had insufficient resources to conduct efficiency audits and recommended significant increases. In its response the Government did not meet the Committee's claim-an ambit claim though it may have been-but it did agree to provide an additional $2m annually, which will go a long way towards providing resources for the Australian Audit Office for a stronger program of efficiency audits. Making one brief aside: it was indicated to me in the course of the inquiry undertaken by the Committee that when the Audit Office goes in to undertake a regularity audit, those behind the cash register pay attention, but when the Auditor-General moves in to undertake an efficiency audit, it is the secretary of the government department that sits up and takes notice; such is the importance of the efficiency audit process. </PARA>
<PARA> Most importantly, the Committee recommended that the Auditor-General be the auditor of all government bodies. The Government has responded to that by saying that it was disposed to accept the Committee's recommendation, but it depends very much on what the independent inquiry by the Auditor-General of South Australia says in his response to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Like my parliamentary colleague and Deputy Chairman, Senator Watson, I want to end on a positive note, because the Government's response is welcome; it has been a significant reform. But I stress to the Parliament that we need to go further and build on these reforms to give greater accountability in Australian government. I have every confidence that, given the direction of the reforms that the Government has implemented and the very wide public support for them, in years to come we will see other recommendations of this historic report of the Joint Committee implemented. </PARA>

The first comment I wish to make relates to the honourable member for Hughes, because a number of very important reforms have been undertaken by the Joint Parliamentary Committee under his leadership.

We have gone part of the way, but let's not lose sight of these objectives we have sort of worked to'. I wish to make it very clear what the Government has done in its response. The Government has picked up the easy reforms, but in terms of the fundamental conflict between the Executive and Parliament, the Government has determined that the Executive is pre-eminent. In the context of a government that I believe will not be in office, and as one who might join a future government, perhaps I could stand here and say, `Bravo! I am glad you have left these matters in the hands of a future government'. I have to say to the members of the Government that they have forgone the opportunity to undertake significant reforms in this area of contest. </PARA>
<PARA> In its response the Government has conveniently made it very clear that the issue of independence was significant and it put that issue as the first item. I will take honourable members through the response. Firstly, recommendation 2 states:</PARA>
<PARA> A Parliamentary committee be established to advise the Auditor-General on Parliament's audit priorities and to consider the Australian Audit Office's finances in detail. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's reporting function was set out in recommendation 2 (5) and it indicated that the Speaker and President will alternate as chairperson. Paragraph 7 of the response states:</PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of such a Committee is a matter for Parliament to determine. While the Government would be prepared to consider any comment that the Committee might make it would reserve for itself the right to accept or reject such comments. It would not be appropriate for the Minister for Finance, as a member of the Executive to be a member of the Committee. Care would need to be exercised that such a committee was not seen to put pressure on the Auditor-General to pursue particular topics . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The next recommendation, which is recommendation 3 (8), states:</PARA>
<PARA> Future audit legislation state unequivocally that the Auditor-General is an officer of the Parliament in order to emphasise the Auditor-General's relationship with Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph (9) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not support this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 7 read:</PARA>
<PARA>Legislation be introduced to establish the Australian Audit Office as a statutory authority, and to permit the Auditor-General to determine the terms and conditions of employment of Australian Audit Office staff. </PARA>
<PARA>The response was that the Government will give further consideration to this, so it is clearly off the agenda. Recommendation No. 13 read:</PARA>
<PARA>In keeping with the user pays principles, in future Parliament pay all audit fees. </PARA>
<PARA>I thought it was interesting, in relation to that matter and the question of appropriations being included in the appropriations for parliamentary departments in a special Bill, that the Government did not accept the recommendation that Parliament pay all audit fees. The response went on to deal with recommendations on resources. Again, the Government was quite unwilling to allow the Parliament to have a view on the extent to which the Auditor-General may be resourced. The Government went on to say that it did not consider a sufficient case had been made out by the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee to warrant an increase in the proposed amount for the Audit Office of $15.7m per annum which was recommended in order to enable the Auditor- General to undertake the efficiency work load. </PARA>
<PARA> When it came to matters relating to appointments of the Auditor-General, the Government was prepared to accept an advisory input from the Parliament but not a parliamentary role, so he was not to be an officer of the Parliament. When it came to the Auditor-General's mandate, the Government said that it was disposed to accept those recommendations and to that extent one should be pleased. When it came to the final question of the Government's enacting new legislation, I am pleased that the principal recommendations of the Committee have been accepted. I make the point, as I commenced, that when it came to a question of whether or not the Auditor-General was really an officer of the Parliament, the Government was prepared to join issue. </PARA>
<PARA> There is only one real virtue, in my view, that has arisen from the way in which this report has been addressed and that is that it is the first occasion on which I can recall that a report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has been the subject of a separate report by the Government to Parliament rather than the old system of finance minute, that is, report to the Joint Committee being followed as the mechanism the Government uses to respond to committee reports and the Public Accounts Committee thereafter having to respond separately, if it thought fit, enclosing the finance minute and the Committee's reply to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that on this occasion the Parliament has had the opportunity to consider the response and to examine it. I am certainly very disappointed that, in this instance, the Government has seen fit to reject those recommendations that so clearly would have enhanced the role of the Auditor- General as an officer of the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is my first opportunity to reply to the debate on the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Bill. A number of matters were raised in the debate last evening. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), leading for the Opposition, raised the question as to whether the Bill created offences which will be encompassed by the mutual assistance and proceeds of crime legislation. Let me assure the House that the answer to that question is yes, it does. We can seek mutual assistance in respect of any offence and we can grant it in relation to any offence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In particular, we can grant all forms of mutual assistance, including the enforcement of foreign proceeds of crime orders in relation to serious narcotic offences as defined in the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. Again, we can seek extradition for any offence and, in respect of the offences listed in Article 3 (1) of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, all other state parties are obliged to consider our requests for extradition. We can surrender to other countries for all relevant offences provided their laws prescribe a penalty of not less than 12 months. Again, we can take action under the Proceeds of Crime Act in respect of the proceeds of such offences as are created in this legislation because all the offences created fall in the definition of `serious narcotic offences' in that legislation, and we can take action in respect of the laundering of drug proceeds. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies raised matters which he felt were causing some concern in the community, namely, there appears to be some disagreement between the Chairman of the National Crime Authority and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Let me say at the outset that both of those people are statutory appointees. They have obligations in respect of the statutes which they are appointed pursuant to and they participate in discussions on the law and its effectiveness. They are free to express their own views. The only cause for concern would be if there was a suggestion, in the course of their statutory responsibilities, that they were not necessarily able to fulfil them because of their views. We are entitled to make it very clear that I have the utmost confidence in both those people. They are leaders of their profession and are well respected. </PARA>
<PARA> Reports have been made that the Director of Public Prosecutions was suggesting that there could be decriminalisation or legalisation of drugs. It has been drawn to my attention that Mr Weinberg has specifically repudiated any suggestions that he was calling for the legalisation of drugs. All he was talking about was a consideration of a range of options. Many people are talking about a range of options. That would relate to the question, which the Convention talks about, of rehabilitation, treatment and matters of that nature. Addiction is a medical problem. However, the Convention to which this legislation is related is in respect of the trafficking or manufacture of narcotics which, everybody acknowledges, can cause great difficulties for our society and can injure a large number of people. Society dictates the type of legislation that governments would be encouraged to introduce. There is no doubt that public opinion is firmly against any suggestion that there should be some soft approach to those who manufacture or engage in illicit trafficking of narcotics for their own pecuniary gain. I think we are all at one in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> There are variations as to how we might best deal with this. It is a bit simplistic to suggest that we might overcome some of the problems by legalising drugs. Those who practise in the difficult area of treating addicts made the quite valid point: do we want to encourage a number of other people to become addicted, thereby injuring themselves, their families and others in society? In other words, we ought to recognise that it is a disease. That is the point. At the same time, we have to recognise that those who perpetuate the factors that may well encourage addiction-namely, the manufacture of and trafficking in narcotics-are encouraging others to sign their own death warrants and certainly they injure society. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to talk about addiction in medical terms because that is where the treatment would need to be aimed. The Convention recognises that. Medical practitioners, psychologists and others who treat addicts are very much against the view that there could be any hope for the improvement of the addict by the legalisation of the distribution of narcotics. They make the point that it would merely increase the number of addicts by perhaps 2 per cent. What would that do for society and the addict? The Convention itself makes the point that some efforts have to be made to assist people who have an addiction. We certainly do that in our society. We spend a fair amount of taxpayers' money assisting those who need help for addiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that is made is that the addictive potential is a psychological, not necessarily physical, process. Physical dependence should be distinguished from the psychology of addiction. As has been pointed out to me, addiction is only tangentially related to a particular drug in that the addict is addicted not to a chemical process but to a sensation, a prop, an experience, which structures the life. We need to understand the problems that a number of people in our society have. Instead of making them perpetual invalids we have to talk about their rehabilitation. They have a dependency because they feel inadequate. It is that type of treatment and psychology that we want to encourage-not to talk about it in the sense that it is harmless and there are no problems; there are. </PARA>
<PARA> Drugs have real effects. Some excite the nervous system. In respect of their clinical action, they are stimulants in that they give a person an illusion of being energised through the feelings of stored energy for immediate use. Since that energy is not replaced, the chronic stimulants take over. Therefore, addicts are virtually living on borrowed time. Like the heroin users, they are doing nothing to build up their basic resources. Their true physical or emotional states are concealed from them by artificial boosts. With the constant elevations of their heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output and blood-sugar level, they are inured to variations in outside stimulation. That is a medical diagnosis of what is wrong with these people. We have to acknowledge the difference between the addict and the person who wants to get monetary gain from that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested in the course of the debate that perhaps our legislation in respect of the proceeds of crime is a bit too severe. I do not think that it is. I think that it is quite fair. Those who seek to have money on the basis that they are relying on the misery of others deserve to be deprived of those assets if they can be directly related to that fact. We are talking about the proceeds of crime and money laundering. There has been some criticism on the basis of section 81 of the proceeds of crime legislation. There was a suggestion that mere negligence under that section might be deemed to be sufficient. An analogy was drawn with an offence that covers both murder and mere assault and prescribes the one penalty of life imprisonment for both. However, the analogy is fallacious, as it is not the mens rea that differs in the example but the actus reus, causing death or inflicting injury or fear, both of which must be intentional. It is not a question of mere negligence in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument appears to overlook the fact that there are two mental elements to the offence. The first and primary mental element relates to the mental state applicable to the transaction which constitutes the money laundering-namely, that which is inherent in the word `engages' in that particular piece of legislation. Clearly, there can be no negligence involved in engaging in conduct. This must be a conscious intended action. The second relates to the mental state required in relation to what Brennan, J. described as the circumstances attendant on the occurrence of the criminal act-He Kaw Teh v. Queen, 157 CLR 523 at page 575. It is in relation to that mental state that section 81 uses the expression `knows, or ought reasonably to know'. It appears that somebody has overlooked the distinction which the courts have made in laying down minimum standards for these two mental states. Brennan, J. states at page 575:</PARA>
<PARA>A mental state less than knowledge can apply more readily to circumstances attendant on the occurrence of an act involved in the commission of an offence being circumstances which make the act criminal. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, it is not unusual for no mental state to be required in relation to the attendant circumstances. For example, in the money laundering offence, it would have been open to the Parliament to create an offence which prohibited anyone engaging in a transaction involving property which is proceeds of crime, regardless of whether the person had any knowledge at all that the property was of that type. There can be no doubt that the courts would have accepted that the intention underlying the offence was to prohibit any intentional dealing with such property absolutely. </PARA>
<PARA> The Vienna Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances requires state parties to create offences relating to the conversion and transfer of property, knowing that property to have been derived from an offence. Article 3 (3) provides that knowledge, intent or purpose required as an element of an offence set forth in paragraph 1 of this Article may be inferred from objective factual circumstances. It would appear that the Convention envisages an offence which imposes liability on the basis that the person ought reasonably to have known. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the legal reasonings which justify what has been introduced into this legislation. I think the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) raised the issue of the need to annexe the Convention to the Bill. Whilst we have the power to enact the vast majority of provisions contained in the Bill on the basis of specific domestic legislative powers, there are some provisions which rely on the validity of the external affairs power, which in this case will derive from Australia's status as a party to the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there was a question of the limitation of our power to reconsider a drug policy. It is too simplistic to suggest that because one provision of the Convention imposes an obligation to create an offence on the basis of possessing, purchasing or cultivating drugs for personal use, there is no scope for dealing with users; that is, the point of addiction and the question of treatment. The Convention itself says that criminal offences for users shall be created if the party considers it necessary, and even then only if its constitutional principles and basic concepts of law so permit. Again, even if Australia does create offences relating to possession, purchase or cultivation for personal use, those offences need not attract traditional criminal penalties. The Convention specifically encourages treatment, education, after-care and rehabilitation as alternatives to conviction. At the commencement of my reply, I outlined the sort of medical analysis that has got to be done to assist these people. </PARA>
<PARA> The decriminalisation of personal use is available to state parties as a legitimate option, as is clear from the list of states which have already signed the Convention and which have liberalised their own drug laws to permit alternative methods of dealing with users. So let us put at rest the suggestion that this will in any way inhibit states being able to talk about alternative measures for those that are addicts. I again make the point that there are to be no alternative measures for traffickers or manufacturers of narcotic substances. They are the ones at which basically this legislation, based on the Convention, is aimed. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies felt that there were some difficulties about our extradition matters. There are no weaknesses in our extradition laws. He raised two specific issues in respect of Fiji which are really outside the ambit of the Bill but on which I think I ought to put his mind at rest. He made the accusation that we had refused to extradite a person to Fiji for what was alleged to be a smuggling affair. The Fijian Government never really sought extradition. The person in question was in London, and the Government of Fiji sought extradition from the United Kingdom, which was refused by the British on the basis that they did not consider there was justification for extradition. They also took the view that there was a political offence involved for which extradition should not be granted. So it would be inappropriate for us, bearing in mind that Fiji was the principal country concerned, to suggest that we might extradite the person to Australia when the country deemed to be injured was Fiji. </PARA>
<PARA> The second question was whether we had prevented another person, in Australia, from being extradited to Fiji. I inform the honourable member for Menzies that no such request was made. But the matter I find rather difficult to explain is that the person was arrested in Australia with no evidence of the offence. The basis of that matter certainly created an impression amongst the law enforcement authorities in Australia. I went to a great deal of trouble, through the Director of Public Prosecutions, to send somebody to Fiji to interview whoever the witness was against him. It appeared that the person concerned had been in custody until a day or so before making a statement. When that person was interviewed it was made very clear that very little was known about any alleged offence. I have no doubt that that is why that matter was not pursued. I make it clear to the honourable member for Menzies, who seems to know a fair bit about this matter, that there has been no suggestion that our laws are in any way unenforceable or that we have ever refused any valid request for extradition. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has been very conscious of the need to get extradition, because we are rather bereft of treaties, through no particular fault of the situation, I suppose, except that previous governments never thought that they would be appropriate. It now appears to be that one of the busiest parts of our administration is to deal with extraditions, not only from our point of view in seeking people to be returned to Australia, but also from that of other countries seeking to have their citizens returned to them. There are adequate safeguards. In respect of the British position, I can understand why they took the view that they would not extradite the person concerned. I think that answers all the matters raised in the second reading debate. I thank all members for their contributions. I am very pleased to acknowledge that the Opposition supports the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921. The Opposition will not oppose this Bill. However, we want to see the complete deregulation of the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) market. The Bill before the House alters the excise duty on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas, and to that extent the legislation is unexceptionable. But the underlying issues which pin Government policy in regard to liquefied petroleum gas have the most serious consequences for the future energy needs of this nation. A deregulated market for LPG would see greater industry incentive to increase availability of supply, prolong the availability of the gas beyond the next decade and ensure the efficient allocation of the resource across the market. Admittedly, though LPG supplies are not infinite, in the short to medium term LPG will enable us to meet a number of vital objectives in relation to our broader energy requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we could diversify our energy supply by encouraging wider use of LPG in any of its applications we would be going quite some way towards enhancing our own security with regard to energy. At present LPG has varied application. Some 41 per cent of LPG consumed in Australia is used as an energy source for residential, commercial and industrial consumption. Within this component residential use is growing, according to forecasts, at a rate of some 6.4 per cent per year. Some 38 per cent of LPG supplied is accounted for by its use as a feedstock in the petrochemical industry, whilst the remaining 20 per cent or so is utilised as an alternative to automotive gasoline. Automotive demand is expected to increase at a modest 3 1/2 per cent per annum. I do not contend that domestic, industrial and automotive demand should be converted wholly to LPG use but I believe that LPG is an under-utilised resource. It deserves greater utilisation because it would allow us to diversify our energy resources and offset the enormous crude oil bill which faces us in the next decade. LPG can therefore extend the life of existing oil reserves and offset the huge import bills we face next decade as a result of the Government's excise regime. </PARA>
<PARA> LPG also provides a not insignificant export income for this country. The 1.3 million tonnes exported in 1987-88 earned Australia some $240m. Under the current policy of this Government these earnings will fall to around $60m annually at the turn of the century. Moreover, LPG has other important advantages for Australians. It burns cleanly and it has no detrimental environmental effect whatsoever. Given this, I would have anticipated that the Government, having developed a temporary and quite politically cynical interest in green politics, would have seized on the opportunity to exploit the resource. The Government needs to realise that if it is genuinely seeking to protect the environment and is prepared to leave aside the rhetoric and replace it with action, it should consider and then implement the deregulation of LPG. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also needs to realise that if it genuinely seeks to see this resource utilised effectively it must comprehensively deregulate the pricing system it has built up around the gas. To deregulate the pricing system comprehensively is to remove that pricing system completely-no ifs or buts or part conversions or compromises. LPG needs to be deregulated without qualification. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government actually possesses an energy policy with a clearly defined strategy beyond motherhood statements about Australia's energy needs into the future, it must ensure that the pricing arrangements for LPG do not discourage its development as a fuel for use within Australia. Though I admit that the present policy has shown some signs of progress in relation to earlier times and different circumstances, especially in the opening up of the inland market for LPG, there is still a long road to travel. I fear-and so does the industry-that the Government has stalled on that road. Though LPG does not attract a product end retail excise and onshore and refinery produced LPG does not attract an excise in the way that naturally occurring Bass Strait LPG does, significant steps still need to be taken to ensure that industry is able to overcome the difficulties of supplying and marketing LPG. </PARA>
<PARA> The critical end of the LPG problem concerns the setting of the wholesale price. That is, the critical matter is the question of how the Government can create the appropriate relationship between producers and marketers of LPG. The setting of such a relationship is critical to ensuring the most efficient utilisation of LPG, and the key to that question, which has stood in the way of the development of LPG as a fuel, is the Government's persistence in setting the wholesale price of LPG. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government made a gesture for deregulation by lifting direct control of the wholesale price. Yet it faltered. The Government is under pressure to back away from deregulation or the slight steps towards that end objective that have been tentatively undertaken to date. Will the Government stay firm on its alleged pursuit of a more deregulatory policy? It must confirm its commitment to deregulation. The Government has transferred responsibility for the setting of the wholesale price of LPG to the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA). In other words, while it lays public claim to having deregulated the industry it continues with regulatory policy through the PSA. That is to say, the PSA gets to carry out the dirty work by way of indirectly executing government regulatory policy. The Minister for Resources, Senator Peter Cook, likes to berate the Opposition for its deregulatory approach to LPG and likes to create in the community fears of massive price rises in the retail price of LPG as a result of deregulation. But in doing so he reveals his own self-contradictory approach to policy formulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, Senator Cook acknowledges that the role of the PSA in setting the wholesale price of LPG is unsatisfactory. In his own press statements he acknowledges that export controls will have to be reimposed if problems emerge in supplying domestic markets. I refer honourable members to Senator Cook's press release dated 11 October 1988. Mr Deputy Speaker, in short, the Minister has no confidence in the very regulatory system he continues to prop up. I should apologise, Mr Speaker, for having referred to you for some time now by the more junior title of Deputy Speaker. I should say that you have shown remarkable tolerance and some humility in not dragging me to order prior to this. </PARA>

Perhaps we lose some of the niceties of address in this place when consumed so intensely by such an important topic. The Minister, Senator Cook, intends to apply export controls, another regulatory device, in order to solve a supply problem in the domestic market. The greater this tendency the further we get from the creation of a free market for LPG, which the Minister says is the Government's objective. In the Minister's press release of 11 October 1988 the following appears in relation to the announcement of the role of the PSA in setting the wholesale price of LPG:</PARA></TALK.START>

Not only has the PSA failed to solve the supply and marketing problems associated with LPG but also it has moved still further from creating a free market by having recourse to employing export controls. The surprise in all of this is that, although the Minister would like to create a free market for LPG, as his press release of 11 October last year clearly states, he has the temerity to castigate the coalition for calling for deregulation proper. The confusion in the Minister's response to the marketing of LPG is extraordinary. He has as his objective the creation of a free market but fails to achieve it owing to the persistent use of regulatory controls. How does the Minister hope to bring about a free market when he has such recourse to regulatory controls? He uses regulation as a prop for his political cowardice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) is signalling that he has little or no interest whatsoever in this matter. It is not a matter of deep concern for him that his constituents are paying more for LPG than they would in a free market. No doubt he will come into this place and make a contribution with the trumped up figures handed to him on a silver platter by the Minister. We can always rely on the honourable member for Bendigo to do the Minister's bidding. He is a very ambitious man. If that means doing what the Minister tells him, if that means reading the Department's set speeches, he will do it. For him the ministerial benches offer an irresistable temptation. His constituents' interests will be trodden over in his climb for power. </PARA>

Mr Deputy Speaker, you are a man of some integrity; let us not pretend that it is anything other than a dispute. Even the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, who is at the table, knows that it is a dispute. Who will ever forget the spectacle of the Minister tripping over his own words to avoid the use of the word `dispute', given that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had outlawed that word.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before being so rudely interrupted by the honourable member for Bendigo and the Minister, I was asking why the Minister for Resources thought he could pretend that he is striving towards a free market for LPG pricing when in fact he so obviously resorts to the use of regulatory power when he feels there may be some electoral backlash. To how many audiences is the Minister playing? The Minister after his press release of 11 October 1988 said in a press release of 7 December 1988 that the Opposition should be criticised for pursuing the objective of complete deregulation for LPG. Which of those two press releases are we to believe?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Farrer, violently concerned about this issue, in stark contrast to the honourable member for Bendigo, asks: which of the press releases are we to believe? Where does the Minister stand? In his press release of 11 October the Minister claimed to be committed to a free market for LPG. Yet in the release of 7 December he extolled the apparent, and misleading, benefits of continued regulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point is that the coalition is prepared to take the bit between its teeth when it comes to policy. It is prepared, unlike the Government, to promote a policy it believes will secure Australia's energy supplies, despite the misinformation campaigns spread by the Government regarding the impact of deregulation on retail prices. One does not have to be a genius to know that the honourable member for Bendigo, with his set speech handed to him from the Department, will attempt to mislead people again as to the impact of deregulation on prices. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Resources must know, problems of supply, such as those which have resulted in rationing in Victoria at peak periods and which will run into the summer months of 1989-90, are essentially problems of pricing and industry incentive. As honourable members will understand, the wholesale price of LPG is set by the Prices Surveillance Authority. The Prices Surveillance Authority wholesale price is geared to reflect import parity prices for LPG-a hypothetical proposition for Australia. The import parity price is derived from calculations which pay respect to the Saudi benchmark price for LPG, exchange rates and shipping costs. At the moment, the PSA wholesale price is $175 per tonne. Producers in their dealings with distributors cannot sell over this price. The PSA therefore acts to cap market movements in the wholesale price or to impose an artificial ceiling, ostensibly to protect consumers from retail price flow-ons. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has very serious problems with the PSA method of fixing the wholesale price. It is claimed that the methodology employed by the PSA lacks a rational basis and is arbitrary. Though the Government couches its present policy in the context of consumer protection, it is a policy which has meant supply shortages in Victoria and it has disfigured the proper growth of the LPG market. It is a policy which has meant that it is near impossible to write sensible commercial contracts because of the cap which is arbitrarily imposed upon rising LPG prices. In reality, the policy of price control does consumers a disservice. It denies them regularity of supply and undermines the community's long term interests by not allowing for the development of the resource and its efficient allocation. </PARA>
<PARA> The present uncertainties in the supply of LPG are a direct result of the legacy of regulatory policies-policies which are being continued through the PSA. The fact that the Victorian supply networks cannot cope at the moment with excess demand for LPG in the winter months is a result of the lack of incentive for producers to invest in more effective pipeline and tracking facilities. Under the current pricing system, producers are unable to recover capital and operating costs of distribution facilities to meet what is a relatively small but vigorous market. Moreover, as the Government requires producers to sell into the domestic market, the lack of overseas competition means distributors have no need to buy at what would otherwise be commercial rates at long term contract prices. Instead, distributors buy from producers at spot price levels. This situation has the added implication of undermining the security of long term contracts entered into by overseas purchasers, the returns from which have underwritten the establishment of the present domestic infrastructure for LPG. This is the legacy of regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Esso-BHP is trying to overcome these problems, but the fact that the rationing of LPG has taken place in the past is a direct reflection of the manipulation of the wholesale price of the gas. In fact, Esso-BHP faces enormous difficulties as a result of being denied the opportunity to use the price mechanism to determine how it would allocate supply in relation to demand. Given the declining supplies of propane, how can the Government expect the industry to make decisions as to how to meet accentuated problems of demand? The investment climate in regard to LPG is not improving. The efficient utilisation of both the propane and butane components of what we know as LPG was severely restricted. For many years, the wholesale prices of both butane and propane were set at the same level, that is, at $175 per tonne. For this reason, there has been an understandable trend for the industry to develop only the propane side of the equation. In fact, when we buy LPG, we are largely buying propane. The butane market has not been developed at all-it is an undeveloped resource. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there are technical reasons why the production of propane was preferred over butane, the simple fact is that the two markets have not emerged in tandem largely because of the uniform pricing of the two gases. It is therefore impractical to develop two distinct processing facilities for two identically priced products when the same end result can be obtained with the production of one alone-in this case propane. As a result, one resource-propane-is overextended, while the other-butane-is underutilised. Regulation has corrupted the supply mix of these resources. It has twisted the development of this area which the energy sector regards as so very critical to the energy future of Australia. Moreover, this policy of regulation has retarded the development of butane while encouraging us to exceed our supply of propane resources. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Farrer, with his interest in this subject, has said that we are paying a horrific price for this regulatory policy embraced by the Government without qualification. I cannot stress strongly enough the importance of enabling a mix of butane and propane. This is not the fault of the industry-it is the fault of the regulatory system, which has not permitted market demand to set the price at its natural level. In short, the butane market will not develop until there is a satisfactory price differential between it and propane. These are the facts of life in the marketplace and there is now an opportunity for a sensible price differential to develop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I realise that State regulations also apply to the acceptable mix of propane and butane for use in various applications. This is especially the case in Victoria. These regulations reflect fears as to the volatility of mixes of butane and propane that existed in earlier times. Mixtures are already in use in various applications in other States. If the industry were able to enjoy more market responsive pricing for LPG, especially for butane, then it would also be encouraged to take the technical and engineering steps towards alleviating these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> Moves are afoot from outside the Government to bring some uniformity to the various States' practices in relation to technical standards, but this tier of regulation will not disappear, I would hazard to say, until the Federal Government acts to free up the pricing mechanism-and the PSA cap on the industry certainly needs freeing. Under the present system, which will be reviewed in some undefined way next year, the PSA price is an inflexible and rigid instrument which does not adjust to the shifts in the component values that were used to calculate it. For example, as I said before, the PSA rate of import parity for LPG of $175 is set by reference to Saudi production values, exchange rates and shipping costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, all three of these components tend to alter in value over time, but the PSA remains unresponsive. This is especially the case in an environment in which the exchange rate keeps dropping. When the exchange rate drops, the market price heads rapidly towards the PSA ceiling price. If this persists, the very inflexibility of the pricing mechanism will ensure that producers would be better off diverting LPG reserves to the export market. In short, price must reflect market conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the related problems that concern the Government, such as diversion of supply to the export market and the rationing of domestic requirements, stem directly from the PSA price capping system. Let us not get away from it. Let the price float according to where the market is heading and the resource will find its proper place in regard to price. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By eliminating regulation, as the honourable member for Farrer valuably contributes. The same inflexibilities in the artificial pricing of LPG threaten also to disrupt the sales of gas to the interstate markets. Without a bidding system in place that is not hamstrung by an artificial price ceiling, a rational interstate distribution network may well fail to establish itself. Again, depending on how they are placed, certain States might well experience supply difficulties in the future owing to the inflexible pricing system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In drawing to a conclusion, I admit that there are consumer related concerns here, but they are nowhere near what the Government's scare campaign has propagated. The matter we are dealing with here is the capping of the wholesale price, and not the pricing arrangements at the retail end of the market. The gulf between the two is so great that changes in the per tonne price at the wholesale level would not have anywhere near the imagined impact consumers have come to fear as a function of Government propaganda. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, if there is a concern that LPG ought to be in greater use as an automotive gasoline, then deregulating the wholesale market will have only nominal influence on whether or not this comes to pass. Whether LPG comes to take pride of place as a substitute fuel in the transport sector will have more to do with the following: the supply mix of butane and propane permissible; the retail value of conversion kits, which are prohibitively high at around $2,000; and the extent to which the international automotive industry can adapt engine designs. What we are about is the efficient utilisation of a natural resource in the context of a coherent energy policy. By necessity, such an objective requires the operation of market forces to create adequate levels of supply and efficiency in the allocation of our natural resources. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a long speech by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). It was certainly a very well researched speech, but during the duration of that speech it occurred to me that perhaps it was one of the reasons why Radio National or the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) took parliamentary broadcasts off 3LO and put them at some obscure number at the end of the dial. While the speech by the honourable member for Gippsland was well researched, I doubt that it did much for the interest of the listener or for the ratings of the ABC. I noticed that, during the honourable member's speech, those honourable members who were present in the chamber cleared out after the first 15 minutes, as did members of the press gallery. However, in defence of the honourable member for Gippsland, it certainly was a very well researched speech and it is obviously a matter in which he takes a great personal interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to take up a couple of matters raised by the Opposition during this debate. Those matters really relate to regulation. Opposition members are big talkers about deregulation but, by and large, they are the non-achievers. We have heard the honourable member for Gippsland talk tonight about his own views-I do not know whether they are the views of the Opposition-that this industry should be more deregulated. However, when one looks at the Opposition's policies and the votes taken in this place over the years, one sees that it has consistently opposed the operation of market forces and the deregulation of various industries. For instance, it was this Government-the Hawke Government-which, soon after its election to office, deregulated the Australian financial markets. We floated the Australian dollar and we allowed real competition between Australian banks. We removed a number of the regulations that affected the financing and banking industries. We introduced deregulation basically to free up the arteries of finance in the Australian economy. In that respect, this Government has the runs on the board in terms of those market forces and deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> I also remember that it was this Government that not so long ago introduced legislation in this place--(Quorum formed) This provides a real contrast: during the contribution of the honourable member for Gippsland the chamber and the galleries emptied; during my contribution they have filled. I was talking about the float of the dollar in 1983. Members of the Opposition are the big talkers and non-achievers in this area of regulation and deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The financial impact statement with respect to the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) indicates that the Government will not raise any revenue from excise on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for the six months from 1 April 1989. With a zero excise rate to apply from 1 April 1989, total LPG excise receipts for the 1988-89 financial year are estimated at $11m, compared with receipts of $19.8m in the previous year. The Bill will therefore have the effect of raising less excise in the next financial year than was raised in the previous financial year. Honourable members listening to the debate should take those figures into account when considering the contribution of the honourable member for Gippsland. </PARA>
<PARA> The discussion about regulation and deregulation is certainly a very important one in the context of our economy in terms of freeing up markets and becoming more efficient in the way in which we produce things in Australia. Earlier this year the Government introduced wheat marketing deregulation legislation. It produced a massive split between the coalition partners, the National Party of Australia and the Liberal Party of Australia. Legislation in relation to the Industry Commission is presently before Parliament. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) remarked in Question Time last week, there are also serious divisions between the Opposition parties in relation to the Industry Commission. I remind the House that the purpose of the Industry Commission is basically to set up a very high-powered commission to consider various references in relation to industries to ensure that our industries are established in a framework which encourages efficiency, productivity and export activity. As I say, there are major divisions between the Liberal and National parties on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before us tonight is a Bill for an Act relating to duties of excise. I want to make a few comments about the matter of excise. Over the years governments have raised a significant proportion of their total revenue from excise, particularly from excises on petroleum products, LPG and also, if I might broadly describe it as an excise-I think it is broadly correct to do that-the crude oil levy, which is basically the levy collected on old oil which is still in production in Australia. There is a great deal of topical political debate about the amount of excise on fuel which is raised by Government and, in turn, the proportion of that excise which is spent on roads. Honourable members would be aware of various campaigns being run in Australia at present. The Australian Automobile Association (AAA), the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV) and the National Party-to which I will come in a moment-are proposing that the amount of excise raised on fuel and spent on roads be increased from 5c a litre to 7c a litre. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will have something to say about that in a moment when I quote what has been said in the Victorian State Parliament by some of the honourable member's colleagues who have a different view from him on what is National Party policy and what is coalition policy on this matter. Having seen the policies, I prefer to support the view expressed in the Victorian State Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to excise, I had some figures taken out the other day from the Budget Papers, the official Treasury papers which are provided each year at the time of the Budget. I will compare fuel taxes as a proportion of total government revenue over the last decade. I have taken out two lots of figures. The first are from 1978-79, a decade ago, and the second are the most recent figures, those for 1988-89. If we take into account the crude oil levy, LPG excise and petroleum product excise, the figures show that 10 years ago $2.24 billion was raised from total fuel taxes. The total Budget revenue at the time was $23.5 billion, so the percentage of total revenue which was raised by fuel taxes was 9.5 per cent; that was 10 years ago under the Fraser Government. In the last financial year, 1988-89, we raised $1.4 billion from crude oil levy and LPG excise and $5.05 billion from petroleum product excise, making a total fuel tax take of $6.4 billion. Total Budget revenue to the Commonwealth Government in 1988-89 was $82.3 billion. The percentage of total revenue raised by fuel taxes last year was 7.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Ten years ago under the Liberal Government, the percentage of total revenue raised by fuel taxes was 9.5 per cent, representing almost one dollar in 10. Last year under the Hawke Labor Government the percentage of total revenue raised by fuel taxes was 7.8 per cent, representing about one dollar in every 12 or 13 dollars. The point of that is that, as a proportion of total revenue, the Government is raising less money from fuel excise than was a former Liberal-National Party Government. So all of this rhetoric about excise and fuel taxes that we hear around the country as the National Party members stamp the bush, desperately seeking to win votes by pork-barrelling wherever they go, is just bunkum. It is absolute bunkum, because this Government is raising less revenue from fuel taxes and excise than did the previous Liberal-National Party Government. </PARA>

If he says that it is not right, he should qualify the statement and substantiate it in the House. It is straight out of the Budget Papers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, there is a more interesting statistic. Of the money we raise from fuel excise-from taxes on fuel-how much is being spent on roads? In 1981-82, the last year of the Liberal-National Party Government, it spent $735m on roads and raised $4.1 billion in fuel taxes. It spent on roads 18 per cent of what it raised in fuel taxes. Last year, in 1988-89, this Government spent $1.3 billion on roads, and it raised $6.4 billion-it spent 20.5 per cent of every dollar raised from fuel taxes on roads. We spent one dollar in five; the former Liberal-National Party Government spent one dollar in six. </PARA>
<PARA> That gets me to the point of the policies of the National Party, the Australian Automobile Association and the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria, which say that we should increase the amount of fuel excise being allocated to roads from 5c a litre to 7c a litre. That would mean another $500m a year for roads. I guess the first point to make about that is that, while the National Party is stumping around the bush everywhere in Australia selling this policy that more money is needed for roads and that it would increase the amount from 5c to 7c a litre, which would mean another $500m and everybody's Christmases coming at once, the fact is that in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan, its official policy document released earlier this month, there is not a mention of roads. The question arises: What happened to this commitment to increase the amount of money it would spend on roads from 5c to 7c a litre, that is, an increase of $500m? The fact is that the Opposition could not live up to its commitments. The Economic Action Plan gives no commitment at all to spend one extra cent on roads in Australia. The honourable member for Farrer hangs his head in shame because he knows it is true. He has spent the last three years going around the country misleading voters. He has been stamping around in the bush, trying the old pork barrel and suggesting that the Opposition will increase road funding from 5c to 7c a litre, that is, by an extra $500m.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will ensure that I keep my comments relevant to the Bill. As I indicated earlier in my remarks, it is a Bill that relates to duties of excise, and I am attempting to confine my remarks to this question of excise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was talking about how much of the excise raised should be allocated to roads. I believe that that is a legitimate issue for this Parliament. I was saying that two or three weeks ago in the Victorian State Parliament the National Party member for North Western Province said, as is recorded in Hansard, that it is the policy of the Federal Opposition to increase the amount of excise raised to be spent on roads from 5c to 7c a litre. That statement in Hansard was brought to my attention. In Bendigo I challenged that member to substantiate his statement. I said that, if he could not, he had misled the Parliament. In the Bendigo Advertiser, that National Party member for North Western Province conceded that he had misled the Parliament. Subsequently, on 16 November 1989, he admitted in the Parliament that in fact the Federal Opposition had no such policy in relation to road funding. I accused him of misleading the House and he conceded that he had done so. He has since said that the Federal Opposition has no such policy to increase road funding from 5c to 7c a litre. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to repeat the point that all around Australia Federal and State National Party members have been suggesting that an incoming coalition Government would increase road funding by $500m a year by allocating 7c a litre from fuel taxes. There is no such commitment in the Economic Action Plan, and the one National Party member of Parliament whom I accused of misleading the House has conceded that he did mislead Parliament-a very serious offence, indeed-and that there is in fact no Opposition policy to increase road funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I think all of us in this House need to attach an importance to the question of road funding. The road infrastructure of Australia has some problems, and the Parliament and the Government obviously should address that issue in the years to come. But the point I have made in this debate is that specious comments by the Opposition-comments made without substance and without policy support-suggesting that in government it will increase road funding by $500m a year have absolutely no foundation in fact. They have no place at all-not one mention-in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan, and, if we can ascertain anything from the Opposition over the last seven years or from our experience of it when in government, it is that the Opposition would be unlikely to deliver on any commitment like that. </PARA>

As the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) leaves the chamber, I wish to turn to his rhetoric on the excise duties that have been imposed by his Government. The 1989-90 Budget Papers show that forecast receipts from petroleum product excise are $5.6 billion, an amount which is quadruple the $1.3 billion of 1982-83, when the coalition left office. What this Government has done is move the taking of the tax from the well head to the pump. The taxes are now at the pump. Excise duties are imposed on every motorist who pulls up at the bowser. Motorists are now paying 23.152c per litre and that excise is indexed to inflation. We have this insidious set-up of the Labor Government continuing to tie things to the inflation rate. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) shakes his head. What is the inflation rate? It is again at record levels. In comparison with the rest of the world, the inflation rate in Australia is at record levels.

Previously the excise tax was tied to the price of crude oil and the cost was not carried through to the consumer. Now there is an excise on both natural gas and petroleum products that is tied at the pump to inflation. This means that the cost of every product that has to be delivered around this country and every input into industry is continually spiralling upwards because of the indexation at the bowser through the excise on fuel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bendigo was wrong. The Opposition does intend to increase the amount of funds that it will expend when it comes to government after the next election. The Opposition will increase by 2c a litre the amount of money spent on roads. The shame is that 23.5c per litre is being collected at the pump and yet only 5c to 6c of that money is being spent on roads. The roads of this nation are an absolute disgrace. I know that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy flies around in the new Falcon jets that the Federal Labor Government has just bought, and on occasions we have had to use them ourselves in the last six months because of the airline pilots strike. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to impress upon the Minister at the table that the Opposition is prepared to increase road funding. The roads are a disgrace. Today councillors from my electorate met with Minister Willis and I intend to meet with Minister Brown tomorrow. These people are from the central highlands area in my electorate of Maranoa. Councillor Gail Nixon is chairperson of the Bauhinia Shire Council and Councillor Ted Staal is Chairman of the Emerald Shire Council. They have brought along their engineer, who can prove that in central Queensland an extra $60m has to be spent simply to catch up with the disgraceful road system this Federal Labor Government has given us. There is not a decent road in this nation. Even the four-lane highways that have been built in the last few years are choked with traffic. The roads cannot handle it. </PARA>
<PARA> The subject of road funding is very important to us all. All electorates are influenced by the lack of funding. The Opposition will spend more money on roads. When I was a shadow Minister I spent a lot of time helping to formulate the Opposition's road funding policy, and I assure honourable members that there is a definite need for this sort of increase in funding. It is simply not good enough for this Government to continue to supertax the motorist. Even if proportionately the tax is lower than it was 10 years ago, it does not mean to say that it is right. No other section of taxpayers in this nation are paying the 8 per cent tax that is being paid by the motorists of Australia. It is supertaxing at its worst, something we do not need. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has very few competitive edges over the rest of the world-Minister Kerin should know that-but Australia is still self-sufficient in fuel, although only just. Australia may not remain self-sufficient in both LPG and petroleum oil under this tax regime. Australia imports and exports oil, but it continues to remain self-sufficient. Under this taxing regime there is no encouragement for oil companies to look for new deposits and that is something that both sides of the Parliament should be considering. Today there is not the amount of exploration taking place in Australia that there was five and 10 years ago and it is worrying that big companies such as Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd will not spend their money here. These companies go overseas and spend their money in offshore China and other parts of the world. This is very bad for the nation. These companies should be given encouragement to look for more fuel deposits. I have always argued that the sort of taxation that is imposed on the oil industry is ridiculous. Australia is a huge nation which relies on roads to transport everything, including produce to the ports for export. It is ridiculous that Australia is locked into this sort of taxation system. In addition, Labor has locked us into indexation of excise taxes. Under the present regime Australia will never get out of it. The only way to get out of it is to get the Labor Party out of government, and the sooner the better. </PARA>
<PARA> On Saturday there is a State election in Queensland. I want to tell the people of the nation that, under the National Party Government, Queensland is the only State that has no extra fuel tax. Every other State applies a fuel tax to collect more revenue. I urge every Queenslander to vote for the National Party in Queensland on Saturday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can hear the Labor Party members getting excited. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) is getting a bit excited about my comments on taxation in Queensland. Queensland is the lowest taxed State in Australia and we pay no fuel taxes. All the Labor States-New South Wales, which pays 6c, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia-are paying State fuel taxes. It is a disgrace. They cannot help themselves; they continue to tax people out of existence. Queenslanders pay no fuel tax at State level, and I impress upon them the need to vote for the National Party in Queensland on Saturday. It is most important that Queensland maintain a progressive National-Liberal Party coalition in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is all about LPG, and the electorate of Maranoa produces a great deal of LPG from the small town of Wallumbilla. The Queensland Premier, Mr Russell Cooper, resides close to the village of Wallumbilla. Under the progressive National Party Government in Queensland a new LPG gas pipeline is about to be opened. No other State in Australia is building a continental pipeline. I know that there is a big development offshore in Western Australia, but there is no other onshore development taking place. The Queensland Government has built this pipeline. I have had conversations with Trevor Bird, who is the project manager of a company called SIAPEM. It is expected that this project, which runs from Wallumbilla to Gladstone, will be completed on 17 December. This is the kind of constructive, progressive project that the Queensland National Party Government has continued to encourage to help the prosperity of the great State of Queensland. Bridge Oil, the producing company, has signed a 10-year contract with ICI to produce approximately one billion cubic metres of LPG per year. This gas will be used to make sodium cyanide in Gladstone, which in turn will be used to refine Australia's gold products. The Labor Government has introduced a gold tax, which will hinder the production of gold. In the last few weeks the price of gold has increased by $20 or $30. The gold industry is booming in this country and yet the Labor Party has introduced a tax on gold. </PARA>
<PARA> This project has a cyclical effect; one project has a carry-on effect on many projects. This is the kind of free enterprise development that over the last 32 years the Queensland National Party Government has continued to encourage, and intends to continue for the next 32 years in conjunction with the Liberal Party in coalition. We will remain in government for the next 32 years and continue to encourage these sorts of projects. All sorts of soothsayers have given all sorts of outcomes to Saturday's election, but the National Party will be up there. The commentators and the press bogies said exactly the same thing at the last election. At the last election they said that the Bjelke-Petersen Government could not govern in its own right and the National Party swept into office and will do the same on Saturday. </PARA>
<PARA> About 6,000 tonnes of propane and butane are being produced from LPG at the Wallumbilla plant and used internally in Queensland. These are the sorts of projects that are being encouraged by the National Party Government in Queensland. Without that support from the National Party, Queensland would not have these sorts of projects under way. That Party has done a fantastic job in all sorts of resource development. Queensland is still the fastest growing State in Australia. More people are moving each week to Queensland than any other State. They are leaving Victoria and New South Wales in droves and crossing the border to live in the sunshine State under the progressive National Party Government. We welcome them and the money they bring to invest. Queensland is a very large State. The area of the Maranoa electorate is 700,000 square kilometres and people in cotton growing, coal mining and gas and oil exploration continue to move north and pour their money into the resources in Queensland. This is something that the National Party Government encourages. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently no large amount of finance or extensive amendments are contained in the Bill. I guess that it is good for the people to hear that no new taxes are involved and that only small amendments are being made to the Act to enable the ACT Government to impose a small excise on gas. I would like to sum up by saying that fuel costs are very important to the farming community in Maranoa. In the 15-year period from 1970 to 1984, farm costs rose 355 per cent or an increase in real terms of 20 per cent after discounting for inflation. Increases in excise do not affect most producers because they do not pay it but the cost of transportation of goods and parts is the cause of a large proportion of their increased costs and the costs paid by small manufacturing businesses and small business generally in rural Australia. In contrast, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics index of prices received by farmers has increased by 203 per cent over that period, which is a fall in real terms of 22 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is good that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is in the chamber because I am sure that he understands something about the cost-price squeeze from which farmers in this country continue to suffer. There has been a massive decline in real terms in wool sales. Our wheat prices have improved somewhat but they are still below the inflation rate, which is very sad for us. The balance between what farmers pay in costs and what they receive in prices, generally described as their terms of trade, has deteriorated in the 15-year period by 42 per cent. This results from increased costs of fuel, including LPG, which they use for drying grain in many cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst problem across Australia today is the massively high interest rates. We are expected to produce goods and to export and compete with the rest of the world. Is it any wonder that our balance of trade runs at $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion a month? Why would anybody want to borrow money in this country? Why do farmers and corporations go overseas to borrow money? The interest rate in Japan is 4 per cent, in Europe it is 8 per cent and in Australia it is up to 25 per cent. It is an absolute disgrace. The Treasurer comes into the House almost every day trying to justify his monetary policy. Certainly interest rates have been that high previously--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill has already been passed by the Senate and introduced into this House. This Bill will enable the completion of this Government's major and innovative reforms over the last two years to modernise the legislation which governs the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to streamline and enhance its administration and management. The Bill represents one of the most significant initiatives in policing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Far-reaching proposals of the nature contained in this Bill are normally not easily accepted by the persons they will affect. It is, I believe, indicative of the sense of commitment to effective law enforcement in Australia that the membership of the Australian Federal Police, and the Australian Federal Police Association (AFPA) have accepted the changes outlined in the Bill. I join the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) in taking this opportunity to congratulate both the Association and its members and to restate the commitment of the Government to the development of the Australian Federal Police not only as the premier law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth but as one that can be looked up to throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been some concerns expressed as to the potentially wider implication of these proposals for other public sector employment. My colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) has confirmed that during the discussions that led to this Bill those particular concerns were canvassed. He has stated that fixed term appointment in the Australian Federal Police is a response to a set of unique circumstances and should not be seen in any way as providing a basis for moves to fixed term contract employment in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police is the Commonwealth's premier law enforcement agency. At the national level, the Australian Federal Police will be an investigative agency with a proactive focus. The Australian Federal Police has, in recent years, been shedding non-investigative functions, such as guarding diplomatic premises, so that it can concentrate on its investigative role in relation to the fight against drug trafficking, organised crime and fraud against the Commonwealth. This Government is also concerned to ensure that, while the Australian Federal Police continues to develop to meet the everchanging challenges confronting it, its administration and operations continue to maintain the highest standards of effectiveness, public accountability and integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> In January this year the Government implemented the career structure review of the Australian Federal Police through major amendments to the Australian Federal Police regulations. Those amendments:</PARA>
<PARA>broadbanded the rank structure to reduce the number of ranks from nine to five;</PARA>
<PARA>removed the barriers to promotion on merit and accelerated advancement by removing certain eligibility prerequisites for promotion;</PARA>
<PARA>ended the role of seniority in relation to promotions at any rank;</PARA>
<PARA>allowed lateral entry to ranks above constable in certain circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA>streamlined the procedures relating to promotion and promotion appeals;</PARA>
<PARA>provided for the appointment of non-citizens on probation; and</PARA>
<PARA>allowed persons who are appointed as constables, sergeants and superintendents to be paid at greater than base salary level. </PARA>
<PARA>While the Australian Federal Police currently has high educational standards, these amendments to the Australian Federal Police regulations will facilitate the achievement of even higher standards to enable it to respond even more effectively to the ever increasing sophistication of criminal activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Act 1989 was enacted in the autumn sittings of the Parliament. That Act inserted part va into the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. Part va provides for existing and former police members of the Australian Federal Police to lose certain superannuation rights and benefits if convicted of an offence involving corruption and sentenced to life imprisonment or a term of imprisonment longer than 12 months or, if a police member is found guilty of a relevant disciplinary offence and dismissed from the Australian Federal Police, as a penalty for that offence. </PARA>
<PARA>A Unified Work Force</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) provides for the creation of a unified work force. As far as is practicable, all AFP personnel-police and staff members-will be employed under the Australian Federal Police Act rather than utilising officers of the Australian Public Service who are currently appointed or employed under the Public Service Act 1922. Hitherto only police members have been appointed under the Australian Federal Police Act. This change is regarded as crucial to the long term development of the Australian Federal Police because it will greatly improve the Commissioner's flexibility in determining the overall staffing composition of the Australian Federal Police and the utilisation of its employees, both staff and police, effectively. It will also enable, wherever possible, that positions which do not require police powers be filled by staff members which will result in a better utilisation of scarce police resources. Another benefit is that it will allow the development of a professional and dedicated work force which is purpose-designed for the unique task of Federal law enforcement. Also it will be a work force which is structured to encourage the sharing of a common purpose and set of values. </PARA>
<PARA> Upon commencement of the legislation, existing Public Service Act staff will be offered fixed term appointments as staff members of the Australian Federal Police under the Australian Federal Police Act. Alternatively, they will be able to take advantage of the mobility provisions of the Public Service Act. If they choose to be appointed to the Australian Federal Police under the Australian Federal Police Act they will retain their mobility rights within the Public Service for their first term. At the end of that term they will have the choice of electing to be credited with the accumulated adjustment payment-this is the payment to be made in recognition of fixed term employment and which I will later describe in more detail-or they may choose to return to the Australian Public Service. All police members will be taken to have been appointed under the fixed term system provided for by the Bill unless they notify the Commissioner that they wish to resign from the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides the Commissioner with chief executive powers in relation to the composition of the Australian Federal Police and the terms and conditions of service of police members-other than himself-and of staff members. The Commissioner is given the power to determine terms and conditions for all members and staff members subject to the Minister giving the Commissioner general policy guidelines. In relation to members who are not deputy commissioners, senior executive commissioned police officers or senior executive officers, the Industrial Relations Commission will continue to determine most terms and conditions through awards. There are certain limits on the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission because of the Government's recognition of the unique nature of the Australian Federal Police as a disciplined force comprising police and staff members. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Commissioner will be provided with chief executive powers over the terms and conditions of employment of the force, staff members' employment-other than senior executive level staff members-will continue generally to be governed by Industrial Relations Commission awards. In addition, on such employment aspects as promotions and invalidity retirement, staff members will retain the right of appeal to the Merit Protection and Review Agency which will have a recommendatory power in relation to the Commissioner's decisions in these areas; the MPRA will also be given a recommendatory review role for Senior Executive Service level non-appealable promotions. In respect of disciplinary matters, staff members will have the right of appeal to the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal now afforded to members. In respect of general non-economic grievance matters, staff members, like police members, will have recourse to an AFP review panel especially established for that purpose. The panel will make recommendations to the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill abolishes tenure and replaces it with a fixed term appointment system for all police members, including deputy commissioners, and staff members of the Australian Federal Police. The very nature of policing lends itself to a fixed term tenure system. The stress of policing often leads to burnout among members who do not want or cannot progress to management positions. The fixed term appointment system will enable police members and staff members to leave the Australian Federal Police and enable the Commissioner not to reappoint police members or staff members who are not performing at the required level. There will be an administrative appraisal system to recommend whether a police member or a staff member should be reappointed on the completion of a term appointment. It is noteworthy that the report of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct has also recommended that term and contract appointments be introduced for the Queensland Police Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the entitlement to an adjustment payment which recognises the fact that the person's appointment is for a fixed term. The Australian Federal Police adjustment payment will be 12 1/2 per cent of accumulated salary over the period of the police member's or staff member's fixed term appointment or appointments, on the basis that it will be treated as an eligible termination payment. Police members or staff members will not be eligible for the adjustment payment where they resign from the Australian Federal Police prior to the end of their terms of appointment or where police members or staff members have their appointments annulled during the period of their probationary service. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also contains amendments to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981, the Superannuation Act 1976, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989, the Industrial Relations Act 1988, the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984 and the Public Service Act 1922 as a consequence of the restructuring of the Australian Federal Police by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Currently the Australian Federal Police incurs very high invalidity costs. With the introduction of the unified work force there will be greater flexibility for redeployment of staff under the Comcare arrangements. Additionally, members will have the opportunity at the end of their fixed term appointments to make career changes with the financial support offered by the accumulated adjustment scheme, thereby avoiding the stress related illness so common in the force. Future cost benefits will accrue from reduction in invalidities and the absence of retrenchments provisions in the Australian Federal Police Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police adjustment scheme payments will be in the order of $5.4m, in current dollar terms, in the year 2020, based on an AFPAS payment of 12 1/2 per cent of a police member's or a staff member's accumulated salary. This payment will be taxed as an eligible termination payment. The first significant payment of AFPAS, estimated at $0.8m, will occur in 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA> Before concluding, I foreshadow an amendment to the Australian Protective Service Act 1987 to be moved by the Government during the committee stage of the debate. The amendment, which has been provided to the Opposition, includes in the list of legislation in respect of which Australian Protective Service officers can exercise power of arrest the following Acts; the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963, the Crimes (Hijacking of Aircraft) Act 1972, and the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973. The amendment is consequent upon the restructuring of the Australian Federal Police. It is designed to enable the Australian Federal Police to continue shedding its non-investigative functions and thus concentrate on its main task of being the Commonwealth's primary investigative agency. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments will enable Australian Protective Service officers to perform security functions at airports which in the past have been performed by the Australian Federal Police. The proposed amendments empowered only the Australian Protective Service and have no budgetary impact. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) introduces a form of fixed term contracts of employment in the Australian Federal Police (AFP). It applies to police officers and also to public servants employed in the AFP. It is therefore a significant Bill. I say at the outset that the Opposition supports it. We have been following developments on this Bill and the proposals contained in it for several months as negotiations have progressed between the Government and the Australian Federal Police Association (AFPA). The upshot of these negotiations is that the AFPA now supports the Bill, although from time to time it has, as is well known, had its reservations about parts of it. The 13 other unions represented in the Australian Federal Police, including the Public Service unions, as we understand it, oppose the Bill because it is one step towards contract employment and, to put it in the manner in which I understand that they do put it, they say that this is the thin end of the wedge towards contract employment, to which they are of course opposed. We take the view that, if the principal union supports the proposal and these other unions are opposed to it, then it almost certainly has at least a reasonable amount to commend it. We believe that the Bill has merit, and we ask the other unions-that is, other than the AFPA-to think again before they continue with their opposition, if they do propose to continue to oppose this proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has just told us, the Bill is part of the modernisation of the Australian Federal Police and it follows on from the career structure review that took place earlier this year, which, it will be recalled, introduced broadbanding of ranks, merit promotion and other reforms designed to make the Australian Federal Police a more modern, efficient and effective police force. Coming in the wake of those reforms, the Government now wishes to introduce two more major reforms, which in fact it does via this Bill. The first of these reforms is to put all Australian Federal Police personnel, both police officers and public servants, under the Australian Federal Police Act. This is desirable, as the Government says, in order to obtain flexibility in determining the overall complement of the Australian Federal Police because the Commissioner will be able to adjust the numbers respectively of police officers and public servants-those that are needed from time to time as the functions of the AFP change in response to current situations. That is the first reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reform is to abolish permanency of employment and replace that with a form of fixed term contract of employment. Police officers presently employed in the Australian Federal Police will be given an option: take a fixed term appointment or resign. Public servants, employed under a different statute at the moment, now working in the AFP will have a choice of a fixed term appointment like the police officers or will be made subject to the mobility provisions of the Public Service Act. In other words, they will be able to go back into the mainstream of the Public Service, if that is what they wish. </PARA>
<PARA> The justification for fixed term appointments is that they give flexibility in managing the force. The needs of a police force change from time to time and management has to have the flexibility to bring in officers with the skills that are needed and to be free of officers without those skills, those who have suffered burn-out and those who have lost their enthusiasm or efficiency. Under the present system, those who are incapable of being promoted or who do not want to be promoted must be kept on in employment because they have virtual permanency of employment. The system proposed in the Bill is that police officers and public servants in the Australian Federal Police will be on fixed term appointments which will be renewed, but they will be renewed only if the employees are efficient, productive and honest. If their appointments are not renewed at the end of their fixed term contracts, then the employees will receive, by way of compensation for not having had their contracts renewed, an adjustment payment of 12 1/2 per cent of their accumulated salary over the term of the contract. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner will have power to fix the terms and conditions of employment, but it will not be an unbridled power because it will be subject to general policy guidelines given by the Minister. We are told that these guidelines will require adherence to the national wage case guidelines and the statutory authority coordination arrangements. By this means, what are referred to as `most terms and conditions' will continue to be determined in effect by the Industrial Relations Commission through awards. A common award is proposed to be put before the Industrial Relations Commission, and the terms and conditions set out in that common award will be those that will apply across the body of the police force. </PARA>
<PARA> However-and we would maintain that it is a step in the right direction-the terms and conditions of the higher ranks of deputy commissioners, senior executive commissioned police officers who are commanders and assistant commissioners, and senior executive public servants, are expressly removed from the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission and will be determined by the Commissioner. So the Commissioner, in the case of those higher ranks and the higher echelons of the Public Service, will have virtually an unfettered discretion in determining the terms and conditions applying to those employees. There is also power to make temporary appointments of up to 12 months, and this should add to the flexibility to be achieved by these changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is largely consistent with the Opposition's industrial relations policy. However, before I move to that point, I say in passing that from reading this Bill it is extremely difficult to work out exactly what is being done. I know that it is a trend that has been adopted by the Commonwealth parliamentary draftsmen in a Bill of this sort to make a whole host of amendments, and it would seem to me very useful for the reader and those who have to use Bills passed by this House to have the whole structure set out in the one piece of legislation. I hope that can be done on future occasions. The present Bill is a very good example of how just simply reading what is in effect a series of amendments makes it extremely difficult to work out what exactly is going on. However, with the assistance of the second reading speech and a very useful briefing I have had on the subject, I have been able to ascertain the effect of the Bill, and on the basis of that understanding, as I have already said, the Opposition supports the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill introduces reforms consistent with the Opposition parties' industrial relations policy-and that is another point in favour of the Bill. Clause 1.15 of our industrial relations policy, on the issue of public employment, says:</PARA>
<PARA>We will adopt practices in the Commonwealth public sector that will set an example in the pursuit of flexible and harmonious workplace relations. </PARA>
<PARA>Our industrial relations policy also provides that we will adopt:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a more flexible, market-oriented approach to industrial relations in the area of Commonwealth employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Our public administration policy provides that:</PARA>
<PARA>In some cases, it may be appropriate to move certain classes of employees outside award coverage altogether. This could be done through the use of voluntary agreements as set out in our Industrial Relations Policy. </PARA>
<PARA>It will be seen, therefore, that the Bill is largely consistent with our policy, and I commend the Government for seeing the light in this regard and adopting the thrust of reforms to industrial relations in this country which we have been advocating for some time. It is interesting to reflect back only a couple of years when the sorts of notions provided for in the Bill and in our industrial relations policy were pooh-poohed. I think that is the term; certainly they were derided. In fact, when we first started talking about the need for flexibility in employment I can remember Mr Simon Crean saying that there already was flexibility in the industrial relations system. Of course, that was completely false, because it was then, as it still is largely now, a rigid, centralised, compulsory industrial relations system which, certainly at the level of Commonwealth Government employment, provided no flexibility, no scope, even on the most remote interpretation of the law, and no opportunity at all for anything remotely approximating contracts of employment for fixed terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The industrial relations debate has moved as a result of the Opposition's initiative. It is true that there has been generally increasing and expanding support for and acceptance of the proposition that there is a need for more flexibility in employment and, in particular, in the terms of employment. Certainly there is a need for a flexibility that enables managers to manage. This Bill is a very good example of it because behind it is a proposal to allow the chief manager, namely, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, to manage his police force and not to be rigidly fixed and stuck with old-fashioned forms of employment, permanency of employment, burdened with employees who he believes are not appropriate in some cases to be promoted and who indeed, in fairness to them, in some cases do not wish to be promoted. That is really the basic notion behind this Bill. It is a commitment to flexibility in employment, particularly in terms and conditions of employment. We commend the Government for accepting and taking up the cause of flexibility in employment that we have advocated now for several years. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, it is really not surprising that some of the old-fashioned trade unions have gone into orbit about the proposals contained in this Bill and are very annoyed at the Australian Labor Party for having promoted them and accepted them. In fact, they are quite furious about it and they will take their revenge, I think, at the earliest possible opportunity on those who they believe are responsible. But the Australian Federal Police Association, being the union which is closest to the workface in this area of employment, sees the value of the proposals and, subject to some qualifications and reservations, supports them. It deserves every credit for that. </PARA>
<PARA> The fixed term appointments proposed by the Bill are not contracts in the strict sense of that expression; they are really fixed term appointments. In the case of constables, sergeants and superintendents, they are really a form of hybrid appointment with terms and conditions which are fixed mostly by awards, despite the fact that the employment created is not permanent employment but employment for a fixed term. Only the term of the appointment itself and the adjustment payment will be fixed by means other than the award-that is, by determination made by the Commissioner. The scope for an individual police officer or public servant to negotiate his or her own terms of employment-which I am sure many of them would like to do-is necessarily limited. However, it is commendable that the senior ranks of commanders, assistant commissioners and deputy commissioners and the senior executive public servants will have contracts which will be capable of variation in their terms from officer to officer. As such, the Bill is a step forward because it does away with permanency of employment and requires performance or termination. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer specifically to proposed new section 39d in this context because it is an interesting sidelight on the argument about industrial relations. In effect it excises certain matters from the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission and prevents the Commission from having regard to certain matters. I mention it not just because of its own merits but because it is in effect a very convenient admission that the Opposition's industrial relations policy can be applied. One of the arguments that have always been put against our industrial relations policy is that, if one has areas of employment where there are fixed terms and terms of employment separate from those applying under awards, one will have a wages break-out and everyone in employment will want what has been agreed upon in this particular area of employment. We have said that one can always prevent the Industrial Relations Commission from looking at those particular areas and at the terms and conditions that apply in them. It is not compulsory for the Industrial Relations Commission to look at those areas. One can quarantine them by legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has always derided that and said that it just cannot be done. Lo and behold, what do we find in this Bill, in proposed new section 39d, but a proposition that a number of matters are in fact deemed by the legislation not to be matters pertaining to the relationship between employer and employee. That is a quite extraordinary proposition although, as I have said, one I agree with. It is extraordinary coming from this Government and the Government deserves double praise, in my view, for being prepared to make such an admission, a concession that some matters on the surface appear to touch on the relationship between an employer and employee but nevertheless can be excised from the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission, by that means forcing the Industrial Relations Commission to concentrate on its own patch-that is, to concentrate on those incidents of employment between employers and employees who are in fact subject to the centralised system-and to leave alone those who do not want to be part of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, under proposed new section 39d the Bill tells us that `the terms and conditions of service of a member mentioned in paragraph 6 (2) (b)' and I interpolate to say that they are deputy commissioners, `or (c)', and I interpolate to say that they are senior executive commissioned officers, are not matters `pertaining to the relationship between an employer and employee for the purposes of the definition of ``industrial dispute'' ' under the Industrial Relations Act. The Bill goes on to refer to matters arising under section 26e, which are those matters relating to what happens at the end of appointments, when the term of appointment comes to an end. The Bill tells us that those matters again are not matters pertaining to the relationship between employers and employees for the purposes of the Industrial Relations Commission Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is commendable that that is there. We give it three out of three-10 ticks if necessary-because it is a very healthy and resolute proposal. It makes it perfectly plain to us that what we have said all along is absolutely correct, that is, that one can excise various aspects of employment relating to people who are not subject to the centralised system and one can lawfully say to the Industrial Relations Commission, `Keep to your own patch and leave these other people alone'. That is what we say should be done in larger areas of industrial relations. That same proposed section 39d goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Industrial Relations Commission must not, in exercising any of its powers in relation to an industrial dispute or industrial issue, take into account any entitlement of a member or staff member to an adjustment payment. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Attorney-General has been explaining, when the term of appointment of a police officer comes to an end and the contract is not renewed he or she is paid an adjustment payment of 12 1/2 per cent of salary by way of compensation. We find in this proposed section the proposition that the Industrial Relations Commission must not take that into account. It is quite clear, on what this very Bill says-I presume the Bill is valid-that it is lawful to say to the Industrial Relations Commission, `Do not have regard to what has been agreed upon in a separate area outside your own patch. Stick to your own patch and leave others alone to do their own bargains'. That is what the Bill says in these proposed sections. It should say that and it does. That is commendable. We give the Government full marks for putting such a provision into the Bill and we say in addition to that, that the provision should be applied in other areas of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, we believe, taking all of these circumstances into account, that we should recognise the Bill as a moderate advance towards contract employment. We therefore support it. I should add, however, that we will be watching very closely the administration of this Bill when it becomes law because the Australian Federal Police Association has had reservations about it. To its credit, the Association supports the Bill but there have been reservations along the road of negotiations. We will be watching the matters which have concerned the AFPA and which that organisation has brought to our attention, and my attention in particular. For instance, we will be watching, as closely as we are allowed to watch, the workings of the internal review proceedings which will be used when decisions are made as to whether a police officer's contract will be renewed or whether a public servant's contract will be renewed. That review process is not set out in the Bill. It will not be in the law; it will be set up by administrative decree. We will be watching closely to ensure that that structure of review is administered and applied fairly and reasonably. We will expect that both the Australian Federal Police and the Government will administer these new arrangements fairly, bearing in mind that they will, after all, be dealing with nothing less than individuals, with their careers and their livelihoods. </PARA>
<PARA> We will also be watching the workings of this whole proposed new structure, because it is new for the Federal Police and it is new for the civil service as a whole. We commend the Government for proceeding with this first tentative step, but we will be watching it closely to ensure that it is all administered and applied fairly. </PARA>
<PARA> To save some time later on the Attorney-General has foreshadowed an amendment that the Government will be moving to the Bill. We will support that amendment. It deals with the Australian Protective Service and, in effect, gives responsibility for security at airports to the Australian Protective Service rather than the Australian Federal Police so that the Australian Federal Police can get on with its real work of investigation, particularly of serious major Federal crime. That is what the Federal Police should be doing. We support the Government's proposal to take away one area of its more mundane work and give that to the Australian Protective Service. Our law and justice policy states:</PARA>
<PARA>In consultation and co-operation with the States, the responsibility for, and level of, security at major ports and airports will be re-examined so that the most effective service is provided and that the best possible use is made of the available physical and financial resources. </PARA>
<PARA>That policy still stands, but we will support the Government on this amendment. We will be watching closely the administration of this change in responsibilities. I would have thought that the amendment would have said exactly that-that henceforth, or words to that effect, security over airports will be the responsibility of the Australian Protective Service. But the amendment gives only the power of arrest to the Australian Protective Service. I understand from the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) that the reason why the Bill is confined in that way is that that really is the only legislative provision that has to be changed. The rest of it is done by imperial fiat, administrative decree or some other internal mechanism. I presume that is the way in which it is done. We understand the intent of what is proposed by the Attorney-General and we will support the amendment to the Bill that he has foreshadowed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My comments will be very brief, which is just as well, given the length of the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown). For the moment I simply want to deal with the issue of fixed term appointments, which the honourable member spoke about at length. The Government considers that the nature of policing lends itself to a fixed term tenure and stresses that policing involves quite a lot of stress and sometimes leads to burn-out. So, there is justification for having fixed term appointments in the police force and extending that to civilian staff members of the Australian Federal Police. An administrative appraisal system has been established to recommend whether a police member or a staff member should be reappointed on the completion of a term of appointment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Menzies mentioned, there was considerable concern about that provision within the Public Sector Union and other public sector unions because security of tenure, permanence of tenure, is a central principle of Public Service personnel policy. Because of that concern, the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) have included in their speeches the fact that fixed term appointments in the Australian Federal Police are a response to a set of unique circumstances and should not be seen in any way as providing a basis for moves to fixed term contract employment in other areas. I underline those comments. They clearly corral this decision to the police. There are no implications for the Public Service; they are not a precedent in any way for any other part of the Public Service or the public sector. There certainly has been much concern about that decision throughout the Public Service, but that comment I have quoted from the Minister was included in his statement after colleagues and I went to see him to pass on those concerns. He was, in turn, concerned to state publicly that this decision does not have any implications for the rest of the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Service of course is a career service. Permanence is one of the central principles which allow maintenance of an impartial Public Service. Security of tenure gives public servants the assurance that they can advise Ministers fearlessly without threat to their positions. Security of tenure is an important principle for a Public Service free from partisanship. That is not to say that public servants should not have views or values. They must do so not only to be effective public servants but also to be mature human beings. But they do not have to have a party allegiance to receive senior promotions as public servants do in the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> Job security is one of the central principles of that career with the Public Service. I was rather surprised at the cavalier way in which the honourable member for Menzies rather snidely said that because Public Service unions had expressed concern about fixed term appointments the proposal must be all right. This is surprising, for his comment neglects the traditions of the Westminster system of government, which is the origin of our system and which I would have expected him to support strongly. Nevertheless, the Government has guaranteed that this Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) does not set a precedent for changing that principle in the Public Service. Given that guarantee, I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), which will allow the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to determine terms and conditions and introduce fixed term employment for all employees of the AFP. That has been previously addressed particularly by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). He has explained in some detail what all that means.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The idea for the formation of a Federal police force was conceived, as most good ideas are, in Queensland. It was during the campaign for conscription during the First World War that the then Prime Minister, Billy Hughes, decided to form the AFP. When researching this I was very interested to find this out. It was in the town of Warwick on the Darling Downs in Queensland on 29 November 1917 at the local railway station where Billy Hughes had stopped to address the local community on the Yes case for the forthcoming referendum that someone in the crowd threw an egg at him and knocked his hat off. Mr Hughes demanded that the local police sergeant arrest the person concerned. Apparently, the local policeman was not taken with Mr Hughes and suggested that the incident was not all that serious. Mr Hughes demanded action but it was not forthcoming. Mr Hughes decided that the answer was to establish a Federal police body that was answerable to those in Canberra and not to any State government. </PARA>
<PARA> Employees of the AFP can be divided into three categories: the Commissioner, members of the AFP and support staff. The terms and conditions differ for each group. The Commissioner is employed for a fixed term contract for a maximum of seven years and is eligible for reappointment. The second group consists of the other members of the AFP and the terms and conditions for this group are determined in accordance with the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. At present it provides for agreements between the appropriate Minister and the relevant staff association, the Australian Federal Police Association-the AFPA-and establishes a tribunal to arbitrate on most disagreements, although certain matters, such as appointments, discipline and dismissals, are excluded from arbitration. The final group comprises the `civilian' support staff for the AFP. Section 16 of the principal Act provides that these staff are to be appointed and employed under the Public Service Act 1922. </PARA>
<PARA> The far-reaching proposals contained in this Bill are normally not easily accepted by the staff who are going to be affected. Clause 6 will amend section 6 of the principal Act to define staff members of the AFP as employees who are not police officers. Section 17 of the principal Act will be amended to provide for fixed term contracts, with a maximum term of five years and with occupants eligible for re-appointment, for deputy commissioners of the AFP. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make some comments on the work of the Federal Police. Although drug and fraud inquiries are more prominent, investigative areas of general investigations constitute a substantial part of the AFP's workload. In the past year alone 1,222 inquiries were undertaken and at 30 June 1989 539 investigations were still in progress. With State and Territory police forces, and the Attorney-General's Department, the AFP participates in the development of common police services with a view to ensuring that a cohesive and coordinated effort is maintained in countering criminal threats and activities against the Australian community. The AFP, through its role of providing advice to the Attorney-General on law enforcement issues, actively participates in discussion of matters under consideration by the Ministers through participation in senior officers' group meetings of the Australian Police Ministers Council. </PARA>
<PARA> A major program evaluation study was introduced during the financial year 1989-90. This study was an effectiveness evaluation of the additional staff levels provided by the Government in the first force development program, which increased the average staff level of the AFP by over 294 over the three years from 1985 to 1988, and the projected effectiveness of the second three-year program. The study concluded that there was increasing productivity and effectiveness in the AFP and, in view of this effectiveness, the bid for additional staff in the remaining two years of the second program was justified. Regionalisation was introduced in the first half of the calendar year 1988. It is the organisational structure adopted by the AFP to meet the objective to continue to improve the quality and responsiveness of police services provided in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of drug trafficking, AFP investigations focus mainly on identifying and prosecuting principal offenders involved in the importations of illicit drugs. Drug operations depend increasingly upon useful intelligence. Continued efforts to improve the quality and timely dissemination of intelligence have proved a significant factor in a number of seizures involving the importation or attempted importation of large quantities of drugs. The wide spread of anti-drug activity by the AFP includes operations involving more than one region, while the Drug Operations Branch in Canberra coordinates national AFP investigations and associated international inquiries. Recent developments in the area of drug policing have included the introduction of a fully computerised system for reporting drug seizures and related arrests. It is believed that this system will enhance intelligence capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Organised Crime Branch, within the Drugs and Special Operations Division, is responsible for investigating major organised criminal activity, particularly as it affects the laws and interests of the Commonwealth. The branch has operational arms in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, with the main focus of its investigations relating to large scale drug importing organisations. It is hoped that recent Commonwealth legislation will increase the branch's effectiveness by stripping individuals of the profits of their criminal behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> The investigation of fraud against the Commonwealth is conducted in all States and Territories by the AFP and relates to fraud against expenditure and revenue. As part of measures designed to reduce fraudulent activity, the AFP has been involved in reducing fraud committed within Commonwealth departments and agencies. The recommendations contained in the review of systems for dealing with fraud on the Commonwealth, which was undertaken in 1987, have increased monitoring by Commonwealth departments of vulnerable areas where fraudulent activities may occur. A recent innovation is the formation of a fraud intelligence group to provide an effective intelligence arm to the Fraud and General Crime Division. The group will specifically collect information on national and international fraud-related matters and become the AFP's central repository for holding such information. </PARA>
<PARA> The year 1988-89 saw the creation of the Special Assignments Branch. This branch is responsible for undertaking highly sensitive investigations of a national character or those not normally catered for by the AFP. In addition, the branch targets areas of suspected internal corruption and can employ specialised resources within the investigations department which are unavailable to the Internal Investigation Division. During the past year this branch undertook a number of tasks, which included leading a team of a United Nations sponsored survey of internal security problems within refugee camps on the Thailand-Kampuchea border. As a result of this survey a report was submitted to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Bangkok. The United Nations border relief operations subsequently sought and obtained the services of police representatives from Australia, the United Kingdom, Sweden and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police is the Commonwealth's premier law enforcement agency. At the national level, the Australian Federal Police will be an investigative agency with a proactive focus. This Bill will enable the completion of this Government's major and innovative reforms over the past two years to modernise the legislation which governs the Australian Federal Police to streamline and enhance its administration and management. As mentioned, reaction from the various staff associations represented in the AFP has been varied. The constructive comments by these associations have been welcomed by the Government and those responsible are to be congratulated. This Government is concerned to ensure that the Australian Federal Police continues to develop to meet the everchanging challenges confronting it. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for the creation of a unified work force. As far as is practicable, all AFP personnel-police and staff members-will be employed under the Australian Federal Police Act rather than utilising officers of the Australian Public Service. With the introduction of the new fixed term appointment employment system and unified work force for the Australian Federal Police, it can be confidently expected that the flexible deployment avenues which will then be opened up will substantially reduce the AFPs present high invalidity. Future cost benefits will accrue from the introduction of these proposals and the non-requirement for the retrenchment provisions in the AFP Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police adjustment scheme payment will be in the order of $5.4m in current dollar terms in the year 2020, based on an AFPAS payment of 12.5 per cent of a member's or staff member's accumulated salary. This payment will be taxed as an eligible termination payment. The first significant payment of AFPAS, which is estimated at $800,000, will occur in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to offer my congratulations to the Australian Federal Police and its Association on their work throughout many years and I wish them well for the future. As I mentioned earlier, I am pleased to have the opportunity to support this Bill and the associated amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will not be a surprise to honourable members to know that on Saturday an election will be held in Queensland. It is hardly newsworthy that the National Party of Australia is having some difficulty in this State election. It was reported on Brisbane television tonight that the latest poll conducted by the Ten network places the Australian Labor Party's prime vote in the Brisbane metropolitan area at 56 per cent and at 51 per cent in the balance of Queensland and the country areas. That is obviously an indication that Labor is heading for a landslide victory in Queensland. Given the corruption which is rife in the Queensland Government, the revelations of the Fitzgerald inquiry, and the shoddy standard of that Government, it is hardly surprising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also hardly surprising that the National Party has had some difficulty in finding what we might fairly describe as quality candidates to represent it. Indeed, in a number of State seats within my Federal electorate, there is a quite unusual range of National Party candidates who have achieved nomination. The State seat of Caboolture is held by Mr Ken Hayward for the Labor Party. The National Party candidate is a gentleman by the name of Roy Rogers. He is campaigning under the slogan that Roy `makes things happen'. He might make things happen, but he does not pay for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Courier-Mail and other local newspapers have now revealed that Mr Rogers over the last two years has incurred court judgments against him of some $70,000, including current judgments which have been listed in the recent edition of the Dun and Bradstreet report for approximately $7,000 to a local firm of solicitors. It seems that Mr Rogers has some difficulty in meeting his commitments to local businesses, including the Caboolture Cooperative Association. The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation has outstanding judgments against Mr Rogers in the order of $10,000 and a number of local banks and local businesses also have some judgments. Although Mr Rogers, the National Party candidate, may `make things happen', it is a bit unfortunate that he cannot quite find his way clear to pay for the things that he seems to be making happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Another State seat in my electorate, Pine Rivers, is held by the current Minister for Transport and Ethnic Affairs, Mrs Yvonne Chapman. She is known affectionately in the local area as the chameleon of Pine Rivers. She started her career as an Independent in local government. At the next local council election, she stood as a Liberal Party endorsed councillor. In between, she stood unsuccessfully for the National Party in the State seat. In the next State election, she reappeared as an Independent, saying that she had no party affiliations. She ended up in the Parliament as a National Party member, while at the same time declaring that she had membership of both the Liberal Party and the National Party simultaneously. That is hardly surprising; that particular experience has been repeated throughout Queensland. Numerous Liberal-National Party candidates interchange their roles. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party candidate in the State seat of Somerset, which is also within my Federal electorate, is Councillor Neil Zabel, from the Esk Shire Council. Councillor Zabel's particular claim to fame is that he gained Liberal Party endorsement after he let his National Party membership lapse. His opening statement to the press with respect to his endorsement was that he could give a guarantee to the electors that he would not swap sides after the election. His No. 1 pledge was that he would definitely stick with the Liberal Party. It is hardly surprising that, with candidates such as the one with $70,000-worth of debts outstanding, the National Party cannot find candidates who pay local businesses within the area. As other candidates chop and change between the conservative parties-Liberal one day, National the next-it is hardly surprising that the Labor Party is predicted to gain 56 per cent of the vote in Brisbane and 51 per cent in the rest of Queensland. After 2 December, Queensland will at last have a decent, responsible government when Labor achieves the treasury bench. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the closing stages of the last Federal election the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan) sent a letter to electors in South Australia saying that if a Liberal government were elected their pensions would be cut. This was entirely untrue and some expense was involved for the Liberal Party in refuting this untruth. It is interesting that that particular exercise was a precedent for the Labor Party in the just past State election campaign in South Australia. Exactly the same practice was used. The member for the State seat of Unley, Mr Kym Mayes, who is the Labor member, distributed to his constituents a letter in which he claimed that the Liberal Party was to build an O-Bahn at a cost of $170m. That assertion is wrong, as the cost was $80m, less than half that mentioned in the letter Mr Mayes distributed to all his constituents. The letter further states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Liberal proposal will have dramatic consequences for Unley including the substantial purchase of properties along the tram line. </PARA>
<PARA>That is wrong. The Liberal proposal was that no properties whatsoever would be purchased. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, there is an expected need to purchase homes at Black Forest to provide ready access and exit for O'Bahn buses at South Road. </PARA>
<PARA>That is also wrong. There was absolutely no suggestion that the Liberal Party would do that. It was to use the existing tramway to the South Road and not again purchase any homes. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a good example of the sort of totally dishonest propaganda put out in the closing stages of an election campaign. It brings into disrepute the democratic process. I am sorry to say that the member for Unley, Mr Mayes, was not the only Labor Party politician to practise that strategy. The former member for Fisher-fortunately he lost his seat, and justifiably so-went around the electorate of Fisher, when talking about a plan that the Liberals had to extend transport to the southern suburbs of Adelaide, claiming that Mr Olsen's document did not even rate Flagstaff Road a mention. That is an important part of that electorate. The simple fact is that the Liberals' document said that they would upgrade the Darlington intersection and Flagstaff Road to eliminate the traffic bottleneck. That is what the document said, yet in the closing stages of the campaign the Labor Party was prepared to say that the Liberals did not even rate it a mention. It did not matter that those statements were totally untrue; it did not seem to prick his conscience one jot that he was joining Mr Mayes in sending around during the closing stages of the election campaign totally false information. He was happy to do that because he was happy to win votes at any price. </PARA>
<PARA> In the State seat of Adelaide, which the Labor Party also lost, the Public Tenants Association Inc. was used as the stalking horse for the Labor Party. Exactly the same thing happened. The Labor Party letterboxed every single house in the State electorate of Adelaide with a document which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We have opposed rent increases in the past, but how would you like a 100% hike in your Trust rent?</PARA>
<PARA>That is a reference to the South Australian Housing Trust rent. The document continued:</PARA>
<PARA>That's what you could expect under an Olsen Liberal Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Never at any stage over the last four years or during the election campaign did the Olsen Opposition ever suggest that there would be a 100 per cent increase in housing trust rents. But that was letter-boxed into every household in the State electorate of Adelaide during the closing stages of the State election campaign. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) will be as outraged at some of the comments made by the Liberal and National parties in Queensland this week. He also spoke about the increase in housing rents. I suppose the Labor Party was going on what happened in New South Wales, because when the Liberal and National parties gained office in that State some housing rents in the Shellharbour area had increases of 100 per cent. I suppose the Labor Party in South Australia was going on the experience of what happened when the Liberal and National parties came into power in New South Wales. Of course they were assuming that the same would have happened in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is not the point that I wish to raise here this evening. I want to talk about the administration and functions of the National Commission for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), which are being transferred from the Department of Employment, Education and Training to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. While this move apparently has the support of both Ministers and the Chairman of the National Commission, Dr Richard Walsh, I am concerned about the proposed bureaucratic arrangements for servicing Australia's UNESCO involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members may be aware, national commissions for UNESCO are a unique feature in the United Nations (UN) system. No other specialised agency has similar provisions. Like all other UN organisations, UNESCO is an intergovernmental agency dealing, however, with matters a government can promote and stimulate but not create. That is ultimately up to the educators, scientists, writers, scholars, philosophers and civic leaders. This dual source, as the chamber will be aware, is at the root of UNESCO's special mandate and implies a broader approach than an exclusively political one. National commissions, according to the UNESCO charter, were created to carry out this advisory role to government. </PARA>
<PARA> The transfer of the National Commission's UNESCO responsibilities to the International Organisations, Information and Cultural Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade runs the risk of making the Australian UNESCO effort subservient to foreign policy priorities at the expense of the essential educational and intellectual roles which the Commission is required to play. I have been associated with the National Commission for some years now and I am impressed with what it has been able to accomplish in that time, given the resources that have been available to it. A vital part of that effort has resulted from a dedicated secretariat. The proposed move to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will, I believe, split a cohesive and hard-working secretariat and downgrade the position of secretary of the Commission. The overall staffing resources for the secretariat will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> My intention in raising this matter, therefore, is to express concern on two counts: firstly, the politicisation of a body that is meant to play an advisory role to Government on education, the sciences, culture and communications and, secondly, the downgrading of its secretariat and, subsequently, Australia's full participation in UNESCO. At a time when Australia has encouraged Pacific countries such as the Cook Islands and Kiribati to join UNESCO and when there is a heightened expectation by Pacific countries of the role Australia will play through UNESCO in the Pacific region, it seems extremely untimely for Australia to be seen to be decreasing its commitment to UNESCO by downgrading and reducing the services of the expert secretariat which has served it well in past years. I ask three questions: Is this a downgrading of the National Commission? How will it affect the Commission's ability to advise all Australian governments, of whatever political persuasion? What will happen to the Commission's staff?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In June 1987 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gave an election promise to urgently reform the Broadcasting and Television Act, which he described at the time as being `nightmarish legislation'. Despite the urgency of the Prime Minister's statement at that time, and considerable subsequent public acknowledgment by Ministers as to the inadequacy of the Act, two years have now gone past without amending legislation being introduced into the Parliament. But we do have yet another promise. The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) informed the House on 1 November last that legislation to reform the Broadcasting Act will be introduced in both the autumn and Budget sittings of Parliament in 1990-three years after the Prime Minister acknowledged that urgent reforms were needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One aspect of the Act which we understand the Government wishes to change is to abolish its present policy of investigating television and radio reception interference problems at no charge to the consumer. Under its present policies, a television or radio user suffering reception interference can report it to the Department and have it investigated free of charge. If the fault is in the user's equipment or antennae, the user must have it repaired privately. However, where the interference is traced to an external source, such as a power line or a two-way radio service, the Department accepts responsibility to take follow-up action with the local council or licensee to remedy the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of this well established and efficient procedure, the Government is proposing to charge a $60 investigative fee which will be payable in advance, will provide only advice as to the possible cause of the reception difficulties, and will place the Department under no obligation to remedy the cause. I understand that the Department is receiving up to 16,000 complaints a year, with about 42 per cent being traced to external causes such as faulty power lines, industrial equipment, two-way licences and faulty departmental transmissions. Information made available to me suggests that by imposing a fee of $60 the number of complaints will be halved and the Department will reduce its investigative staff by 15 persons at a saving of $700,000 per year.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like the House to consider some of the implications of the proposed fee scheme. When a member of the public phones in with a complaint about reception interference, the Department will initially respond with a free booklet mailed to the complainant, and containing advice as to how the householder might identify the possible interference source. If the user is still dissatisfied, he must then send $60 in advance to the Department to arrange for an investigator to diagnose the source of the interference. For the $60, the investigator will simply give advice as to the possible source of the interference, and be under no obligation to take any action to remedy that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members should just put themselves in the position of a consumer who suffers reception interference problems which he considers to be from an external source. He complains to the Department and a week or two later receives a booklet with advice as to how to identify the problem himself. If he follows the instructions and still has a problem, he can phone the Department again and will be told to send in an advance payment of $60. When that is received the Department arranges a visit by an investigator who will diagnose the problem and identify the possible source, but without any obligation to ensure that the external interference is remedied. It is simply totally unsatisfactory. Consider a situation where a taxi service has a faulty transmitter which is causing interference, and this results in 20 people phoning in with complaints of domestic interference. Will the Department charge a $60 fee for all 20 persons, even though the problem might be identified-and hopefully remedied-after the first complaint has been investigated? This is a simple example of possible administrative difficulties that will be caused by a fee scheme in the form being considered by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Most people will abandon the departmental investigative service and phone their local radio or television repair man, and hope that it is domestic set or antennae problem. If their local repair man tells them it is external interference, they will be forced back onto the treadmill of phoning the Department, receiving their free booklet, paying the fee, and waiting for an investigator to tell them the source of the interference. Then there will be a wait of indeterminate length while the source problem is remedied. What is clear is that the fee scheme will be very unpopular, but it will be a boon to local television and radio repair businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> The public should not accept such a cumbersome and frustrating service from a commercial operator, and it certainly should not accept it from a public department, particularly one which is administered by this Government in a way which has been demonstrated, over the years, to be a simply inefficient way of approaching the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been asked to bring to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) some concerns that have been raised by the Retired Members Association of the Federated Ironworkers Association, Port Kembla branch. I propose to read a letter that I have received which I have been asked to bring to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition, because it clearly demonstrates the concerns of ordinary Australians about what has been put forward as the remedy for Australia's economic problems. The letter reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> Our organization views with some concern the economic plan that Mr Peacock put forward recently in Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems should the Coalition gain office at the coming Federal election the low income and disadvantaged will bear the brunt of cuts in government spending. </PARA>
<PARA> We would like to know from Mr Peacock will the Coalition, should it win the next Federal election, honour the social and welfare policy put in place in the budget and April Statement? Some of the things put into place are rent assistance to $30 by September 1990, increases in pensioner tax rebate and other benefits to be indexed with the movement of the C.P.I. </PARA>
<PARA> We would like to know what is the Coalition's policy with regard to aged health and housing programs? Also if there will be $300 million cut in the general payments to States would the cuts fall on health, community services and other essential services?</PARA>
<PARA> These services are struggling to do their jobs due to inadequate funds now. We do expect answers from Mr Peacock and quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours Sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA> J. Ball</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ball is the Honorary Secretary of the Retired Members Association, Federated Ironworkers Association, Port Kembla branch. </PARA>
<PARA> What this group is putting forward and seeking answers on is simply a reflection of the concern out there in the community about the effect on ordinary Australians, on people who are on retired incomes, and people who are dependent on social security. They are concerned about a range of issues which have simply not been addressed, and have been glossed over by this Opposition that is walking towards a new, wonderful world. This is a plea from those disadvantaged in the community to the Opposition to clearly spell out what it would do on health and social security and what it would do for the disadvantaged in the community. The people have seen an opposition that has callously stated that the people who will be affected by its Economic Action Plan-this great plan for the salvation of Australia-are those least able to look after themselves, the unemployed, the long-term unemployed. Of course, the people from the Illawarra region, the retired members of the Federated Ironworkers Association, know what they are talking about. It is an unfortunate fact of life that there are long term unemployed in an area like the Illawarra simply as a result of the structural readjustment that has taken place in the economic base of that region. That group is concerned for those people. It wants to know whether this policy of kick the blacks, kick the unemployed, kick the migrants will be typical and symptomatic of some broader hidden agenda by a coalition that says that it prides itself on looking after families, that it will look after the disadvantaged and that it will take from the bludgers and give to the workers. </PARA>
<PARA> These are people who have worked all their lives building up the steel industry in this country. They are people that have slaved in the Illawarra for Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, that have battled, that are retired, and that are now on pensions. They are asking the coalition for some sort of an indication as to whether of not their interests will be protected in the future. The Economic Action Plan tells them absolutely nothing. There is not a health policy from the Opposition, let alone a policy as to what it will do for those people who are on pensions or for those people who are unemployed. The policy just does not exist. Despite the protestations from those opposite who cry, `We stand for those people', it is absolute rubbish. The organisation is one that sees through them. It is one of an increasingly greater number that is doing the same, and it will not cop it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to talk about something which I will get to in a minute but, since the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) has demonstrated what is becoming increasingly apparent to much of Australia, and what has been obvious to members of this chamber for some time, I feel I should respond. Of course, he is demonstrating the very real fear of the Australian Labor Party that it will lose the next election. That is why Government members are starting to concentrate on the success of the Opposition's Economic Action Plan. I suggest, first of all, to the honourable member from Macarthur that, if his constituent is so concerned, he ought to write to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and he will probably get a first-hand response to the concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must admit that I and many of my colleagues were deeply touched when we listened to the honourable member for Macarthur talking about his concerns-against a background of bankruptcies rising to a record level under this Government. Where was his concern about those people-concern about the fact that this Labor Government has mortgaged the future of our children and has run this nation into a debt the like of which we have never seen in the history of Australia, a debt that our children will probably have to spend decades trying to bring under control and repay? Where is the honourable member's concern about this? Where is the Labor Party's concern about the way in which it has mortgaged the future of what once was a great nation and mortgaged the future of our children? What will Government members say when their children turn around to them and say, `Why did you put us into debt like this? Why did you not think about the future? Why did you not care about the next generation'? What will Government members tell them? When they are sitting in opposition, I suppose they will not care very much. I suggest that they have a long, hard think about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want tonight to raise another matter. I tried to warn the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) beforehand, although I told him last night that I intended to raise it. It is the same point that I mentioned earlier: when a government is about to lose office some members not only seem to lose confidence but also start to run off at the mouth and contradict their own policies, as in the case of the honourable member for Bendigo. It is very interesting that the honourable member for Bendigo recently issued a press release which seems to say everything that the Opposition has been saying about Government policy for some time. The honourable member for Bendigo highlighted the fact that the present Government's level of funding for roads in Australia is inadequate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he is a member of the Labor Party and he is saying that road funding is inadequate, despite all of the protestations of the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) that road funding is okay. In fact, to make it clear, I will read part of his press release in which he says he has written to the Minister. His press release reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his letter to the Minister, Mr Brumby said additional road funding was necessary to maintain road infrastructure in a satisfactory condition. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be clearer: additional road funding was necessary to maintain road infrastructure in a satisfactory condition. That is what the honourable member for Bendigo said and that is what the Opposition has been trying to tell the Government for some years. Until this time, it seems that the Government has been quite deaf. I wonder what the Minister's response will be to that. The honourable member for Bendigo continued:</PARA>
<PARA> What I have said to the Minister is that existing levels of federal, state and local government funding for roads is not adequate, and that the issue must be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously he feels that his seat is not only marginal but is at extreme risk. He is now trying to have two bob each way and trying to convince people locally that he is concerned even if his Government is not. In his press release he continued:</PARA>
<PARA> My letter follows comments I made on this issue in Federal Caucus last week. </PARA>
<PARA>He said also that he had written to each local government authority, so obviously he is very nervous. What he said to his local government authority is very interesting. He gave it these two options:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a `one-off' increase of (say) $150 million to be paid over the next three years (in addition to existing road funding levels) . . . a decade long programme of $2.5 billion (in addition to existing real levels) to be financed through an additional one cent per litre levy on petroleum products. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is an old adage which says, `Familiarity breeds contempt' and I hope that this proverb will never apply to our relationship with the United States of America which is so friendly that one takes it for granted. However, I learnt yet again that nothing should be taken for granted in this life. Recently I was visited by a United States attorney, Mr Ronald F. Storette, who made an appointment to discuss with me business migration laws. I expected that Mr Storette would be discussing with me our Australian business migration laws. To my great surprise when I met Mr Storette, who works for a law firm in New York, he complained about the difficulties encountered by Australian businessmen in trying to obtain visas to enter the United States for business purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Storette informed me that there is no treaty between the United States and Australia which would facilitate the issue of US visas for Australian businessmen. From our discussions and subsequent inquiries we both learned to our surprise that, despite our friendly relations, there are no treaties between our two countries which would promote cultural, scientific, sporting or trade cooperation. The only treaty with the US is the ANZUS Treaty, a military treaty which has questionable value even for military, let alone peaceful, cooperation. ANZUS would be absolutely useless in a regional conflict and, if there was a global conflict, God save us all. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with our military oriented relationship based on ANZUS and a number of secret military agreements with the US, there are many academic works published on our American alliance, but none on our peaceful cooperation. A treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation between the US and Australia is long overdue. Such treaties have been established between the United States and 39 countries running alphabetically from Argentina to Yugoslavia and including countries such as the United Kingdom, Turkey, West Germany, Israel and Italy-a wide variety of countries. Yet there is no treaty with Australia. In his letter Mr Storette wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>A Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Australia will facilitate nonimmigrant business travel between the two countries and will enable Australian nationals to enter the United States on E-1 Treaty Trader Visas or E-2 Treaty Investor Visas. </PARA>
<PARA> If a Treaty were established, E-1 Treaty Trader Visas would be available to Australian nationals who wish to carry on substantial trade between the United States and Australia. This nonimmigrant visa classification is frequently used to transfer personnel to the United States on E-1 visas in fields such as international banking, insurance, transportation, tourism, communications import-export, etc. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, if this Treaty were established, E-2 Treaty Investor Visas would be available to Australian nationals who wish to come to the United States to direct and develop substantial investments they have made in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, many Australian companies and banks would be able to increase their trade and investments in the United States pursuant to this Treaty and facilitate the transfer of their executive and managerial employees, as well as their employees possessing essential skills, in order to manage their trade and investments in the United States. Needless to say, the Australian business community has expressed strong interest in establishing such a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation with the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the business opportunities this Treaty would create, another advantage of this visa category is that E-1 or E-2 visas can be valid for substantial periods of time, and can be renewed as long as the trade and/or investments remain viable. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, I call on the Government and this Parliament immediately to initiate moves to negotiate formal agreements with the United States, such as the treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation, and to cement our traditional friendship into formal agreements to the peaceful advantage of both our countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 5 September 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to reports on page one of Nuclear Fuel, 6 March 1989, which state that the continuing decline in spot uranium prices has forced uranium producers to act as traders.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is he able to verify reports that the majority of uranium producers are now finding it more profitable to buy and sell on the spot market, and to buy on spot in order to fulfil long term supply contracts, than actually produce uranium.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is he able to verify the claim on page two of Nuclear Fuel, 3 April 1989, that many producers will cease production and instead purchase on spot to meet their long term commitments if uranium spot prices do not improve by the end of 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Is he able to confirm reports in Nuclear Fuel that Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) has already bought on the spot market in order to meet US contracts; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) If ERA has bought on the spot market to meet those contracts, what are the details.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Is he able to verify the claim on page 12 of Nuclear Fuel, 23 January 1989, that ERA will need to purchase or borrow as much as one million pounds of uranium during 1989 in order to meet its US delivery commitments.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Has his attention been drawn to the reports on page two of the 6 March 1989, and page three of the 17 April 1989 issues of Nuclear Fuel which refer to transactions between the US company Malapai Resources and ERA.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Is he able to say whether (a) Malapai Resources sold between one and two million pounds of U3O8 at between $US17.25 and $US17.50 per pound largely to ERA in 1987 and (b) ERA purchased around 1.4 million pounds from Malapai in a series of spot transactions in 1988-89 in order to meet 12 US contracts which were tied to the spot market price; if not, what are the details.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Has he asked his Department to investigate the accuracy of any of the reports referred to; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) If he has asked his Department to investigate, what was the outcome in each case.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Is he able to say whether ERA has denied the purchases from Malapai Resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) If the purchases were made, then in view of the assurances from Mr P Bradfield, speaking on behalf of ERA and reported on page nine of Nuclear Fuel, 20 March 1989, that ERA is fully protected against the vagaries of the spot market, how may the purchases be explained.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) Is he able to say whether ERA has found it cheaper to supply long term contracts from spot purchases rather than producing at Ranger.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) Is he able to say whether ERA has engaged in spot market activity.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) If ERA engaged in spot market activity, is he able to provide a full account of the nature and extent of the activity; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) Has he considered allowing ERA to operate solely as a trading company to fulfil its long term US and other contracts from spot purchases and to cease production completely at Ranger; if not, why not.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) to (3) No. I understand that apart from US producers, most other producers expect to fulfil most of their contractual obligations from their own production. The spot market represents approximately 15% of the trade in uranium and I suspect that some producers will utilise that option.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) to (16) The issues raised in the questions are commercial-in-confidence and I do not propose to answer them in detail. There is nothing stopping ERA from fulfilling its contractual obligations by purchasing material offshore, including on the spot market. This does not conflict with any government prescriptions and is a matter for ERA's commercial judgment. ERA, however, remains a major, low cost producer of uranium whose production continues to account for the bulk of Australia's current uranium exports.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 7 September 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is he able to confirm that the West German company RWE, a shareholder-customer of Energy Research Australia (ERA), has terminated its long term contract with ERA with effect from 31 December 1990, as stated in an ERA press release of 8 August 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is he able to say what the relationship is now between ERA and RWE.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is he able to confirm reports that RWE holds large inventories of uranium, including 10 years supply for the Mulheim Kaerlich PWR, currently closed by the West German courts and facing protracted relicensing proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Has his attention been drawn to reports on page 13 of Nuclear Fuel, 15 May 1989, that while ERA's shareholder-customers wanted to bring the prices of ERA deliveries down to world market levels from the then existing floor price of the Australian Government, the West Germans were said to wish to withdraw completely, whatever happened to the floor price.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Is he able to say whether an RWE withdrawal from ERA, following the sale of Saarberg to COGEMA, will be followed by the withdrawal from ERA of the sole remaining West German company, Urangesellschaft.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Is he able to confirm the reports on page 13 of Nuclear Fuel, 15 May 1989, that when ERA made a first round offer to its shareholder-customers of $US26 per pound, no utility was said to be interested.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Is he able to say whether ERA's remaining shareholder-customers would accept a similar offer.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Is he able to confirm the reports on page 14 of Nuclear Fuel, 15 May 1989, that not only are European utilities such as RWE buying much more on the spot market for approximately $US12-13 per pound at present, but that they are receiving long term supply offers for $US17-18 per pound.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, RWE has given notice that it will terminate its long term contract with Energy Resources of Australia (ERA).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) RWE is still a shareholder in ERA.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am aware that RWE is reported to hold substantial inventories, but the specific levels of inventories are not normally revealed by companies.</PARA>
<PARA> (4), (5), (6) and (7) The article reflects industry press speculation and was written at an early stage in the renegotiation of settlements between ERA and its shareholder-customers. These protracted and difficult negotiations have now been finalised and ERA and all of its shareholder-customers, with the exception of RWE, have concluded settlements for deliveries in 1990 and 1991 at a floor price of $US26 per pound. I have approved these settlements.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) I am aware that European utilities have made some uranium purchases on the spot market, but most purchases continue to be made under long term contracts. The Euratom Supply Agency reports the weighted average price of all natural uranium deliveries made to members of the EEC under medium and long term contracts in 1988 was $US31.82 per pound, though current long term supply offers would be expected to be below that price. Precise prices offered is commercial in confidence information.</PARA>
