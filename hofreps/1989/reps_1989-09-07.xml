<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, in an article in today's Sydney Morning Herald at page 6, dealing with the airline pilots dispute, Mr Milton Cockburn writes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To add further confusion, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, yesterday supported the idea of voluntary contracts between the airlines and pilots, bypassing the pilots' federation. </PARA>
<PARA>This is totally incorrect. Let me read not one but two extracts from my speech to the House yesterday, because I said it not once but twice. At one point in my speech I made the point:</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that the only way out of the dispute is for negotiations between the airlines and the pilots, either individually or through the union. </PARA>
<PARA>I later said:</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the Government as the owner should encourage the management of Australian Airlines to begin negotiations with the pilots, either individually or through their union. </PARA>
<PARA>It can therefore be seen that an allegation that I was suggesting the Australian Federation of Air Pilots be bypassed was not correct. It can clearly be seen that Mr Cockburn's reference to my speech is a misrepresentation. Furthermore, on this morning's Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) program AM it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA>There is reported disagreement in the ranks of the Opposition parties in Canberra on how the dispute should be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Although the Opposition Leader, Andrew Peacock, has restated his belief that the airlines should negotiate with the pilots directly, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, Senator John Stone, says the airlines should negotiate with the Pilots Federation. </PARA>
<PARA>As can be seen from the two references I have quoted from my speech, where I indicated quite clearly that the negotiations should be held either individually or through the union, this reference on the ABC AM program is also a misrepresentation and totally without foundation. </PARA>

<PARA> 6. In 1987, local government expended more on roads than either the Federal Government or the combined State Governments.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The road system is failing in many areas. Many roads are well overdue for reconstruction. Some roads in rural areas cannot be maintained in a sealed state due to funding constraints and are being reverted to an unsealed surface.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request the House to raise the priority listing of roads in the Government's expenditure programmes to ensure that sufficient funding is allocated to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) redress the backlog of road works required to raise the nation's road network to a standard consistent with that of a progressive, developed country.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) ensure that Australia's road network is able to be maintained to a standard acceptable to a country so dependent on road transport; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) permit the progressive improvement and upgrading of the road system so as to keep pace with the demands made upon it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to European Parliamentary Institutions. I had the honour and pleasure to lead the 1988 delegation to the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The delegation also had the privilege of visiting Italy as guests of the Parliament of that nation. I would like to place on record my appreciation to the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), who greatly assisted me as deputy leader, and to all other members of the delegation for their active involvement in the many discussions the delegation had with senior members of other parliaments and institutions. The delegation was representative of all the major political parties from both Houses of the Parliament. It had the advantage, therefore, of having a wealth of knowledge and talent within its ranks to be in the position of presenting Australia's case in a factual yet forceful manner for a greater involvement in European activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the report of the delegation records, visits to the European Community by delegations from the Australian Parliament are very important because they provide an opportunity for Australian parliamentarians to put to European parliamentarians and officials our country's points of view on many international issues of mutual interest and to draw attention to the effect on Australia and developing countries of decisions made by the European Community in relation to those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> As the European Parliament is continually increasing its influence and power in the European decision-making processes it is important that Australia have regular contact with its European counterparts. The 12 European nations comprising the European Community have within their boundaries over 320 million people who generally enjoy a very high standard of living and excellent mobility between their borders. There is great cooperation between those European nations. Their success thus far in raising their standard of living has been due to the desire of their people to join together in a spirit of cooperation encompassing transport, trade, employment opportunities and defence. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1992 any remaining obstacles will be swept aside when these nations will allow the free movement of people, goods, services and capital across their borders. This removal of internal barriers will give a significant boost to the economy of the European Community. Manufacturers, for instance, will be able to achieve economies of scale and the business environment will become more competitive as sectors such as air transport and financial services are liberalised. The economic benefits of a unified market have been projected as adding about 6 per cent to the Community's gross domestic product and creating as many as two million extra new jobs in the medium term. </PARA>
<PARA> What does this mean to Australia? In all the discussions the delegation had with parliamentarians from Europe and with the President of the Republic of Italy, we were assured that the coming of 1992 did not mean that Europe would develop a fortress mentality in respect of trade but rather that because of Australia's historical ties with these nations increased trade opportunities would be possible. I am of the opinion that increased trade opportunities will be available if sufficient trouble is taken to ascertain the needs of the European Community and to market appropriate products to cater for those. We were acquainted with too many instances where Australian products had failed to sell in Europe because the manufacturers had failed to adapt their products to suit the needs and requirements of Europeans. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian trade with the European Community is significant to our economy. The Community is Australia's second biggest export market and its largest supplier of imports. A strong European economy contributes to a healthy world economic and trading system. Australia stands to gain because of our close economic and political ties with Europe. I am of the opinion that many of our larger manufacturing industries should endeavour to join with European manufacturers in joint venture projects in Europe so that full advantage can be taken of the local market. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation also held numerous discussions with our European colleagues on environmental matters which concern not only our countries but indeed the whole world. It is quite apparent from these discussions, and indeed from the delegation's own observations, that Australia does not have the environmental problems that Europe has because of our location and our small population. Europe has enormous environmental problems ranging from acid rain destroying their crops and forests, water pollution of their inland rivers affecting the quality of their drinking water to the many effects of waste disposal at all levels. There is ever-increasing concern being expressed of the need to take urgent action to improve the quality of the European environment and this concern has been manifested by the electoral success of parliamentary candidates of a number of so-called `Green' parties in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of differing pollution control methods adopted by the European nations, it has become increasingly difficult for them to come to grips with many pollution problems such as motor vehicle emission controls, et cetera. Generally, Australia has much stricter controls over pollution. This puts us in a unique position to supply Europe with largely pollution-free agricultural products in the future. It is an area that we have not paid much attention to in the past, but with an ever-increasing demand by Europeans for pollution-free food products we should take every opportunity to cater for this demand. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation also had the opportunity to visit Italy, at the request of the Italian Parliament and with that Parliament providing all the facilities to us. We were guests of that Parliament and we had very many fruitful discussions with our Italian parliamentary counterparts. As many honourable members would know, a large number of our migrants came from Italy and there are very, very strong ties with that country. The Italians are very concerned indeed that Australia could be put at a disadvantage when 1992 comes about, when we have the single European Act, and they stressed to the delegation the importance of the need for Australia to have continuing close relations with Italy. We were assured by the Italian President, President Cosiga, that indeed they had very, very fond regards for Australia and for Australian people and that we should continue to have very, very close ties with that particular nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we were in Europe we had the opportunity to visit some of the war graves of the many Australian soldiers, from both the First World War and the Second World War, who had been buried there, following their fall in defence of those nations. We had the very great honour of visiting the Menin Gate at Ypres and of laying a wreath there. The delegation was very pleased with the way that ceremony was handled, in that buglers were made available to us to sound the Last Post and all the traffic going through that particular area was stopped while we carried out the wreath-laying ceremony. I am appreciative of the efforts made in that regard because many, many Australians laid down their lives in that particular area and we were very, very moved by the respect that the local people have for the efforts and the sacrifices made by Australians in those campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to place on record my special thanks to the Australian Ambassador in Brussels, Mr Peter Curtis, and his special assistant, Jean Page, for their assistance and dedication in ensuring that the delegation had every opportunity to put Australia's case with our European colleagues. My thanks are also extended to those European parliamentarians and officials who extended the hand of friendship towards us and who gave us their valuable time to hold discussions on the many matters of mutual concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I also place on record my thanks to the Secretary of the delegation, Mr Paul Barsdell, for the assistance that he gave the delegation whilst we were overseas. But I must also place on record my criticism of him for the fact that it has taken so long for this report to be prepared. I have been attempting since very early this year to get the report prepared so that it could be presented to Parliament and it was only within the last half an hour that I received the final two copies of this report. So although on one hand I thank him for the assistance he gave the delegation in Europe, I think it is also fair to place on record my criticism of the fact that it took all this time to get this report to Parliament. I regret that fact because the 1989 delegation goes to the European Communities in only a couple of weeks' time, and it would have been much better if this report had been presented earlier than this. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As a member of last year's delegation to the European parliamentary institutions, I would like to thank the honourable member for Banks, Mr John Mountford, for his leadership of the delegation. It is not easy to maintain an oversight of a fairly numerous delegation and all its needs and make the arrangements that are necessary with the changes of plan that obviously occur. So I place on record my thanks to him and to the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), the deputy leader of the delegation, who supported his leader admirably and who smoothed the way for what was the most interesting trip of my life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Such a delegation, in making the investigations it does and in having the opportunity to interview the various members of parliament and members of the public ser-vice who flesh out the institutions in Europe, obtains a raft of detail. It is from that detail that I made a number of major observations. The Europe that I saw was for me, for the first time, a Europe of one entity. The cooperation which is now evident in Europe and the determination to make the European Economic Community succeed is something one has to experience to believe. I was most impressed with the optimism of members of parliament and, as I have said, of the members of the support systems of the institutions. Their optimism was infectious. The cooperation which now exists between nations which were, only a few years ago, at war and such deep enemies, was evident when one visited the war graves the day after seeing intricate committee work by re-presentatives of those same countries. So the optimism is there. The economic growth is also there for all to see. Especially in Italy the rate of growth has been fantastic. </PARA>
<PARA> So too is pollution. I was amazed, as were all delegates, to fly from Milan to Venice without getting above the cloud of pollution which was above our cruising altitude of 20,000 feet. If one needs to develop any regard for the Greens party, one needs only to go to Europe and see the pollution which is evident at every turn. One soon realises why there has to be some specialised representation in the European political scene to overcome what would otherwise be, if pollution were disregarded, an overwhelming disaster for all of Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> The politics of the common agricultural policy are evident, too, in that one gets the view that Australia has a very small influence in Europe. We were received with great hospitality at every turn, but Australia's influence is minimal and our influence on the common agricultural policy will be minimal. I believe that we should approach the European scene on the basis, `We are here to help you; we have specialised goods we can export to you; we have some great commodities, such as coal, which are available to you'. I do not believe we will go much further in simply railing against the common agricultural policy. We need to maintain our desire and demand for fair trade from Europe so that fortress Europe does not develop but, on the other hand, we need to adopt a new approach `We are here to help you'. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is isolated in the minds of many Europeans. Time after time we spoke to people who said, `You are so far away and you do all of your trade with Japan'. Obviously, we need to maintain strong representation in Europe, which we do, of course. I thank the Australian ambassadors in Europe and their embassy staff for the great help they gave us, and for the obvious help they provide in maintaining the Australian view in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> Upon leaving the delegation, following our briefing at the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation headquarters, I had the opportunity to spend five days in Russia, which was a great experience. It was interesting to follow up our queries of 12 months ago as to what was happening in Eastern Europe, and to find out what swift changes had occurred in those 12 months. It was a great experience to make comparisons with the news of today. </PARA>
<PARA> On a personal level, I would like to thank my fellow members of the delegation, particularly for their application of the work ethic. They all shared in the committee work we did. I would also like to thank them for their help in sampling the beer of Venice and Belgium. In that regard I would like especially to thank the honourable member for Aston (Mr Saunderson), although I worried somewhat about the devious source of some of the crustaceans out of the Venetian lagoon. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IJ4">Mr SNOWDON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important report of the Committee because it demonstrates that a bipartisan approach can be achieved within this Parliament on important issues facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. After a long process of consultation with Aboriginal and Islander communities a unanimous report is presented to the Parliament. I thank my colleagues on the Committee for their support and their positive response to the needs we saw on our field visits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The conclusions and recommendations of the report centre on a desire by the Committee to see Aboriginal and Islander communities achieve self-determination. For the Committee self-determination means Aboriginal and Islander people having the authority, resources and capacity to control the future of their communities within the Australian legal structure. Education and training are vital in giving Aboriginal people those resources and capacities they require for effective self-determination by equipping them with the skills to manage their communities and control their future. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee argues that there must be the development of an overall approach to training. Existing programs are generally ad hoc and they have provided communities with few of the skilled people they require for the range of responsibilities they wish to assume. The development of an overall approach does not mean the implementation of universal solutions to the differing needs of communities but it does mean providing training in a comprehensive rather than an ad hoc way. As part of the implementation of a comprehensive approach it is essential that better coordination be achieved between agencies involved in providing training. The Committee makes recommendations to see better coordination by government agencies under the arrangements already provided for by the Aboriginal employment development policy. However, coordination must also take place at the community level where the effects of poor coordination have their most obvious impact. The Committee advocates that coordination at the community level take place within a process of developing long term community plans embracing the socio-economic, cultural and physical objectives of communities. Government agencies should also coordinate their visits and consultations with communities. The Committee has recommended that an investigation take place of the amalgamation of the field office staff of Commonwealth agencies to ensure a better coordination at the local level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee makes the obvious point that training in skills for community management must be preceded by a basic educational grounding. Many Aboriginal and Islander people do not obtain a basic education. The Government's new Aboriginal education policy is a welcome initiative in addressing basic educational programs for Aboriginal people. Current approaches to training have made concessions to Aboriginal people's differing needs in some cases. Some educational institutions have responded in sensitive ways to Aboriginal needs by establishing enclave programs to support Aboriginal students and by utilising on site methods of delivery of programs. Recommendations by the Committee support and strengthen these initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> While recognising the necessity of institutional training in some areas, the Committee strongly advocates the adoption of more community based training. The Committee is convinced that a community based approach is likely to be the most effective in the long term, although it will require additional funding and innovative responses to be made. A number of linked recommendations are made by the Committee to implement a community based approach to training. The Committee also recommends the development of a comprehensive range of courses and materials in skills for community management and development, with Aboriginal and Islander people being closely involved in this process. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already thanked my colleagues for their cooperation and support in the completion of this report, and I do so again. In particular I would like to thank my predecessor as Chairman, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Blanchard). I also thank the Committee Secretary, David Elder, and other staff who have worked on the inquiry-Wynne Allen, who is in the House today but is no longer with the Committee; Claire Brien, who I understand is also leaving the Committee, unfortunately; and Peter Ratas. Thanks should also be given to the Hansard reporters who accompanied the Committee on its field visits. Finally, I thank all of those who made submissions and gave evidence to the Committee. In particular I thank the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the communities who made themselves available for discussions with the Committee during its field visits. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the comments made by the present Chairman of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), in his thanks to David Elder, the Secretary, and also to members of the staff, Wynne, Claire and Peter, because we all know that in putting together reports like this a tremendous amount of work is required behind the scenes. The work done by these people has been very much appreciated by us as members of the Parliament on this Committee. I shall make a few comments about this report. The status and condition of Aboriginal Australians in this nation of ours is an area of concern which I believe all members of this Parliament have. This report looks at four areas in particular. I want to dwell on two of those in the few brief minutes which I have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first area is in regard to coordination of programs for Aboriginal Australians in this nation. Unfortunately, I believe it is a great tragedy when we have people come before a committee and say that they spend so much time working out what the roles are of everybody else involved that they can hardly get down to the job of doing the task which is really their responsibility. Over the past years in this administration I believe literally thousands of hours have been spent by people working out what roles are already being done by similar organisations in a certain area. This is particularly so with regard to training and employment. When I was moving around I think I got a list from one departmental area which showed that there were 15 different agencies involved in training and employment programs in Australia. Basically all had the same goals in mind but the reality was that there was very little effective coordination and time spent on actually training and education. This Committee has observed this situation right around this nation. Hopefully this report will not be mere words; action is what this nation needs to bring about changes for people who have been very disadvantaged over the years. There must be action. I would be pressing at this point that the Government do something about this as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I refer to basic education. There are parts of Australia where Aboriginal children in our schools are 14 and 15 years old, but their level of education really is year three level. What we have to ensure is that Aboriginal children get up to primary school standards of education right throughout this country. Of course, we all hope that they will get up to year 10 and year 12 standards of education. It is vital that that occur if we are really going to bring about changes in this area. Tragically, that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> In bringing down a report which asks for government action, I say to parents of Aboriginal children that there is a need for them to work hand in hand with governments so that their children go to schools and then we can alleviate some of the great difficulties with which we are faced in this area. There are other aspects to this but I know that two of my other colleagues want to make comments; so I will just finally come back to the point: this area has grown like Topsy. There has to be better coordination and we look to the Government for action and action very quickly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the comments of the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Aborig- inal Affairs, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), and also the comments of the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). We all want to see the recommendations in this report translated into action. I would like to mention the background to the inquiry. It arose out of a reference to the Standing Committee by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) in November 1987. The reference requested the Committee to inquire into and report on the effectiveness of existing support services within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities, including administrative and advisory services. The broad terms of the reference allowed a wide variety of issues to be raised. Support services became interpreted as relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander needs for services, ranging from essential type services such as water, electricity and roads, to basic services such as education, employment, health and housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the wide ranging terms of reference did not allow the Committee to concentrate sufficiently on the many issues that were raised. It became clear after discussing issues with a large number of Aboriginal communities that there were four areas which deserved closer scrutiny by the Committee. These areas were, firstly, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community management and control; secondly, education and training for community administration; thirdly, advisory services for Aboriginal communities; and, fourthly, mainstream local government and minority Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA> In its interim report the Committee considered that dividing the broad terms of reference into a number of smaller inquiries would allow a better targeting of the major issues emerging from the inquiry. This report is the first of these reports and it deals with the important issues of education and training for community administration, management and development. It became clear to the Committee that there has been a deplorable lack of comprehensive approach as a strategy to meet community management and administrative needs. We found a lack of coordination of programs, conflicting funding approaches, and inadequate consultation. We found that there was a need for better coordination of the funding of Commonwealth, State and local government programs. We found that Aboriginal input to education and training is still lacking at national, State and local levels and must be provided. Most importantly, we found that community development plans need to be drawn up which should provide the basis for the provision of programs. I cannot emphasise enough the need for consultation and negotiation at community levels on methods of delivery of programs and also on the content of training programs. This is an excellent report and the recommendations contained therein deserve the support of the Minister and the Government: I trust, as I said earlier, that steps will be taken immediately to implement the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I pay tribute to the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for the Northern Territory. He has been a tireless worker and has worked well with Committee members and the secretariat. Tribute should also be paid to the Secretary of the Committee, David Elder. I have had the pleasure of working with David for a number of years. He is dedicated to the task in hand and I feel he has helped con- siderably to smooth the work of the Committee. I would like to acknowledge the work of the support staff of the secretariat, Wynne, Claire and Peter, who worked, under Mr Elder's leadership, both hard and diligently on behalf of the Committee. As I said earlier, this is an excellent report and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support the comments of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Blanchard) and thank him for the excellent work that he did over the period of years that he was Chairman of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. He has been very dedicated, has travelled throughout Australia and given an awful lot of time to working with the Aboriginal people. I would also like to join with him and with the Chairman, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), in thanking our support staff-Claire, David, Peter and Wynne-and wishing those who are leaving well in their new endeavours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report, of course, is only an interim report on a large number of things that we have been looking at. It is important that the House understand that it is a combination of No. 1 and No. 3-management control is No. 1 and advisory services is No. 3-in the four areas that we have been looking at. There are 49 recommendations in the report and I think that probably highlights the fact that there are still many problems associated with the education and skills area. Our Committee has done a report on education. The Commonwealth does get involved in extra funding for the Aboriginal people throughout Australia. I have always been personally very strongly of the view that those extra funding areas should be means tested and should be available to all, both Aboriginal and European children, in any school and that Aboriginals should not be particularly taken out and given extra funding. It does cause a lot of problems in communities such as Goondiwindi in my own electorate, where we have seen race riots, et cetera. A lot of that sort of activity starts at the local high school and a lot of it is bred because of the extra funding. Our policy now in our own party is to means test some of this extra help. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a real need, of course, for education. What the Europeans do not understand is that Aboriginal people generally have not had much education. In fact, we have only been educating ourselves in the fashion that we do today for probably 100 years. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BF4">Mr IAN CAMERON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I do not doubt that. I have been fortunate. I have been to school. When I was young I went to the local State school. I rode my horse there. In fact, I attended school with some Aboriginal children. One of the problems is that, as demonstrated by the number of support services that are available, the Commonwealth tends to want to get involved in all these fields rather than letting the States do the work. Really, it is the Commonwealth that is the taxing area but it is the States that have to do the educating and the skilling because we have a State school system that the Aboriginal people have to start to attend. The biggest problem we have is that a lot of them are not attending school. We have an attendance rate as low as 30 per cent in a lot of communities, and unless we encourage these children to attend school, this problem is going to perpetuate itself. Of course, the other thing that we have done is take them from, in some cases, not necessarily the Stone Age but at least from a non-European educated area rapidly into self-determination and looking after and managing their own communities. A lot of them find it very difficult. It is this area that we have been looking at, and we have recommended that extra funds be made available for extra training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One thing we have recommended is cadetships for senior staff. I think something like that would be excellent. As the Chairman says, they could either stay on in the community or go away and get the extra training that is needed. Certainly these people find it very difficult without this training. Most communities are practically 100 per cent welfare funded, and they have to handle an enormous amount of money. They are not used to coping with the sort of funds that they have to spend, and of course it is very difficult. Even we have a lot of trouble getting through the bureaucracy and doing things. I know that as a farmer the number of forms and things I have to fill out these days is mind-boggling. I have to spend about a day in the office each week, so we can imagine what it is like in these communities. These people have an enormous amount of work to do. I would like to support the Committee. I have enjoyed working on the Committee and I hope that the work we have done will help the people out there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, I present the Committee's report entitled The Discussion Paper on Broadcasting Regulation: A Critique, together with the minutes of proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2J4">Mr SAUNDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Committee report is a critique of the discussion paper Review of Broadcasting Regulation, a paper issued by the Department of Transport and Communications. The preface of the paper calls for public comment by 15 September this year. The only public comment the Committee can make is by report to the House. This report and critique is necessitated by concern that the discussion paper is a document of substandard quality which does not make a worthwhile contribution to substantial reform of broadcasting regulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee's 1988 report on the role and functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) was probably a status quo document. It was not deregulatory and gave the Tribunal a bit more regulatory power than it has at present. The discussion paper gives the Tribunal much more power. In fact, it gives the ABT virtually unfettered power. It is relevant to ask, then, why the Committee is so strongly critical of the discussion paper, which can be said to originate from the same stable of regulation as the 1988 Committee report. The reason is this: from the lack of precision in its stated aim in the preface, virtually right through section after section, the discussion paper is misleading, inconsistent, sometimes contradictory and proposes significant increases in the powers of the ABT based on unsubstantiated assertions or without any rationale. This is one of my major concerns with the paper. Its poor quality does a disservice to the cause of regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the Committee's major criticisms of the paper is that it is not what it purports to be. In several places the paper describes itself as being deregulatory. In broadcasting, regulation encompasses controls on the behaviour of licensees exercised by the Tribunal pursuant to legislation. Deregulation then should have an opposite meaning-the reduction or removal of these controls. </PARA>
<PARA> When one goes through the various sections of the paper it becomes clear that the whole tenor and thrust of options, proposals or suggestions is to increase controls or the power of the Tribunal over the behaviour of the licensees rather than to reduce such controls of such power. This conclusion applies mainly to existing services because it is difficult to deregulate that which does not exist. For services not yet introduced the extent of regulation can be gauged by the choice of options which result in more or less regulation. The regulation of Sky Channel, if not other video and audio entertainment information services, wider discretionary powers, performance reviews, a role in integrated planning and the trustee system all give the Tribunal more control over decisions of licensees. It is, therefore, incorrect to say that the paper gives the Tribunal different powers, not necessarily more powers. Such a view, and the description of the paper as being deregulatory, are impressionistic and are not based on a concept of what regulation means in broadcasting. As a consequence, they are misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> The structure of the Committee's critique corresponds very closely to that of the discussion paper. I do not propose to follow that structure but rather to highlight the major weaknesses of the paper. A major shortcoming of the paper is the absence of a clear relationship between the perceived problems and suggested solutions. This is very serious, because as a result there is no rational basis for the suggestions made. They are arbitrary. This deficiency exists in the section on objections in legislation and sanctions. The Committee report on the role and functions of the ABT supported the inclusion of policy objectives in legislation. The report said that by itself the inclusion of policy objectives in the Act will not clear uncertainty. Therefore, these objectives need to be accompanied by a more detailed ministerial statement which explains how government proposes to implement the broad policy objectives contained in the Act. Appropriate recommendations were made. </PARA>
<PARA> The real problem as identified in the discussion paper is that the lack of specific objectives has introduced tensions and uncertainties about priorities in the administration of the Act which could be avoided. Unless the Act specifies an overriding objective, the last thing objectives can do is to give any indication whatsoever about priorities. As recommended by the Committee, a ministerial statement can indicate priorities. This requires as a prerequisite the setting of objectives. To put in ministerial statements as optional or supplementary, as the paper does, is to put the cart before the horse. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst on the subject of objectives in legislation let me say that the discussion paper exaggerates their value. Objectives can be achieved in different ways, as with the one that facilitates and encourages the improvement of quality and diversity of programs and services. One way to achieve this objective is through competition. Another is by regulation. By itself, the setting of the objective has limited value. The worst area of arbitrariness in decision-making is in respect of sanctions where large and punitive increases in Tribunal powers are suggested without rationale. The punitive purpose is to punish and deter non-compliance. There is little relationship between the problems and solutions; the ills and cures. A perceived problem is that there have been no prosecutions for offences. It is a bit like saying that capital punishment has been unsuccessful because no-one has been hanged. </PARA>
<PARA> Another perceived major deficiency is a view that the ABT's current practical sanctions are not adequate. In other words, someone's unexplained view of inadequacy is transferred into a problem that requires attention. The quality of analysis on sanctions is abysmal, yet this is the basis for suggestions for increases in punitive powers based on punitive intent. Other examples of poor reasoning cover the module approach to legislation, wider discretionary powers and networking. The discussion paper favours a modular approach to regulation. In short, the proposed legislation would cover all broadcasting and broadcasting related services irrespective of the technology of delivery. The Act would have a central core of obligations applicable to all services covered and a number of modules of obligations applicable to a particular service. Each model would be in a different division of the Act and there would be different levels of requirement within each module. </PARA>
<PARA> It is apparent that under the modular approach the power to prescribe a type of regulation would pass from the Parliament to the Minister under regulation, or the Tribunal. This emasculation of institutional role is supported by the specious claim that the traditional method is expensive in its use of parliamentary resources and the trivial claim that the traditional method results in a repetition in legislation. Another example of poor quality of reasoning covers the wider discretionary powers associated with the removal of the exclusive licensing criteria. One argument for non-exclusiveness is that some public interest questions cannot be addressed by the exclusive criteria. I refer, for example, to the statement, `the personal qualities of employees which may be of fundamental importance to a broadcasting service'. The Committee is very disturbed by this example which appears to be an extension of the `fit and proper' criterion to each and every employee of a commercial broadcasting station. The example has a whiff of McCarthyism about it and could even impinge on the civil liberties of Australians employed in commercial broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA> The above quotation from the Committee critique is very provocative and is deliberately intended as such. It draws attention to the very dangerous road on which the discussion paper is travelling in its misguided attempts to increase discretion and remove repetition. Another serious shortcoming of the discussion paper is its inconsistency. Having argued for the modular approach to legislation, the paper turns around later and belittles the entire concept. It says that technological developments are leading inexorably to ever greater difficulties in defining modules and that such change is going to make regulation harder and harder in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Another clear inconsistency is on removing appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The argument used in the past and repeated in the paper is that the ABT is an expert body. Yet the paper argues against itself when it says the Tribunal makes many subjective, discretionary and value judgments. This admission takes much of the gloss from the expert body argument which is exposed for what it is-people with more than average knowledge pretending to be the font of all wisdom. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee critique of the discussion paper is a strong one, but we also offer some suggestions for improvement. One is accepting or rebutting the implications in the discussion paper about licences being held in public trust and not attracting property-type rights. If this means that profitability or economic viability is of no concern to the Tribunal when it sets standards or conditions arising from performance reviews or licence hearings, the Committee would disagree with it. Nevertheless, this extreme view serves to raise the question of what role there is for the Tribunal in improving quality, if the bottom line and the ratings which attach to it become so important. There is also the question of the role of competition vis-a-vis regulation. Competition is a concept recognised in the terms of reference of the Department's pay television report, yet it is absent from the discussion paper which talks about competition and free market mainly in the context of removing commercial viability as a licensing criterion. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times in Australia we have seen the creation and development of the Special Broadcasting Service and the introduction of aggregation. There is also the possibility of the introduction of pay television which, if delivered by cable, offers the possibility of public access channels. In other words, there is a short to medium term possibility of there being rapidly decreasing returns to scale on the increase of program diversity by regulation. It is something we suggest be kept in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> In my concluding remarks, I recognise that regulation of broadcasting is beset by obstacles. On reading some Tribunal transcripts I sense some frustration and concern over wastage of resources when licensees play the system but this is no excuse or reason for the discussion paper increasing regulation or for imposing punitive sanctions or for reducing accountability. What is required above everything else is clarity of analysis, clearly articulated identification of problems and clear connections between problems and suggestions for change. Resort to phrases such as `the public interest' are a poor substitute. This phrase, thrown around like confetti at a wedding in this area, represents nothing much more than the legitimisation of personal points of view. Protecting the public interest by avoiding undue concentration does nothing towards resolution of this mess. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want briefly to support the remarks of the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Saunderson), not to take the time of the House to repeat everything he said, but to say that I certainly agree with the proposition that the discussion paper produced by the Department of Transport and Communications is confused, lacks any real coherence and, above all, lacks any real philosophy. The Department gives one the impression in its discussion paper that it has no idea where it is going. In preparing this work it seems to have completely ignored the report of our Committee on the role and functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. It makes but scant reference to that work, passes by and goes on to talk about the need for deregulation but proposes measures which will, in fact, have the reverse effect and lead to still greater regulation of broadcasting in Australia. It talks about introducing regulation of video and audio entertainment information services and it gives the Tribunal wider discretionary powers. Of course, if we give the Tribunal wider discretionary powers inevitably that means that there will be greater regulation, perhaps to a limitless extent, imposed by a tribunal with those wide discretionary powers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Aston pointed out, the paper, I think particularly inappropriately, proposes an extension of the fit and proper provisions to every employee of a commercial broadcasting station and the Chairman quite rightly points out that that has a whiff of McCarthyism about it. Just imagine the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal determining whether individuals working in a particular television station are fit and proper people to hold those jobs. That is not the sort of society many of us in this House would want to live in. The discussion paper talks about performance reviews and so on; in other words, promoting what ultimately would lead to a substantial increase in the regulation of the whole of the Australian broadcasting system. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Department should be doing is producing an informed piece of work, perhaps in the form of a White Paper presented by the Minister, with a fundamental philosophy. The fundamental philosophy that that paper should embrace is the philosophy of deregulation, of competition, so ordinary people in their homes, in the evenings, can choose what they want to watch on television rather than have that imposed on them by some authority on high; so ordinary people can decide what they listen to on the radio rather than have politicians and regulators telling them what they have to listen to. At the end of the day, however, the point that the Department misses is that the new technology will simply wash away the regulators. With the advent of pay television, satellite television and other forms of communication, it cannot sustain that philosophy of regulation forever and a day. People in any case are tired of being told what to do and once the limited spectrum of radio and television is overcome with technology then frankly the regulators will wither away. </PARA>

<PARA>Preparations for marking the 1990 International Literacy Year will be launched in Canberra tomorrow by Mrs Hazel Hawke, who will become the patron for the year. The Government has formed the broadly representative national consultative council (NCC) to guide Australia's involvement in International Literacy Year. I am a member of that council, which is ably chaired by Mrs Margaret Whitlam. In fact, the council is meeting at this time. Tomorrow, 8 September, is International Literacy Day. It has been designated so since it was first declared by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in 1967. When the United Nations decided to set 1990 as International Literacy Year it gave carriage for the year to UNESCO. UNESCO has decided on six objectives for the year. They are as follows: to increase government action to combat illiteracy; to increase public awareness of the scope, nature and implications of illiteracy, as well as the means and conditions for combating it; to increase popular participation within and among countries in efforts to combat illiteracy; to increase cooperation and solidarity among member states in the struggle against illiteracy; to increase cooperation within the United Nations system in that struggle; and to use International Literacy Year for launching a plan of action for the eradication of illiteracy by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> In a media release for International Literacy Day tomorrow, the Director-General of UNESCO, Mr Frederico Mayor, called for large scale action to meet the challenges of illiteracy. `Education for all is the responsibility of all', he notes in his appeal. While everyone would understand that illiteracy is a major problem in a number of developing countries, it will come as a surprise to many that functional illiteracy is a significant issue in Australia. By functional illiteracy I mean the ability to cope with everyday reading and writing tasks in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, of course, our expectations of people's literacy capacities are higher than those in many other countries. For instance, we assume that all adults can manage all the forms that are put in front of them on a daily basis. But this is not always the case. A survey conducted by Judith Goyen in Sydney in the 1970s found that 10 per cent of Australians over the age of 15 were functionally illiterate. That is, they could not find simple information in the telephone directory or read a street map. The difficulties were by no means limited to people of non-English speaking background. One-third of the people were of English-speaking background. On 1986 census figures that 10 per cent is equivalent to over one million adults. I refer honourable members to an account of this survey in the Current Affairs Bulletin dated January 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The first truly national survey of adult literacy has just been completed and its findings will be published next month. However, we know already that the results are comparable with those found in a similar survey in Canada where the findings were that 25 per cent of the population was functionally illiterate. Interestingly enough, the worst results are in the over-50 age group. Perhaps literacy standards generally are not decreasing in the way that some would have us believe. Of course the consequences of inadequate literacy development are much more of a problem than they were, say, 50 years ago in Australia. We live in a much more print-saturated society and, while technology makes some things easier to operate, it also requires greater educational understanding to deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past literacy problems in adults were more hidden. Now we realise how much they affect people's lives today. One used to be able to hold down the same largely unskilled job for 40 years or so. With restructuring of the economy and the work force, retraining is becoming a reality for most workers. An article in the Business Review Weekly of 2 June this year was entitled `The Hidden Costs of Illiteracy'. It estimated that inadequate literacy skills are probably costing the Australian economy some billions of dollars each year. It further pointed out that 70 per cent of the work force in the year 2000 are already in the work force. In other words, literacy development is certainly not just an issue for schools. We have to make an appropriate provision for adults to pick up their basic education skills. Learning is not limited to childhood or to schools and we have to face the necessity for all of us to continue learning throughout our lives. I commend to honourable members a publication put out this year by the Commission for the Future called Lifelong Education Revisited. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a source of shame to many adults that their reading and writing skills are not as high as is commonly expected in this society. However, we all know that many things happen in the lives of children which may prevent them from learning during these years. It is important to know that it is quite possible for adults to develop literacy skills, just as we can learn other skills. Poor literacy skills do not mean that people are stupid. The removal of this sort of stigma is one of the things that International Literacy Year will set out to achieve. It is surely inhuman to deny people opportunities to develop their basic education just because things did not work out for them as children. The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) wrote into its policy in March of this year that:</PARA>
<PARA>All award restructuring negotiations include recognition of the significance of English language training specifically and literacy and numeracy training generally. </PARA>
<PARA>On another aspect of adult literacy difficulties, I refer to a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training of May 1988 entitled Getting to Work. It was an inquiry into the entry or return to the work force by social security pensioners. On page 41 the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>Additional funding for adult literacy programs is needed. It is not satisfactory to place people in training courses which are above their literacy competence. </PARA>
<PARA>We know much more about adult literacy development now for both children and adults than we did previously. Literacy is not a set of isolated technical skills but part of a person's general language development. The description given in ILY paper No. 2 is that literacy involves the integration of listening, speaking, reading, writing and critical thinking. It incorporates numeracy. It includes a cultural knowledge which enables a speaker, writer or reader to recognise and use language appropriate to different social situations. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend both ILY papers, Nos 1 and 2, to honourable members. The first is an introduction to the year which contains a great deal of useful information and the second contains the policy directions for the year as recommended by the NCC and accepted by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). Paper No. 2 lists eight goals and eight strategies for the year which the council is pursuing. The goals are: the recognition of the value of reading and writing; enhanced school literacy programs; expanded learning provisions; improved quality of adult literacy provision; greater public awareness and participation; international and regional awareness and activities; promotion of plain English; and effective links between education sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> These goals will be supported by the following strategies: an Australian literacy charter; a funded program for State and Territory ILY councils; Commonwealth and State-Territory literacy strategies; public awareness and participation strategies; interaction with international and regional strategy; a plain English strategy; and an evaluation strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> It sets down the four priority areas for funding: adult literacy; child and community literacy; public awareness; and international activities. The Government has committed $3m of new funding for ILY projects. The NCC has already recommended that Australia's international effort should focus on the South Pacific generally and Melanesia in particular. Papua New Guinea has an illiteracy rate of over 50 per cent and Australia, through its UNESCO connections, has already begun planning joint projects in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Within Australia the NCC is recommending national projects to support the development of long term literacy strategies. Schools will continue to carry the major responsibility for literacy development but child literacy programs need to be integrated with adult literacy programs as part of a continuing lifelong provision. All education sectors, from pre-school to tertiary, need to reinforce a literacy effort. For some adults, individual tuition is sometimes the most appropriate form of learning and trained volunteers can play a part in this provision. Community groups can support reading and writing experiences for adults and children. Public libraries have a vital role to play in encouraging reading. Industry, involving both employees and unions, has a responsibility to support the further education and training of workers and to communicate the literacy needs of the workplace to education authorities. We are all stakeholders in Australia's literacy development. </PARA>
<PARA> The other side of literacy education is the use of plain English in public documents so that we make information readable and accessible for people. This is another strategy called on by the NCC and is indeed something that we legislators should take particular notice of. The NCC also supports a resolution agreed to in the Senate at this time last year which calls for a national charter which endorses the right of all Australians to have the opportunity to acquire literacy and numeracy as part of a lifelong learning process. The recent national conference of the Australian Council for Adult Literacy held in Hobart in August was called `From Grass Roots to Green Papers'. Perhaps we need to develop a Green Paper on adult literacy policy in this country, as the issue is such a significant one for the future development of our human resources. In keeping with United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation objectives, the NCC has called for a plan of action for a literacy decade to be developed by the end of 1990. Perhaps on International Literacy Day in 1990 we will have a draft national agenda for literacy development in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, International Literacy Year presents us with a challenge. It is a challenge for this Parliament and indeed a challenge for the people of Australia. Let us, each of us, respond to this challenge in a meaningful way so that this particular year will make a meaningful contribution to the elimination of illiteracy worldwide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak both as an individual and on behalf of the Opposition today in supporting the motion moved by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). The advent of International Literacy Year next year is particularly welcome. Having spent all of my life, except for my pre-school years, involved in the education system in one way or another, I would like to say emphatically that the ignoring of the issue of literacy in this country is nothing short of a national tragedy. I would hope that one of the consequences of International Literacy Year will be the formation of programs to really meet the problem of literacy in Australia. I also acknowledge that the motion refers to Australia's international obligations in relation to literacy, and the Opposition supports this aspect. However, because of the very short time that is available today, I shall be concentrating my attention on the situation in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion recognises that significant numbers of Australian adults have difficulties with everyday reading, writing and numeracy activities and accepts that this causes major problems for the participation of such people in society. Those problems were acknowledged in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training report entitled Getting to work-Report of the inquiry into entry or return to the workforce by Social Security Pensioners, which the previous speaker referred to. I am very pleased he did. I actually chaired that inquiry and it is gratifying to know that somebody other than those who wrote the report have actually looked at it. I shall be referring to some of the detail of that report later in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially, I want to make particular reference to some concerns of Australian industry about literacy in Australia. The involvement of industry in education and training is something that we are very much concerned with these days. It is therefore noteworthy that the Confederation of Australian Industry, in facing the fact that it had an obligation here, put out a report in December 1988 called Skills Formation and Structural Change. As part of that report, in preparing that report, the Confederation undertook some surveys of employers, their views on their employees or potential employees, and made some very particular comment in relation to the education system. As the first line of people who have experience of the outcome of our education system, their comments are very noteworthy. In its report the Confederation says that it undertook a major study of the training efforts of Australian business, but in the process of that study it had some pertinent things to say on the subject of education. I am sure I speak for many Australians when I say that it is a matter of wonder to me that in a society so sophisticated and a society which pours such enormous resources into its education system, such large numbers of our young people are still leaving school illiterate. Whilst there has been talk for decades now about the need for attention to the subject of literacy, it seems that the progress is painfully slow. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember well those who were illiterate in my class when I attended school, and I regret to say that the general attitude in those days was that those young people were just stupid and were treated as such. It was after I had left the education system that the problem of, for example, dyslexia, real learning difficulties, emerged and that some attention was paid to it. As groups such as SPELD grew-bringing people's attention to specific learning difficulties as problems which could be overcome-I, for one, thought back to my school days and wondered how many of those young people who had effectively been just thrown on the social rubbish tip in fact had a problem that could have been addressed and cured, and were actually quite intelligent people. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the matter of the Confederation of Australian Industry report, it makes the statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The foundation stone of the entire education and training structure is the formal system of education. It is here that all learning later in life has its origins. Unless the formal system is capable of providing an appropriate educational background, employees will be unable to benefit from the training that is provided during their working lives after they have entered the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA> There is now wide agreement that a large part of what goes on within education institutions must be the provision of skills to young people so that they will be able to find productive employment within the economy. This is not the only aspect of education, but it is one of the most important. </PARA>
<PARA> Employing someone is a business decision. A job is offered along with the income that goes with it because the person offering the job and the income is looking for something in return. A job is a reciprocal arrangement in which money is paid out in return for labour services. Education and training is concerned with ensuring that individuals have labour services to offer. </PARA>
<PARA>In referring to its survey, the Confederation says:</PARA>
<PARA> The survey results indicate that there are problems with the adequacy of formal education in Australia . . . Young people have to be encouraged to leave school with skills rather than leaving, as many of them do today, with no more than a hope and a prayer. More needs to be done to ensure that education is about providing marketable skills that young people will be able to build upon throughout their working lives. Formal education must be seen as a base upon which other skills will be built, not as a final level of equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose the comment: it is nevertheless an assumption of this report that basic formal education is an absolute minimum for progress into the work force. The report says further that its survey of employers indicated that 60.6 per cent of respondents employed school leavers directly from school. Of those employers, 42.1 per cent were dissatisfied with the education of these school leavers. Amongst the specifics of their dissatisfaction are two really quite startling pieces of information. One was that 71.6 per cent of those employers found that their employees had inadequate communications skills, and 55.7 per cent found that their employees had inadequate numeracy skills. Such a high level of inadequacy of those basic social and employment skills is startling information indeed. I think we must be indebted to the Confederation of Australian Industry for having identified those facts. The reason I say that is that one of the things that plague the issue of literacy and those who have wanted to pay attention to it, is the lack of useful data available. Very few worthwhile surveys on the subject of literacy have been done. When the parliamentary committee I referred to earlier was conducting its inquiry into how to get long term social security recipients back into the work force, it constantly came up against the issue of literacy. It encountered it in direct submissions from organisations interested in literacy and also in conversations and interviews with employees of such government departments and bodies as Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES), all of whom acknowledged that we have a major problem with illiteracy, particularly amongst social security recipients, and that the measures used to address it to date simply have not been adequate. I refer again to and emphasise that section of the motion which points out that illiteracy disadvantages the participation in society of people with that problem. This report gives, in graphic detail, the specifics of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The report states that it is apparent that many people have literacy problems which they often manage to conceal. Whilst it may be possible to effectively undertake some jobs despite low literacy competence, the options for employment are limited. Evidence from the Wilston-Grange Adult Literacy Centre in Brisbane contained the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no point in putting on a whole lot of training courses to assist people getting back to the work force unless literacy is considered as a component and unless literacy is an issue in placing people in courses, so that people are asked to identify any literacy problems before they enter a course . . . CYSS for example, has run a course for unemployed youths, and after six weeks in the course they have discovered that the people are not doing very well in the course because they cannot read or write. They cannot take notes. </PARA>
<PARA> The abilities to read and write are not the only criteria on which a definition of literacy should be made. Literacy is seen by workers in the adult literacy field as a far broader concept which encompasses vital aspects of the person's ability to function as an adult individual and to achieve an acceptable and satisfying level of social integration. Current projections about literacy depend on surveys carried out by the Army in 1943 and by a Sydney researcher, Dr J. Goyer in the early 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA>That underlines what I was saying earlier about the real lack of attention that has been paid to this very real problem in Australia. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA>It is estimated from these surveys that 4 per cent of those from English speaking backgrounds were unable to read, even at a very simple level. </PARA>
<PARA>Those involved in the area believe it is really rather higher. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>This estimate would probably more than double if any written task were included in the test. The figure for those from non-English speaking backgrounds was 43 per cent. Therefore, even without considering ability to communicate in writing, 220,000 adults in Sydney alone might be unable to read. Using the same base it is estimated that in Victoria this could mean some 430,000 adults could have difficulty performing even the simplest reading tasks. Most of these adults do not receive any form of literacy tuition. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to point out the very practical difficulties that this lack of literacy skills brings to people particularly those with problems governing employment. I recommend that people look at those specific difficulties detailed in the report if they are interested in the subject of employment and social security payments in Australia. One recommendation in the report is that funds should be provided to gauge the effectiveness of existing adult literacy programs since limited resources have precluded follow-up research on them. Nevertheless, available information indicates that literacy programs are a cost effective means of increasing skills. Further, the report specifically recommended that research to assess the extent of literacy problems, particularly amongst unemployed people, should be undertaken through the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) and that the Commonwealth Employment Service should assess the literacy skills of people seeking training wherever appropriate. In fact, many CES workers become aware very quickly of the literacy problems of many CES clients, through their over the counter dealings with them, even when they are not required to read something to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year I received a letter from the Queensland Council for Adult Literacy expressing its concern on the subject of literacy programs. It pointed out that adult literacy programs in this State-and I am sure it is true of other States too-have largely been funded by money from the National policy on languages. The cutbacks in grants to the States have meant that those programs have been under severe threat. I, too, would like to express the Opposition's disappointment about the Government's apparent withdrawal from the national language policy-which it was slow enough in initiating-at a most inappropriate time. I hope that International Literacy Year may once again refocus the Government's attention on the subject of national language programs, and specifically on the excellent report-a landmark report-by a Senate standing committee several years ago, very little of which unfortunately has been enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> My information is that the funding for these literacy and numeracy programs under the national policy has been essentially directed to courses with a vocational purpose. They are quite short and people who are not seeking immediate employment do not have access to such programs. Therefore people who recognise that they have a literacy problem and want to do something about it in anticipation of future training actually cannot do anything to improve their literacy skills at that stage. I instance the particular problem of people on supporting parent's benefit. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training identified this group as being particularly at risk for remaining in social security dependency. </PARA>
<PARA> Those parents, frequently women with very low educational attainments because of past history of the education of girls in this country, may well recognise that they have a problem. Nevertheless, because they are rearing young children they are not able to actually enter into vocational training programs at that stage of their lives. Therefore, they are precluded from joining literacy programs under the national training program, because they are not yet able to enter work skill training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I think it is interesting to note the fairly recent concern of the Labor Party in New South Wales on this subject. Mr Carr's statement recently on his belief that there is a need for the reintroduction of formal grammar lessons and a renewed emphasis on the teaching of the classics in literature has been documented in the newspapers. I would like to refer to this briefly. The editorial in the Australian newspaper on this subject stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Carr's argument that language, and the mastery of language, are at the very heart of education, is surely right. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Carr took up the theme made popular by E. D. Hersch, in his best-seller Cultural Literacy, that it is in effect impossible for students to feel a mastery of their own destiny unless they are fully literate in their own culture. Indeed, this is also essential for a society to achieve sustained economic success. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> His argument for literacy is an argument against elitism. An education system that does not give everyone exacting instruction in essentials, he says, will lock out the poor as genuine competitors. </PARA>
<PARA>This underlines most of what I have been saying in my speech. The editorial, of course, acknowledges that Mr Carr's contribution is likely to bring him into conflict with certain powerful people in teachers unions. I hope that next year the debate that should take place in this community on the subject of literacy will override their views and that the community as a whole will have an opportunity to participate in the debate in order to make clear that it also believes what people have been saying now for years; that basic literacy is essential in our community. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House expresses its concern that the Australian Government has not been unequivocal in denouncing attempts by the Yugoslav Government to manipulate Australian community groups. </PARA>
<PARA>The Hawke Government has played a provocative and an almost dangerous game with the feelings and allegiances of community groups in Australia. During the Australian Bicentenary in 1988 the Australian Government endeavoured to gain favours from two particular groups of people-those of Yugoslav origin and those of Greek origin. It played an ambivalent game. These are Australians with a different background, settled here as part of the Australian community, people who have made a magnificent contribution to this nation. During the Bicentenary the House will remember the demonstrations and the violence connected with the visit of the President of Greece, and the way in which that was brought about. It was a scene that we had not previously witnessed in Australia. It is an expression of deep feelings and an allegiance of long ago that Australia has been unaware of. It is not part of Australia and yet the Government's actions, its equivocal and provocative attitudes, particularly those of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), have encouraged violence and demonstrations of a type we have not previously seen. This sort of activity, this wish to win votes from community groups of the Prime Minister, is part of his character. He is egocentric. He wants to be liked by everybody. In order to gain the maximum impact he tends to say the things people like to hear. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not work, but in this instance it is a most foolish way to behave. The Prime Minister's foolishness and the difficulty that lies ahead for the Australian community if those attitudes continue can be fully exposed if the background of this whole issue is exposed. Since the 1920s, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia have claimed a greater part of what is now northern Greece. Ancient Macedonia, it is claimed by the Bulgarians, was a single nation. That is true. But the fact that the Yugoslav and Bulgarian governments have claimed that it is Slavic is not true. The crunch of the presentation from both of those governments has been to promote activity amongst dissidents and communist party members right throughout the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since World War II, communist parties in Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Greece have worked together to endeavour to establish an area that they have referred to as a separate identity, an independent nation or state, called Macedonia. It is interesting to note that the Greek Communist Party has, in later years, dropped out of that process, which is encouraged by the communist parties of Bulgaria and of Yugoslavia. In passing, one should note that such a concept would produce, either for the Soviet Union or for Yugoslavia, a rich agricultural area which they could then claim. The capital of that area is Thessaloniki, a wealthy city. They would also have access to the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean. But that is not brought forward as part of the claims that Macedonia is Slavic. There has been a turmoil of ideologies and allegiances since the Second World War in the area that has made life for people living in that area extremely difficult. That has been played upon by the Yugoslav Government, manipulating people, trying to encourage a sense of patriotism, which is basically false, amongst the people of that area to achieve its objective of a separate nation and access to the Aegean. </PARA>
<PARA> The propaganda from Yugoslavia seeks to claim Macedonia and even goes to the extent of claiming that Alexander the Great was Slavic in origin. To us in Australia those arguments seem remote and irrelevant to the life we live, yet there they are intense. The arguments and propaganda deal with the language and work of Saint Cyril Methodius and their contribution to that region. It all seems remote. But within Australia, following this propaganda and encouraged by the Yugoslav Government, are people who seek to carry forward that propaganda in a most damaging and awful way that threatens all of the past, all of the history, of great groups of people within this nation. Initially it brings about conflict between Australians of Greek origin and Australians of Yugoslav origin. Yugoslavia as a nation has not been successful in dividing Greece or having the Greek people accept this proposition. After all the endeavours and propaganda following the Second World War the Greek people are as one. There are dissident voices here and there but they are as one, they are Greek and they do not wear the concept that there is a separate Macedonia which is Slavic and which should be established immediately. But the Yugoslav Government over the last few years has adopted a different approach and that is to bring pressure to bear on those communities outside the immediate region. Most of those communities can be found in the United States, in Canada or in Australia. We have seen over a period of five years or more continuing unrest, which has been supported by the Government of Yugoslavia, to create tension and dissent in the West with a view to bringing pressure to bear on that region and ultimately to achieve the objective of a Slavic Macedonia. It is a tragedy that such a primitive approach is being used in those countries, and concerns have been expressed in all of them about this problem-the division of communities in Canada, in the United States and in Australia. In fact, there have been some serious occurrences in those friendly countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party and the Prime Minister have basically acquiesced in this process. They have given solace or a sympathetic ear to people who make claims about their origins, or a community grant to people who feel out of things in Australia. Part of the Labor Party's approach to things is to give sympathy-not to disagree and not to agree but to comply with the propositions that have been put by community groups or activists. This tension in Australia has been basically under the surface. We have been able to cope with it. But the promoter of the world's greatest multiculturalism policy brought it right to the fore when, during the Bicentenary, he said, `We will not allow the Greek Government to call its brilliant exhibition Macedonian. We will remove that word from it; we will call it the Greek exhibition'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, by that single statement, rewrote history in the terms in which the Yugoslav Government wished to have it rewritten. That is why we had a response from the Greek community. It said, `Hey, hang on Prime Minister, you are promoting a greater Macedonia under the control of the Communist Party or at least under the control of the Soviet Union or Yugoslavia'. There was an immediate reaction from the Greek community in Australia seeking to have the Prime Minister change such a crass and stupid decision. The Prime Minister, from his own personal knowledge, should have realised what he was doing-he has stacks of advisers tucked away in all sorts of sections and groups within his Department-but he wished to curry favour. That is the point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy Speaker, the Prime Minister sought to curry favour in this regard by playing to the feelings of those people of Yugoslav origin who, encouraged by the Yugoslav Government, felt strongly about this issue. He withdrew the name Macedonia from that exhibition and when Australians of Greek origin responded he put it back. What was the result? Australians of Slavic origin reacted violently. Having thought the Prime Minister was on their side, they suddenly found he had changed his mind. He was not on their side at all. What a way to deal with the Australian community-manipulate groups which have strong allegiances and feelings of their heritage and origin, mixed up with world wars and goodness knows what. Here we have the Prime Minister playing at these games.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The President of Greece spoke here in this Parliament, in the Great Hall, and honourable members will remember that. The translation of his speech said, `Macedonia is Greek, and no Australian should forget it'. That is how strongly that visiting head of state felt about the treatment his nation had received at the hands of the Australian Prime Minister. He also went on to speak in a similar vein in other capitals of Australia. By the way, as Australian taxpayers, we finished up having the exhibition and paying for it as well. This was not the original intention; it was to be a gift from the Greek Government. It was a most brilliant exhibition, going back to the time of Alexander the Great and before. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, Greek Ministers have publicly and privately expressed a strong concern that there is ongoing activity within Australia by activists supported by the Yugoslav Government. That activity is going on to create turmoil and tension. Not only are those comments of Greek Ministers supported by Greek officials who are eminent civil servants, not committed to political parties, but they are also endorsed by leaders of Pasok, which is the socialist party, and-would you believe it-Communist Party members in Greece. They say that Australia has to be careful. The Australian Government needs to make it clear that political activity identified with a foreign government is not acceptable behaviour in Australia. The Prime Minister's intervention with the naming of that exhibition was strictly political and the results were political. It is nothing to do with culture; it is a political process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister should be warned that there is deep and abiding concern among members of the Greek community and the Greek Government, who have proof, so they say, of continuing activity here in Australia. It is not one political party in Greece-everybody knows of the turmoil of politics there-it is all political parties who are sounding this warning to Australia. I believe deliberate confusion has been created here by the Australian Prime Minister and it should stop. </PARA>

<PARA> I also draw to the attention of the House the fact that in this area, tragically, it seems there may be a member of parliament also involved in communications between the Yugoslav Government and community groups. There have been reports in the press over the last month or so. I call on the Prime Minister to sort out that matter. If that is the case, it is dreadful. Members of parliament take an oath of allegiance; they are Australian citizens. What I want to see happen is for the Greek community not to react to the provocation from Yugoslavia and for the Yugoslav community to be aware that it is being manipulated from outside. They need to be cautious. Madam Deputy Speaker, a word of advice for the Prime Minister; we will go back to Alexander the Great. This is the code of behaviour the Australian Prime Minister-any Australian Prime Minister-should abide by. Alexander said:</PARA>

I classify them using only one criterion: virtue. For me every virtuous foreigner is a Greek, and every evil Greek worse than a barbarian. If differences ever develop between you, never have recourse to arms, but solve them peacefully. If necessary, I shall be your arbitrator. You must not consider god like an autocratic despot, but as a common father of all, so that your behaviour may resemble the life siblings have in a family. On my part, I shall consider you all equal, whites or blacks, and I wish you would be not only subjects of the commonwealth, but participants and partners. As much as this depends on me, I shall try to bring about what I promised. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the words of Alexander and those are the words the Prime Minister needs to take to heart instead of strutting the stage and causing difficulties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me first state that I am the first migrant of non-English-speaking background to be elected to the House of Representatives. I hope that many will follow, but I also hope that those who follow me will not have to defend themselves against attacks of disloyalty, double loyalties or some imputed disloyalties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been elected as the member for Hotham four times. It was a blue ribbon Liberal seat and we took it from the Liberals. I thrashed the conservative candidates in three successive elections, which, of course, hurt them. Each time, time and again, in the propaganda in their blue leaflets, they referred to my old name, which I changed in 1959 by deed poll because my brother, who came here before me, changed his name. They misspelt and distorted my name in order to ridicule me and my foreign origin. They distributed unsigned leaflets stating that I owed allegiance to a communist country and even went as far as calling me a communist spy. I mention in passing that my office has been wrecked. It is a yearly event; it occurs at least once or twice a year. The Ustasha organisation sets out to wreck my office, to throw paint, to paint `communist spy' on the walls of my house, on cars parked outside, or on my office. It has been well reported in the press. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me establish my credentials. I was born and reared in Yugoslavia. I left Yugoslavia after I married in 1948. I migrated to Israel, where I lived until 1954 and I then came to Australia. My loyalties and the loyalties of my family are first and foremost to Australia and the Australian people. I have lived here for the longest part of my life. I left Europe at an early age after living through all the horrors caused by people who want to divide nations. We just heard an example of that here today. A failed shadow Minister tried to resurrect old ethnic divisions and bring them into this country, and accused the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of doing that. Well, it is not on. I can assure the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) that Greeks, Yugoslavs, Macedonians, Turks and Bulgarians-wherever people come from-work shoulder to shoulder in factories, on building sites and in the offices of this country. The great majority of us consider ourselves first and foremost Australians and are looking to the future to build a homogenous Australian nation. No matter what our origin-Irish, Yugoslav, Macedonian or Greek-we are first and foremost Australians, and we will not swallow that hook. So do not let the honourable member cast those nets and attempt to create divisions. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been talk of my having double loyalties. If I had double loyalties, that would not be so bad either, even though I say I do not and that my loyalty is to Australia. I come from a country where the majority of the population fought in the First World War with the English, French and Australian forces against the Kaiser's Germany. In the Second World War, the whole population of Yugoslavia-except for a few thousand quislings and traitors like the Ustasha or the Chetniks-fought with the allied forces. Now, in that respect, there is nothing to be ashamed of in relation to the country I come from. I supported it in its fight for freedom in which the population of Yugoslavia gave three million dead in the cause of the allied war effort. </PARA>
<PARA> I hold no brief for the Yugoslav Government or for its diplomats but I want to say that the policy of the Yugoslav Government is known to me because I discussed with officials of Foreign Affairs in Belgrade, when I visited, the problem of Macedonia, Greece and other minorities. But the official policy, I was told, is for the status quo on the Balkans and good relations with Greece. So, there is no intention on the part of Yugoslavia to stir up trouble and there is even less intention on our part because, of course, we have migrants from 130 different nations. Just let me see what the Prime Minister thinks of that. I was the first to ask the question here in this Parliament back on 28 November concerning the shooting at the Sydney consulate, when I asked the Prime Minister to ensure that the matter would be investigated fully and that the person or persons responsible be dealt with according to Australian law. Now, let me just read that part of the Prime Minister's answer which concerns the accusations of the honourable member for Mitchell. I beg your pardon. I made a mistake. I did not intend to call him honourable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw that. I am quoting the Prime Minister:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>As I said on Friday, we do not want to see Australia become a battleground in terms of people trying to live out and act out ancient rivalries that may still, to some extent, bedevil their places of origin. Our policy of multiculturalism presumes an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia in which people see themselves first and foremost as Australian. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the Prime Minister. The honourable member probably disagrees with that because he wants to see divisions but he will not succeed, I can assure him. Now, of course, there were other accusations that the Yugoslav Government set up some secret service here. It was bandied about in the press. The other night I heard the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred) or the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price)-I do not know which-accuse the Government of not taking any notice of what these Yugoslav diplomats are doing. I would remind both honourable members that I do not know in what year the Yugoslavs established consulate activities in this country but I was here in the late 1950s and they certainly were here in the 1960s. They were here between 1975 and 1983 and in all those years the mates of the honourable member were in government. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, did he have any knowledge of any untoward activities or did it happen yesterday? There was division in the Yugoslav community. There were activities in the Yugoslav community of Croat separatists, of fascist, former Chetniks with allegiance to quisling times during the Nazi occupation, and of course the Government of the honourable member did nothing about accusations that the Yugoslav Government interferes. Nor has it done anything about accusations that we have war criminals active here. It has done nothing at all; it has just disregarded the whole matter and yet terrorist activities took place. In 1962 HOP, the Croat liberation movement, was training here. I can show honourable members a leaflet of which I was the author. It was called `War criminals in Australia' and it contains a photo of people with the Ustasha emblem on an Australian armoured car. </PARA>
<PARA> Going back further, in 1964 there was an incursion of armed men into Yugoslavia with nine from Australia. They were all members of the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood, HRB. They were caught and they were dealt with there. In 1972 19 armed terrorists went into Yugoslavia and killed a number of Yugoslav citizens before they were apprehended; nine of them were from Australia. In 1964 a gentleman called Lesic was referred to by a former Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, who said: `When the bomb went off and blew off his two legs, the bomb he was carrying to put at the Yugoslav Consulate, he hoisted himself on his own petard'. </PARA>
<PARA> There were various and numerous bombings of consulates. In 1981 training of armed men took place. One group came to court, and Judge Thorley of the Sydney District Criminal Court sentenced Jure Mavic to four years imprisonment. But let us read what Judge Thorley had to say. He was reported in the Age of 10 October 1981, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>``This Commonwealth has been used more than once for training people in sabotage, guerrilla warfare and the ways of revolution for the purpose of going to a foreign country to exhibit that training. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Ethnic pride and culture has nothing in common with the sort of evil secret societies of which we have heard in this trial. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Yugoslav consuls, when issuing visas, look at whom they issue them to, especially their former nationals, I do not blame them. Our own chief immigration officer, a very fine lady in Paris, said that they have a problem in tracing Armenians because there may be a terrorist element among them and they do not issue them visas to come here to blast the Turkish consulates. We do the same thing; of course we look into visa applications. </PARA>

They describe organisations which take part in anti-Yugoslav activities. What he was saying is bull. I offer to arrange for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) or his nominee to come into a Yugoslav welfare office and, at random, check the files or look at all the files, provided there is some guarantee of privacy to people, because people go there for pensions and on social security and other matters. But I will not let people in this coward's castle attack social workers who are trying to help the community, and claim that some illegal or untoward activity is occurring. We could ship all those files to Moscow, Paris, London or Belgrade and no-one could use them because there is nothing on a welfare file other than the name of the person, his problem and where he was referred. It will state whether he has received a pension or whether his immigration problem has been fixed up. There are no political notations. There is nothing on any individual, let alone an organisation. Any individual who would be anti-Yugoslav would not come to Yugoslav welfare anyway because it is called the Australia-Yugoslav welfare society.</PARA></TALK.START>

There are nearly half a million people who settled here from Yugoslavia, and about the same number from Greece.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on a matter which I believe could alter the fabric of Australian society. The very base of democracy in Australia is being eroded by apathy, ignorance and a general malaise by certain members of a political party. What I am talking about is the takeover of the Liberal Party by the New Right. I do not agree with the Liberals on many issues but we need in Australia at least two parties with views that differ and with variations in philosophical ideals. We definitely do not need a party of extremists and zealots, a party which is ruled and manipulated by the driving force of ambition and greed. I believe that the New Right has hijacked the Liberal Party. It has infiltrated its branches and support organisations. After the next election, when the New Rightists are within the Liberal Federal Caucus, they will strike and they will rule with an iron fist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important that we recall what Liberal leaders in the past have had to say about this once great Party, a Party that is now crumbling through deceit, treachery, bribery and downright lack of moral rectitude: I would like to quote from three Alfred Deakin lectures, each from a different decade in Liberal Party history. In 1967 Harold Holt said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal Party says that once an endorsed candidate is elected by the people as a Member of Parliament he represents the whole of the people in his electorate and is not subject to any directions from the Party's organisation. When he becomes a member of the Parliamentary Liberal Party he, with his colleagues, is expected to implement the Party's Platform, but is favoured with complete freedom of action without any attempt to coerce him. </PARA>
<PARA>In the 1973 Alfred Deakin Lecture, Phillip Lynch said:</PARA>
<PARA>At its core, liberalism stands for the dignity of the individual: his rights to liberty, to justice and to self-fulfilment. It stands not only for freedom of choice, but also for encouraging positively the conditions under which the individual can achieve fulfilment. And it believes that the rights and freedoms of each citizen should be guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA>... ... ... </PARA>
<PARA>The guiding principle of Liberalism in this endeavour is that freedom to make the great decisions of one's life according to one's conscience is a necessary and vital condition for achieving this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>... ... ... </PARA>
<PARA> Men and women can only grow to their full moral stature when they control their own lives. </PARA>
<PARA>In the 1983 Alfred Deakin Lecture, Andrew Peacock said:</PARA>
<PARA> Four years ago in delivering the Sir Robert Menzies Memorial Lecture, honouring another great Australian Liberal Prime Minister, I took the opportunity to spell out what I believe to be the fundamental principles of Liberalism. Those principles have not basically changed since they were first developed in the great liberal democratic movements of Europe and America over two hundred years ago. They were principles which Alfred Deakin passionately believed in. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> . . . key elements of Liberal philosophy are:</PARA>
<PARA> The right to individual freedom and choice in all aspects of human endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Leader of the Federal Liberal Party, I see it as the responsibility of myself and all members of the party not just to re-state but to promote our basic principles. </PARA>
<PARA>Why have the members of the Liberal Party forgotten this fundamental precept of their own philosophy? Madam Deputy Speaker, Bruce Petty summed it all up with a cartoon in the Age on Saturday, 17 June 1989. There is a castle parapet which has the Liberal Party written on it. It has a flag flying over it with `Compassion' written on it and the present Leader of the Liberal Party is looking down at a large wooden dinosaur with `New Right Candidates' written on its side. It is a wooden horse; a present, gift-wrapped, that will ultimately destroy the Liberal Party as we know it today. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a brief look at how the New Right is taking over the Liberals: Roger Shipton, beaten by Costello; David Hamer, beaten by Rod Kemp; Ian Macphee, beaten by David Kemp; Chris Puplick, beaten in the Senate position by Bronwyn Bishop; James Porter, beaten by Ian McLachlan; Ken Aldred, forced to move by the insecurity of Julian Beale; Charles Copeman, candidate for Phillip. All of these new candidates are New Right members. Yet we have John Howard saying he rejected the New Right tag. A press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Federal Opposition Leader John Howard today denies the weekend preselection dumping of three Liberal Party members in Victoria reflected a move to the Right within the party. ``I will not allow for a moment that we have become a bunch of right wingers''. </PARA>
<PARA>Another gem from the Liberal Party stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney said today he would quit the party if he felt it was lurching to the extreme right . . . </PARA>
<PARA> ``I'd be worried if those changes were pushing in the direction of extremism. In fact, I would resign . . . I would have no truck with it.''</PARA>
<PARA>What utter stupidity for him to say that members of the New Right are within the Liberal Party; they are waiting to seize the opportunity to take it over. The erosion of the Liberal Party's key principle-that is, a Liberal parliamentarian is favoured with complete freedom of action without any attempt to coerce him-has happened very suddenly. On 12 April 1988 a press report states that John Howard gagged his Ministers from speaking. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition Leader, Mr Howard, yesterday gagged all his shadow ministers from speaking out on consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Howard said later:</PARA>
<PARA>All shadow Ministers must refrain in future from expressing their personal views for or against the introduction of a broad-based indirect tax. </PARA>
<PARA>The President of the Liberal Party, John Elliott, said:</PARA>
<PARA>What we want to do is say to both the parliamentary members and organisational members that loyalty is a very important part of the process of winning government. </PARA>
<PARA> If there are people who step right out of line, the people believe then they will be brought to task. </PARA>
<PARA>Is this freedom of the individual or is it a threat?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us see what happened after the pre-selections in Victoria. A newspaper article is headed: `Libs' rank and file told to hush up during preselections'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Liberal Party yesterday gagged its branch members and officials from making public statements during preselection. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for freedom of the individual. And this quotation on free speech is a real lulu. After the Liberal Party State Council, Ms Cathy Dossetor said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the motion would stop the `wholesale holding of the party to ransom in the press' by a few `for their own selfish reasons'. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how many honourable members were listening to the radio in the mornings during the Goldstein preselection but every day when I got up I was horrified and angry. All I wanted to do was go down and punch a few people in the mouth. Is this the Liberal Party or is it some South American dictatorship? We were all aware of the lies, the conniving, the deceit and treachery committed by some members of this House when they brought down John Howard. The smirking and gloating that we were subjected to on our television were pointers to the direction in which the Liberal Party is heading. Here are just a couple of comments from letters:</PARA>
<PARA> What hope has this nation in the battle against anarchy when the major alternative government is led by men who have given their pledged word and then, in some cases, not only broken it but have sat at the table with the leader they were advanced in secretly plotting to destroy?</PARA>
<PARA> The devious connivance, backstabbing and disloyalty shown to John Howard make me shudder to think I voted for them to lead the Australian Government. No longer. </PARA>
<PARA>These two examples echo the many feelings of people around this nation. The Right is moving and yet members of the Liberal Party remain mute. What is the matter with them! There are a few more pieces of the whole picture. One article states:</PARA>
<PARA>The comments by Victoria's Liberal Party president, Mr Michael Kroger, that his party `will not forget' those businessmen who `get into bed with the Labor Party' were silly and are likely to prove counter-productive. </PARA>
<PARA>Threats again, Mr Kroger. Other headlines included, `Liberal membership takes a dive' and `Lib branch exodus on Macphee'. The latter article began:</PARA>
<PARA>Liberal Party branches in the Victorian electorate of Goldstein have experienced another rash of resignations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Another headline was `I didn't know of bribe'. Of course we have the most telling photograph of all. It is a picture of Andrew Peacock in front of the latest Liberal slogan that reads `A fair go for families'. However, his body blocks out the first four letters of `families' and it reads `A fair go for lies'. A picture is worth a thousand words. Some of the words I have used in this speech are words that I fervently hope do not come true. I want Australia to remain a democracy. I want the people to be able to have a choice. But let there be no mistake: if the New Right gets control, there will be no choice. Its views will be imposed on everyone and there will be no longer that key Liberal principle, the freedom of speech. I say to those in the Liberal Party who are not coerced by the New Right, `fight!'. I would like to read a few paragraphs from a poem by Dylan Thomas, which I believe sums it all up. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Do not go gently into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light. </PARA>
<PARA> Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night. </PARA>
<PARA> Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The events of the past two weeks have revealed the utter poverty in integrity and moral decency of the present Labor Government in Western Australia. I hope that all members of this House will join me in expressing condemnation of a government that has abused its power and conferred privileges on private individuals and firms with regard for neither the limits of proper government action nor accountability to the taxpayers of Western Australia. Under the Burke and Dowding governments, Western Australia has seen the endemic growth of a new form of political corruption which has made old style gambling, racing, development and prostitution scams, such as those considered in the report of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct, look mild-although no more desirable for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This new form of corruption is not only a corruption of individuals, which we should not be surprised to hear about occasionally, but a corruption of the very processes of government which were designed to protect citizens from the illegitimate use of public authority and public funds. One dictionary defines corruption as `to make rotten', `pervert', `make evil', `bribe' and `spoil by mistakes'. It is in this sense, as a perversion of the power and processes of government, that the present Government of Western Australia is corrupt. The essence of this form of corruption is not that it may be illegal or capable of judicial determination, but that it is morally wrong and destructive of the legitimacy of the democratic procedures which are the basis of all government in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Australian Labor Party won power in Western Australia in 1983, the incoming Premier, Mr Burke, outlined a new model of entrepreneurial government which would actively participate in the private sector. He claimed that it would take advantage of the opportunities to earn money through direct investment in private projects and the more efficient use of public resources through the sale of unproductive assets and the corporatisation of public authorities to limit the taxation drain on the public purse flowing from the large expenditure programs which Labor had promised. The corporate path was presented as an innovation which would save the interventionist state from stagnation and collapse by introducing the benefits of private enterprise operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects of taking this innocent sounding path have been disastrous. The Government, which was supposed to be an independent umpire of private activity, has become an active participant in the very activities from which it should have remained aloof. Inevitably, as a result the Government has become enmeshed in failing business enterprises and is exposed to the real world of competition in the private sector. It has been drawn into using its legislative powers to give it a competitive advantage in those business dealings. Indeed, abuse of power becomes almost inevitable since the Government has a conflicting obligation to the taxpayer to protect the funds which it has invested in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Labor the umpire has become a participant in the game. This has been corruption of the very fabric of government. The State Government's bailing out of Rothwells Ltd was the culmination of this corporatist approach to government, not the beginnings of the Burke Government's problems as some apologists for that exercise would have us believe. From the minute that the Government decided to become a participant in the private sector, something like the Rothwells fiasco and what followed was inevitable. After the 1987 stock market crash the Government decided to provide a $150m guarantee to a private corporation, Rothwells, to prevent its collapse. Since the collapse of Rothwells would have had serious political consequences and would see the $150m government guarantee for loans to Rothwells called upon, the Government was willing to go to any length to support that company. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxpayers of Western Australia, including firms in competition with Rothwells, had become the means by which a private firm sought to avoid the consequences of its own folly. That folly was widely appreciated amongst the wider business community, which avoided all dealings with Rothwells. To extricate itself from the dire risk of its political future the Government became involved in, some would say initiated, the plan to purchase the rights to build a petrochemical plant at Kwinana from Mr Laurie Connell and Mr Dallas Dempster. The plant itself did not even exist. Some land had been purchased and some construction contracts had been let on the basis of plans which were still being developed. However, the total price paid for the project was $400m, of which the State Government paid $175m for a 43.5 per cent share in the project. A further $1.2 billion was required to complete the project. </PARA>
<PARA> It was said at the time that the project was nothing more than a convenient means of providing funds to Rothwells so that the Government guaranteed loan to the National Australia Bank could be paid out. This supposition was supported by the fact that while Mr Dempster received $50m for his half-share in the project, Mr Connell received $350m for his half-share which just happened to be the amount which he paid directly to Rothwells to purchase a portfolio of non-performing assets consisting largely of loans to companies associated with Mr Connell. The money was then used to meet Rothwells debts. There is little doubt that the petrochemical project was not worth the $400m paid for it. An amount of 175m of taxpayers' money was given to a private individual to allow him to meet the debts of a private company to save the political scalp of the Western Australian Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence is now mounting that the State Government was to introduce value to the project through more government guarantees. Not only was the existence of any form of guarantee to the project denied by the Government, but it would seem that those guarantees which Bond Corporation maintained did exist might well have been unconstitutional. The current Premier and other Ministers were intimately involved in all negotiations relating to the project and the final attempt to save Rothwells from liquidation. Now, both Rothwells and the petrochemical project have collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> Grave allegations about the actions of the State Government have been made by one of its former partners. Virtually every criticism which was made of the Government's involvement in these deals has been vindicated. It is possible that the Premier, his deputy and one other Minister seriously misled the State Parliament on the question of a government guarantee for the petrochemical project. The increasingly desperate Premier, Mr Dowding, has made ridiculous allegations about a link between his political opponents and Bond Corporation which, incidentally, have no bearing on the serious allegations against his Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the costly mess in which Mr Dowding's contortions have landed the State, he should do the right thing and stand down, as better men have done in less pressing circumstances. Lest anyone think that Labor has made but one mistake by bailing out Rothwells, and that all of its contortions relate to this one mistake, I remind the House of the Teachers Credit Society bailout, the Midland abattoir and brickworks scandals, the Anchorage development, the problems with the casino, the operations of the Western Australian Development Corporation and Exim Corporation, the Swan Building Society bailout and the Bell Group buyout. They are just a few of the controversial business involvements of this Western Australian Government. I do not have time to deal with them in detail today. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that many Government members are as disturbed as I am about the activities of the Government in Western Australia. In recent times Senator Button and Senator Walsh have expressed reservations about their colleagues in Western Australia. It is a tragedy that the good name and standing of Western Australia as a place of opportunity and some enterprise has been undermined by the reckless actions of a corrupt government. I realise that a commitment to the Labor Party puts some Government members in a difficult position when considering the failings of some members of that Party. However, I urge those with a genuine commitment to the basic principles of democracy in this country, which I hope most of us share, to wash their hands of the Dowding Government. If events in Western Australia lead to an early election, Government members should at least refrain from campaigning for a government which has undermined the credibility of both the Labor Party and the State. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use the recent keynote message of Dr Bill Keepin, a visiting energy analyst from the United States, as the theme of my grievance debate speech today. Dr Keepin spoke at a conference held in Melbourne in July, about solutions to the greenhouse warming of our oceans and atmosphere caused by industrial and domestic pollution. His message was as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to suggest that Australia, which was once a leader in solar technology, ought to reinstate itself as a leader and develop its vast renewable resources and show the rest of the world what is possible. </PARA>
<PARA>He pointed out that solar technology, used in conjunction with saving energy through efficient equipment and conservation, must be an essential ingredient of any future energy strategy. He used the example of the use of new energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs which last much longer than the normal domestic light bulb. Whilst it is true that the new fluorescent bulbs cost around $30 each, compared to about $1 for the present incandescent bulb, savings in both electricity bills and energy are considerable. It must also be appreciated that, if mass produced, the new fluorescent light bulb would be considerably cheaper than its present comparatively high price. He also pointed out that, while reducing energy through using more efficient methods is vital, eventually a new source of energy will have to be developed. It is important to say that he got a great deal of support from his audience of over 400 people when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Renewable energy is a very important opportunity for the future. In the United States we find that potential energy supply from renewable sources could be multiplied by twelvefold by the year 2010. It turns out that this is more than all the energy consumed in the United States today. The potential for the renewables is there to supply all the energy in the United States. That, by the way, is without any increase in hydro-power-that's coming from windpower, solar power, and geothermal and others. </PARA>
<PARA>But, even more importantly, he referred to scientific studies which indicated that photovoltaic cells have great possibilities and that by the year 2000 we could have photovoltaic electricity for about 5c per kilowatt hour. It is interesting to note that the basic needs for photovoltaic energy are sand and sunlight, both of which are most abundant in Australia. Again, I quote from Dr Keepin's conference address:</PARA>
<PARA>I would just like to compare sand with uranium. The lure of nuclear power has been that a gram of uranium gives a lot of energy-about 3,800 kilowatt hours if it is converted to plutonium and cycled through a fast-breeder reactor. However, a gram of silicon in solar cells can produce about 3,300 kilowatt hours which is comparable. Furthermore silicon is 5,000 times more abundant than is uranium. </PARA>
<PARA>In this respect I would draw attention to the fact that it is proposed to devote $600,000 and six staff years within the budget of the Australian National Science and Technology Organisation for research into laser enrichment of uranium. Since only $21,000 had been spent in the previous financial year, this amounts to an increase of almost 300 per cent. Surely it would be more productive and more in keeping with the environmental statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) if this money were spent on the research and development of renewable energy sources. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall energy research and development picture is even worse. Total outlay for 1989-90 for energy research and development is $32.5m. Due to the fact that expenditure on renewable energy is spread across a number of program areas, it is difficult to be completely precise. But in December 1987 the Government promised an additional $5m over five years for research into renewable energies on top of existing programs. Of this amount, $3m was committed last year. The Budget Papers, however, show the estimated expenditure for renewable energy research from the renewable energy research trust account, RERTA, for 1989-90 is $900,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Some funds may also come from the general energy research budget as some projects funded by other programs may also involve research into renewable energy, but this will not amount to anything significant. Clearly these figures amount to chickenfeed when compared to the $57m devoted to the support of nuclear energy programs and the overall energy research and development budget. </PARA>
<PARA> One positive aspect is the announcement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that funding for energy conservation and energy efficiency promotion for 1989-90 will be $1m, which is double the 1988-89 figure of $0.5m, but it is still an appallingly low figure in view of both the economic and CO2 emission savings which can be obtained through increased energy efficiency, as outlined in Dr Keepin's address. It is particularly unfortunate that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, which had been involved in the development of renewable energy, decided in 1981 to cease work in this area of research. One pleasing aspect of the Government's initiatives though, as I have said before, was the statement by the Minister, Mr Kerin. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the greatest problems in gaining support for renewable energy sources is overcoming the energy status quo. While the energy establishment continually claims that renewable energy sources are not economically viable, what is conveniently ignored is the fact that traditional energy sources are most often heavily subsidised. The International Energy Agency, in a recent report on Australia, has said that the electricity and gas utilities are charging artificially low prices. In an article in Australian Society, Professor Ian Lowe has argued that when it became apparent that electricity capacity was excessive, the electricity authorities engaged in two strategies: retiring of plant prematurely, even if it had been expensively refitted; and aggressive electricity marketing, where several authorities have offered financial incentives in an attempt to halt the move towards solar water heating. He makes the point that if the sales campaigns are successful in increasing electricity use, this is likely in turn to be used to justify building still more power stations. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Mark Diesendorf, President of the Australian Wind Energy Association in Canberra, has argued that unsubsidised wind and solar power cannot compete with the massive subsidies provided for fossil fuels and that if proper pollution controls were to be instituted, renewable energy is likely to be economically competitive in many cases. He has called for penalties to replace the subsidies such as resource depletion and pollution taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, unfortunately, spends very little on the research and development of renewable energy sources, and I have already pointed that out. The plain fact is that from being a world leader in renewable energy research and practical application, Australia has dropped far behind and is near the bottom of the ladder in per capita terms. Research commitment to the renewable energy area needs to be increased but this must also be accompanied by the allocation of resources to develop political strategies for Australia; to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels; and to increase the efficiency and productivity with which it uses energy. I hope that the Government and the Ministers responsible will take account of the comments I have made and do something to improve our research into renewable energy sources. We have abundant supplies in Australia which can be exploited. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today relates to the building industry. In the last few weeks we have had a great deal of hand-wringing and declarations of war and the like against the airline pilots, and perhaps a lot of the concern felt about the quite unacceptable behaviour of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is understandable. However, it is interesting that the airline pilots would be targeted in this way while rorts and ramps and, in many cases, standover and illegal behaviour in the building industry go on unaddressed. The building industry in this country has an absolutely appalling record, and through the last 6 1/2 years of the Hawke Labor Government not one single thing has been done to address the catastrophic state of the building industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It took the Master Builders Association of Australia to sponsor the writing by Professor Ireland of the report entitled Improving Work Practices in the Australian Building Industry. This report really has some quite fascinating conclusions, especially those which compare the efficiency of our building industry with the building industries of the United States and the United Kingdom. We just have to look at some of the comparative statistics to see that on the face of it we have fundamental problems in our building industry. The average time lost through industrial disputes in our building industry was 17 per cent of all days worked. The average time lost through inclement weather, in a country which has a great reputation around the world for very good weather, was a further 10 per cent of all days worked. Yet if we look at the days lost through industrial disputes in the United Kingdom and the United States, the figure was less than one per cent of all days worked and, as Professor Ireland says, `closer to nought per cent than to one per cent'. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the number of days lost to inclement weather in those countries-and, heaven forbid, everybody knows that the United Kingdom in particular has miserable weather; that is why many people originally migrated to Australia-the number of days lost is only 2.1 per cent of all days worked. Just remember, that compares with 10 per cent of days lost as a comparison with days worked in the Australian building industry. The average cost of time lost in Australia over and above the United Kingdom and the United States amounted to 15.4 per cent of total project cost in this country. Put in another way, it means we are 15.4 per cent more uncompetitive than Britain or the United States. It means that is how much more we pay for buildings to be constructed in this country than is paid in those countries, and that obviously imposes a very real cost on the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Ireland pointed to some quite remarkable industrial practices in addition to these things I have referred to in our building industry. He talked of the refusal of workers to walk on surfaces made wet by rain as they proceeded to a dry area of work. The fact that workers cross wet pavements, Professor Ireland said, while walking to the job site is not seen as relevant. He added:</PARA>
<PARA> There was then a refusal to put planks down on the wet earth, in order to make it a safe area on which to walk, because men would have to walk on the wet earth in order to put the planks down and this is dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA> Some sites reported workers playing football in their lunch hour in the rain after refusing to work. </PARA>
<PARA>It is just pathetic and nothing has been done about this, even since Professor Ireland produced his important report. There are other examples such as the start-up times for cranes:</PARA>
<PARA> A practice which is universal in some cities is the payment of an additional two hours to crane drivers to be positioned in their cabin ready for work in the morning. As it seldom would take more than ten minutes to climb the tower and be positioned, this is totally unjustified. </PARA>
<PARA>Just imagine a crane driver taking two hours to climb up into his cabin on the crane. That is what he is paid for, and this is simply evidence of a rort which is taking place in the industry. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly no restructuring has taken place at all. Professor Ireland talks about what are known as special food allowances. Some projects reported homers-that is, paid days off-having been taken because workers demanded special food at smoko or lunch in such amounts and at such short notice that it could not be supplied. Extreme application of the no ticket no start principle is another problem. On some sites Professor Ireland pointed out an extreme application of the no ticket no start principle that has occurred. Even taxi drivers making deliveries to the site have been refused a delivery point if they are not a member of a building industry union. I could read and read but the point, I think, is a very simple one: nothing has been done to address these fundamental issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has also been in recent years a quite massive growth in the practice of so-called over-award payments through the device of site allowances in the building industry. These site allowances are way outside the guidelines of the accord, and nowadays the Industrial Relations Commission refuses to register any site allowances. Indeed, it announced in March of this year that it would not even consider or be party in any way to site allowances. On something like 20 per cent of all the major building sites in the central business districts of Australia site allowances and other special allowances are paid. They are not part of the wage fixing principles to which the Government holds so dearly and which of course are the basis of its declaration of war on the pilots. It is just going on and nothing is being done about it. </PARA>
<PARA> A classic example of this is on what is called the Myer redevelopment site in Adelaide. I have drawn attention to this issue before. Under the industrial agreement on the Myer redevelopment site, members of the Builders Labourers Federation and other labourers on that site are getting extra allowances which constitute a 30 per cent pay increase above the basic award, which is way outside the Government's wage fixing guidelines, as outrageous as the claims of the airline pilots, yet nothing is said about it by the Government. Nothing is said about it, for that matter, by the Bannon State Government, a government which is perhaps better known for its weakness and its capacity to bury its head in the sand when difficult issues arise rather than to take any decisive action. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the industrial agreement says. First, the industrial agreement provides for a special $1 an hour payment to be paid as `compensation' for the unions agreeing not to claim payment for time lost during industrial stoppages. That has not been registered with the Industrial Commission. Secondly, the agreement provides for a $1.50 an hour site allowance and overtime penalty rates apply to this allowance when overtime is worked. So that site allowance can add up to something like $3 an hour. Thirdly, employees obtain a $20 a week project completing bonus to be paid at the completion of the project. All these payments are outside the award, outside the Government's wage fixing guidelines and, ipso facto, have not been recognised by either the State Commission or the Federal Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have now on the Myer redevelopment site in Adelaide is a situation where labourers, admittedly working long hours-I am not denying that-and some working night shifts, can earn anything up to $88,400 a year on an annualised basis, or $1,700 a week. That is fair enough if it is consistent with the Government's wage fixing guidelines, but the fact is that it has nothing to do with the wage fixing guidelines. It is way outside any of the guidelines about which we hear the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) puffing away at the dispatch box during Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA> It was very interesting that, after pointing out these things to the South Australian community recently, the Remm Company spent $8,000 on an advertisement to point out that I was wrong when, quite obviously from what I have just read out, I am entirely right. Of course, that advertisement was not a bona fide advertisement. That $8,000 was spent by Remm because it was told to do so by the building unions. It was told, `If you don't do that there will be industrial action on this site'. That is the sort of threatening behaviour which is going on in the building industry and which is making our building industry so enormously expensive compared to the building industries of other countries and is yet another example of why Australia is becoming so uncompetitive with the rest of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the end of September, the Maryborough Dairy Cooperative will close down. In its place the Cooperative will become a distribution depot. Some men will be made redundant and others will obtain work in Nambour, 160 kilometres away. The closedown is a deliberate instrument of policy of the Queensland National Party. Maryborough's demise was foreshadowed in the Langdon report on the dairy industry. It signifies a remarkable change in the dairy industry since the National Party came to power. At that time in 1957, up to 10 towns in the Wide Bay-Burnett district were engaged in the production of milk, butter and cheese. Today, no town in Wide Bay and only one town in North Burnett produces dairy products. This is the National Party legacy to rural towns in my area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The chief beneficiaries of the National Party shutdown have been Queensland United Foods (QUF) and Gold Coast Milk Pty Ltd, which is a subsidiary of QUF and South Coast Dairy. QUF has close links with the Queensland National Party, and is 22 per cent owned by Suncorp. This House has been told over the years how a senior member of the Queensland National Party, Mr Holm, a former senior Minister, Mr Hinze, and others set out to rort the milk quota system in Queensland. There is no better illustration of the cosy relationship between the National Party and the dairy industry than evidence given to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation by Mr Peter Robert Gallagher in May 1985. A questioner asked, `Have you become a member of the National Party?'; the reply was, `I have so on the purchase of my dairy in June 1984'; the questioner asked, `Was there any connection between those two events?'; the reply was:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes . . . the Dairy Industry has quite a number of problems and I saw some way of having some input into it by joining the Party. </PARA>
<PARA>The property was purchased off the present National Party member for Southport, Mr Vievers. The reason a person had to be a member of the Party was illustrated by a case in 1982 when a couple sold their farm. At the time the property had no stock, no dairy and was two hectares in size. It could not support the entitlement and after the sale the entitlement was shifted 50 kilometres away. The rort was so blatant that the Milk Entitlements Committee would not approve it. At that time a senior member of the National Party, Mr Holm, arranged a meeting with the then Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Ahern, and approved the transfer which, as his own Department had advised, was illegal. The Acting Director of Dairy, Mr Gittall, on 3 September 1983, notified Mr Ahern that the transfer should not be approved because it `was not allowed under current Government policy'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ahern told Parliament, on 30 March 1983, that transfers involving senior National Party figures were legitimate transfers within the guidelines laid down at the time. Yet, when interviewed about this on the program PM on 15 May 1985 by reporter John Austin, Mr Ahern said, `There were no guidelines at the time, no guidelines in respect of the transfer'. This view was contradicted by the Chairman of the Milk Entitlements Committee, Mr Pag Beattie. On 3 May 1983 on the Nationwide program Mr Beattie claimed that he had distributed 175,000 litres of milk under the Act. How could anyone distribute that amount of milk without some guidelines? The point is, Mr Ahern misled Parliament. He knows it and he has been caught out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is disgraceful, as the honourable member for Bowman says. South Coast Dairy was once under the chairmanship of Mr Hinze. It is now run by Mr Hollindale, who is a brother-in-law of the Queensland Minister for Environment, Conservation and Tourism, Mr Muntz. In 1985 the National Party took a decision to wipe out the Logan and Albert Dairy Cooperative, based in Beaudesert. One of the ways of doing this was to cut off its suppliers. The cooperative used to be supplied by the Palen Creek Prison Farm. When Mr Muntz was Minister responsible for prisons he directed that the Palen Creek Prison no longer supply Logan and Albert. It had to supply South Coast Dairy. This gave the prison farm an increase in milk quota of 350 litres a day and helped out the financially troubled South Coast Dairy. It was a clear case of Mr Muntz doing a deal for a family member. True to form, South Coast Dairy, in collusion with QUF Industries and Gold Coast Milk, then moved in on the Logan and Albert Dairy. They acquired the cheese factory and gave an undertaking to keep it open. After acquiring the factory in January 1986 they had it closed down by April 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then along came the Langdon report. The report recommended the closure of several dairy cooperatives including the profitable Warwick Co-op Dairy Association Ltd. South Coast Dairy now proposes to take over the Warwick Co-op. Having already taken 30 suppliers to the Gold Coast, one of the lures being offered is that Warwick will share in the growth retention. There is also a verbal undertaking that Warwick will not close. South Coast, with a $7m debt, will, if successful, acquire a profitable concern with no debts. Based on the Beaudesert experience, Warwick will then be closed down and the assets used to defray the $7m South Coast losses. Warwick farmers will then have to pay the increased cartage costs to supply the Coast and Warwick will become a distribution depot with a resultant loss of employment for a provincial city. The Nationals have no love for Warwick Dairy. Senior figures in Warwick Dairy blew the whistle on the Nationals years ago and were calling for a royal commission into the dairy industry. The Langdon report is the payback. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland National Party simply cannot resist doing a favour for its family members or its mates. The Queensland Industry Development Corporation (QIDC) is a very good example. The appointment of Mr John Bell to the Board is a case in point. Mr Bell is a close relative, by marriage, to the Minister for Finance, Mr Austin. Indeed, he was the best man at Mr Austin's wedding. Mr Bell has had a charmed life under Mr Austin. When Mr Austin was the Minister for Health, Mr Bell was appointed to a position on the South Brisbane Hospital Board. Yet Mr Bell is a Brisbane insurance broker. However, the National Party dismissed its former chief executive from the QIDC, Mr Boschma, because of a lack of rural expertise. </PARA>
<PARA> The subsequent appointments are breathtaking for their cynicism. The Nationals have appointed Mr Cameron Boyle, a Sunshine Coast property developer; Jenny Russell, a former National Party research officer; and Mr Tony Ford, a former Brisbane manager of the failed Rothwells Ltd. Presumably these people were appointed not for their sound rural expertise but because they will do the Government's bidding. It is well known that a Mr Michael Tracey, a constituent in the Landsborough electorate of the Queensland Premier, Mr Ahern, lobbied the Premier successfully for a $200,000 loan from the QIDC. It has now been revealed that Mr Tracey was an undischarged bankrupt at the time of receiving the loan. Moreover, both the Premier and the QIDC were aware that he was an undischarged bankrupt prior to approval of the loan.</PARA>
<PARA> On 15 August Mr Ahern said a firm called MITEC was a real success story his Government was proud to be involved in. In September 1987 the QIDC gave the firm $280,000 in equity funds. In June 1988 the QIDC lent MITEC $200,000 secured by a fixed and floating charge over the assets of MITEC. The annual return for the year ended 30 June 1988 revealed a staggering loss by the company of $338,651. In March 1989 the QIDC provided another $120,750 in equity funds for MITEC, increasing the QIDC commitment to $400,750 in equity funds and a $200,000 loan. </PARA>

It has started down the road toward achieving this objective by taking three relatively simple but very effective steps: first, by questioning the traditional role of the family unit and its relevance to and in a changing world; second, by questioning the ability and capacity of families to identify and implement satisfactory solutions for some of the complex problems currently facing our community; third, by limiting resources and support facilities available to families and to the voluntary groups and organisations working to promote and sustain the concept of secure, happy homes and stable family relationships. Instead, additional resources are increasingly being directed to so-called experts in government departments and agencies, many of whom operate on a nine to five basis only and some of whom would not recognise a happy family if they fell over it. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether it is by neglect or design, any failure on behalf of the Government to recognise, support and reinforce the legitimacy, value and independence of the family unit, makes it more and more difficult for families themselves to cope with the many significant and demanding pressures and challenges involved in fulfilling their traditional and proper role and responsibilities. If the Government is unwilling to acknowledge the importance and contributions of families, is it any wonder that others start to question whether the whole idea of the family unit is an outdated, unrealistic and inadequate concept and that, perhaps, there is another, maybe even better option?</PARA>
<PARA> As families will in many instances eventually collapse under the economic, social and moral pressures that are part and parcel of our race towards the twenty-first century, who is waiting in the wings offering itself as an efficient and legitimate alternative provider, carer and counsellor? Why, the Government, of course! Anyone with a television set will have seen the recent series of advertisements promoting the Government as a sort of all providing-at least a new shoes providing-fairy godmother. A big brother would be closer to the mark!</PARA>
<PARA> What this disgraceful and wasteful exercise in taxpayer-funded propaganda fails to point out is that many mums and dads do not have enough money to pay for new shoes because they are too busy trying to make ends meet with what little money is left after the tax bracket creep and inflation have taken their toll on the family weekly income. The more people are encouraged, coerced and forced to depend on the Government, the more control the Government can exert on their lives-so much so that they may become accustomed to the Government and its agents in the Government controlled bureaucracy making their decisions for them; telling them what they should do; when they should do it; why they should do it; and how they should do it. If they do not want to play according to the Government's rules, they had better be able to foot the bill-whether it be in cash or kind-themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of families, the price to be paid inevitably includes some often quite significant breaking down of their independence, self-esteem and dignity. This in turn leads to pressures on, and consequently problems with, their personal and family relationships. The unfortunate and unacceptable legacy can be seen in the escalating divorce rate, in the increasing number of so-called homeless children, in child abuse and domestic violence, in illegal and prescribed drug abuse. The list is almost as long as it is depressing. What is the Government doing to restore the rightful place of families?</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the word `family' was used only twice in the Treasurer's 1989 Budget speech is a clear and disturbing indicator as to what the Hawke Government's real priorities are, and families are very low on the list. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the policies of this Government are designed to undermine rather than protect the family unit. Instead of being referred to in the context of families, people are now being sorted into separate categories based on factors such as age or sex and the Government's policies are designed to deal with each group in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the Budget statement we have been inundated with a plethora of glossy, no doubt very expensive, Budget related handouts, detailing Government programs and strategies for young Australians, women, retirees, social security recipients, et cetera, but not one for families. Even a cursory examination of these various documents reveals that families either are totally ignored and forgotten or rate only the briefest of mentions. In the optimistically, if somewhat fancifully, entitled document `Better Opportunities-Social Security', the section on labour market reform occupies 14 pages, the social justice for young people fills 12 pages, whilst family assistance, conveniently tucked away on page 55 of a 62-page document, warrants only four and a bit pages. In the social justice Budget statement document, Towards a Fairer Australia, there are 10 special sections covering programs for young people, old people, women, even multiculturalism, but not one for families. Evidently, at least in the eyes of this Government, families do not warrant a separate mention on the so-called social justice agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> In an agenda for women which the Government claims is meant to encourage a say for women, a choice for women and a fair go for women, who says the `says', the `choices' and the `fair goes' should be so oriented away from home and family? Of course we want to, and we must, encourage and support those women who choose to pursue a career in the paid work force, who want to break down the barriers and enter what have been in many instances, for far too long, regarded as traditional male roles and responsibilities and occupations. But does it not occur to this Government that some women may choose to put home and family first, that some may want a fair go in relation to proper recognition for their contribution as home managers and mothers? Where are the Budget initiatives designed to help women who choose these things as their most important priorities? Where is their special agenda?</PARA>
<PARA> If any more proof is needed of how this Government regards the role and importance of families, we need look no further than two other Budget related documents aimed specifically at young Australians. In the conclusion to the Federal Government's strategy for young Australians, under the heading `Looking to the Future', we find the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a comprehensive network of Federal Government services which are becoming increasingly integrated in order to be able to respond sensitively, speedily and effectively to young people's needs. </PARA>
<PARA>Parents, not governments, should be the ones responding sensitively, speedily and effectively to their children's needs. The best providers of the care, support, understanding and guidance that young people need and deserve are loving parents in a stable and secure home environment. The Government, or its agencies, should not be adopting the role of surrogate parents except as a last resort. But this Government has chosen to direct available resources towards providing support services from outside rather than inside the home and family environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example of this alarming trend is the way in which the Government is managing the problems of homeless young people. One would have thought that the most important consideration would have been preventing young people from becoming homeless in the first place, but on the Government's list of priorities this is relegated to second position. Whilst this Government plans to spend $100m on curative measures over four years, only $5.5m has been allocated for preventative measures. What a ludicrous state of affairs. The cause of youth homelessness in the vast majority of instances is family breakdown. The solution to the problems of homeless children does not lie in $100m worth of government provided accommodation. All that gives them is a roof over their heads. They need more. They need the love, discipline and guidance of their parents and the safety and security of a loving home. The proper long-term answer, the only solution that will really work in the best interests of everyone concerned-and that includes all of us-is for the Government to get its priorities right, to stop hindering and instead start helping families who are finding that the going is getting too tough. Article 16 (3) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:</PARA>
<PARA>The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and it is entitled to protection by society and the State. </PARA>
<PARA>Those who believe in the fundamental truth of this statement are becoming justifiably and increasingly concerned that in Australia it now seems the family is not so much entitled to protection by the state but protection from it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I go on to my subject for the grievance debate today, I want to comment quickly on the opening remark of the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), who preceded me. He mentioned that my very good friend the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) should be doing more than just talking about the matter he raised in his speech. All I want to say is that if exposing details of sordid stories of corruption in a State of this country, such as has been the case in Queensland over the last 33 years, is not doing the right thing by this country, I do not know what is. Certainly it was of a lot more interest to me than the prattle and the criticism that the honourable member for Casey carried on with over the last 10 minutes. If he was worried and did not like the speech of the honourable member for Hinkler, I would suggest that he hang around because I am going to give his party up in Queensland a little bit of a spray, because it deserves it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My grievance today relates to the way in which the Liberal Party in Queensland is seeking to deceive the people of that State in the run-up to the forthcoming State election. The deception is that it is a completely independent and autonomous party running against the Nationals. The proof that this is a lie can be seen in the actions on Tuesday in the Queensland State Parliament, when the Leader of the Opposition and Labor leader, Wayne Goss, attempted to move a no confidence motion in Premier Ahern. The Liberals, despite their claims of opposition to the National Party Government, stated that they would vote against the motion and later conspired with the Nationals in a vote designed to suppress the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are weaklings, as the honourable member for Hinkler says. There is no doubt about that. The Liberals, in effect, expressed confidence in Premier Ahern, in his leadership and in his Government. This is despite the fact that nearly one-half of the National Party members have no confidence in Ahern's leadership. When given the opportunity recently in their Party room, nearly one-half of them voted against Ahern. When the pressure was on on Tuesday, the Liberals saved the National Party Government, as they hope in vain they will be able to do after the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6J4">Mr SCIACCA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fraud, as the honourable member for Fisher says. I want the Queensland public to know that more Liberals than back bench National Party members have supported Premier Ahern and the National Party. I come to this conclusion by some simple mathematics. There are 18 Cabinet Ministers, all of whom supported the Premier, except for three who resigned from the Cabinet. That makes 15. We only need to include the Speaker, who is known to support the Premier, and that makes 16. Mr Ahern received 26 votes, which means that at the very most 10 backbenchers voted for him, and yet 11 Liberal Party members voted for him last Tuesday. Ahern was extremely worried that some of his disgruntled backbenchers would cross the floor to vote for the no confidence motion, just as they did a short time ago to vote against his choice of Speaker for the Legislative Assembly. The reasons they did not cross the floor were: firstly, that they want him in for a couple of weeks extra so that they can have another shot at his leadership; secondly, knowing that the Liberals were opposing the no confidence motion, there would have been no point in crossing the floor and incurring the wrath of that Queensland National Party supremo and kneecapper, Sir Robert Sparkes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The evidence is now completely irrefutable that, if given half a chance, the Liberals would jump straight back into bed with the Nationals after the State election. They will prop up a National Party dominated government, in the unlikely event that they hold the balance of power after the next State election. The Nationals are finished in their own right, and everybody knows that. The only way they will ever have the opportunity to govern is by Liberal Party support. The people of Queensland must not give them the opportunity to do this. They must and will allow Labor to govern. </PARA>
<PARA> I have with me a leaked confidential document-leaked to everybody, so it is no big deal-about research by Kenning Australia into voting trends in Queensland, commissioned by the Liberal Party. The facade the Liberals are trying to present to the Queensland people is even more disturbing, considering that their own leaked research shows they cannot win. Research conducted says `Labor has a very good chance of winning'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6J4">Mr SCIACCA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is great news, as the honourable member for Hinkler says. Yet Innes, the Leader, keeps saying, `I will be the next Premier'. We have heard this from Queensland Liberals in the past-Bill Knox, Terry White, Llew Edwards. In fact, if I can quote from the research, it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>While the Liberals' share of current voting intentions is certainly well up on 1986, the Party has gained only half the voters lost by the Nationals. A greater share would surely have been expected. This implies that the Liberals have gained support by default rather than by inherent voter appeal. </PARA>
<PARA>The facts are, and the Liberals own research shows it, that the only two options the people of Queensland have are a National Party-led coalition or Labor. It shows that the Liberals have gained only one-half of the voters who are leaving the Nationals. That is extraordinary in the circumstances. It is absolutely extraordinary that conservative people would not go to the Liberals. The research says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Liberals have gained support by default rather than by inherent voter appeal. </PARA>
<PARA>That is hardly the sort of thing governments are made of. On the other hand, I am very pleased to say that 72 per cent of those polled-and remember, it is Liberal Party polling-said that Wayne Goss would make a good or satisfactory leader. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6J4">Mr SCIACCA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The poll is definitely correct. The Liberals' actions on Tuesday indicate that they know that this is the situation. They are sucking up to the Nationals, despite their attempts to have people believe otherwise. With an election just around the corner, Innes and the Queensland Liberals should stop the deceit. They should come clean and tell the Queensland public under what terms and conditions they will enter into a coalition with the Nationals. For example, is part of the deal a commitment to give Liberal preferences to the Nationals, as has already been indicated by Mr Innes? The Liberals supported the Nationals despite the fact that the Queensland Government has failed to govern the State for more than a year. It has lurched from crisis to crisis, providing no policy or economic direction for that State. This is despite the fact that it was under the Nationals in recent times, and a Liberal-National coalition prior to that, that corruption took root and flourished in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Queensland is falling apart at the seams because the Government has failed to govern. That is evident from a number of factors, including the Government's complete lack of commitment to reforms recommended by Fitzgerald; its dithering and complete lack of commitment to electoral reform; its back flip over the politically motivated 14 October referendum; its back flip over the issue of daylight saving; its closing down of the Public Accounts Committee investigation into Queensland Industry Development Corporation loans; and the uncertainty and instability arising out of the Premier's refusal to disclose the date he has chosen for the State election. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a matter which I want to bring up. I would not normally have brought it up because we over here on the Government side do take notice of very sensitive issues. However, after what happened here in Parliament during this week with the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) coming out and talking about situations relating to Mr John Halfpenny, I want to say something. In that situation there were leaked documents and there have been some allegations made by the estranged wife of Mr Halfpenny. Because of the fact that the honourable member for Parkes continued along that line, I want to say this: some time ago in this House-I think earlier this year-I made some comments relating to the question of ministerial expense abuse in Queensland. I said at that time that even the Premier himself, Mr Ahern, had something to be a little bit afraid of. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned some expenses with respect to an overseas trip that he took. The very next day as reported in the Brisbane Courier-Mail-I do not have the article with me-a spokesman for the Premier, Mr Ahern, admitted that he had used his ministerial expense account card to pay for some clothes for his wife. The clothes had been destroyed in a conveyor belt, I think on a trip to the United States. He also went on to say that the money was paid back when the insurance claim moneys came through. In other words, we have the position where a Premier of a State uses our money-that is, the money of the public of Queensland-lends it, sort of thing, and then, when the insurance comes through, pays it back. This is something like a bank teller borrowing from the bank some money which does not belong to him, and then giving it back at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention this because Mr Ahern in the State Parliament yesterday, in a grubby sort of a way to help his mate down here in the Federal National Party-I think it is the honourable member for Parkes-supported his claims by tabling the National Crime Authority statement from, I understand, Mrs Halfpenny. I mention that because I think it is tit for tat when it comes to this sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The current attitude of the Liberal Party in Queensland, as indicated by Tuesday's vote, is astonishing, considering the years of abuse that it has received from the Nationals. It is well documented that the Liberals were the victims of hopelessly rigged electoral boundaries, in the same way as the Labor Party has been a victim. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not know why. Yet for years the Liberals faithfully stuck to Sir Joh and the Nationals simply because, for them, the sniff of ministerial leather was far more important than principle. The climax of the abuse came in 1983 with Joh trying to govern in his own right and he did so. He discarded the Liberals like a piece of trash. But the Liberals are demonstrating now that for the purposes of getting backsides on ministerial seats they are prepared to go along with the National Party yet again. Some Liberal members, of course, could not wait to jump back into bed with the Nationals. I refer to the now disgraced Liberal Party Minister, Don Lane and the current National Party and former Liberal Party Minister, Brian Austin. In 1983 both these men jumped the fence to the National Party, giving it the opportunity to form a government in its own right. The only difference between those two parasites and the rest of the Liberals who are there in State Parliament now is that they were less patient. The current Liberal members have one thing in mind, and that is governing with their old mates in the National Party. I ask the people of Queensland to remember that in the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought that the Government backbenchers would have taken the opportunity today during the grievance debate to put forward arguments supporting their pharmacists and supporting those constituents of theirs who are going to suffer most adversely indeed because of the acceptance by the Government of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal recommendation. Today I wish to rise on behalf of the pharmacists within the electorate of Lyne, and those throughout Australia, to try to put the argument and request the Government to revise the situation with respect to the actual remuneration of the pharmacists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is pleasing, when I look along my desk here, to see that the matter of public importance to be debated after Question Time today deals with the pharmacy situation. It is opportune that we should also talk about it today in the Parliament because of the fact that the pharmacists themselves have, after considerable thought, decided that there should be some stop work action today. That is how deep their concern is. I want to say quite clearly that I support them. I support them because of the extra impositions of tax and costs that they have to bear today. It is unique that a government should say to small businesses throughout Australia that their remuneration is to be cut back. At the same time they are saying that the follow-on will be that the service to patients that pharmacists are giving will also decline. That is one thing that we on the Opposition benches will not stand for. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendation of the Tribunal to the Government says-I point out that the Government has agreed with this; the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) has made that quite clear-that it should abolish the 25 per cent of wholesale mark-up and replace it and the $2.54 dispensing fee with a flat $3.50 rate. This is a decline on each of the national health service prescriptions of $1.05. In other words, the remuneration that is being paid by the Government to pharmacists throughout this country will be cut by 23 per cent. That is the important factor that we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> Who is a pharmacist within the community? I have many of them within my electorate and they are dispersed because there is a dispersed population. I have the smaller seaside resorts and the smaller townships throughout the electorate. As the days and weeks go by, many hundreds of people are moving to my electorate and to other electorates throughout Australia to get out of the metropolitan area. Most of these people are receiving a pension. They are retiring and they want to go into a better geographical situation. I can recall earlier days when a chemist was a chemist; he actually dispensed and sold pharmaceutical goods. As time went on he was forced through cost to take other lines into his shop. This has occurred in order that he can survive. </PARA>
<PARA> It is always a pleasure to go into a pharmacist's shop because one will always find that it is clean and attractive. It is a typical example of what small business is and ought to be throughout this country. This Government has misjudged the reaction of the people of this country. The greater percentage of these people will not tolerate what is being done to them and the running down of their service that is likely to occur. We all support social security in certain fields. But by doing so we have also to give strong, practical support to the people who are delivering services to the pensioner folk; not only age pensioners but also invalids and others within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, over the years, has encouraged the pharmacies to provide those services. I wonder what the Minister has in mind when he is starting to squeeze the purse of these people. I am very much afraid that he is going to put pharmacies, in towns and community centres, in the same way as Medicare offices are situated, and they will have to dispense from there. I mentioned earlier that there is great concern within my electorate. We are talking about professional people. I have a short lettergram from Mr Brian Owens of the Owens Pharmacy at Taree. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>We will not survive on an effective $12 per hour. Represents a loss of $40,000 per year to this pharmacy and subsequent retrenchments. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Graham Kinnear from Kinnear's pharmacy says:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> If the Federal Government institutes its proposed cuts to Pharmacy income on October 1, my business will be greatly affected. </PARA>
<PARA> I will lose income of approximately $30,000 per annum and this will mean I will have to retrench two employees and cut the working hours of another four employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ian Carr of Saxby's Pharmacy at Taree says:</PARA>
<PARA>I am writing to you to outline the disastrous consequences which will ensue from Government acceptance of the recent Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal decision. This pharmacy will lose in excess of $30,000 p.a. from its gross margin which must mean the loss of two or three full-time jobs to maintain viability. </PARA>
<PARA>Then we have a letter from Mr Tony Bailey of the Chatham pharmacy. He points out the very pertinent fact that the pharmacists did not ask for an increase. They have not asked for an increase; they have just asked for what they are receiving to be maintained, and regularly reviewed after that. He is in this line of business and he asks why, with current inflation, increasing overheads-wages, staff superannuation, rent-and the rest of our country receiving increases in remuneration, the pharmacist is singled out. He says that it will mean a reduction of 23 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only these four pharmacists. We have people like Mr Latham, of the Gloucester pharmacy; Mr Ian Rolfe, of Nelson Bay; Mr Bremner, of Raymond Terrace; Mr Milner, of the Terrace; and Mr Toner, who has a pharmacy at Harrington. The last one is a typical example because Paul Toner conducts a pharmacy in an area into which an increasing number of aged people are moving. He phoned me only last evening and pointed out how disastrous it will be. What will happen if the people of Harrington, Hawks Nest, Nelson Bay, Laurieton and other centres lose the service that they have?</PARA>
<PARA> I have risen to speak today because I feel it is so important that we stress to the Government the very great need to revise the things that it has done. I have a document passed to me a while ago by the honourable member for Page (Mr Ian Robinson), who is terribly concerned about the issue. He points out that the chemists and the entire community of the north coast area have every right to be outraged and dismayed at the treatment being meted out to them by the Hawke Administration through the decision to cut back these fees. He goes on to point out, too-and I totally agree-that the aged and infirm in the north coast area will be the big losers from the Government's senseless and unwarranted attack on the pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time available to me, I want to point out these inadequacies in the Government's thinking. Do not forget that pharmacists have patients; they save a lot on the Medicare bill because patients go to them for advice. In fact, more should be going to the pharmacist. The have a drug delivery service. They provide a service that cannot be replaced. If this service of pharmacists is to be replaced, it will be replaced by one central office or shop in each of the districts concerned, such as for Medicare today. I, for one, will not tolerate that. I am concerned not only for the pharmacist; I am concerned about those people who go to their local pharmacist for their drugs, for the convenience because they cannot afford a bus fare or to run their vehicle to their towns, which might be 20, 30, 40 or 50 kilometres away. They need their local pharmacies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard it said that most politicians have not fully grasped the degree to which Australia's future rests in scientific research and its application for the benefit of mankind. I do not believe this proposition to be true. Indeed, in my experience most politicians are very much aware of the scientific importance of research and its application. Yet it seems incomprehensible that, despite the growing importance of scientific research to Australia's economic development, Australia is now spending less on research and development as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) than it did 20 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In private industry, research and development does not have the priority one would expect to find in a modern developed nation such as Australia. The Hawke Government-an authentic Australian government-has made a number of efforts to encourage greater private sector investment in research and development. There is a 150 per cent tax incentive available until June 1993, and with a further two years thereafter at 125 per cent. Although there has been a slight increase in expenditure by the private sector in research and development, it is still too low. Industry contributes approximately 37c to the total research dollar whilst, in comparison, in Sweden and Switzerland the proportion of industry investment in total research and development is 60 per cent and 79 per cent respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> Why therefore is there a lack of science based enterprise culture in Australia? As the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) accurately observed, there seems to be a mind-numbing congenital apathy among Australian business to research and development. It is against this background in Australia that we can only continue to marvel at the creativity and dedication of Australian scientists epitomised by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). Indeed, CSIRO is Australia's engine-room of science and is almost alone in this nation in developing and promoting a science based enterprise culture. </PARA>
<PARA> All Australians welcome the initiatives in the Hawke Government's science statement released in May this year. The statement, entitled Science and Technology for Australia, set the framework for science funding for Australian government research organisations until 1992-93, thus giving a degree of certainty that funding for science and technology would be quarantined against budgetary cuts. CSIRO now has a guarantee of stable funding for the next three years. Nevertheless, whilst the increase in funding for CSIRO is welcome, I believe there must be a greater investment in scientific research and development if Australia is to succeed in the challenge of economic survival in an increasingly competitive world. Australia needs development-particularly industrial development. We welcome tourist development but we also need the scientific capability to assess the environmental impacts of these developments. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of the agricultural and pastoral industries in northern Australia proceeded almost without any scientific scrutiny until the CSIRO established the Davies Laboratory at Townsville in 1962. These industries have had a profound impact on the land and environment of north Queensland. Since its small beginnings in Townsville in 1962, CSIRO has made increasing and important contributions to tropical agriculture and land use in northern Australia through the growth and development of Davies Laboratory. This laboratory now contains the largest grouping of CSIRO scientists north of Brisbane and it is by far the most important centre for agriculture and land use studies in the Australian tropics. The CSIRO Davies Laboratory is the only CSIRO research centre in tropical Australia with soil, plant and animal scientists working together with the capability of establishing multidisciplinary task forces to deal effectively with relevant research problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the CSIRO's Davies Laboratory initially focused its attention on the beef cattle industry, the application of its research extends to both irrigated and dry land farming. The sugar industry, the maize, sorghum and soya bean and horticultural industries are beneficiaries of its research. This continuing research is essential to the management and conservation of our tropical woodlands and rainforests, which underpin important segments of our tourist industry, and also the management of our soil and water resources. Davies Laboratory has fostered strong collaboration with the James Cook University of north Queensland in the area of tropical veterinary science, tropical freshwater research, rainforest studies and various landscape studies in geology and geography. </PARA>
<PARA> Davies Laboratory contains three divisions, as I mentioned before: Soils, Tropical Crops and Pastures, and Tropical Animal Production. In each of these scientific areas scientists at Davies Laboratory have made outstanding contributions to scientific knowledge. For example, a reconnaisance soil survey of northern Australia conducted by two scientists at Davies, Ray Isbell and Graham Murtha, was completed in 1968 and became the foundation for understanding our soil resources in that region. More detailed surveys by Graham Murtha of the wet tropical coast between Townsville and Mossman have played a key role in the development and expansion of the sugar industry, and they were primary information statistics on which the World Heritage rainforest areas were subsequently based. Currently Dr Ray Isbell, a world authority on the properties and distribution of soils, is building a classification system for Australian soils. This classification will assist in future national soil and land capability surveys, which are now seen to be essential if Australia is to implement effectively a national land care policy in the decade of soil conservation. </PARA>
<PARA> The high rainfall areas of the north Queensland tropical coast constitute one of Australia's unique and most important geographical regions. The natural resources support a flourishing sugar industry and an expanding tourist industry, and they provide, Mr Deputy Speaker-and you have flown over it-the remainder of the highly prized rainforest vegetation that once clothed large areas of Australia. The greatest natural resource underpinning this is the soil. The productive sugar fields and the lush rainforests might suggest that the soils are fertile, but work conducted by Dr Gillman of Davies Laboratory has shown that most of the nutrients are in the vegetation itself or in the organic matter. Once this is lost through cultivation or clearing, most of these coastal soils become infertile. His work has led to basic understanding of the nature of the clays and how they retain the few nutrients they hold. The work points to serious problems in the future of the sugar industry as the fertility of these soils declines under intense cropping. Even more serious is the loss of soil nutrients that end up in rivers and streams and eventually may have implications for the health of sections of the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA> One of Australia's major cattle industries is located in the semi-arid tropics of north-eastern Queensland. Increasing pressure has been placed on the native pastures. The change from British breeds to Brahman-type stock which are better adapted to the harsh environment, extensive use of food supplements and improved transport have led to serious land degradation across the region, principally in the form of extensive soil erosion, a loss of perennial grasses, and invasion by woody and often spiny shrubs. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you ever come to Townsville I can take you to areas just outside Charters Towers and other parts of north-western Queensland where the extent of soil degradation and erosion has to be seen to be believed. The poor management of the use of those soils is a disgrace. The work of Dr John Williams, in collaboration with Dr John McIvor and Dr Chris Gardener of Davies Laboratory, has documented and called attention to the serious problems of land degradation. Further, their research is providing management strategies which are being adopted to halt the degradation of our precious land resource.</PARA>
<PARA> There is an urgent need for soil resource information at a scale which can be used for proper planning to minimise land degradation. The work that has been done by Davies Laboratory can result in a more effective and cost saving method for soil surveys. This work requires substantial funds for computing equipment which can be used to interpret and display French Spot satellite imagery and exploit the recent developments in geographic information systems.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the press boxes here in Parliament House, Canberra, were filled today with a press release from a number of Federal Australian Labor Party politicians from Queensland. That press release heralded the events later this day, when Labor politicians came in here one after another and condemned the Queensland Liberals. Having listened to the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), I can only compliment him on not having allowed himself to be dragged into the sham that his colleagues are displaying in public press releases, whose promise has yet hardly been fulfilled, with the exception so far of the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca). The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) came in here and talked about a problem in his electorate but, unless I missed a part of it, he did not use up the time of his speech condemning the Queensland Liberals for not joining with the Queensland Labor politicians last Tuesday in a vote of no confidence in the Ahern Government in Queensland. So some marks to him. But, if my memory is correct, he had his name included in the press release. So shame on him for being cajoled and dragged into something that really did not happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice that the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) is here now. I hope that he will at least fulfil the promise that was given. But let us get into it. The honourable member had the audacity to condemn the Queensland Liberals for not joining with the Australian Labor Party in Queensland on Tuesday to bring about the downfall of the Ahern Government. Is that right? That was it?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Laugh, you short-minded man. The memory of the honourable member has a short span. In 1983 the Liberals stood, they walked away from the ministerial leather, and they said, `We are here on principle; we are out of the coalition'. We were fighting for accountability and we were prepared to lay to one side the perks of office that honourable members on the Government side enjoy down here with all those other trappings. The Liberals in Queensland stood on principle. We have never stopped being a party of principle in Queensland. Our principles are such that we are not going to be dragged into being part of what was just a political ploy. I am utterly amazed. When one looks at the relatively short stay that some of these honourable members who are behind this motion have had here, maybe that explains it all. But they have brought a Queensland matter-a purely Queensland matter-into the Federal Parliament. The Government has issues, like aeroplane strikes; it has issues. Right now as I speak, pharmacies all over Australia are closing their doors in a protest at the way the Labor Party has screwed them and yet honourable members raise in this place a matter which is a Queensland matter. It has nothing to do with the Federal Parliament of this--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9F4">Mr DONALD CAMERON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, `Very important', the honourable member for Bowman says. I would say this to the honourable member for Bowman: if the Federal figures at the polls were looking like they are in Queensland at the moment, then I would be grasping for any straw, just as the honourable member is. The Liberal-National Party vote federally is way ahead of the Labor Party vote and this could well be one of the last speeches that the honourable member makes in this Parliament. I just wish that he would try to immerse himself in history with memories of better contributions than that which he has made. Why would the Liberals not want to join with Labor in Queensland? Do honourable members know why? One does not have to look far to see how Labor performs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This country, as a result of Labor administration, has the largest amount of foreign debt that it has ever had the burden of carrying. It came in on a promise of lowering taxation but taxation levels are still high. The Labor Government has gradually pushed even low income earners into the high income tax brackets. Labor came in, in 1983, on the promise that when interest rates were 12 1/2 per cent it would lower them. That was a promise of the Hawke campaign in 1983. People had an expectation that interest rates would probably fall to a single digit. But now, interest rates are sitting at nearly 20 per cent. If one is in business or if one is buying something, other than a home, one will be paying more than 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the honourable member has come to this place today, condemning my Party for not joining with Labor in a no confidence vote in the Ahern Government in Queensland. Let us say this: the Liberal Party stood firm on the question of the referendum; the Liberal Party said, `No, we do not want the Nationals to have another six months. What we want is for them to go to the polls as soon as their term runs out to let the people have a say'. Government members' predecessors condemned the interference of a former Governor-General who said, `Let the people decide'. They wore that on their sleeve for years. Now they are condemning my Party for not allowing an elected government to continue for its full term. There are only about three months to go before the people will go to the polls. Government members cannot wait. I can understand that because their Party since 1954 has not even gone near getting a majority of the votes in the State of Queensland. It must be very demoralising to have sat on the Opposition benches in Queensland for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go to the other aspect of this matter. The Labor Party has not looked like winning since 1954. It would not matter who drew up the boundaries. The honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) could draw them. Old Fred Daly and Mick Young could draw them up; we could have a redistribution commission comprising those three people. Even on the boundaries that those three people would draw up-and they would redefine the word `gerrymander'-even with those advantages, Labor would not have been able to win. On every occasion, since most people here were not even born, the people of Queensland have voted against Labor. They do not trust it, and they have reason not to trust it. </PARA>
<PARA> If Government members want to complain about corruption in the State of Queensland, they should also look at some of the other Labor States. One thing that sits on their shoulders that I will never forget is that it was a Labor government in 1922 that voted for the abolition of the upper House in the State of Queensland. Labor got rid of it. Do not whine 50, 60 or 70 years later, by saying that a single house parliament gets itself into trouble in the way that it does because there are no restraints upon it. Upper Houses, like our Senate, act as a watchdog on the lower House. Yet Labor abolished it for its own political reasons in the 1920s. I believe that was one of the gravest mistakes to which the people of Queensland have been subjected. </PARA>

The first one is to line their pockets through taxpayers' funds and the other one is to interchange between one party and the other.

<PARA>Mr Speaker, this is the first time since 1917 that this particular mechanism which is available to the House has been triggered, and I am very proud that the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) will second the motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, you might remember some months ago that there was a bit of a reshuffling of seats on this side of the House. At the time great play was made of this by the Opposition and the media, suggesting that this was a sign of a desperate government putting its marginal members behind the dispatch box so that they would get on television. You may have noticed, Mr Speaker, that since then the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), on the other side of the House, has also changed seats. She no longer occupies the seat she occupied before; she now occupies the seat-a new seat-behind the dispatch box so that she will be on television.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot blame the Opposition for putting its only woman member where she will be seen on television, so that it will get some sort of credibility. I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) that if he wants to put the honourable member for Moncrieff in a seat where she will do the Opposition the most good, he will not put her in the second row; he will put her on the front bench because the honourable member for Moncrieff is one of the few Opposition members who have any idea about social or education policy or how they operate.

It is absolutely remarkable how many Liberal and National Party members in that State interchange between parties when the mood takes them. The most famous examples are Brian Austin and Don Lane, who were Liberal Party Cabinet Ministers who swapped over to the National Party following the 1983 State election, but there are countless other examples who are quite well known. For instance, in Brian Austin's seat the Liberal Party candidate against him is a Councillor Bob King, from Maroochydore Shire Council. Prior to gaining Liberal Party nomination, he was the prominent National Party spokesman in that particular area. Gilbert Alison, the State National Party member for Maryborough, was formerly a member of the Liberal Party. While he was the Liberal member for that area he always wanted National Party members to stand against him so that he could shore up the vote in that area. Oddly enough now, it is remarkable that the Liberal Party candidate against him was his former National Party campaign director. That is what we have in Maryborough.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to point out to the House today the disastrous effects that would be caused in rural areas of Australia if the Government were to accept the recommendations coming forward from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia has pointed out to the Government that if those recommendations are accepted, it will reduce the average incomes of pharmacies around Australia by some 23 per cent, and that would be particularly disastrous in country areas of Australia because it would have the inevitable effect of forcing country pharmacies to close. Of course, if those pharmacies close, there will not be the essential health services that country residents need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government should not think that only people living in urban areas of Australia need to have doctors' prescriptions made up. Country residents also need to have those essential services, and they will not be available if the country pharmacies are forced to close because of the recommendations and because of actions taken by the Government to reduce their income. I would point out to the Government that if that does occur, country residents would be forced to travel hundreds of kilometres just to have a doctor's prescription made up. There are many elderly, retired people who live in the coastal areas of my electorate, and they are the people most at risk. They are in the high risk categories, and they would be forced to travel to either Launceston or Hobart to have a prescription made up. I urge the Government not to accept those recommendations and to ensure that the country pharmacies remain open. </PARA>

Our fours team, John May, Greg Rule, Eddie Hunter and Bob Deane, won both games against the fours team from the Southern Cross and Woden Club, by six points in the first game and an overwhelming 20 points in the second game.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of members and senators belong to the Bowling Club but the membership contains far more men and women of the parliamentary staff. Once again, the parliamentary staff team played with great skill. Unfortunately, the club has not yet been able to play at Parliament House because a bowling green has not yet been prepared. I take this opportunity to seek the support of all honourable members and senators, including the Presiding Officers, to ensure that funds are provided to enable the green to be completed. The space is there. The Bowling Club members are prepared to provide, out of membership fees, some help with the maintenance of the green once it has been established. So, how about it? Give us a go! Let us see the work commenced at an early date. We want the chance to have some wins on our own ground. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The entire community has every right to be outraged and dismayed at the decision of the Government to support the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal's decisions on the amount of payment to pharmacists. I just want to say, in the very brief moment left, that I have received, as have other members, a huge volume of lettergrams and calls from pharmacists in my electorate today. There can be little doubt that as a result of the decision to slash pharmacists' remuneration, there will be a drastic decline in the level and quality of service they can afford to give the community. It is imperative that the Government review the decision that it has made. The Caucus obviously has been inept and inactive in this matter and it is time that the Government recognised the reality of the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, in Question Time on Monday the honourable member for Deakin asked me a question in relation to spare parts for Hercules aircraft. I agreed to provide an answer to the honourable member and for the benefit of the House I provide the following information, which is in a letter I have sent today to the honourable member. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Mr Beale</PARA>
<PARA> In question time last Monday you raised with me the alleged theft of spare parts for the C130A Hercules.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services advised me that while the Hercules aircraft was in Ethiopia assisting in aid relief, the spare parts at Laverton were not, as you have alleged, moved to premises outside the Government's control. The spare parts were stored in the same building at Laverton from 1984 until their sale in 1988 and 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> While you are correct in describing this building as being of red brick construction you may rest assured that as it forms the foundation of the control tower at RAAF Laverton it has most definitely been within the Government's control at all times.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Philippines company, Aboitiz Air Transport Corporation of Manila which purchased four aircraft in 1988, were sold, under an arrangement authorised by the Department of Administrative Services, a small quantity of spares as a fly away kit. Fowler Aeronautical of California purchased the last four remaining Hercules aircraft and all the remaining stock of spares in 1989. Both sales involved spare parts located in the control tower at Laverton. An agent for Fowler Aeronautical is currently at Laverton packing the remaining spares for removal.</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly I can see no reason for the Government to request the Australian Federal Police to investigate any of the allegations you have raised. The AFP is already investigating various aspects of the sale of the Hercules aircraft and spares through previous agency arrangements and as you may know criminal charges have been laid against Mr Peter Hocking and Mr Peter Commins in relation to this matter. In these circumstances I am sure you would agree that further comment would be inappropriate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Housing and Aged Care. I ask the Minister: if the Government implements the 23 per cent dispensing fee reduction recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, what is the Minister's estimate of the number of pharmacies that will go out of business? Given that the isolated and essential pharmacy allowance is insufficient, how many of these are in towns with only one pharmacy where closure will particularly affect the disabled and elderly with little access to transport? What action will the Minister take to ensure equitable access for these groups?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr STAPLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first part of the question is simply that that is difficult to answer at this stage because the Pharmacy Guild of Australia has not come back to the Government with its proposals on the essential pharmacy allowance. While the Tribunal made its principal determination, it also made a number of recommendations which gave the Government and the pharmacy industry, and particularly the Guild, certain latitude to make adjustments in a number of areas. Until the issue of restructure, the issue of the professional development fee and the issue of which pharmacies would or would not be eligible for the essential pharmacy allowance are settled, it is obviously very difficult to answer that question. As far as the supply of pharmaceuticals is concerned, the Government's primary objective in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is to make sure that every Australian has access to those pharmaceutical benefits, and in that regard we are very aware. That is why we want to talk with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, to make sure that in areas where there are difficulties because of remoteness, or even in other areas where supply needs to be kept up on an around the clock basis, we take that into account as our primary objective.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the honourable member for the Northern Territory for his question, particularly as we all know of the dedication and commitment he has in the area which is the subject of the question. It is a matter of very great satisfaction and pride to me to be able to inform the honourable member and the House that a most significant agreement on this matter has been signed by me on behalf of the Commonwealth Government and by Chief Minister Marshall Perron on behalf of the Northern Territory Government. I table the text of a joint press release by me and Mr Perron and of the memorandum of agreement which we have concluded, together with its two attachments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The agreement is a complex and detailed one and I shall here only summarise its main provisions. The agreement constitutes a package of cooperative and coordinated actions by the two governments which, taken together, address the issue comprehensively. The Commonwealth will provide land for relevant groups of Aboriginal people on stock routes and reserves under the Land Rights Act. We will then proclaim amendments passed in 1987, which will mean that claims not scheduled will lapse. The Northern Territory will legislate to provide living areas on pastoral leases under special freehold title, which will provide a number of particular protections on matters of concern to Aboriginal people. These protections relate to such matters as protection against alienation of land, the question of compulsory acquisition, mining and access to the land. A detailed procedure has been agreed for processing of applications and this provides for referral, if necessary, to a special tribunal and the right of appeal to the Northern Territory Supreme Court. That tribunal will consist of a solicitor of 10 years standing appointed by the Chief Justice and a representative from each of the land councils and the pastoralists.</PARA>
<PARA> The land councils will be empowered under Northern Territory legislation to act for Aboriginals seeking excisions if the Aboriginals concerned so request this. The Commonwealth will provide the necessary approval under the Land Rights Act. Agreed criteria have been established for consideration of applications. Both governments are pledged to seek passage of relevant legislation as early as next month. A joint review group will be established to monitor progress and will report regularly to me, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Chief Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> I wish most sincerely to commend the attitude of give and take shown by the Chief Minister, Mr Marshall Perron, in the negotiations in a joint effort with us to arrive at a practical and acceptable package. That attitude was, of course, reciprocated on the Commonwealth side. Without this approach by both governments agreement could never have been achieved on such a highly complex and contentious matter on which successive Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs of my Government have been working since 1983. I want particularly to pay tribute to the tenacity, the determination and the dedication of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, in the process which has culminated in this agreement. It will stand as an enduring achievement of truly historic importance.</PARA>
<PARA> In this agreement it is true to say that none of the parties with an interest in the issue have achieved everything that ideally they would have wanted. But what we have is a basis for moving ahead rapidly to meet the urgent, practical requirement of land for those Australians who for far too long now have been the most disadvantaged in our community. We have the means at last of removing what has been for far too long a stain on Australia's international reputation and a source of social and economic injustice for Aboriginals in the Northern Territory. I hope and I trust that this agreement, and the legislation required under it, will receive prompt and unqualified bipartisan support.</PARA>

Certainly by comparison with the ineptitude and incompetence of the performance of the Leader of the Opposition, he is assuming almost gigantic proportions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am trying to explain to the Leader of the Opposition, who will need to concentrate carefully to grasp it, that what is happening uniquely is that in the airline industry-not anywhere else-a small group of people, the Federation of Air Pilots, are setting themselves apart, not only from every other employee in the airline industry but also from every other group of employees in Australia. By that attempt they uniquely are threatening not merely the wages system of this country but the very Australian economy. That is the uniqueness.</PARA>
<PARA> In that respect, there is not the same capacity to say in respect of the employees of the airline industry who have been affected by this rapacious claim of the pilots in the industry, `You are dispensable'. In this respect, Mr Speaker, there is not the capacity for the exercise of stand-down that there has been in other areas of industry, including the tourism industry. Let me make this clear, as I have from the beginning of this dispute: there has never been any suggestion that there should be compensation for loss suffered by the airline industry.</PARA>
<PARA> All that has been put on the table-and it will be considered by Cabinet in due course-is that because of the uniqueness and delicacy of the airlines' employees in the industry, which is where the dispute threatening this economy exists, we should consider some form of recompense where the industry cannot stand down its employees.

But we are in a situation here where the airline is in a regulated industry, both in respect of what it charges and what it is charged. That, of course, reflects some uniqueness about the airline industry. But there has been no predetermination of this matter. It is an issue which, as I have said, is on the table and it will be considered by this Government, which is approaching this matter responsibly, as distinct from the politicisation of this issue by those opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the question from the honourable member for Hawker. I commend her for her close concern in the interests and the welfare of retired people. I am aware that some people have overlooked the quite substantial benefits of the Budget measures for existing superannuants. Existing superannuants benefit immediately from four important tax changes: firstly, they benefit from the personal income tax cuts which took effect on 1 July 1989 and which are funded from this year's Budget; secondly, they benefit from increases in the age pension rebate and the ability to transfer any unused part of one person's pension rebate to a spouse; thirdly, they benefit from the increase in the dependent spouse rebate announced in April and funded from this Budget; and, fourthly, they benefit from the increases in the Medicare levy low income thresholds announced in the Budget. The tax cuts provided by these four measures are substantial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All aged couples entitled to a part pension will get a tax cut this year of at least $15 per week and for many the tax cut will exceed $20 per week. These tax cuts go to any aged couple with total superannuation and other non-pension income of between $3,640 a year, that is $70 per week, and $26,640 per year or $512 per week. For example, because of these tax changes a pensioner couple with $70 per week private superannuation will pay $911.85 or $17.54 per week less tax this year; $148.20 of that comes from a reduction in marginal tax rates, and the other $763.65 comes from the increase in the pension rebate and the ability to transfer unused rebate to a spouse.</PARA>
<PARA> A pensioner couple with $100 per week private superannuation will pay $1051.70 or $20.23 per week less tax this year; $171.60 comes from the reduction in marginal tax rates and the remaining $880.10 comes from the pension rebate changes. A pensioner couple with $200 per week private superannuation will pay $924.30 per year less tax or $17.78 per week less tax. The cut in marginal rates reduces the tax by $370.80 and the new pension rebate arrangements provide the additional tax cut of $488 over the year. In addition the increase in the dependent spouse rebate gives a tax cut of $55 and the increase in the Medicare levy low income thresholds cuts tax for this couple by a further $7.50.</PARA>
<PARA> So, Mr Speaker, the tax benefits for existing superannuants will be even larger in the future because the tax free area is being aligned with the social security income test free area and this will be indexed annually from next year. Of course, from 1995 no age or service pensioner, either full rate or part rate, will pay any income tax at all. Superannuants with non-pension income of less than $26,640 a year will also benefit from the increase in the pension rate and the bringing forward of pension indexation. All in all, this Government's retirement incomes policy, while establishing a rational long-term structure for those planning for retirement, also provides very substantial and immediate benefits for those who have already retired.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Prime Minister. Given the assurance by the Minister for Industrial Relations yesterday that the contracts negotiated by Ansett Airlines of Australia with individual pilots are within the wage guidelines, can all workers in the airline industry now expect similar effective-I emphasise `effective'-increases in their wages which would be within the guidelines?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1163" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I would suggest that the learned gentleman stay within his bailiwick, though I know he is not doing too well against my colleague the Treasurer. Let me make this point: obviously the judgment of the Opposition must be that the economy is going very well because neither the Treasurer nor I have had a question on the economy for two weeks. This is one respect in which the Opposition is 100 per cent right. The management of the economy is going very well. Now, for the benefit of the shadow Treasurer, let me explain to him-briefly, because I want other questions to be possible-that he is not too well acquainted with the matter. Other employees in the airline industry have willingly committed themselves to a system of wage fixing principles, under which principles there are provisions which apply to everyone in the community except the Opposition's friends, the pilots. People, including those in the airline industry, are able, particularly now under the structural efficiency principle under the recent set of national wage guidelines, to discuss and negotiate what the outcome shall be. Under those principles, of course, they are able to get a 3 per cent plus a 3 per cent increase in wages, and they are able to get that in respect of their existing hours of employment. If they are in a position where they can work overtime, they can get an increment to their income which flows not only from the 3 per cent plus 3 per cent, but from the additional hours they work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The strange fact-and for many of the members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots the increasingly distressing fact-is that if they had remained within the wage fixing principles and operated under the system they would be now looking at the situation where they would be getting a minimum 6 per cent increase for the existing miserably low number of hours that they work. In other words, had they stayed within the system they would have got a 6 per cent increase in salary. The fact is that now, because of their decision under the contracts that have been formulated, without going into all the details, they will get a 6 per cent increase but it will not be for the low number of hours that they were working when they stayed within the system; it will be 6 per cent applied as it properly should be to a significantly increased number of hours. So in that respect they are going to be worse off than they would have been if they had stayed in the system. Under the contract, of course, if they work additional hours beyond those base hours they will be able to get an increase in income.</PARA>
<PARA> So the position, very simply, is this: in regard to those other members of the airline industry for whom the shadow Treasurer seems now to have a bleeding heart, they are satisfied that it is appropriate for them that they should operate within the system, within which system they will be getting, as I say, a minimum 6 per cent increase, something which the pilots, if they had good sense and brains, could have obtained themselves. Instead, the situation has been created where, fortunately, in terms of micro-economic reform-which the shadow Treasurer would not know anything about-the pilots that sign up will be getting the 6 per cent increase for working a larger number of hours, and significantly fewer pilots will be employed.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide for his question, which provides me with an opportunity to comment on the recently released figures relating to the labour market. Before going to the question of employment growth in the Australian economy, it is perhaps worthwhile prefacing my remarks by saying that it is of course the Government's policy to see some easing in economic growth in order to address the balance of payments question. The way in which we are trying to moderate domestic demand will be through a combination of fiscal and monetary policy whilst at the same time cushioning the effect on the labour market through an appropriate wages policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to recollect that the period of strong growth that the Australian economy is now experiencing and has experienced over several years is almost unparalleled in Australia's modern economic history. Our opponents were hooked on recessions. They could not go more than a few years without driving the economy into a recession in order to deal with the inadequacy of policy formulation that they had at the time. It is only because this Government has the appropriate mix of policies that we will be able to sustain a moderation of growth without the recession which the Opposition longs for so much, not only because it thinks it might be politically attractive for it, but also because, in a sense, the members of the Opposition are like recession junkies. The Opposition has gone so long without a recession fix that it cannot wait for the next one. It misses the recessions which it used to be able to bring upon the country time and time again.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst there has been very strong growth in the labour market over the last month or so, signs are beginning to develop which suggest that the labour market is beginning to moderate and that we might see some easing in employment growth in succeeding months; that is, after we adjust for the likely effect of the pilots dispute. If we look at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd job vacancies survey we see that the number of vacancies has fallen for the fourth successive survey. My Department's own surveys of skilled vacancies have also shown declines in recent months.</PARA>
<PARA> It is it important to realise that there have been important advances for groups in the economy in Australia who have traditionally, or at least in recent times, been somewhat disadvantaged as far as the labour market is concerned. For instance, if we look at the teenage population, when we came to office, 12.4 per cent of the entire teenage population were out of work. The figure for August was less than half of that, at 5.8 per cent. We have also seen a very significant rise in female participation. It is now at a record level of 51.5 per cent. The number of long-term unemployed people has fallen from nearly 200,000 in 1984 to just under 130,000 in the three months ending July 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> The unemployment rate stands at 5.9 per cent which is the lowest level since October 1981. It is perhaps worth recollecting that it was at about that time that the now Leader of the Opposition, who at that time was the Minister for Industrial Relations, produced the wages explosion which saw the largest growth in unemployment in this country since the depression of 1930. So it is no wonder, as the Prime Minister observes, that the Leader of the Opposition does not know anything about industrial relations now, as he knew nothing then, when he was responsible as Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> Since our election we have seen as a result of a combination of our policies, a growth in jobs of 1 1/2 million people; that is, 1 1/2 million additional jobs have been created-about three times the number the Prime Minister promised at the election of 1983. The honourable member for Port Adelaide rightly draws attention to the situation in South Australia. We have seen in recent times a very dramatic improvement in the labour market in South Australia. Its unemployment rate of just 6.6 per cent is the lowest rate of unemployment in that State for more than 10 years. So not only has there been a marked success of the policies of this Government; obviously, in combination with the enlightened Government of South Australia, we have seen a substantial performance in that State as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We on this side of the House often meet after Question Time and ask, `Can they get any worse? Can they go on?' But they do. It is beyond belief that yesterday's shop steward for the Australian Federation of Air Pilots has now almost become a full-time assistant secretary. I simply ask the honourable member in terms of a reply to his question: What does he think that above all else the Pilots Federation would like to know? I will tell him in case it escapes him; I bet it does not because he is in constant contact with them. The things that the Pilots Federation would like to know are: how many pilots have signed up with the two airlines; what is the state of negotiations between the airlines as to further numbers being signed up; and what are the terms of the contract? That is precisely what the Pilots Federation would like to know because that would help it in making its assessment about what the pilots will do. As I said yesterday to this person who has become the agent of this Federation, he is not going to be told.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is appropriate that the House, in getting the answer to the honourable gentleman, who is the agent of the Pilots Federation, should understand the nature of the alliance.

Let us just see what the truth is in regard to that issue. I wish to quote briefly from the magazine of the agent's organisation, that is, the Federation of Air Pilots. Not many quotes--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following the decision of the Senate today on the delayed legislation relating to general practice, we plan to introduce the new system of GP remuneration, training and continuing education from 1 December. I will also be examining in what ways the phasing-in of the new rebates can be done in such a way as to minimise the disadvantages GPs have suffered as a result of the delay in the Senate. I point out that this decision resulted from a unanimous set of recommendations from an all-party Senate committee. That Senate Committee essentially endorsed the proposal that GPs be vocationally trained, be subject to continuing medical education requirements, and that there be some form of descriptor utilisation review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When that Senate Committee brought down its report it was greeted with support from all sides. The Australian Medical Association claimed that its position had been vindicated. The Opposition claimed that its position had been vindicated. The Government claimed its position had been vindicated. So we did appear to have some sign of consensus in relation to this matter. Indeed, the Medical Observer, no great friend of the Government, commented.</PARA>
<PARA>It is encouraging to see that there are still some corners of our parliamentary system which can address themselves to the issue at hand without getting sidetracked by the political mileage they can gain.</PARA>
<PARA>That is true of that all-party, unanimous Select Committee decision. It is no longer true of the Opposition because the one body in this country which in fact has tried to overthrow the recommendations of that Committee, overthrow its own representative on that Committee, has been the Opposition. Indeed, what has happened in this matter is that the troglodyte wing of the Opposition has simply taken over, aided by a collection of senatorial dinosaurs whom I listened to this morning. They have simply taken over from the rest of the party. Indeed, it is a sad and sorry sight to see a great party simply abrogating its responsibilities in a matter as critical to the development of general practice in this country. And indeed, if any Australian doubts the total unfitness for government of this Opposition he should examine its sorry record on the whole issue of GP remuneration. On the other hand, this Government can take pride in the fact that we have begun to restore the confidence, the morale, the status and income of GPs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. He is also known as the member for fish and chips in Eden. Honourable members would be aware that the Commonwealth-New South Wales forest agreement is at present protecting both jobs and the local environment in the south-east forest area of New South Wales. This agreement provides for a deferral of logging in 91 per cent of the National Estate areas pending biological study, and incorporating increased environmental safeguards on continued logging and feasibility studies on improved forestry operations. The National Estate values, although misrepresented in the media by calling the area a wilderness area, relate to arborial marsupials, and the waterholding capacity of the Tantawangalo which is at the head of the Bega Valley, and the relationship of this to the forest. So we are dealing with serious issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two interruptions to progress on this matter. First of all, there is the campaign by the conservation movement, and I do not need to remind honourable members of some of the dangerous activities that are now developing in this regard. More importantly, at the official level, is an earlier indication by the New South Wales Minister for Natural Resources, Mr Causley, that he would ignore the recommendations of the joint scientific committee and so abrogate the agreement that Senator Cook had arrived at with him. My colleague Senator Cook, the Minister for Resources, has had many discussions with representatives of the environmental movement, the conservationists, pointing out that, without the agreement, logging would take place over the whole of that area and that the biological studies are absolutely essential for proper discussion and proper decisions concerning the forests.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has also made it perfectly clear that the Commonwealth Government will not allow the New South Wales Government to abrogate this agreement. He said that if the Greiner-Murray Government does not cooperate, then the Commonwealth will not hesitate to bring down the full weight of its constitutional powers, including the corporations power, to achieve resolution of the issue.</PARA>
<PARA> The firm stand taken by the Prime Minister has been vindicated. Mr Causley has since stated publicly that he is pledged to the agreement. He has now sent a letter to my colleague the Minister for Resources to this effect. So, faced by the firm resolve of this Government, it is quite obvious that the New South Wales Government has backed off from its earlier position and will abide by the terms of the agreement and refrain from confrontationist or obstructive actions.</PARA>
<PARA> What the honourable member for Eden-Monaro wants, as do all members of this House, is to get a sensible resolution of this problem, taking into account the concerns about the environment. What we have in this agreement as a result of actions taken by Ministers in this Government, including the Prime Minister, are all the ingredients for a successful and fair outcome.</PARA>

The mortality rate for brucella melitensis is about one or 2 per cent, so one needs a pretty big population. The concern about brucella melitensis is that it can spread to people. The disease is endemic in the Middle East and people die from it. The method of transmission is by sheep's milk, sheep's cheese or secretions from aborted foetuses, which are the main symptom of this disease. It is very hard to get milk, cheese and foetuses from six-year-old wethers from Australia. I think even honourable members opposite would understand that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Treasurer. Is he aware of concerns in the community arising from proposals that have been put forward to inflation adjust the tax system? Will he explain to the House the effect such a proposal would have if it were ever implemented, particularly on business and those on modest incomes?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1169" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been considerable disquiet in the community over a proposal to inflation adjust the tax system. Much of the concern arises from the confusion over whether such a proposal would be a partial adjustment or a comprehensive adjustment. Either way, the concern is well founded. At this stage the proposal is to inflation adjust the taxation of interest but not stocks or depreciation-a lopsided terrible mixup of the tax system. The plan is for partial adjustment because comprehensive adjustment would cost billions. Indeed, the Treasury has estimated that the cost would range from $3.5 billion to $4 billion in a full year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The choice is to leave a gaping hole in the Budget or raise tax rates. As an example of how this would affect small business, the tax bill of the average farmer would rise by up to $40 a week, a typical cab owner-driver by $50 a week, an interstate truck driver by $75 a week, a typical service station owner by 75 per cent, and for a motel owner the tax bill would double as the needs of his business require him to take on gearing, with the effects of this measure on the costs of that gearing. It would have a similar impact in terms of a massive shock to large business and would also throw Australia in with the hyperinflation countries such as Brazil. Apart from the attack on business, the plan would hit those at the lower end of the income scale. The Taxation Office figures show that taxpayers on $100,000 or more would benefit by $90 a week, yet taxpayers in the $20,000 to $30,000 range would benefit by $4 a week, which of course is a classic piece of Liberal Party tax policy, as I think somebody interjected.</PARA>
<PARA> Since this proposal was floated by the Leader of the Opposition during the mock election campaign he held some weeks ago and is now trying to forget, concern has mounted. Only yesterday Senator Stone was backing away from the proposal saying, `I emphasise it has always been just that, a proposal'. So this great centrepiece of coalition policy is now just that, a proposal. He also went on to say that the plan would be ready in 10 days time. As he said in relation to the Access Economics report:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . we'll get the report on that in the very near future, in fact in the next week or 10 days . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Yet Mr Carmody from Access Economics said about inflation adjustment:</PARA>
<PARA>if we go down that route it should be done on a comprehensive basis otherwise you are basically moving away from a level playing field.</PARA>
<PARA>So the person associated with the organisation which is costing this proposal has actually said, `If you go for partial inflation adjustment you are moving away from a level playing field'. The so-called technician costing it has damned it already, saying, `You would be moving away from a level playing field'.</PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, in today's Australian we now have the President of the Liberal Party panning the plan. Referring to a meeting that was held to discuss this and other matters which the Leader of the Opposition attended, the Australian reported:</PARA>
<PARA> One source who attended the Sheraton Hotel dinner said it was made clear to Mr Peacock that the application of the scheme to debt would involve huge increases to the cost of business borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA>That is nothing more than the Prime Minister and I said a couple of weeks ago. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Peacock was told the plan would alter the whole structure of corporate financing in the community and that it was a revolutionary proposal-</PARA>
<PARA>it is revolutionary, all right-</PARA>
<PARA> The source said it was assumed that as a result of the concerns expressed at the dinner, Mr Peacock would `back off' the plan.</PARA>
<PARA> That begs the question: Who is running the Liberal Party? Is it Mr Elliott, or is it the Leader of the Opposition, who has been not impolitely told to back off? It will be interesting to see, as we see the countdown to Liberal policy, who will win. Will Mr Peacock stick to his guns or will he do what he is told by Mr Elliott? What of the Peacock two-step tax plan? Will the two-step become a tango with Mr Elliott on the tax plan? Does Mr Elliott favour the two or three or four-step tax plan?

He could not think of one question to ask about the economy in two weeks and he is sitting over there interjecting. I conclude on this point. It is 24 days to countdown time, 24 days to go, to the big tax plan. Of course, we know the honourable member for Wentworth is going to go across to New York to a private seminar, and the Leader of the Opposition is apparently on some other trip, so there is going to be a lot of cramming done between now and 24 days hence for the appointed day when the Liberals' tax policy will finally be announced.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the matter of public importance brought into the House this afternoon by the Liberal and National parties is being debated on the same day that around Australia this nation's 5,600 community pharmacies have already closed or will this afternoon close their doors for between two and four hours. Anybody who likes to think about this dispassionately would realise that it is extraordinary for a professional group or small business-which is what community pharmacy is-that relies on the public for its livelihood and income, to close its doors voluntarily and not be open for business. It is even more extraordinary when we realise that this action is being taken by pharmacists. They are dedicated, service oriented, community minded individuals; they enjoy the highest respect in our community, something that politicians and journalists alike would be envious of; and they are holding stop-work meetings. That is totally out of character. It is even more extraordinary still when we realise that today is the second time this year that pharmacists have resorted to action and have been forced to close their doors to hold these sorts of meetings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government and its individual Ministers are fond of claiming records. This Minister opposite, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), who is responsible for pharmacy and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS), certainly has a record. Singlehandedly, through his administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, through the changes that he sponsored to the scheme, through his antagonistic attitude to pharmacists who are charged with the responsibility of delivering the scheme to the public, this Minister has pushed the pharmacy profession to the point where stop-work and protest meetings are the only way in which it can communicate to the Government and to this Minister its frustration, its anxiety, its anger and its arguments about what the Government is doing to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and pharmacy in particular. Those arguments are that the Government's course of action is totally wrong. It is totally wrong in respect of pharmacy, it is totally wrong in respect of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and it is totally wrong in respect of the public. </PARA>
<PARA> The straw that has broken the camel's back, as it were, pushed pharmacy to the brink and placed the future of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in jeopardy is the latest report of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal which brought down a decision on 28 August last. In short, that decision is to reduce pharmacists' remuneration by 1 November 1990 by $1.05 per ready prepared item under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and also to abolish the 25 per cent mark-up that pharmacists have hitherto been allowed on PBS drugs that they dispense. </PARA>
<PARA> The bottom line of this Tribunal's determination is that there will be a 23 per cent cut in the pharmacists' remuneration package in respect of dispensing. Small pharmacies commonly dispense 80-odd scripts a day; Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have some in your electorate. They stand to lose approximately $400 a week because of this decision. Medium pharmacies commonly dispense about 120 scripts a day; you would probably have some of those in your electorate as well, Mr Deputy Speaker. They stand to lose, straight off the top, approximately $600 a week because of this decision. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would also have some large pharmacies in your electorate. They commonly dispense about 300 scripts a day, and they stand to lose, straight off the top, because of this decision, up to $1,700 a week. If there are pharmacists in an electorate that rely more than the average on their dispensing function as part of their overall operation, a 23 per cent cut it will not be; it will be much higher. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that in paragraph 11.1 of the report, the Tribunal states about itself:</PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal, since its inception, has been concerned to ensure that approved pharmacists have been paid a fair price by the Commonwealth for the supply of pharmaceutical drugs under the NHS. </PARA>
<PARA>What is ironic about it is that this latest finding is not fair; it is grossly unfair, it is unjust and totally wrong. Statistically, the Tribunal relied on flawed and invalid data. It surveyed only about 0.3 per cent of the number of pharmacies across the country and, on the basis of that and other information, brought down this particular finding. But, even in its own terms, even if I did not make that complaint, the Tribunal's findings are wrong in its own terms. The bottom line will be that by 1 November 1990 pharmacists will have a remuneration package in respect of dispensing of $3.50. In paragraph 3.6 of the report, which supports the findings of the Tribunal, there is an assessment of the cost of dispensing per prescription. Of those pharmacies surveyed, regrettably small though the number was, we find updated current salary costs of $3.55. The salary costs alone, in the data on which this finding is based, are 5c more than the bottom line that pharmacists will be paid. Quite frankly they will go broke. They will be going so far out the door that they will not have time to say goodbye. </PARA>
<PARA> The entire Tribunal finding is based on a broader figure of $15 per hour as the remuneration for pharmacists. But actual wages, for example, of pharmacists who work in proprietor owned shops are between $20 and $30 an hour. So the finding relates only to half of what is actually happening in the marketplace. Quite frankly, if these findings are brought in by the Government as it is threatening to do, pharmacies around the country will go broke, and they will go broke quickly. If you add to this, Mr Deputy Speaker, the fact that for any items over about $50, under this package and this arrangement-wholesaling and pharmaceutical remuneration package together-it will be uneconomic for pharmacists to dispense those items. Let me read briefly from a letter which relates to insulin which was penned to me by a pharmacist:</PARA>
<PARA>We now have the ridiculous situation where a pharmacist pays $105 . . . for a drug e.g. insulin, and the Hawke Government pays him $103.50 after he has dispensed it, i.e. he has bought it, kept it in his fridge for one or two months, dispensed it, submitted his claim to the Health Department and been paid 2 months later. </PARA>
<PARA>They will go broke, not only in terms of what they will be paid by the Government, but also in terms of dispensing a whole range of drugs. Insulin, a commonly used drug, necessarily used by thousands of people in our community, is one classic example. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in the conduct of this public debate, has focused on the independence of the Tribunal. I do not want to question the integrity of Tribunal members. I do not want to question the independence of the Tribunal. It is a coincidence that in the April mini-Budget we find the Government's plans to take $31m out of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, $238m over three years, and this Tribunal decision will contribute to that by taking out $100m over the next couple of years. It is just a coincidence that in the conduct of this debate, a couple of months ago this Minister wrote to every pharmacist in the country, I presume-certainly to many-and said in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps they-</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the Guild executive-</PARA>
<PARA>prefer their members to obtain less from the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>How on earth, one can reasonably ask, could the Minister make that statement if we are dealing with a genuinely independent body? How on earth could he say to pharmacists, `Perhaps they would like to obtain less from the Tribunal'? The Minister also says that he is bound by this Tribunal; the Government has its hands tied; there is nothing it can do about it. That is absolute rubbish and absolute nonsense. This Government could legislate to revoke the determination of this Tribunal. It could support our Bill that we will debate in the Senate later today which will do exactly that. I call on the Government to announce its intentions in respect of that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will have an opportunity in the Senate this afternoon to respond. It should not huff and puff; it should not say that it is bound by this Tribunal. Legislatively, it can support our Bill in the Senate, revoke the decision and strike it down. We will be very interested, as will pharmacists and the public around the country, to learn the Government's response this afternoon. I make a prediction that I do not think the Government will make the positive response that it should, because the basic thrust is to try to reduce the number of pharmacies. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) asked the Minister in Question Time how many pharmacies would close. He was not able to give an answer. But those in the marketplace confidently predict-drastically predict-that up to 1,000 pharmacies will close around the country. It is a totally indiscriminate policy. Some small pharmacies will close, certainly. A large pharmacy in one of the larger shopping centres might even close, depending on its cost overheads and its basic structure. It will be totally indiscriminate. It will not have anything to do with whether there may be a large number of pharmacies in one area or another. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no rationality in what this policy will produce. Based on the report its logic is that the most important determinant of the dispensing cost is the prescription volume of the pharmacy. The argument, so far as the Government is concerned, must go like this, if there is any logic at all. A smaller number of pharmacies will be able to make up lost income by higher volume and it will cost the Government less.  What a fantastic policy!</PARA>
<PARA> Just to stay even, those pharmacies that do survive will have to increase their business by at least 30 per cent. I want to ask another question. The logical extension of this policy is that we shut the blinking lot down and have only one pharmacy in each suburb. Is that what the Government wants to do? If the Government wants to do that it has to ask itself: at what cost? The pharmaceutical benefits scheme is not just about an accounting cost benefit analysis as to how much it costs to dispense an item. It is a welfare measure that has been in this country for 40 years. It is also about access and service. Access and service to the public, which is what the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is all about, will be greatly reduced if the Government continues down this track.</PARA>
<PARA> Pharmacies are efficient already. With computerisation and all the other measures pharmacies have taken-they are in a very competitive environment; if there are five in the same suburb that is nothing if it is not competition-they are honed to the bone. They are very competitive. They have achieved 5 per cent productivity increases for so many years now that I cannot even recall. With those productivity increases they have been delivering service to the public; after hours services, and delivering scripts, if poor old Mrs Jones, the pensioner, cannot make it up to the shop herself, and providing counselling and advice. </PARA>
<PARA> If we go down this track, the other thing to remember is that one can dispense only so many scripts an hour.  What does the Minister want to do? Does he want to turn pharmacies into script processing lines? If he does, it runs totally against his argument about professional service and developing pharmacy for the public's benefit. The long and the short of it is that this policy is absolute madness. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not bound by the Tribunal. It can take legislative action itself, or it can support our Bill, in the Senate. The Government has to understand that, whatever policy it has, it cannot deliver.  It relies on community pharmacy to deliver it in a co-operative partnership. It has to jettison its 'us and them' attitude that it has towards pharmacy. It is not the pharmacists' fault that the Government has failed pharmacy. The Government cannot blame them. It has to recognise that its bottom line responsibility is to remunerate them fairly and properly, because if it does not, thousands of them will go broke. The real sufferers will be the Australian public in terms of access to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and service. </PARA>

On 30 August, as recorded in Hansard, referring to the PBRT he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We do not support the Tribunal for attacking pharmacists-</PARA>
<PARA>The word `attacking' has quite a clear malicious intent. In an interview on The World Today he questioned the independence of the Tribunal. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Whatever you say about the Tribunal's independence, it is the Government's decision to reduce costs. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is quite clearly implying that the Government influenced the decision quite directly. At his press conference on 1 September, referring to the Tribunal he talked of the `so called independence' of the Tribunal. In an interview with Mr O'Brien on the Face to Face program on Sunday, 3 September, Mr O'Brien said:</PARA>
<PARA>So you are suggesting that the Tribunal is not independent, that it is compromised. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Shack said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am suggesting that it is not an independent tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr O'Brien said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is compromised?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Shack said:</PARA>
<PARA>In the strictest sense of the word. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have a member of the Opposition publicly criticising and attacking in this Parliament an independent tribunal of this land for not being independent. Let me remind honourable members how this Tribunal was set up. It was set up under the Opposition's legislation because of 20 or more years of haggling between government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, in particular, over the price that would be paid for dispensing pharmaceuticals. It was set up to overcome that problem. It was set up in a very deliberate way with an extremely high degree of integrity. That degree of integrity means that the Minister will make contact by letter to the President of what is now the Industrial Relations Commission. The President of the Commission will nominate a person whom he sees fit to be the chairman of that Tribunal and the Governor-General will appoint that person. In this case we have Mr Riordan. The Government is also able to appoint two other members apart from the one appointed effectively by the Commission and by the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Tangney has now impugned, in this House and publicly, the integrity of three people in Australia for breaking their oath in their dealings with the PBRT. He has attacked one of the most eminent health economists in this land, Professor Richardson, and a very senior and well-qualified person, Mrs Margaret Jackson, the other member of the Tribunal, for not being independent and effectively kowtowing to government. That is a very serious charge which has not been substantiated by the honourable member for Tangney. He would do well to remember what he has said and to justify himself, not by simple assertions, throw-away lines and insinuations, but by fact, fact, fact. The honourable member for Tangney has not done that and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) has not criticised him. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not deal simply with that. Let us look at what the Opposition is suggesting should go on. The honourable member for Tangney has attacked the independence of the PBRT by impugning the process in which the chairman of the PBRT is set up. He has attacked and smeared the Industrial Relations Commission, He has said publicly that the PBRT process should now be subject to parliamentary review. In other words, he wants to wind back the clock to where we were. What a stupid suggestion. He wants to take the PBRT, the whole process of negotiation between government and pharmacists, back to where it was in the days before the Tribunal. It did not work and he knows it. His own Party brought in the legislation. Will he subject all decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission to parliamentary review or have one rule for the workers and one rule for the bosses?</PARA>
<PARA> That is one element of the Opposition's industrial relations policy. Let us look at another one-the pilots strike. The Leader of the Opposition's view of the policy is that the pilots should go to the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) so that it can mediate. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has an opposite view. He says, `Leave it alone'. The honourable member for Tangney has just insinuated an attitude to the PBRT and the IRC totally in contrast to what he now expects the pilots to do. We know the attitude of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) to tribunals and whether or not their decisions should stick. He believes the decisions of the Tribunal dealing with salaries of members of parliament should be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Opposition's policy? I will tell honourable members what it is. There are different policies on every issue. Members of the Opposition have differing industrial relations policies and differing levels of integrity. They are caught by their lack of policy. They will sell off to anyone they think they can get a cheap vote from, as the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) said the other day. They will sell themselves off to anyone; all they will haggle about is the price. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the Tribunal database is a very, very complicated one. It is also the most exhaustive analysis of the cost of dispensing ever undertaken in Australia. If anyone has any substantive analysis to prove that the Remuneration Tribunal is  wrong--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Shack" NAMEID="9J4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr STAPLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They made over 600 submissions. If the honourable member for Tangney or anyone else has any evidence, let him put it forward. But he will not. Opposition members are trying to beat up an issue-their usual old way of terrorising people and running with the pack. That is the way they run their policies in this country. The Tribunal sat on this issue for nearly two years. There were over 600 submissions. It also obviously took account of the 182nd report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Bureau of Industry Economics, the Industries Assistance Commission and, of course, its own database.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Tangney has quite clearly asserted in this House today that I have interfered in this Tribunal. The evidence he puts forward is absolute rubbish and he knows it. If he has not seen the letter that I wrote to all pharmacists, he should not quote selectively from it. But he has, and I intend to read into Hansard now some pertinent points in that letter I wrote to all pharmacists on 17 May. On page 2 I said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government and the Guild were at the point of releasing a joint media statement when the Guild Executive rejected the offer at the last moment, choosing the alternative course of simply putting their case to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>This is important; I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This was done despite the Guild Secretariat's estimate that the Tribunal data base study would lead to a reduction of between 40 cents and 90 cents per prescription. </PARA>
<PARA>Three paragraphs further on, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am at a loss to understand why the Guild Executive reversed the decision by the full National Council and rejected the Government's offer at the last minute. </PARA>
<PARA>It is on this matter that the honourable member for Tangney impugned not only me, but also the Tribunal for alleged collusion with the Government. I went on to say-this is the part the honourable member pulled out, after all that had gone before:</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps they prefer their members to obtain less from the Tribunal rather than face the more difficult task of explaining a constructive Government proposal to Guild members who had previously been misled about the contents of the Government's proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member has been found out and exposed again in this House. That is a clear example of it. I table that letter, and a further letter to Mr Matthews. </PARA>
<PARA> This Tribunal has gone through an exhaustive process and, short of overturning that process and, with it, many other issues of law in this country, the Opposition's only claim in this debate is to make assumptions about the integrity and independence of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us not just concentrate on the Opposition. Let us look also at the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. Before May, I had been trying to have discussions with that organisation about how we could put a joint submission to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. It rejected that approach-rejected an offer from the Government that would have seen it far better off, perhaps, if the Tribunal had accepted that joint submission. </PARA>
<PARA> Now with that decision handed down by the Tribunal, the Government is prepared to join with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia in developing a range of other remuneration packages around the essential pharmacy allowance-something that will be very important to the viability of many pharmacies-to look at the structure of the industry and, very importantly, to look at the professional role of pharmacists in the community. As yet there has been no response from the Guild to these repeated offers of discussion. All I got on Friday was a fax saying `We need time to consider it. We will get to you in a couple of days'. It is the Comedy Company-`a couple a' days'. We want to talk to pharmacists. If the Guild does not want to talk, then we will talk to pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many issues pharmacists want to talk about with the Government. If the Pharmacy Guild of Australia wants to, it will go out and scare all its members about supermarkets and all the rest of it, it will spread misinformation, like it has done in the past, to wind up its people. It failed in May to provide adequate leadership which could recognise that the Government wanted to negotiate properly with pharmacists, to develop fair and reasonable remuneration and a better pharmacy industry in Australia, a pharmacy industry that would serve the changing health needs of Australians into the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> But there has been no reply, in the same way as the Pharmacy Guild of Australia actively discouraged its members from participating in the data base survey. The honourable member for Tangney did not tell us that. The Pharmacy Guild has its uses, but why will the pharmacists not allow the Tribunal to take evidence from them in that way? That question has to be answered by all pharmacists, by the members of this House. It is a question that has been well and truly answered already by the consumers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The leaders of the Guild, with the cooperation of the Opposition, are intent on focusing all their energies on attacking the PBRT and this Government, in the vain hope of having a political fix in overturning the PBRT decision. These same people will go out and rail, day after day, against ordinary workers for trying to improve their position. Yet they come in here and try to overturn the law of this country simply to gain a few votes because they think the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the pharmacists can build up the stocks of the Opposition. They think that the people of Australia will believe that the Government is not ensuring the supply of pharmaceuticals. What rubbish! Look what this Government has done through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. There are more pharmaceuticals now than ever before. There will be a 17 per cent increase in the expenditure from 1988-89 to 1989-90. The aged, the chronically ill and those on low incomes are protected, as well as every other Australian, by the safety net provided in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this matter of public importance with a feeling of great concern about the continued delivery of health services in Australia, especially to the remote areas of my electorate and to other isolated areas. I was surprised by the speech made by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples). All the Minister did was tell us who said what about someone. The old argument came out about the workers and the bosses. Then we heard about the pilots. There was no joy for the Parliament in hearing the Minister explain why he is going to cut health services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed cuts in pharmacists' remuneration are part of the continuing and relentless attack by the Federal Government on medical professionals. The attack is totally unwarranted, as we already have the best and cheapest health delivery service in the world, or we did have until this Government came into office. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past several years we have seen relentless attacks on doctors, pathologists, deliverers of care for the aged and so on. Now it is the pharmacists' turn. As honourable members would know, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme was introduced in 1950 by the Menzies Government. Its objective was to ensure that all Australians, irrespective of income levels, had free access to the majority of drugs prescribed by doctors. Gradually the scheme was changed to provide some patient contributions in an attempt to control its cost. Pensioners and social security recipients were exempted. Following last month's Budget, the maximum amount which people have to pay for PBS drugs is $12 for the first 25 prescriptions, and this figure will be indexed every 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members may recall that the Government introduced last year, in its usual Rambo style, a series of measures to encourage doctors to prescribe less expensive drugs. It was subsequently forced to partially back down after the decision caused mayhem in the community, particularly amongst those with cancer, heart or diabetic disabilities. Presently, pharmacists receive a flat dispensing fee of $2.54 a script, plus a 25 per cent mark-up on the wholesale price of the drug. This gives an average return to the pharmacist on PBS prescriptions of about $4.55 per prescription. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, as a result of the flawed database survey by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT), the Government has decided to reduce pharmacy incomes by 23 per cent. The Tribunal's decision will cut pharmacists' fees by an average of $1.05 per prescription, or about 23 per cent. This amount will be arrived at over a period. The Tribunal decided to abolish the mark-up completely and to provide a flat dispensing fee of $3.50 for each prepared drug with special compensation for more difficult dispensing. While this may appear on the surface to be a legitimate means of saving money, in effect it is going to have a disastrous effect on pharmacies, particularly those located in smaller communities. Although the details are not clear, the proposed essential pharmacy allowance may prevent some closures; but it is still not clear to what extent this will assist. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the Government's decision on this matter, I contacted several pharmacies in small communities in my electorate to gauge their reaction. It was one of utter dismay. One pharmacist was almost in tears as he explained to me that he thought the Government had already done all it could to ruin his business. But he was wrong. The decision of 28 August has made the situation even worse. Already, pharmacies, particularly in small country towns, have become like supermarkets, selling anything from beach balls to tow ropes in an attempt to remain viable. </PARA>
<PARA> One pharmacist I spoke to said that he obtains 40 per cent of his cash flow from dispensing and the other 60 per cent from shopfront items. He said that he would get out of the pharmacy but he felt that he was performing an essential service for the community and the dispensing did bring some people into the shop. I suppose the question to be asked if he did get out is who would buy the business. Already he finds it hard to get a pharmacist into the country to care for his business when he tries to get a holiday, which is not very frequent. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members may recall, the Federal Government, outside the PBRT, unilaterally reduced the wholesaler's margin from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. Wholesalers found that, because of costs, the 10 per cent was not enough margin and they therefore placed a surcharge on pharmacies of an additional 2 per cent. In some cases, it has been higher. Therefore, if a pharmacist purchased an article worth $100, that pharmacist would have to pay the $10 margin plus a $2 surcharge. For this, however, the pharmacist would receive only $110 from the Government through the PBS scheme. It is estimated that this costs the average pharmacy $250 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also doubled the maximum quantity of most PBS drugs a doctor may prescribe at one prescription from 1 August 1988. This resulted in a further loss of an average of $120 a week. The Government also increased its payment times. Apart from the serious effect upon pharmacy cash flows and incomes, some of the changes raise direct public safety concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> If the pharmacies are required to reduce their fee to $3.50 by 1 November 1990, many drugs will have to be sold over the counter at a loss to pharmacists, before ever taking into account overheads such as rents, staff, wages, et cetera. The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) went into that. Let us look at how the price is affected by some of the more common drugs being dispensed. For Epillmec 509, for 200 tablets, the cost price to the Australian Pharmaceutical Industries (API) is $68. The wholesale Government price upon which pharmacists are paid is $64.22. If we add on the $3.50, we get $67.72, so on this drug pharmacists lose 28c. For 60 tablets of Roaccutane, the wholesale price from the API is $158.83. The Government pays $150 plus the $3.50; pharmacists lose $5.33. I remind the House that this is before any overheads are added. </PARA>
<PARA> It must also be noted that not all wholesalers charge the same price. It must be understood that if all drugs were bought in dozen lots the prices would perhaps be cheaper. But many pharmacies, particularly those in country areas, cannot afford to purchase expensive drugs in bulk. This really means that the pharmacies will be losing substantially on any drugs prescribed above $50. In my electorate of Riverina-Darling, pharmacists have varying amounts invested in stock, anything upwards of $14,000. But it is obvious that with the Government's latest moves, expensive drugs will not be kept in stock and patients will have to wait for a number of days sometimes, particularly in isolated areas, for the drugs to come from the wholesalers. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a number of towns in my electorate where there are only one, or perhaps two, pharmacies. These include Hillston, Lake Cargelligo, Coleambally, West Wyalong, Cobar, Condoblin, Hay and others. They form some of the 450 in the nation which stand a good chance of being closed if this Government goes ahead with its policy. Over past years, they have provided a valuable professional health role, in many cases being the first line of contact of people seeking aid and care for their health. People with the flu, pregnant women and the elderly, for example, all use the pharmacist's advice and when people live in isolated areas there is no way that most of them can travel to larger centres. </PARA>
<PARA> My real concern is that despite the so-called essential pharmacy allowance, a number of pharmacies will find it difficult to continue. In those towns with only one doctor my real fear is that those doctors will leave because most people usually visit the doctor's surgery and then go to the pharmacists for their prescriptions. If they cannot get a prescription in their own town they will more than likely travel to a larger centre where they can see a doctor and get their prescription filled immediately. The loss of the town doctor usually results in the downgrading of the town's hospital. It also results in a loss of jobs, mainly for women, and loss to the community of a valuable citizen in the pharmacist and his family. </PARA>
<PARA> The House can see that this move by the Government is not just an attack on pharmacists but on the total community. This Government in its period in office has shown a blatant disregard for people in the bush, but when it comes to the downgrading of health services, I feel the line has to be drawn. Therefore, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) can be assured of a very strong campaign from rural areas against this attack on pharmacists which they believe is an attack on the community as a whole. I know the Minister has said he is negotiating with the Pharmacy Guild, but from what I can understand the Minister is not negotiating when he gets behind closed doors; he merely continues to dictate the terms. </PARA>
<PARA> I have talked to a number of pharmacists. I spoke to one who has five children. He said that none of his children will become pharmacists. Where are we going to get our pharmacists from? I doubt whether anyone would want to go to university now and train to be a pharmacist because he would never know what was coming next. I have had a number of letters from people in my electorate from different pharmacies and I will read a few of them. One states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Noel . . . deeply concerned at moves made by Peter Staples last week against pharmacy. </PARA>
<PARA>This letter is from Broken Hill, by the way, Mr Deputy Speaker. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Faced with inevitable staff retrenchments and with probable closure. </PARA>
<PARA> As we service an aged community most would be seriously inconvenienced if this should happen. Implore Peter Staples-</PARA>
<PARA>`implore', the word is-</PARA>
<PARA>to show some commonsense in this matter and give us just remuneration for the responsible professional work we do. </PARA>
<PARA>But of course the honourable member for Perth has already said that we are paying too much to our pharmacists. I have a lettergram from Hay. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Tribunal promotes socialism deters motivation and bankrupts pharmacy. </PARA>
<PARA>I have one from Hillston. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Government payment a disaster possibly terminal please help!</PARA>
<PARA>I received this one from Broken Hill South:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Noel,</PARA>
<PARA> Just a brief note of anger at Peter Staples . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Another one from Griffith states:</PARA>
<PARA>Twenty per cent reduction disastrous. Please help. Deeply concerned for future of pharmacy. </PARA>
<PARA>They go on and on. I think it is about time the Government woke up to itself, particularly in regard to the smaller pharmacies in country areas, as well as pharmacies all over the nation which are providing a very valuable service for the people of Australia. It should do something immediately. It should support our Bill in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is called the fallacy of ad hominem, which, for those on the other side who do not understand it, means playing the man rather than the ball. To use the words of the shadow spokesman, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), I believe that pharmacists are dedicated, service minded and concerned. I understand that pharmacists should be interested in the future of their industry and their business. The only thing that the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) did not predict was the imminent blacking out of the sun as a result of this decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us put it in perspective: I made the point by interjection that the Government believed that the offer it made to the pharmacists was generous. The Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) revealed in his speech that it was the case that the secretariat of the Guild believed that its chances of getting a better decision before the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal were unlikely. But the Pharmacy Guild took that choice. It chose to go before the Tribunal. We are used in this place to listening to the Opposition complaining about the umpire's decision; we are used to hearing it complain about the Commissioner of Taxation because he tries too hard to do his job; we are used to it coming in here every time it does not like some statistics that are produced and saying that the Australian Bureau of Statistics is fiddling. We now find it saying that the Remuneration Tribunal has fiddled, that it is under government influence, and impugning the reputation of some very ethical people. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members come in here day after day and rail about micro-economic reform and about how we can improve the efficiency of government and the efficiency of the Australian economy. The dries on the other side say day after day that we should cut expenditure, that there should be massive savings. It took 37 years for our expenditure on pharmaceuticals through this scheme to reach $1 billion, and in the next three years we will add another $1 billion. But they do not take any account of that. They say that there do not need to be any efficiencies in the system. Should the Government and the taxpayer support all pharmacies, regardless of whether they are efficient and regardless of whether there is any retail competition which affects them?</PARA>

When I speak to pharmacists I have not found one who has suggested that there is an appropriate number of pharmacies. All I have spoken to, without exception, say there are too many pharmacies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Opposition is saying, on the one hand, is that we need economic reform, we need micro-economic change, but on the other hand, when we look at marketing wheat, and efficiencies in wheat marketing, that is no good. When we introduced the entertainment tax, what were we told? Restaurants would all go out of business. What has happened in the restaurant industry? There has been burgeoning growth. What do we find in this place day after day? We find our opponents supporting the pilots. Indeed, they should read the article today in the Australian Financial Review-hardly a supporter of this Government; hardly a newspaper that, from a philosophical point of view, supports us. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> But like the actions of the pilots, this industrial action-</PARA>
<PARA>it is referring to the pharmacists, and I do not agree-</PARA>
<PARA>will draw attention to their voracious appetite at the public trough. </PARA>
<PARA>What does it say about the Government's proposals? It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's reform of the PBS is correct as it reduces the burden on taxpayers and streamlines the operation of this vital service industry. </PARA>
<PARA>It does that. The Opposition needs to understand that there have to be changes. It is appropriate that it be a more efficient industry. I have said in this place and in other places that I believe an accommodation can be reached. I do not believe that the Tribunal's decision as written out should necessarily be the final solution. There are important areas that we need to consider. We have gone to the pharmacists to talk about the essential pharmacy allowance because there are people in the country who are concerned about the provisions of community pharmacy. It is important that that be considered. The Government is willing to consider their views on some of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basic decision that has been made by the pharmacists it needs to be understood that pharmacy had its chance in May and it did not take it. We see the cynicism of the Opposition on this particular issue, with its continual talk about cost cutting and micro-economic reform. But every time we bring into this place some measure which is likely to bring about change in that direction, we find some puny self-interest getting in the way. Lots of myths are being circulated about the way in which pharmacy is structured. </PARA>
<PARA> There is concern amongst members of the Opposition about the database and the information that was made available. They ask whether it is fair and whether the costs of pharmacy have been included in this decision. If they take that view, we have to look at the benefits that accrue for the pharmacist as a result of his privileged position in being able to dispense national health service scripts. It needs to be considered that, if a pharmacist dispenses 50,000 scripts a year, that means that 50,000 people walk through his door to get their scripts filled. They stand about in the shop and buy jelly beans or condoms or perfume or a stuffed doll or many other things. There are advantages for pharmacists in the way in which they are allowed to operate, including the hours during which they have been allowed to open. Indeed, there is an advantage for their retail business as a result of their being pharmacists. Perhaps that information needs to be fed into a future database inquiry; perhaps then we will get a more balanced result. If we balanced it in that way, it certainly would not go the way in which pharmacists wish to see it go. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of what has happened over the last four or five years, there has been a change in the profile of drugs that are being prescribed by doctors. More and more expensive drugs are being prescribed. There are a number of reasons for that, but there has been a significant change in that profile. The result of pharmacists getting a 25 per cent mark-up on the price has been a windfall for them. But the Opposition is not happy to accept that. It is not happy to accept the fact that the pharmacists have been getting a significant increase. </PARA>
<PARA> We should look at the task of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Review Tribunal. Given the 25 per cent mark-up change for the price of drugs, the Remuneration Tribunal was supposed to adjust the professional fee to keep the total payments of dispensing the drugs equal to the chemists' costs plus 10.5 per cent. As a result of that it was appropriate that there be a change. The Opposition spokesman said in his speech today that the Government has reduced the pharmacy fee and abolished the mark-up. That is absolutely untrue. The present fee is $2.54. Even in the worst scenario, and allowing for inflationary adjustment, it will probably be around $4 in 1990. So to say that we have reduced it and removed the mark-up is absolutely untrue, and he knows it, because the mark-up has been built in. He understands that but he is not willing to come in here and tell the story. I said at the beginning of my speech that I accept that pharmacists are dedicated. I understand that they are service minded and I believe that they are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been my position all along in this issue to say that it is unfortunate that they did not accept our offer in May. As a result of that their position is not as good and it is necessary for them to talk to the Government about those areas which they believe are most important. But it would be irresponsible of the Government-and let us say that our final responsibility must be to the taxpayers and public of this nation-to be in a position where it did not accept the efficiencies that have been brought down as a result of a decision of the independent umpire. It is like going into a cricket match and saying, `If I'm given out I'm not going to go'. If you accept the play then you take the consequences. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is coincidental that hard on the heels of the matter of public importance debate, which dealt with pharmacy and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS), the House should now be considering the National Health Amendment Bill 1989. This Bill is designed to give effect to the decision announced in the 1989-90 Budget to raise the maximum general patient contribution for pharmaceutical benefit prescription items from the current level of $11 to $12. In addition, the legislation provides for this contribution to be adjusted on 1 August each year, in line with movements in the March quarter all groups consumer price index. The Government estimates that the application of this new level of patient charges from 1 October this year will yield savings of $10m in expenditure on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in the current financial year and $17m in a full year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While there are obviously a great many matters relating to the Government's administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme with which we would strongly argue, and some of those were raised in the matter of public importance debate just a few minutes ago, this is not one of them. We do not oppose this Bill. We are committed to the preservation of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme as an effective and efficient means of delivery of the most modern and up to date medications to the community at subsidised, affordable prices. We are also committed to seeing that assistance under the PBS is targeted to those in greatest need: to pensioners, other low income earners and the chronically ill. What is important to state in the context of this debate, where we are requiring members of the general public to pay a dollar more for the pharmaceutical benefit items that they obtain at their local community pharmacy, is the fundamental point that in the delivery of welfare programs, which the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is, every dollar that is spent on someone who can afford to look after himself is a dollar less we can afford to spend on those who cannot afford to look after themselves-pensioners, the poor and the disadvantaged. It is for that reason that we have no argument with the Government's move to achieve savings along these lines. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme there is a subsidisation of the care to pensioners and other low income earners and the chronically ill. It is a burden we all share, either through the taxation system or through our own direct contribution to the cost of PBS prescriptions and, as I have said, we are not opposing this Bill. It is important to have in mind always that relationship with finite Budget moneys-that every dollar spent on someone who does not need public or taxpayers assistance is a dollar less we can afford to spend on someone else who really does need our assistance. It is important to keep that firmly in mind, as each year we look not only at the general patient contribution but also at other elements of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> For instance, there is the safety net element. There are many anecdotal examples in Sydney of what is called the eastern suburbs practice, whereby in November or December people drive up and double park the Rolls while they run in and get their maximum entitlement under the safety net. That is not what a welfare program is all about. Many people with health benefit cards own a deli, drive a Mercedes and collect their entitlement at their local pharmacy. That is not what a welfare system is all about. The Government, for as long as it remains the Government, and we, when we take office after the next election, will be constantly looking at the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, retaining it but ensuring that the entitlement to maximum assistance goes to those in greatest need. </PARA>
<PARA> But to come back to this Bill, the real issue, in the face of no opposition from the Liberal and National parties, is to ask what consumers will get for the extra dollar they will have to pay for their PBS prescriptions. Will they receive the same level of service from pharmacists that they currently enjoy? Will they continue to have convenient access to the services of a pharmacist? To restate some of the remarks made in the matter of public importance debate, if the Government continues down the path it is currently pursuing in relation to pharmacies, the answer to both these questions undoubtedly will be no. </PARA>
<PARA> In its April 1989 economic statement, the Government set PBS savings targets of $31m in 1989-90, $96m in 1990-91 and $156m in 1991-92. Obviously, some of these savings will result from the matter currently before the House, that is, the increase in the maximum general patient contribution. I remind the House of the Government's own estimates that it is looking at savings of $10m in expenditure on the PBS in the current financial year and $17m in a full year. But that falls short of the $31m this year, the $96m next financial year and the $156m in the financial year after that. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal way in which the Government aims-and we can now see this clearly-to achieve a reduction in expenditure on the PBS is by reducing the amount paid to pharmacists as remuneration for dispensing PBS items. Pharmacists have already suffered significant reductions in remuneration over the last year as a result of past government actions. Across Australia pharmacists have had their basic income reduced variously between 9 per cent and 14 per cent. Some of the actions which have contributed to this, and which have originated from this Government, have been cuts in the wholesale margins for pharmaceuticals, the doubling of the quantity of drugs available on a single prescription, extensions to the range of drugs covered by the pharmaceutical benefits scheme authority only list, confusing switches between brand name drugs and generic alternatives and the failure of the Government to extend the incentive payment scheme for the computer processing of dispensing claims. In addition, pharmacists have also experienced financial hardship as a result of the Government being slow to process and pay their claims for dispensing PBS goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Moves by the Government to further reduce the remuneration of pharmacists will only serve to completely undermine the whole structure of the PBS which all major political parties in this country are committed to preserving. This issue needs very close examination. The Government has embarked on a course of slashing the basic remuneration package available to Australian pharmacists by 23 per cent. It hopes by doing that to reduce the number of pharmacies. The logical argument of the Government's position is that if we reduce the number of pharmacies they will be able to keep pace and make up for the cuts that we are imposing on them by, hopefully, dispensing a greater number of scripts, by making up their remuneration through higher volume, and all at less cost to the Government and, of course, less cost to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> I made the point in the matter of public importance debate a little while ago that pharmacists, on average, would have to increase the number of scripts they dispense each day by 30 per cent to make up for the cuts that are being imposed on them. The other fundamental point that I want to make is that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, even in the Government's own terms, is not just about dispensing scripts at the lowest price; it is basically a welfare system to ensure maximum access for all Australians, especially the needy and the most disadvantaged-pensioners, the poor, and those who have health care cards of one kind or another. It is principally a welfare scheme to look after those people. Two important elements of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme are service and access. </PARA>
<PARA> Pharmacists are already efficient. Pharmacists operate in an enormously competitive environment. Pharmacists have achieved productivity gains in their own practices of about 5 per cent per year, largely through computerisation, and they have passed those productivity gains on to the public. They have after hours services, which we never used to have many years ago. They have deliveries to pensioners, individually or to nursing homes, hostels and the like. The pharmacist, at cost to him, takes the dispensed drugs to those people who desperately need them. Pharmacists play an enormous role in counselling and giving advice to the public for free. </PARA>
<PARA> Anybody who has anything to do with running a family will know that if one has children, the first person one goes to when something of a minor medical or ailment nature occurs is not the general practitioner but the pharmacist, to ask him or her for advice. That advice is given free; it is not paid for. Our family has gone to our local pharmacist for advice, we have been given advice for which we have paid nothing, and because of that advice we have not had to buy any preparation, either. It has been judged by the pharmacist that it is not necessary. That is the sort of service that is being delivered in the community because of the productivity improvements that pharmacists have been able to make within their own industry. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government persists in going down this road, there are only so many scripts that an individual pharmacist can dispense in an hour or a day. Does the Government really want to turn community pharmacists, or those who survive as a result of these financial cuts, into this sort of dispensing supermarket, `Just come in and get your script and get out as quickly as you can so I can deal with the next one'? That is not about service, it is not about access, and it runs completely counter to the Minister's own public statements about trying to develop the professional role of pharmacists. The professional role of pharmacists is to give counselling and advice, to spend time with customers and patients, not to give them their script and tell them to buzz off quickly because they are too busy to talk to them, as they have to dispense the next one. I cannot understand the logic of the Government's position of turning community pharmacists into dispensing assembly lines while at the same time talking high-mindedly about developing the professional role of pharmacists. Quite frankly, if these arrangements do come into play, pharmacists will not have time for this development. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of my education as shadow Minister for health, I have actually worked in pharmacies around the country. I am not going to pretend that I have put on a white coat; I am not going to pretend that I have dispensed scripts; I am not qualified to do that. But I have looked over the shoulder of those who are. I have gained first hand experience of what they do. Madam Deputy Speaker, you would be amazed at the important role pharmacists play in checking the actual prescription that they get from a doctor. We place enormous trust and faith in doctors, but they sometimes make mistakes. They prescribe the wrong thing, they prescribe the wrong quantities, they give the wrong advice. It is the pharmacist who is the checkpoint, the gateway, another hurdle between the doctor and the community. They do very important and valuable work by checking doctors' prescriptions. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already spoken at some length about the advice that pharmacists give customers and patients. Pharmacists now dispense preparations in a computerised way. Not only does the name of the drug come out, with all the other relevant details, but often the computer will spit out a little page-sheet of advice to the patient as to what the preparation is doing to that person, how he should best take it and how he should best operate his life in accordance with that preparation. The pharmacist comes from behind the counter, stands next to the patient and goes through that detail-all for free.</PARA>
<PARA> Counselling is provided by pharmacies, and they are not only counselling people as to how they might treat themselves with the preparation that has been dispensed for them. There is an expanding role for the community pharmacy in preventative medicine: advising people on lifestyle changes that can improve and maintain their health so that they do not even have to think about going to a doctor. </PARA>
<PARA> One must add all this to the delivery and the service that pharmacists give to individual age pensioners, nursing homes, hostels and the like. If the Government goes down this route pharmacists will not be able to afford to continue to deliver that sort of service. However, the Minister, as a negotiating bludgeon, threatens to open up the entire area to supermarkets. On the one hand, he is talking about closing down the number of outlets; on the other hand, he is threatening that it will be open go. I simply cannot understand the logic behind the Government's position. </PARA>
<PARA> If we ask whether there are too many pharmacists, when we make international comparisons, as some people do, to support the argument that there are, we also have to remember that we do not allow doctors in this country to dispense. Figuratively, only a handful of doctors are allowed to dispense. Overseas, if on the face of it there exists a smaller number of pharmacies per head of population than exists in this country, it is largely explained by the fact that many countries allow their doctors and general practitioners to dispense directly to the patient. It is a case of lies, damn lies and statistics. One has to look at the basis of one's comparison. </PARA>
<PARA> From an economic point of view I could ask the same question: Are there too many hairdressers? Are there too many delicatessens? Are there too many service stations? All are involved in an intensively competitive free market environment. Pharmacies are opening and closing all the time. This Government, by this measure, will wipe out, in one fell swoop, up to 1,000 pharmacies around the country, and there is no justification for it. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I make a fundamental point. Pharmacists do not originate scripts; they only fill them. It is doctors who originate scripts. Under the head of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, we are going to be spending increasingly more money. Everybody knows and talks about the ageing demography of the community. As a society we are all collectively getting older. Some of us are going to be lucky enough to live, not only into our sixties, but into our seventies, eighties and nineties. The new generation of drugs will enable us to live longer and healthier lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The new generation of drugs is hellishly expensive. The other thing about their availability is the increasing expectations of the community. If we know that these drugs are available, if we know that they can make our lives healthier, if we know that we can live longer because of them, we are not going to say, `We will not have them, we do not want them in this country'. Of course we are going to want them. </PARA>
<PARA> We are going to spend more money in this country on pharmaceutical items under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. If one understands anything about preventative medicine, that is a good thing, not a bad thing. This new generation of drugs, those that eliminate blood pressure, or take cholesterol out of our systems, are the generation of drugs that will keep us out of hospital and off surgery operating tables. If we improve our lifestyles in a whole range of areas, if we have access to these drugs, five-way bypass operations will go out of style. They simply will not be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The real cost in the entire health portfolio is not at the pharmaceutical benefits scheme end of the operation. It is in hospitals. We have got to have the breadth of vision to be able to look at the entire health portfolio and to recognise that by spending a bit of money up front we can save a lot of money down the line. The key to that is the development of the professional role and services that can be delivered in our community by our community pharmacists. What the Government is doing is flying directly in the face of this. It is all financially driven. I think that the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance have rolled the Minister for Community Services and Health and the Minister for Housing and Aged Care. There are many people on the Government back bench. The honourable members for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), Streeton (Mr Lamb) and Dobell (Mr Lee) understand the position. They are campaigning against what the Government is doing. This Government direction must be stopped and turned around, because it is doing totally the wrong thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude, I want to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>`whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As stated by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), the National Health Amendment Bill will increase the patient contribution slightly, to $12, for general patients under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. While the Opposition has in some cases justifiably attacked the decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, it has, as in so many cases, failed to state exactly what its own policy will be on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which this legislation relates to. The honourable member for Tangney has acknowledged that the Government has been confronted with a massive blow-out in pharmaceutical benefit costs. One major reason is that there have been far more expensive drugs coming onto the scheme. Life-saving medications have been listed which are very costly-sometimes in the tens of dollars; sometimes in the hundreds of dollars; and in at least one case, over $1,000 just for the cost of one item. People who obtain their prescriptions for $12 or $2.50 or free, depending on which system they are eligible for, often do not realise just how much their medication costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has listed or hinted at some of the alternatives it sees to the action that has been taken by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal-wrongly I believe; I do not believe that any remuneration tribunal is entitled to take action which restructures a whole industry-and also actions that have been taken by the Government. The Government has been confronted with enormous changes in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. First of all, we had costs one or two years ago of $800m for the scheme. That has escalated to $1.2 billion. There is a prediction that the cost of the scheme will grow to $2 billion in the next year or two. Even if it is only half that, a $400m increase, that is $55 per taxpayer, $55 more out of each taxpaying family to cover the increase. If the prediction by some departmental representatives is realised, then the cost could be $100 more to each taxpayer. When we think of a small town of 10,000 or 20,000 people, over $1m of taxpayers' spending is being taken out of the town. That is the sort of cost increase with which we are confronted. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Opposition going to do? The honourable member for Tangney hinted that it could either charge general patients more, perhaps remove their entitlement to pharmaceutical benefits or perhaps drastically reduce their entitlement. He has not explained whether he would put in a means test or simply take the items off benefits. If he were to put in a means test we can imagine what sort of horrible situation we would have. </PARA>

It handed it to us on a plate, nothing but a bill for $9 billion. Will it remove items from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme? If so, what items? Which people with what illnesses will be affected by its policy? People may find that items they receive today free or at $12 will cost $15, $90, $400 or $1,700.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will continue, I confidently expect, along with other rural members for New South Wales, such as the honourable member for Calare and Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. The Government was faced with this massive blow-out. It had to look at the industry and it had to look at the fact that more money was being made. Since the time we left business in 1985 there has been a substantial increase in the amount pharmacists receive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Pharmacy Guild appreciated that. It has been talking for many months, over a year, to the Government about the strategy that ought to be followed. I was involved in some of the discussions that took place. The Pharmacy Guild realised that there would be a blow-out, that the scheme could not keep going the way it was, and it was prepared to talk about it. The Government and the Guild representatives worked out a proposal. That proposal led to the presentation of a paper which was considered in May of this year. Both the Government and the Guild had been involved in the preparation of that proposal. The pharmacists were not prepared to accept that proposal because the membership of the Guild was not prepared to accept any consideration of mark-up changes and also because it had been hit by a 10c cut in receipts per item. This was the result of a decision to act on wholesalers and unfortunately that cut was passed on in substantial portion to retailers. </PARA>
<PARA> Pharmacists were then confronted with having to go to a tribunal. I know they were divided. Some felt that they ought to accept the proposal, or try to negotiate further on it. Others felt that they ought to go to the Tribunal. In the end the Guild took its chances and went to the Tribunal. I regret that there were not more discussions. I tried to encourage more discussions between the industry and the Government; that did not happen. Then, of course, as usual the Government went to the Tribunal with an ambit claim, the sort of ambit claim that the Fraser Government presented-no mark-up. It went to the Tribunal with an ambit claim and for once the Tribunal substantially accepted that ambit claim. It went much further than the May proposal. This was the proposal which the Government was prepared to take to the Tribunal in association with the Guild. The Tribunal went much further than that and made a decision which effectively would restructure a whole industry. That is not the job of a remuneration tribunal. It is the job of a government. It is what this Government has done in a very effective way with the car industry, the steel industry, the broadcasting industry and the waterfront and shipping industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted that the Government has now said that it will take on board a restructuring proposal for pharmacy and discuss this with pharmacists. I am delighted that the Government this week has agreed that it will join with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia to discuss the future of the industry and in particular urgently develop proposals for, firstly, a restructuring proposal for pharmacy; secondly, financial recognition of the professional role of pharmacy in the community; thirdly, the provision of an essential pharmacy allowance; and, fourthly, consideration of how the impact of wholesale margins and surcharges can be reduced. First of all I believe the fact that the Government is prepared to discuss the future of the industry means that it has to listen to the Pharmacy Guild on all issues which it wants to raise about its industry and its future. Secondly, in relation to a restructuring proposal for pharmacy, the Government is saying to the Guild, `If we are paying a substantial amount of taxpayers money we need to talk to you about just how effectively that taxpayer money is being used'. Of course the Guild can also talk to the Government about its views on the need for restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognising the professional role of pharmacy in the community, pharmacists-I know the honourable member for Tangney conceded this-have a great knowledge of the action and uses of drugs. They know more about the actions of drugs than do the prescribers of drugs. They know more about the side effects of drugs. They know more about the need for patient compliance and how to encourage the patient to comply with the taking of medication. They know more about drug incompatibility. They know more about what drugs should not be taken with others. </PARA>
<PARA> Only recently a pharmacist told me that she had, over two days, prevented drug incompatibility problems from occurring with patients simply because the computers which are now available to pharmacists, and which they purchase, show that there are incompatibilities with medication that the patient is already taking. This is what happens in pharmacies. In addition, the pharmacists are able to give information on the medication. We are long past the days when the pharmacist handed out medication with a label on that did not tell anything about the medication, how it was to be stored, or the actions and uses of drugs. Pharmacists now tell their patients all about the actions and uses of drugs. That is not properly recognised. The Government is saying that it is prepared to develop urgently proposals for financial recognition of the professional role of pharmacy in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter is an essential pharmacy allowance. This is getting away from the problems mentioned by the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) of country pharmacies being taken away from country towns. What the Government is saying is that it is prepared to develop proposals with the Pharmacy Guild for an essential pharmacy allowance, so that pharmacies can stay in the country towns and continue to provide a service. I believe the Government has shown there a will to keep pharmacies operating everywhere they are essential. </PARA>
<PARA> Next is the consideration of how the impact of wholesale margins and surcharges can be reduced. This is an important move and a very difficult one. It is easy for wholesalers to pass their costs on to the pharmacist. The wholesalers themselves have said that they are operating on a shoestring, and the Government and the Guild should get together and talk about just how they can get around the fact that governments can control the manufacturers' price and the retailer's price but they have little control over the wholesale margins and surcharges. We need to talk out the arguments-the arguments from the retail pharmacies that in many cases they are paying higher than the wholesale price and the arguments from the wholesalers that in many cases they are charging less than the wholesale price. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also agreed to set up a Caucus consultation group with the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) to provide advice and act as a direct liaison with Caucus. I heard today that I have been appointed to that consultation group. I welcome the opportunity to continue to be heavily involved in the discussions that are proceeding. Above all, I am pleased that the Government has been prepared, along with the Guild, to enter immediately into negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> While that resolution was one that did not completely reflect my views; it suffered only in that it did not include a mark-up for pharmacists as a major point for discussion. Certainly pharmacists can raise it, but I am not at all confident that they will succeed if they do, and that worries me. It disappointed me that the Government would not accept mark-up as a major issue for discussion. I believe that the mark-up is a particularly important issue for a whole range of reasons, one of which is the fact that items on a shelf cost the pharmacist interest, first of all. If a pharmacist has $20,000 worth of pharmaceutical benefit items stored in the pharmacy ready for sale and $10,000 worth of those items have already been paid for, then obviously it is costing the pharmacist money to keep the items on the shelf. </PARA>
<PARA> So first of all we have overdraft interest, or interest the pharmacist could be making by investing. Secondly, there is the matter of insurance. Every pharmacist has to insure his or her stock and the insurances are paid according to the amount of stock. So here we have the Tribunal saying that there is no mark-up, or not clearly indicating what the mark-up is, when variable amounts of interest are being paid according to the value of the stock and variable amounts of insurance are being paid according to the value of the stock. This is an insult to any retailer. No retailer can operate without some sort of mark-up. It may well be that the small fee that has been established by the Tribunal includes a mark-up, but if it is included, it is a fixed mark-up-whether it is 20c or 40c or 50c or whatever. It includes the cost of keeping in stock the expensive items I was referring to, which costs $70, $80, $400, $1,000 or $1,300. This is a large cost. What has not been recognised by the Tribunal decision is a basic fact of operating a retail business-it costs money to keep goods in stock. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Government and the Guild can go back to the Tribunal. I reject any measure which would abolish the Tribunal. The pharmacists asked for the Tribunal to be set up in 1981. They asked the Government to set up an independent tribunal. They got it from Minister MacKellar, as he then was. I do not believe we should abolish it. What I believe we should do is negotiate, talk together, and go back to the Tribunal with an agreed proposal. That is what should have happened in May; the Government and the Guild should have talked more and should have come up with an agreed proposal. I support the Bill. The amount allocated for a dispensing fee is nothing like the sort of cost that could have been incurred under the proposals that the honourable member for Tangney hinted at. I believe that we do need to look closely at the whole of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the whole pharmaceutical industry, not through the decision of a tribunal but through negotiation and discussion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the National Health Amendment Bill is well known. It is to amend the National Health Act to increase the maximum general patient contribution for prescribed drugs supplied under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme from the present $11 to $12. This is a comparatively small matter. Of course, it has revenue implications. The amendment that has been moved to the motion for the second reading of the Bill by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>`whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its concerns about the way in which the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is being undermined;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) deplores the way in which Government policies have had, and continue to have, a negative impact upon the ability of pharmacists to deliver pharmaceutical services to the community; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) calls upon the Government to honour its commitment to ensure access by the Australian community to necessary prescribed medications through a viable network of community pharmacies'. </PARA>
<PARA>We have heard a considerable amount of debate on these measures thus far today, both under the heading of this Bill and earlier, in the course of the discussion of the matter of public importance. I remind the House briefly of the main issue-that is, the issue which arises under the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Tangney. There has been a determination by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal for the purposes of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, a scheme set up by the Menzies Government and one of the many great social reforms which have come from our side of politics. If we look at the charter, the history, it will be found that we have been in the vanguard and Labor has trailed. </PARA>
<PARA> That decision, however, was based, as has been pointed out, on a flawed database system, that is, a survey of 0.3 per cent of 5,600 pharmacies. The results, in brief, were these: first, there was to be a reduction in professional fees for dispensing ready-made and prepared items-the bulk of the work under the national health service-from $4.55 to $3.50; and, second, the abolition of the mark-up on wholesale prices, which currently runs at about 25 per cent on drugs supplied. It does not take a genius to understand that the effects of this decision on the industry and on the consumers-that is, the people who go along to pharmacies-are going to be very great. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard two voices from the Government. The first voice was the voice of the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) earlier today. We remember him when he was talking about `this decision', and he used an expression which was quite extraordinary. He said that what we from this side were proposing was to overturn the law. What he was trying to convey was that somehow this decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal is set in concrete, somewhat like the tablets handed by God to Moses, and that there is nothing that this Government could or should do about it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had plenty of decisions on remuneration questions which have been changed by this Government, and let me remind the Minister, since he has come back into the chamber, of two. Has the Minister heard about Federal judges? Incidentally, and let this not be misrepresented as a claim on behalf of politicians, has he heard about politicians? There were tribunals which had something to do with their remuneration. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JJ4">Mr SPENDER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me continue. If we heard the two voices, they were these: earlier today the Minister, as I pointed out, was suggesting that this was a decision which could not be overturned. But we all know what it is. It is a major decision with damaging and, for some parts of the industry, terminal consequences. The other voice came in the thoughtful contribution by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). If ever I heard a man who on the one hand was trying to say, `Yes, the Government is right' but on the other hand was saying, `No, the Government is wrong; it is disastrously wrong' it is that honourable member. What he said, in a speech which for the most part I thought was a very thoughtful one, was this: what the Government is doing, just to quote what he had to say, was `through the Tribunal to restructure the industry'. To put it again, more accurately, it was wrong, and the Tribunal does not have the right to restructure the entire industry. It is not the job of the Remuneration Tribunal, to quote him fairly accurately from two parts of his speech. He went on to say it is the Government's job. Whether it is or not, it is obvious that he and others on the side of the Government do not support the decision, think the decision is wrong, think the decision is unjust and want somehow to escape from it. That is the reason why the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has sent out the fire brigade, headed up by the Minister, who is not in the House, to see whether some means can be found to douse the fire. So long as the Government stands by this damaging decision, those means are not going to be found.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me go to the three issues. First of all, there is the consequence of a savage reduction in incomes and in certain cases closures of pharmacies. The second is that the quality of health service is going to be diminished. I should think there is very little doubt about that. The third is-and I do not think this has been focused on as greatly as the other ones; perhaps not at all-that the independence of pharmacists, a fiercely independent group, is going to be eroded very greatly. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take those points in the order that I listed them; first, the savage reduction in incomes and the consequent closure of many pharmacies. We really have no doubt about that. Go to the Tribunal's decision. Incidentally, Madam Deputy Speaker, since you are in the chair may I point out that I understand that about 60 per cent of community pharmacies are owned by women and that a very high percentage, nearly 100 per cent, of those who are employed in community pharmacies are women. They are going to be affected by this decision; their incomes and their livelihood will be harmed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal admits this to be so. After all, if there is to be a reduction of $1.05-23 per cent-which is to be phased in by 1 November 1990, there can be no doubt that people are going to be hurt, and hurt badly. What does the Tribunal say? It says:</PARA>
<PARA>This has been done-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the reduction has been phased in-</PARA>
<PARA>because it represents a significant reduction in pharmacists' remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA>We can all understand that. It takes no genius to come to that conclusion. That is to be done together with an abolition of mark-up. I have spoken to many of the pharmacists in my electorate. I received a copy of a letter from one of them which has been written to the Minister, that is, the gentleman who is not in the House, nor anywhere else, so far as I can see. He gives a particular example. Let me summarise it. It will be in front of the Minister. I am sure that he will sit down and read it, along with the thousands of other letters that he will be receiving from the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The pharmacist points to what he considers to be an extreme example but it illustrates the point regarding the abolition of mark-up and the damage that will do. He points out that he regularly dispenses a prescription for five aminogram FS, for which the list price is $800. His remuneration for this will be $800, together with a dispensing fee which, as we know, is to drop to $3.50 next year. The wholesaler puts a surcharge on him. That surcharge is now 5.9 per cent, so that if he pays his wholesaler after the twenty-fifth day of each month he will lose over $40 on that prescription. I suppose that one could say, `Why can't this man pay earlier?'. The answer is, as is pointed out in his letter, that the Department never pays him promptly, never pays him within 25 days, so he has to finance the Department's tardiness and he has to bear personally that financial burden. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make one other point in relation to what has taken place. Does anybody conceive that if the pharmacists were members of a union they would be treated in this way? Does anybody suggest that if they were members of a union affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) they would be treated in this way? If members of a union faced this kind of reduction in their living standards, in what they earn, what would be the result? This country would come to a halt. There is no prospect that that would be done because it would be regarded as utterly in breach of the system, but here we have people who are outside it. Here we have self-employed people, people who are the backbone of this country and who are regarded probably more highly than any other professional group in this country. But they are easy targets, the Government thinks. They are not part of the ACTU network; they are outside it. The Government thought they were easy targets, but is now finding out that the target is a much much harder one. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me move on briefly now to make the next point; that is, that the quality of the health service will be diminished. The shadow Minister has pointed out the reasons for that. It is inherent in what has been said in the House. What do pharmacists do? They work long hours, they provide a great deal of unpaid advice, they provide a great deal of unpaid assistance to those in need, people who cannot get around, like the pensioners, the old people who cannot get down easily to the local pharmacy. They are highly trained. They put high investments of their time into their occupation. They are the alternative source of medical advice in the community. These activities must be curtailed. Why must they be curtailed? Very simply, it is because pharmacists will have to cut their costs. They are being told that they must wear the financial burden of this misguided decision and so they will be forced to do just that, to cut the services which are a backbone to community medicine in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I make a point concerning independence. The independence of the pharmacists will be eroded under this decision and that is made plain by the decision itself. The decision and the statement made by the Tribunal recognise specifically that some pharmacists, to quote the Tribunal, `essential for the supply of pharmaceuticals as contemplated by the Act may not be economically viable'. They are pharmacists needed by the Australian community. What does that mean, `may not be economically viable'? It means they will go bust. It means that they will have to pack up and close doors but it sounds a bit easier if the Tribunal says, `may not be economically viable'. What can those pharmacists do? They can go cap in hand to the Department. They are `required to apply', to quote the statement, to qualify for a special allowance for pharmacies which are essential but not economically viable; that is, they will be sent broke as a result of this decision. What does that do? It gives the Department more power over a very independent group of people. That does not come as any surprise to me. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude by summarising what I have put. For the public we will see reduced services. For the pharmacists we will see the margin squeezed, smaller returns and many going broke. Overall, we will see greater control by the Government of the industry; that is, of course, if the Government's resolve holds. As I have said, the Minister has the fire brigade out. We can recognise him anywhere, spiky hair, a red tie, and a somewhat frightened expression on his face. We hope that the Government will have the wit to realise that this decision is wrong, is damaging and needs to be reversed. </PARA>

Importantly, in his second reading speech, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) indicated both that the free pharmaceutical benefits for pensioners will be maintained and that the concessional beneficiary rate will remain at $2.50. In addition, the Government retains the safety net provisions whereby those individuals or families that record 25 scripts or more will receive the additional scripts free of charge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This debate happens at a highly political time in the discussion of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). It is interesting to note that today, before this debate, the matter of public importance related to the current disputation between pharmacists and the Government. If we reflect on events over the last couple of years, there have been very few debates here about the PBS but there has been great discussion in government and pharmacy about the way the PBS is to continue. I am somewhat saddened that, with the Opposition's usual display of political opportunism, those opposite have come on like knights on white chargers to get involved and protect some privileged part of the community. This debate should be about the delivery of an important aspect of our health service. We should be relying upon and emphasising the effect on the consumer. What we are trying to do in this Bill is to minimise the effect on the consumer of the charges that are going to be made under the PBS. It is important to get that into context. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw Opposition members' reaction to the decision on the Monday before last of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, when they immediately raced out into the community and whipped up hysteria-the type of hysteria we see on a whole host of issues. Those opposite have mentioned that this Tribunal was set up under legislation put in place by the Opposition when it was last in government. (Quorum formed) I thank my colleagues for coming into the chamber but I reflect on these cheap little tricks that the Opposition delights in. They are of little effect and are not going to deflect the Government from its main game. I was reflecting upon the Opposition's attitude to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. If we look back at 1981 we see that the present Whip-I assume the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) is carrying out his instructions with his cheap little quorum stunt-the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), was then the Minister for Health. I will quote from the Hansard of 29 April 1981, page 1731, when the honourable member introduced the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill which was the legislation that put in place the Tribunal. He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>There have been three inquiries into pharmacy earnings, costs and profits since 1964-65 and no agreement has been possible between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia on the results of any of those inquiries. The Government believes that the most appropriate mechanism to overcome the existing problem is the establishment of a tribunal sitting in a public forum.</PARA>
<PARA>There we had a 16- to 17-year period when the Guild and the Government sat in secret and never could come to any agreement about pharmacy remuneration. The honourable member for Warringah came into this place in 1981, put through a piece of legislation that set up a tribunal and now, some eight years later, the Opposition wants to come in here and champion the cause of overturning that Tribunal's decision. If we look further at what the honourable member for Warringah said at that time we find this:</PARA>
<PARA>Both the chemists and the Government will be bound by the tribunal's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Now we have the Opposition coming and saying, `No, no, a little piece of political opportunism. We have to overturn the Tribunal's decision'. Again back in 1981 it was stated by the honourable member for Warringah:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it will provide a forum in which all interested parties may publicly argue their case whilst ensuring that the levels of chemists' remuneration are determined by an independent body. </PARA>
<PARA>So what did we have in this recent public hearing by the Tribunal? We had over a year of looking into the different submissions. How many submissions? There were over 600 submissions. We cannot get much more public than that. Gone are the days when it was the Guild and the Government sitting behind closed doors, attempting to come to some agreement but failing to. We have a process which allows for the full discussion. I can accept that people can be unhappy with the decision. I can accept that it is the sort of game where people get up and quote figures left, right and centre to try to muddy the waters. But if we are determined to put the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) back, on an even keel, to take the heat out of it, and to take the controversy out of it, the Guild and the pharmacists that it represents should take the opportunity that has been offered to it by the Government to sit down and to discuss matters around the Tribunal decision. The Government has indicated that it is quite happy to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now time for the Guild to bite the bullet, to come and sit down in discussion with Government about the several matters that are open to them to discuss. If we go back to the May offer-and a lot of this discussion centres around the May offer, and sometimes we get opposing views about who actually walked away; it does not really matter now who walked away-the fact is that back in May there was a time line. The Tribunal had given the parties time in which to prepare their cases. There had to be a time in which the Guild and the Government, after the several months of continuing discussion, came to an agreement about the submission that they would jointly put. What happened in the end was that time ran out. The differences, although they were only minor, were such that they could not be accommodated. In part that was because the Guild lost a little bit of the thread of what it was doing for the constituency it was representing. It was encouraging individual pharmacists to go around the countryside lobbying local members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I am quite happy to talk to any pharmacists about their business, and I believe it is their right to have such discussions, but the Guild, in encouraging those individual pharmacists to go around lobbying, was not being forthright enough about the continuing negotiations that were going on. The nature of those negotiations was perhaps similar to the days before 1981, when they were held behind closed doors and that may have facilitated us not coming to an agreement. Perhaps debating points could have been up front so the Guild could not have failed to tell the pharmacists what was going on. But I had not intended to be harsh on pharmacists in the present environment. I only wish to note the editorial of today's Australian Financial Review, which perhaps says a lot about the politics of the present dispute. This editorial leads with these words:</PARA>
<PARA>Today's nation-wide closure by pharmacists is a petulant display of anger over the findings of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal which last week recommended that dispensing fees be cut . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It also says:</PARA>
<PARA> The guild has begun a campaign of scaremongering and whingeing, hoping to exert some political influence. The guild is well connected in the political arena, but suffers delusions about its real political clout. </PARA>
<PARA>I am well aware that even some of my colleagues would dispute the degree of clout that pharmacists have, but I do not think that anything is gained by continuing with a debate about that. The thing to emphasise is that an offer has been made by the Government-an offer that was noted by the Caucus in its meeting of this week-to join with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia to discuss the future of the industry. There were four points in particular offered out for the industry to discuss with the Government. One was a restructuring proposal for pharmacy. This has been one area, for a number of reasons, that I have had some interest in during the 3 1/2 years that I have been in this place, and my interest arises out of an Industries Assistance Commission report on the pharmaceuticals industry. The Commission not only went into the pharmaceuticals industry, but also went into the nature of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It gets back to the point that I made earlier. We hear Opposition members now, when there is some form of crisis that they can attempt to whip up even further, but in all this time they have been quite silent on the industry. They have to acknowledge that it has not only been the Government that has been talking about the restructuring of pharmacy as an industry, but it has also been the Guild, on behalf of the industry, because it acknowledges that it has some difficulties in maintaining the number of pharmacies. That is for a variety of reasons, not the least being the nature of modern business. People continue to emphasise that an element of the shopkeeper is required for pharmacy. But we want to stress also the professional role of pharmacy in the community, which is the next point that the Government has said that it wants to speak to pharmacy about. </PARA>
<PARA> When the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) talks about the professional role of pharmacists, he seems to think that they are always going to be recompensed in relation to the dispensing of scripts. If we are serious about attacking overprescribing, we should be looking at recompensing pharmacists for the wider role that they play in the overall health system. We just do it as some tack-on to handing over a good, instead of appreciating that advice is something that they can offer, without it being attached to the dispensing of drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that in the other place the Opposition is putting forward a piece of legislation to overturn the Tribunal's decision. I do not really know how, in a couple of weeks, the Opposition has decided what it would set as the remuneration. If Opposition members ever formed the government, I am not too sure what success they would have in convincing those of the New Right within their coalition, those that would have charge of its economic policy, that they should put this money up. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) highlighted that question. What would they do? What would the coalition be able to do if the Treasurer were the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) and if the Minister for Finance were, God forbid, Senator Stone?-or, if he is successful in trying to get into this place, into the A grade, Mr Stone the honourable member for wherever. What luck do they think they would have in getting money out of those types of economic managers? It is a nonsense. It is typical of a whole host of areas of policy where we have coalition spokespersons saying, `Right, we will do this; we will do that', when it all costs money and out in the general community we have those from the New Right think tank saying `Cut, cut, cut. Slash, slash, slash'. </PARA>
<PARA> Would the PBS and the drugs that are listed on the PBS be decreased? There are 530-odd drugs on the list. Would the evaluation implement an idea that was floated and repeated in an article in the Medical Journal of Australia, which suggests that the drugs that should be on the PBS should be from the list of essential drugs put around by the World Health Organisation? That would drop the number of drugs from 500-plus to about 110. Are we then to expect that, when people go to chemists to have them dispense the scripts that doctors have appropriately prescribed, they would be charged the full cost of the drugs?</PARA>
<PARA> In the overall context of the Opposition's fetish for slashing government expenditure, what we really have to know is where the Opposition stands on matters such as the PBS. They are matters that are very germane to what we are talking about. Of course the PBS is a very complicated area, because there is not only the Tribunal that sits in discussions of the remuneration of pharmacists but there are other bodies that advise government. The Opposition's amendment expresses its concern about `the way in which the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is being undermined'. Undermined! How? We have heard mention of some consternation about genetic drugs. For goodness' sake, that was something that came out of the Industries Assistance Commission report three years ago. The Government's response is about two years old, and the Opposition discovered generic drugs only when there was some furore in the community that it was whipping up. It is appropriate for the type of health service that Australia has that, on appropriate advice, governments look at generic prescribing, and so on. It is the way to go. It is not only helpful for the cost of the overall PBS. It does no harm to the type of health service given to patients. But it also has the added advantage that in this time of economic stringency it supports a fledgling industry that could be put on an equal footing with international firms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address my remarks to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack):</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>`whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its concerns about the way in which the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is being undermined;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) deplores the way in which Government policies have had, and continue to have, a negative impact upon the ability of pharmacists to deliver pharmaceutical services to the community; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) calls upon the Government to honour its commitment to ensure access by the Australian community to necessary prescribed medications through a viable network of community pharmacies'. </PARA>
<PARA>This decision is hardly a surprise as it comes as the third decision in a line of disastrous, incompetent judgments by the Government that have affected pharmacy in the past 2 1/2 years. The first of these was in May 1987, when the Government attempted to put 53 drugs on an authority only basis. At the time the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) gave three reasons for this. The first was simply `to prompt doctors to think twice before prescribing expensive drugs when there were possibly cheaper alternatives'. I found that particularly amusing at the time as a large proportion of the drugs so excluded were anti-cancer medications for which there was no alternative whatsoever. The second reason he gave at the time was that the Government, in selecting specific drugs, took full account of advice from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. That is a tactic the Government is using here-to hide behind some committee which has been set up. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will talk about that in a moment. The Medical Journal of Australia talked about that on 15 August 1988. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This decision did not include any assessment of the efficacy or cost effectiveness of the drugs. Although Peter Staples' press release of June 1988 mentioned the advice that the Government had received from the PBAC, he did not indicate the question that was asked. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, at that time he was asked a specific question, got the answer he wanted and then attempted to hide behind the Tribunal. The third reason that was given was that `last year these 53 drugs accounted for only one per cent of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme but this year they have risen by an alarming 43 per cent'. That was amusing too because anyone that had any knowledge of the industry would know that that was because angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were introduced at the beginning of that period. He had to back down on that decision, and that was not surprising. </PARA>
<PARA> The second idiotic decision was the one on generic drugs. At the time it led to shortages and a large number of people having difficulties with supply of medication. I have two press statements the Minister put out at the time. On 3 April he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There should be no problems with the supply or quality of medications. </PARA>
<PARA>On 7 April he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Any suggestions of inadequate supplies are also wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>Those two statements were contradicted by pharmacists around the country and specifically by people who rang my electorate office. Again, with a number of the drugs excluded by this decision, the Government had to reverse its decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Before us today is the third decision of the Government. While it may again try to hide behind a tribunal, the Government cannot escape from the fact that when it goes for an ambit claim it has to take responsibility for the outcome, given that the input determines the outcome. What is the Government's justification for this? It justified it on the basis of increased costs. Where are the increased costs going? Anyone who looks at the industry will know that those costs are going largely to the manufacturer. Between 1985 and 1988, of the increased costs, 62.3 per cent went to the manufacturer and only 13 per cent went to the pharmacist. The consumer price index went up 27.2 per cent. Yet the body that bore only 13 per cent of the increased cost is now being expected to bear the whole burden of the solution to the problems in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This decision has created absurd anomalies. The highest cost drugs may become totally unavailable from pharmacies except on a waiting list. A drug such as Roaccutane, an anti-acne drug, has a list price of $150. Manufacturers will usually add a surcharge on that of $4 for a single order. That totals $154 to the pharmacist, from which one will get from the Government $154.20 after 1 October. In 1990, rather than making a 20c profit from a $154 item, the pharmacist will actually make a 50c loss. That drug obviously will just not be stocked. </PARA>
<PARA> This evening I listened to the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) who had the audacity to say that we are `protecting a privileged part of the community'. I will be very happy to tell the pharmacists in my electorate and the pharmacists in the electorate of his colleague on the socialist left, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Saunderson), which borders my electorate and is a marginal seat, that the socialist left considers pharmacists a privileged part of the community. A pharmacist with whom I am personally acquainted works 48 hours a week and draws a salary of $32,000. On a 38-hour week, that works out at $22,600 a year for a 30-year-old professional person with four years training. To suggest that this makes him a privileged member of the community really makes my blood boil. </PARA>
<PARA> What is this closure going to do? The report from the accounting firm Deloittes, even if we accept that it is seriously flawed, said that 50 per cent of pharmacists were making a loss in 1986-87, and this 23 per cent reduction means that 1500 pharmacists face a very real prospect of closure. That may be partly justified in rationalisation, but look at what this will do to a small shopping centre-and many such centres exist in my electorate. The pharmacist is often the key player in the shopping centre. There may be 62 per cent of pharmacists with another competitor within one kilometre, but if we close down that pharmacist we will also close down the whole shopping centre. A butcher in one of my small shopping centres in Box Hill North rang me today and said, `The pharmacy is the busiest place in our shopping centre and he's only just breaking even!'. So I fear that this much talked about rationalisation is going to have very much larger costs, and I suspect that the minute savings by rationalisation will be largely outweighed by the costs we are going to face throughout the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been the Minister's response? I sat here in the debate on the matter of public importance and listened to him accuse the honourable member for Tangney of scaring people by talking about selling pharmaceuticals in supermarkets. I thought that was a bit strange because I seem to remember it was the Minister himself who brought it up on ABC radio. I have heard it bandied around that pharmacists have had an 85 per cent increase in income in the past five years and that they have done very well. That is a pretty simple analysis. That 85 per cent is gross; I would expect the Minister for Housing and Aged Care to know what gross is, but he should also know what net is. In fact, the 85 per cent is a gross figure. If we look at labour cost for pharmacies, which has gone up 87 per cent in the same time, and goods having gone up 101.5 per cent in that time, then the net figure is considerably lower and in fact is probably lower than the average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> We do have problems in pharmacy and they should be examined. There is the safety net, which is the largest reason for the blow-out in the figures. In the last financial year, 1988-89, the safety net cost $143m, an increase of 25 per cent on the year before. I concede that there is nothing wrong with trying to provide a safety net. In fact, it was started from very laudable ideals which, unfortunately, were not met. The Minister, in introducing the safety net in the National Health Amendment Bill 1987, described it as a cost efficient way of directing the resources to those most in need. I would be grateful if the Minister, who has finally walked into the House to listen to this debate, could explain how a system that allows a large family in the wealthy suburbs of Melbourne to hit the safety net on its first overseas trip is in fact providing resources in a cost efficient and directed way. I would like to know how a scheme that enables people who have illnesses such as asthma and who require a medication such as ventolin, which has a long shelf life, to get two years of prescriptions in one year and then none in the next so they can take advantage of the safety net is cost efficient and directing resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area where there is a really big problem is one which was identified by the Auditor-General. In April the Auditor-General stated that there were four problems, and these are a damning indictment of the Government's administration of the PBS. The Auditor-General said the Department does not have enough detail to know whether overpayments are being made; that the Department is unable to confirm that the people who receive free drugs are actually entitled to them; that it does not record information about the people who receive the drugs; and that is is not able to verify automatically the entitlement of a patient to free or concessional medication. What did the Government reply? The Government said there was no evidence at all of significant overpayments. The Auditor-General responded to that that there was a lack of evidence that the Department may be making overpayments because it does not retain sufficient information in its system to know whether overpayments are in fact occurring. That is total mismanagement and incompetence by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the comments of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) who went on at length about what my Party would or would not do in government and stated that we would not say exactly what we would do. When I heard him say that I went to the library and I got out a copy of the Labor Party's 1983 health platform. It is quite interesting. There are 20 pages here, and the then shadow Minister, now the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), had another 12 pages to try to explain it. In those 32 pages there is not one single mention of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Then I went to the Australian Labor Party platform, constitution and rules 1982 and looked up section 10. It does mention the PBS. The health platform listed six items and the PBS was not mentioned once. So we have the hypocrisy of the honourable member for Scullin and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who had the gall to talk about what we do. They did not mention the PBS on a single occasion when they were in Opposition, so they really cannot talk now. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Eden-Monaro talked about being faced with an increase in costs and having to do something. I have already shown that those costs are largely because the Government has been paying manufacturers increased margins and because of the incompetence of the failure to direct the safety net. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro then asked whether it was on our agenda to charge pensioners. That is very interesting. I had a reporter from the Melbourne Herald call me about a year ago and ask me to comment on that. She said she had had a leak from the Department that it was thinking about doing it and she wanted some comments just in case the Herald ran the story. Perhaps the Minister could come clean on whether his Department has in fact examined this issue over the past two years. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Eden-Monaro talked about the safety net and asked whether we were going to abolish it. We have never suggested that we would abolish it. We certainly might look at targeting it to the people that need it rather than wasting money such as the Australian Labor Party has done by having a 25 per cent increase in the first year of operation of the safety net. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro asked whether we would remove items from the PBS. That again was an unbelievably hypocritical question when we look at the number this Government has removed from the PBS. We see that it is quite extraordinary. The words used are `comfort drugs'. Comfort drugs are deemed a luxury and they have been removed apparently because we cannot pay the costs of drugs such as antihistamines, cough medicines and digesic-something that has caused doctors an enormous amount of trouble as a large number of elderly people have used digesic for arthritis. The Government attempted to remove aspirin and paracetamol for pensioners but was rapped over the ears and had to change its mind. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Scullin talked about protecting a privileged part of the community. I will enjoy telling my pharmacists that that is what the socialist left thinks they are. He said we should look at the community. I have tried to argue here this afternoon that in fact it is the community that is going to be severely disadvantaged by this decision, both in their access to pharmacy and in the effect that pharmacy closures will have on the broader community, particularly small shopping centres in metropolitan Melbourne. The honourable member extolled the virtues of the decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal without mentioning that the Government was able to achieve an ambit claim that it never imagined it would have accepted. This was before the same Tribunal that in June gave a 10c cut in the dispensing price of a script, which the Federal Court knocked back with the comment that it was `so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have so exercised the power'. The Court went on to say that it was `difficult to see how, at a time of general inflation, the amount of the professional fee should be reduced'. Those comments apply equally to this decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Scullin talked about the editorial in today's Australian Financial Review. I am pleased to see that he reads that newspaper. There are some other things in it at times that he might like to quote about his Government's economic policies. The editorial today cited the figure of an 85 per cent increase in pharmacy remuneration that the Minister has been talking about on occasion, not realising it is a gross figure and not a net figure, which is quite misleading. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today told us that `misleading' was just another word for a shorter word that we do not use in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure is a catastrophe for community pharmacy, and it will have catastrophic effects through the broader community. The Government, after fighting and antagonising the pharmacists, as it has done continually for 12 months, now wonders why the pharmacies and the Pharmacy Guild have difficulty in trusting it, in sitting down with a government which has been so belligerent for such a long time. This is not surprising. We see the same sort of problems in the aged care area, and it is just another example of a Minister who is unable to come to grips with an important provider group who are intimately involved in one aspect of the running of his Department. It is essential to the whole community that we do something to reverse this decision. We should look at the very real problems of pharmacists, when 50 per cent are making a loss, and try to come up with something that will address the very real needs of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, and not just keep tampering at the edges. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on the National Health Amendment Bill 1989. The honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) did not mention the Bill which we are debating, nor the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition which, of course, has absolutely nothing to do with the legislation. It is completely unnecessary and completely without relevance to the debate. We are here to debate the increase in the general patient contribution from $11 to $12 which was a Budget announcement and which will achieve, over a full year, a $17m saving for the Government and for the taxpayers of this country. It is important that we should be protecting them. It is important that we should be making our economy as efficient as possible and it is important from the point of view of the taxpayers that this sort of necessary legislation is introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The debate has ranged very widely and the honourable member for Chisholm raised a large number of issues. He mentioned targeting. We on this side of the House laugh when we look at the targeting proposals of the Opposition. Many of us remember the assets test debate of many years ago, when it was okay for the millionaires to continue to receive pensions and it was a terrible and nasty thing for the Government to try to target expenditure in that area. The saving for the Budget this year from the assets test-people in Australia should understand this-is $600m. That was being paid to pensioners who had substantial means. My mother has substantial means following my father's death. She does not receive a pension, nor does she expect one, and nor should she receive one. When the Opposition wishes to talk about targeting, we would like it to be a little more honest. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Chisholm talked about some group or tribunal that has been set up in the Government's interest. The Opposition does not want to face up to the fact that it was its tribunal, set up when it was in government, that brought down this decision. It was its tribunal, with its ethos established by legislation in this place by its Health Minister in 1981, that brought down this decision. It is the case that from time to time tribunal decisions in this place are adjusted. One only has to look at the issue of parliamentary salaries to know that that is the case. A pharmacist rang me up the other day and he said, `It is the principle here that is important. You can adjust this tribunal decision'. (Quorum formed) Let me explain to the people who are listening to the broadcast that again the Opposition does not want to debate this issue. It just wants to destroy and to spoil. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I was making was that the pharmacist said to me, `You can change this decision'. I said, `The only way we have changed decisions in respect of parliamentary pay is downwards. Is that okay?', and he said, `No, we don't want it to go downward. It is the principle that I'm concerned about'. But today pharmacists have been having meetings. I have just received a fax which tells me that Western Australian pharmacists have had a meeting and they have decided that they, on this decision taking effect-and I might say that we have been asking pharmacists to come to us and discuss the decision and we believe there are areas where there can be considerable reconciliation between pharmacists and the Government-are going to commence recouping from the public the government subsidy reduction of $1.05 for each pharmaceutical benefit scheme item dispensed according to the following timetable: on 1 October, from the general public; on 1 November, from concessional card holders-they are going to recoup that $1.05-from 1 December, from pensioners; from 1 January, from repatriation patients. I mean, how bad are their sums? They will lose, according to the formula, 35c in October from their fee and they are going to charge $1.05. So it is up 70c plus for the pharmacist. How can they justify it? It is an indication of the sort of sums we have been getting. </PARA>
<PARA> I sat here in the House wanting to debate this issue, thinking that there are many areas in which there can be reconciliation, but if they come back with this, after not wanting to meet with the Government, after being stirred up by the Opposition, then what do they expect? They want to take $1.05 extra and what is happening? They are losing 35c. Not only that, but they are going to take it from concessional card holders, from pensioners and from repatriation patients. It is blackmail. If we look again at today's Australian Financial Review, what does it have to say about them? I quote:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are supported by the Opposition. The honourable member for Chisholm wanted to mention-because it is a popular thing to talk about-the socialists on this side of the House. When we look at the pilots dispute, who do we find in cahoots? The Socialist Workers Party of Canberra is on their side, and the Liberal Party-the Opposition. Together they are holding Australia to ransom. There are 16 million people in Australia who would like a 30 per cent pay rise this year, but there are not too many of them who would be willing to bring the country to its knees to effect their aim. That is the position of the pilots. They are supported by the Opposition. Now we find this approach: as of 1 October, if the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal decision goes ahead without any change-and we are willing to talk-they are going to take back $1.05 for the cost of 35c. So that is a windfall for them of 70c starting from then, and I suppose they are going to go on and on. This is the lot that honourable members on the other side are supporting. That is all they want, is it not? We could go on and on about the things that were mentioned by honourable members opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They say that the gross figures are misleading. The gross figures are not misleading. If we say that there is an 85 per cent increase in the gross remuneration, that is relevant, unless the costs have increased by more than 85 per cent. They have not established that costs have increased by more than 85 per cent, so the net figure is 85 per cent. To say that it is not relevant because it is a gross figure is nonsense. They need to do their sums. One of their concerns is about expensive drugs. If we look at those expensive drugs, where are they prescribed? Principally there are three areas in which the expensive drugs are prescribed; for cancer patients; for patients who are diabetics and need insulin; and for people on hormonal therapy. There are some other expensive drugs coming on and perhaps this is one of the reasons why they are so concerned about losing their 25 per cent mark-up. The antihypercholesterolaemia drugs that will become part of the medical framework in the next few years are very expensive drugs and there are lots of people in Australia with high cholesterol. There is a windfall around the corner for the pharmacists, so no wonder they are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> But the job of the Government is to be concerned about the macro-economic situation in this country and the micro-economic reforms that are taking place. Every time we come here and we talk about some micro-economic reform, honourable members opposite do not want it. When we talk about changing wheat marketing their reply is, `No, no, you cannot do that'. They are the subsidisers; they always have been. They are the rural agrarian socialists and they always have been. We talk about deregulating air travel-and we have done it, not honourable members opposite. The two-airline agreement was conceived by those honourable members and perpetuated by them-they do not want it. All of the consequences that go with those things they do not want. If we talk about efficient pharmacy, it is important that we discuss with pharmacists some of the concerns that they have. There are legitimate concerns for people in country areas. There are legitimate concerns about the efficacy and the viability of pharmacies in the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not paying lip service to it. We want to talk about it. But what the Opposition is doing is trying to achieve some petty, pathetic political gain, as it does on every issue in this place because it does not have a philosophy which drives it. Honourable members are talking about expenditure. It took 38 years to reach $1 billion, and in the next three years we can add another $1 billion to it. The hairy-chested cost cutters on the other side come in here day after day saying, `We're going to cut money from education. We're going to cut money from welfare. We'll do this. We'll do that. We'll cut taxation too'. Those two things are mutually exclusive if one is going to run some sort of a surplus. But they are going to do all of these things. Yet, when it comes to an issue where they can support the Government, or they can bring about some useful change, we do not see it. One of the honourable members opposite mentioned that, in fact, it is doctors who write prescriptions, who drive this mechanism, and I agree with him. It is in fact doctors who write prescriptions. It is necessary, if we are to face up to the future of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the expensive blow-outs that are occurring in that area, that something be done about the way in which prescriptions are written in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no question that we use many more drugs than we need. There is no question that there needs to be a program which counteracts this. But that will not improve the pharmacists' position. If they live in a fool's paradise now and suddenly there is a change in prescribing habits they will be in a worse position. They need to face up to a long term realistic assessment of their industry, and that is what we are trying to do. We want to talk about restructuring; we want to talk about long term viability, but they are the ones who are avoiding it; they are the ones who are ducking away. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition wants a market approach to the PBS, to prescribing drugs and to the expense of pharmaceuticals in this country, it will have to consider charging pensioners. The Opposition continually says, `Well, you are in government'. We have not done it. We have been in government for a considerable time. If the Opposition wants a market approach, let us hear about it. If the Opposition wants to increase the price from $12, as it will be now, to $15 and save $25m in a year, it should tell the Australian public that that is what it wants to do. That would introduce a supply and demand ethic to the way in which pharmaceuticals are prescribed and to the way in which the expense of this important part of our health system grows. Let us hear about it if that is what the Opposition wants to do. Let us not hear the carping criticism, the blaming the umpire sort of approach that we have had for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> The position for pharmacists was this: they were receiving-and I will use an analogy-seven apples a week. The Government went to them with a proposal and said, `Look, we realise that there is a blow-out here; there is a need for restructuring; there is a need for this industry to be better organised. We will offer you six apples a week'. They said, `No, no, no. We will go to the umpire because we think we will be better off'. The umpire offered them four, and now they are saying to us, `No, no. We want seven again'. The decision was given by an independent tribunal. The pharmacists and the previous Government, which introduced the Tribunal, said, `We will be bound by this legislation', but they chose not to be because, in this instance, they see some gain for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard all sorts of stories about expensive drugs. We need also to understand that there are many cheaper drugs with a high turnover. Pharmacists can buy mogadon at $1.29. If they buy it in large amounts they get a discount so it costs $1.20. What do the pharmacists sell it for-$9. If they add in $2.54, which is the dispensing fee, what is the mark-up? It is not 25 per cent; it is a few hundred per cent. We need to understand that. A large number of scripts are private scripts and the mark-up is not 25 per cent; it is substantially more. </PARA>
<PARA> If we average all those things out, there is a consideration. We know the expense of drugs, and we are willing to take into account the problems that exist for a pharmacy in the country, in Karratha or Kalgoorlie, or some other place like that. But let us not fudge the figures; let us talk about what is actually happening. I know there are many expensive drugs. If a drug costs a pharmacist $200, to hold it on his shelf would be very costly. But people should understand that, if a person is on anti-cancer therapy, he does not go to a doctor who says, `Well, I think you have got cancer. Here is the treatment. Take it immediately'. There is a considerable work-up before that procedure occurs. The person goes to hospital; perhaps he has an operation, a bone scan, a barium meal or some special procedure. He comes out of the hospital after being worked up by an oncologist-someone who treats cancer with drugs-under a particular regime. Then he goes to the chemist with a script and says, `Look, this is the regime I am on and I will be wanting these'. The pharmacist orders them in on the day the patient needs them, and he is provided with them. If such a person lives in the country, it is a more difficult problem, and the Government is willing to account for that. The Government is willing to take that into account. But the Opposition should not tell us stories about that. </PARA>
<PARA> If a person is a diabetic, it is not the case that he goes to a doctor who suddenly decides that that person should be under treatment. A person is put on a regime that is developed. He knows what he has to do and which drugs he has. He knows what is left in the fridge, so he prepares himself by saying to the pharmacist, `I will need this'. He can order it. The pharmacist does not need to hold it in his fridge for three months. We need to understand that. There are occasions when these things are needed in emergencies. There are occasions when that is not the case. That is understood. But if one factors into the whole equation the low cost of drugs which are used a great deal and on which there is a high margin, and the expensive drugs which are generally used much less frequently, one sees that that has been taken into consideration by this decision. </PARA>
<PARA> When members of the Opposition say that there is no mark-up, they are telling a story, because there is a mark-up which is built in as a percentage of the dispensing fee. We have been saying that time and time again, but as long as the Opposition wants to distort things, as long as the pharmacists in Western Australia want to take the sort of approach that has been outlined in their statement, how on earth can we talk with them? How on earth can we discuss these considerations which bear consideration by this Government? How on earth is it possible for us to reach some sort of reasonable conclusion? Are they saying that they would rather fight this decision and accept something in between? If that is what they are saying, I feel sorry for them because they will be disadvantaged. If they had accepted the Guild's considered view and the view of the secretariat of the Guild in May this year, they could have avoided a great deal of heartache. Indeed, they would not have been supported by the Liberals in this place because, if they believe that, if the hairy-chested cost cutters on the other side came to government, they would allow the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to blow out as they are suggesting, I think they are being led down the garden path. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, many pharmacies across Australia are carrying out what is essentially a lockout-a lockout of their staff and of their customers. I presume that the Opposition supports that situation. The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) gave us an extremely lucid and, by the standard of this debate, extremely factual description of the real issue. The debate rarely centred upon the National Health Amendment Bill itself-and I will come back to that in a moment. I am concerned that pharmacists across Australia are meeting today, probably tonight and on other occasions-some have met already-and have not heard what the Government is saying. Probably-and I could understand this, if I were in their situation-they are not able to listen to what the Government is saying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make this plea today: pharmacists should look at what has gone on in the past and not simply be wound up at public meetings. They should talk to people who have some responsibility and accountability for this issue, to find out what the real facts are. There is a danger that if some of those in leadership positions continue to push in this direction, the problems will not be overcome as quickly as they would like. What the Government wants, and, I would expect, what the consumer, the Australian public, wants, is for this issue to be resolved very quickly. It will be resolved very quickly if pharmacists, and more particularly their leadership, as their representatives, talk with the Government. There are recommendations by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT) that need to be taken up and considered.</PARA>
<PARA> I am trying to talk with pharmacists about how to develop the guidelines for an essential pharmacy allowance-something I thought that many pharmacists, including many from rural areas, would be particularly interested in. But it would seem that people are prepared to rail against the Tribunal's decision and against the Government's offer, without actually knowing anything about it, and without even contributing, which is probably more to the point, to the discussion. One has to ask why. There can be only one answer. If people do not want to contribute and find out what can be done, the only alternative that would spring to my mind, particularly being in a place like this, is that it is simply and purely a lot of political action. They are out there scaring people in the community, but that is pretty typical of the way a lot of people behave. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Perth made many valid comments. He explained the situation very well. To give due respect to his contribution I will not go back over the same ground, except to say that his contribution in relation to the reality of high cost drugs and mark-up was excellent. I hope that many pharmacists and honourable members opposite will consider it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a complex matter. But in any business there is averaging. What is not being said, but what would be easily known if people had the interest and the honesty to talk to the distributors of drugs, is the way pricing structures and supply are organised. This whole thing about high cost drugs and insulin is a beat-up. When consumers find that their medication is going to be available; when they find that there will be pharmacies left open after all the doom and gloom-let us not forget that these assertions have been made ever since the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) began-the pharmacists will be the real losers. They will lose credibility, as they are now, in the public eye, for their action and for the hysteria they are fostering in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) spoke in the matter of public importance debate today about the PBRT, the Remuneration Tribunal. I remind him that, while he may seek to cast aspersions and innuendo upon that Tribunal, he is doing so on three very reputable people. His assertions have no substantial basis. I remind him also that when the members of a tribunal sign their names to a document like that, they put their whole reputation on that document. </PARA>
<PARA> If I were the Deputy President of the Industrial Relations Commission, if I were one of Australia's leading professors in health economics, if I were a senior and very well respected accountant and representative on other major bodies in Australia, I would not put my name on a document with such import if I did not fully believe that what I was doing was true and accurate. I would certainly not do it if I felt that I was being in any way intimidated by any government. Very serious assertions and insinuations have been made by the honourable member for Tangney and other people. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of issues I could go through today in that regard, issues that have come up in this debate. One of them is the mark-up question. But I want to go back to where we were in May with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, to the evolving process in relation to the Remuneration Tribunal. The Government sought then to make a joint submission to the Tribunal. The current base of remuneration is the dispensing fee of $2.54 and the average mark-up of $2.01, making an average total gross return to the pharmacist of about $4.55. There is no indexation in that. There is a 25 per cent mark-up. There is an isolated pharmacy allowance, on which the Government expends only about $0.4m. It is very strict in its guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's offer on 11 May was for a 10 per cent mark-up with a differential dispensing fee to assist more pharmacies; a separation of the mark-up and dispensing fee-something that pharmacists would give their eye teeth for but which they rejected very noisily; and indexation every six months of the dispensing fee. They were tremendous advances. As well, we offered an essential pharmacy allowance, full consultation before significant changes or restructuring of the PBS; maintenance of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal and six-monthly reviews; the Commonwealth to negotiate with wholesalers in relation to surcharging; and very importantly for many pharmacists, judging by the letters and requests that have come to me since then, a $50,000 amalgamation incentive payment. We could not get that agreement with the Pharmacy Guild, and I believe that part of the heat that is in the issue now is related to the fact that some of the Guild leadership are desperately trying to cover their tracks because of their failure to advise their members properly on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government wants to talk with the pharmacists, and I believe that that will be possible. I hope that we will soon see a realistic resolution to this issue so that people are not disadvantaged in the way they have been in many cases referred to today. I have no vendetta, despite what a few hysterical people would say. I do not think it is in any way relevant, but for a few months when I was 17 or 18 I went to pharmacy college for half a year. I withdrew from pharmacy college and went on to full-time employment and part-time study. Some people think that because I did go to pharmacy college for a couple of months of my life and chose then to go into full-time employment and do other things I have got a vendetta, that I want to destroy pharmacy. That is the level this debate has reached. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is trying to help pharmacists in three specific areas-and others too, if they care to talk. If they really want to solve the issue instead of going around and beating their breasts, we want to talk about the essential pharmacy allowance, the structure in Australia and a professional role for pharmacists. Let us also recognise-not much attention has been focused on this-that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme has become very expensive in terms of the amount of dollars expended. A couple of years ago the cost was $700m; last year it was over $1,000m; this year it will be well over $1,200m, or a 17 per cent increase on last year. In a couple of years' time it will be $2,000m. That is a lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA> The PBS does a darned good job out there, protecting people who are chronically ill with the safety net, people on low incomes with the concessionary payment, the aged and pensioners. It does a tremendous job, and there is going to be a tremendous growth in the number of prescriptions as well. I think that needs to be taken into account when pharmacists sit down to do their sums and, as the honourable member for Tangney and others would say, talk about all the doom and gloom. Let us look at the facts for a little while before we get too carried away and get too locked in. </PARA>
<PARA> As for some of the facts, I think it is worth while exploring them at this point. The Government is putting before the House a Bill that will move the general patient contribution from $11 to $12, and indexed thereafter. I think that is quite reasonable. Most people in the community do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know the Opposition is not opposed to it, but a large number of people in the community recognise that pharmaceuticals are very expensive and that there is a high level of subsidy. There has to be; one way or another, the Government is going to spend over $1,200m a year. As to what the pharmacists say the Government should do, I will read out some points from a pharmacist, Mr Mike Courtney from Noosa, who says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The rising costs of the PBS could be offset by increasing the patient contribution for general benefits and concession card holders. </PARA>
<PARA>We are increasing the general patient contribution today, but certainly this Government has not increased the $2.50 for concessionaries or for pensioners, despite the claims that are being made, and I will refer to them in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA> He has also suggested the Tribunal take the action rather than what he thinks is simply a government or Budget decision, and he says that we should alter the safety net provisions to concessional status. He suggested the Government should make pensioners pay a nominal fee for prescriptions or increase the Medicare levy. This is pharmacists saying these things to me, not the Government. Another pharmacist, a consumer pharmacist, Isabel Moss in New South Wales, says that `pharmacy says no to Keating's give-away wages and tax cuts in the face of lost profits'. I assume from that that the person is saying there should be more profits in pharmacy for pharmacists; the Government should give more money there, despite what a tribunal says, so that people should not get their tax cuts-okay, if that is what they think. Mr Thomas, a Milton and Thomas pharmacist from Castlemaine, says in a letter to me through his local member that, if we gave him a police badge, a gun and a piece of paper, he would strike dollars off our beloved Budget by getting illegitimate recipients off the welfare bill. That is nice, is it not! That is what we are dealing with. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the pharmacists, the poster and the advertisement that I have here obviously cannot be visually incorporated in Hansard, but let me read out a few things in it. The pharmacists say: `Pensioners to pay. Is this the Government's next step?' No. This Bill quite clearly says this is not the Government's next step. Despite their fear campaign and despite the goings on then and now, the Government has not increased the patient contribution for pensioners or for those who are general concessionaries. But, for reasons which I think are well understood and accepted by the community, it has had to increase the patient contribution for the general public. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Perth has just received a fax, and so have I, from Western Australia. The Guild in Western Australia had a meeting today, 7 September, at 2.30 p.m.-the facsimile is marked with that time. The information is that a meeting of 1,200 concerned members of the pharmacy profession unanimously passed a resolution that from 1 October they will charge an extra $1.05 for every pharmaceutical benefits scheme item dispensed to the general public. From 1 November they will extend that to concession card holders; from 1 December to pensioners, and from 1 January to repatriation patients. It is not the Government doing that; this is the pharmacists-$1.05. What the Tribunal has determined is that that $1.05 should apply in three stages, not from 1 October, not from 1 November, not from 1 December, not from 1 January, but three stages from 1 October through to 1 November 1990. But here the Western Australian pharmacists want to whack a $1.05 off right on top and hit all those people from the general public right through to repatriation patients in one greedy hit. </PARA>
<PARA> Is that fair? Is this the concerned pharmacist? Where are these pharmacists? As Minister, I want to talk with those pharmacists. I want to talk with them about the essential pharmacy allowance that would give back $1.05 for the first 1,000 scripts. They want it added on to the general public; I want to give it back. I want to give them $1.05 and I want to find the essential pharmacies that require it. But will they talk? No. They pass resolutions, unanimous resolutions-1,200 of them-saying `Hit the public'. That is their way of dealing with government-`Hit the public'. Is that right? Is it logical? Is it fair? I think the people in Western Australia will judge them on that. </PARA>
<PARA> To wind up, I think it is important that I refer to the press conference and, I presume, the policy of the Opposition. The honourable member for Tangney, at his press conference on 1 September, when he was asked whether he would allow pharmacists the discount on a PBS script, said, firstly:</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, I would allow them to have a free market under the general patients fee. At the moment the general patient's fee is $12. There is no reason why there shouldn't be a freer market in respect of products that fall under that. There will be competition there. </PARA>
<PARA>That should be of concern to people as well. I have indicated a number of elements of documentary evidence that show that people are already being charged over the agreed fee. Of course, if the pharmacist overcharges and puts that prescription under the safety net, that is illegal. But, of course, if they overcharge and do not, in following the law, the consumer misses out on a very valuable entitlement under the safety net-an entitlement which for many people is becoming operable at this time of the year. So here we have a serious situation, but one that is certainly very capable of resolution if pharmacists in Australia really want to deal with the issue. I hope that after today they will. As I have said, they may have closed their doors for a couple of hours today but, ever since the Tribunal report came down, I have said that my door is open 24 hours a day to talk to pharmacists. I have reiterated that offer to the Pharmacy Guild today and it stands until this problem is sorted out. </PARA>
<PARA> Question put:</PARA>
<PARA> That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Shack's amendment) stand part of the question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the information of honourable members I present a letter dated 7 September 1989 which I received from Mr J. S. O'Neill, First Assistant Auditor-General, concerning explanatory notes for 1989-90 relating to Aboriginal Affairs matters and which was received in my office just prior to Question Time today. I presume this is the letter to which the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) referred earlier in the day. When this matter arose the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) asked me whether or not the possession of such correspondence was a contempt. The concept of contempt is a broad one, but central to it is the requirement that to constitute a contempt an act or omission must obstruct or impede the House, members or a committee, or have a tendency to do so. Considering the present matter, however, it is difficult to see that the possession of a copy of such a letter would itself constitute an obstruction or an impediment. I add, however, that I consider the release of private correspondence between the Auditor-General and me to be irregular and undesirable, especially as it has resulted in its being brought before the House before I was able to deal with it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from providing an explanation to the House regarding the advising of the Australian Audit Office to the Speaker which has been tabled that the explanatory notes 1989-90 Aboriginal Affairs (Budget Related Paper No. 76b) contains significant errors and misleading statements. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, this is a matter of extreme gravity. The document that you tabled just before dinner is unprecedented in that it is a letter to you, and also a similar letter was forwarded to the President of the Senate. In this letter the First Assistant Auditor-General, Mr J. S. O'Neill, makes very detailed allegations about the Aboriginal Development Commission's budgetary papers brought to this place. Mr Speaker, you would be aware, as would other honourable members, that a letter of this nature from the independent office of the Auditor-General, making the allegations that it does, is in the memory of most people-many have served for a long time-unprecedented. It also is important to note that the Australian Audit Office is an independent statutory body and it stands, along with the Ombudsman, right outside Parliament. In the Auditor-General's case, he is the keeper of the public purse. The Auditor-General of Australia, Mr Taylor, is a former Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I think that is material. He would know that a letter of this nature, important as it is, ought not to be sent lightly, and it has not been sent lightly to you, Mr Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA> What I want to do in seeking to suspend Standing and Sessional Orders is to give the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) the opportunity to respond. This letter is detailed. It details four occasions on which the Auditor-General says that Parliament has been misled with the documentation that has been provided to it. We do not censure the Minister personally, but I think the Minister would be aware of the gravity of the allegations that are made in this letter. They deserve the deepest consideration and response from him. The whole story of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) has been a sorry one. The Minister earlier in the week, as we recall, related the details of the Perkins allegations. That was all about the ADC. Previous chairmen and general managers have been replaced and in their stead are people appointed by the Minister. Back in April the Minister, in this chamber, in relation to the newly proposed legislation to set up the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, said:</PARA>
<PARA>ATSIC must have its priorities right from the start. </PARA>
<PARA>That was on 11 April in this chamber. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>It will have to put a lot of effort into such areas as corporate planning, program budgeting, policy and program guidelines, and evaluation and internal audit. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is clearly a need, identified in the reports of the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General, to act now to remedy deficiencies within the present structures. We shall ensure that the ADC during its remaining life, operates on a similar basis to ATSIC and in a manner that properly reflects Government priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>That was back in April. Yet today we have this letter that has been sent by the First Assistant Auditor-General. It relates to a special audit that was done by the Auditor-General back in March. This special audit is the subject of this letter, because the Auditor-General, in part, says:</PARA>
<PARA>Yet the ADC persists in providing this and other incorrect information to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>He cites examples:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . defects in the ADC's administration identified in the special audit had not been corrected. </PARA>
<PARA>As an example, I quote from that March 1989 special audit report:</PARA>
<PARA>The audit recommends that the ADC should:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) disclose the names of people and organisations who receive enterprise loans and grants, together with details of the amount and purpose, and details of any significant increase or other change subsequently made. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing has happened. That is what has caused this letter. The Auditor-General is throwing his hands up in the air because nothing has happened. It has got worse and he knows that all of us in this place on either side of the chamber rely on the accuracy of documents that come to us post-Budget. Each individual Minister has a responsibility to ensure that all matters under his jurisdiction, his administration, are accurate in the details that are brought to this chamber. Indeed, the ADC, as I picked up myself and detailed in a press release, had incorrect figures. The Minister wrote to me about that and it would appear that the errors came from the ADC itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hand interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whatever the Minister's letter says. His letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The appropriations listed on the Budget paper No. 3 are correct . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then it states:</PARA>
<PARA>The components of these figures are incorrect and were not provided by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs or the Aboriginal Development Commission. The correct figures, as provided by the Aboriginal Development Commission . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The ADC admitted to me in a memo that those figures were mathematically incorrect. Now that matter has been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> What is clear is that there is something wanting in the ADC. What we are asking the Minister to do is to respond to the details that are outlined in the Auditor-General's letter. As I have said, it is very important that people understand the gravity of what is contained in this letter. It is not usual; in fact that is how the Auditor-General starts his letter. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not the usual practice of the Australian Audit Office to comment on Explanatory Notes that Departments provide for the Parliament in support of the Budget or Additional Estimates each year, but I should draw your attention to certain aspects of the . . . ADC. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose we should look at the broader issue that this letter raises because that is the issue that I think the Minister is required to respond to, as well as, of course, the detail. That is, if the Auditor-General is accepted by all of us as being the independent monitor of the public purse, when he comes to the Parliament and says, `Look, information provided to you parliamentary members is inaccurate and misleading', we must view that charge with extreme gravity. We must hear from the Minister who is responsible. At the end of the day, it is the Minister of whatever department who bears that responsibility. He must come to this chamber and explain. He must explain in detail why it is that these charges have been made. What we ask is for the Minister to stand here now, as we have the opportunity to hear him, and talk about these issues. It was only yesterday that another Auditor-General's report was lodged in this chamber concerning the ADC. Audit Report No. 12 states:</PARA>

I submit that it is quite obviously not in accordance with Standing Orders to discuss what are other reports.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just to pick up the point that the Leader of the House is making, the reason that I come here in the fashion that I do and ask to suspend Standing Orders is that I believe this matter to be urgent. This letter is a central issue for this Parliament. The Auditor-General has come to us and said that documentation provided to the Parliament is misleading and inaccurate. It is urgent. This is the last sitting day for a while that the Minister can be given the opportunity to respond. He ought to respond. This letter was only tabled just prior to dinner and this is the first opportunity we have had to be able to use the forms of the House to give the Minister the opportunity to respond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is urgent. The reason it is urgent is the unprecedented nature of the letter that has been received by the Speaker and also by the President of the Senate. I am sure the Leader of the House appreciates that point. I do not believe that I have canvassed the issues widely, in the few words that I have had to say. This is a reasonably narrow focus. It is a focus on the ADC, an independent statutory authority, with approximately a $100m base, that is in turmoil. The Minister simply has to respond and explain this very dramatic, unprecedented letter that has been delivered to this House. </PARA>
<PARA> Every member in this chamber who appreciates the need for the independence of the Auditor-General will want to know what the Minister has to say. Indeed, all of us who have a vested interest in seeing the administration of Aboriginal affairs improved will want to know from the Minister what steps he is prepared to take. But, of course, we first wait to hear his explanation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion, Mr Speaker. Before the House at this stage we have two words which are very important-`accountability' and `reliability'. This Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) is continually failing to address those qualities in this Parliament. This is of great concern to us as members of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know what the Minister will do. He is going to get up and say, `The Aboriginal Development Commission will disappear in a few weeks' time, on 1 October, and therefore it does not really matter. I will sort it all out. ATSIC is going to come in and it is all going to be lovely and well organised, well administered and all of that'. Well, that is not the issue. The issue is that in the Westminster system the Minister is accountable to this Parliament to tell us the truth all the time, and the information he brings into this Parliament should be reliable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has delivered to this Parliament the details of the ADC, as the shadow Minister outlined, Budget Related Paper No. 7.6b, and it is inaccurate. It is the Minister's responsibility to administer all areas in his portfolio and to know what is going on. But here, probably for the first time in the history of Australia, the Auditor-General writes to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate about an issue of prime concern. One would think that after two years of chaos and maladministration in this portfolio, the Minister would do something about the administration right now-not into the future. As he said in the Parliament on 11 April 1989:</PARA>
<PARA> We will ensure that the ADC during its remaining life will operate on a similar basis as the ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA>Where does that put this Parliament? The reality is that the Minister is just not administering his Department, not getting the due processes in place to ensure that things operate effectively and efficiently in his Department. We can have no confidence in this Minister in the way in which he administers his portfolio. </PARA>

As I said right at the beginning of this speech, this matter is about accountability, and the Minister should explain to us how this can come about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the motion relates to me. I understand what it says and I do not think I need the advice of the right honourable member for New England-although his long experience here is very helpful. The problem is that the shadow Minister has again raised a whole range of issues. In moving this motion he has shown that he has little or no understanding of the ADC Act. I suggest that if he has not got a copy of the Act I will get my office to supply him with one when I return from this discussion. Quite clearly, the motion he has moved here tonight goes to the very thrust of the ADC Act and his lack of understanding of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the substance of the Auditor-General's letter that was mentioned by him in moving the motion, honourable members will note that the Auditor-General, on the first page of the letter, supports what I requested and not necessarily what the ADC has stated in its explanatory notes. I do not resile from that. That is a fact. The Auditor-General supports what I asked him to do. The circumstances leading to the Auditor-General's letter commenced with my writing to him. He responded to me favourably and carried out a particular type of investigation into the ADC which is contrary to that which is described in the explanatory notes submitted to the Senate. He states that the ADC is incorrect. Of course it is incorrect. But I suggest that, in the next three weeks, the shadow Minister read the Act that the ADC operates under and the processes involved in the submitting of explanatory notes to the Senate. I also suggest that he look at a previous occasion in the Senate when an attempt was made to correct explanatory notes and at what occurred in the Senate as a result. People were dragged before the Privileges Committee of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said over and over again in this place what I think of the ADC. It is well known. But the honourable member for Braddon and the shadow Minister both let the cat out of the bag. The debate, the motion, the question, yesterday's stuff, the part of the vendetta earlier in the week is all part of knocking me over to knock over the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). They both referred to ATSIC, and that is what it is all about. It is all crocodile tears. </PARA>

He is addressing the substance of the issue under discussion. As a consequence there have been no references to why Standing Orders ought not to be suspended.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If people would be quiet, I would be able to repeat my opposition to the motion to suspend Standing Orders. We are totally opposed to it. There is no need for it. I was asked a question today, and people would have heard me say that I intended to respond to the shadow Minister's question regarding this issue. I will do that, either today or tomorrow. I will also be talking to the ADC in more detail tomorrow. I see a former Minister here, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson). He had some experience with the operation of the ADC when he was Minister. I do not want to quote his words literally, but he has referred to the sorts of powers and autonomy that exist within the ADC. He is nodding his head in approval. He knows exactly what I am saying. Perhaps he could advise the shadow Minister and the seconder of the motion calling for the suspension of Standing Orders on the particular sections that refer to the autonomy that lies within the ADC Act. It is interesting that people are calling for the suspension of Standing Orders, but there is no need for that to occur because they have a copy of the letter that the Auditor-General has written. The honourable member for Bass tabled that letter. That presents absolutely no problem for me at all. I am quite relaxed about that. If he wishes it, I will attempt to have discussions with the Auditor-General tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike Opposition members, I did not get the benefit of an early release of the letter. I had to wait until sometime after Question Time to get a copy of it. That is when the letter was sent to me. I have read it now and I have underlined a couple of bits of it, in the same way as the honourable member for Bass has, and we will address the matters raised in it. So there is absolutely no reason to suspend Standing Orders. Opposition members come in here with what they think is a scoop motion and a scoop letter, and a trick question at Question Time. I remind honourable members of the matters contained in that question and the desire of the questioner. He tells me that he had no knowledge of the letter from the Auditor-General, and one has to believe an honourable member when he says that in this House. It is coincidental, though, that the person who referred to the letter and the person who asked the question at Question Time were in a huddle for most of Question Time. They say there was no collusion about the contents of the letter, but the question referred to it. So the Opposition will fail in its attempt to suspend Standing Orders because there is absolutely no need to suspend them. I want to address very thoroughly tomorrow the matters contained in the letter from the Auditor-General. I assure the mover of the motion that that will be done, and I will contact him.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the appropriations for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy I wish to concentrate my remarks on the operations and status of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, known as OSS. Allow me to advise the House, for those honourable members who are not aware, that the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1980, as amended, imposes a levy on uranium oxide exports as produced by uranium mines in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory. Mr Deputy Chairman, you will be interested to know that that levy now stands at $1.30 per kilogram. It was, I point out, a mere 11c per kilogram when the coalition, in government, introduced the legislation. In 1986 the levy leapt to 80c per kilogram; in 1987, up to $1.02; in 1989, $1.15; and from July this year, $1.30 per kilogram. The purpose of this levy is to fund, in very great measure, the monitoring function, the operations and the research costs of the OSS which has, of course, been established to monitor, report on and regulate environmental issues in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory; in other words, to adjudge the impact of uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The justification for the extraordinary leap in the levy from 11c in 1980 to $1.30 in 1989, according to Government rhetoric, is to offset the costs of the Commonwealth funded OSS. However, the levy falls, by and large, upon the shoulders of one company alone-that being Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA), the operators of the Ranger uranium mine. It is therefore a discriminatory tax. As the Nabarlek mine, owned by Queensland Mines Ltd-which is also based in the Alligator Rivers region-has ceased production as of last year and is now only fulfilling its contracts and dispersing its store of uranium oxide, the present and future burden of the tax falls fairly and squarely upon the Ranger mine alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government makes the spurious claim that the funding of the OSS at its present exorbitant level is vital to the environmental protection of the Alligator Rivers region. The truth is that the taxation and charges regime under which the uranium industry attempts to operate in the international market is already a sufficient disincentive to international competitiveness by itself, without adding a further burden. </PARA>
<PARA> I visited the Alligator Rivers region two weeks ago and saw for myself the operations and workings of the Ranger uranium mine, as well as seeing first hand just how the OSS operates. The Ranger uranium mine has developed its own research laboratories which parallel those of the OSS. What Ranger does is to attempt to carry out that research upon which practical sets of standards might be based. This is the down-to-earth research which can give rise to guidelines which can be applied to the industry in the environmentally sensitive wetland environment of the Alligator Rivers region of Kakadu Park. Ranger's own environment department comprises 40 professional, technical and support personnel working within high quality laboratories. For this reason, it would be a far better idea-in the context of the coalition science policy-if the more esoteric research functions of the OSS were transferred to the Northern Territory Tertiary Institute and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). </PARA>
<PARA> The shoddy procedures and administration of the OSS have been revealed with the tabling of the Auditor-General's Audit Report, No. 10 of 1989-90. Let us look at how this Auditor-General's report strips away so much of the propaganda that has been established by the left wing, in particular, within Government ranks, to protect the sacred cow of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. In truth, the OSS's work duplicates, unnecessarily, so much of the work done by the Ranger uranium mine. Moreover, so much of the supervision and regulatory function ought properly belong to the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Only five minutes are left to me to proceed through the Auditor-General's indictment of the OSS. Let us consider the key findings of the Auditor-General's report. The first is that the OSS should formalise the development and approval processes for internal research projects, and issue guidelines for the use of staff. During the audit of research projects undertaken by the OSS the form of application, as well as the approval processes, which resulted in the commencement of a research project, were found to be inadequate. Insufficient formal documentation for research projects was undertaken by the OSS. Reporting to the Supervising Scientist himself of new research projects was not formally undertaken. Oral reports were given to the Supervising Scientist, the head of the organisation, when he happened to drop by the Jabiru office, on a visit from his own closeted Sydney offices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General found that new guidelines for documenting decisions regarding research projects would have to be adopted by the staff at the OSS. Hitherto, there has been no formal outline of a project prior to its approval; that is, there was no formal statement as to how long the project would take, how many staff would be required, what expenditure would be required, and what the objective of the whole exercise was. Most importantly, the Auditor-General called for the OSS to document the merits of particular projects when it made decisions as to which projects would be pursued and which would not. </PARA>
<PARA> The most elementary discipline imposed on any research project has been missing, to a very large extent, from the operations of the OSS. Moreover, none of this information has been formally presented to the Supervising Scientist himself. The OSS contended that to have adopted these procedures was too bureaucratic and time-consuming, and would not really engender any added accountability. So the OSS, in a very lame defence, tells us there is no need to go through the normal established accountability procedures of a government department, because it is all too much trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> The second key finding of the Auditor-General was that there was insufficient close scrutiny of the progress of research projects. The Auditor-General found that the OSS was not adequately making use of the many mechanisms available to it for monitoring the progress of research projects. So, not only are there slipshod procedures in commencing and justifying a new project, but also there is no close scrutiny of the progress of those same research projects. The Auditor-General found there were insufficient annual research summaries, inadequate staff review seminars and staff meetings, too few shorter term project reviews, and insufficient numbers of papers published in scientific publications. </PARA>
<PARA> The review mechanism provided by the coordinating committee for the Alligator Rivers Region was not used as effectively as it might be. Consultants engaged in research projects were not subject to progress reports in the manner that the Auditor-General had anticipated. Again, the Auditor-General called for new guidelines on these matters to be designed and rigorously adhered to by OSS staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The third key finding was that there must be more prompt publication of reports on the results of research. The Auditor-General suggested that this might add to the credibility of OSS research, a credibility that has been called properly into question by a number of independent authorities. While there are a number of reasons for delays in publishing research reports, such as lengthy time delays caused by external refereeing, the Auditor-General found that the main reason for the delay was `the poor quality of manuscripts submitted by scientists'. As a consequence of this finding, the OSS has suggested that OSS scientists be trained to write reports of their work. </PARA>
<PARA> In drawing to a conclusion, I stress that publication and the implicit system of peer review are critical to accountability. This applies to all research, whether it be in the sciences or in the humanities. However, it is an especially strong tradition in the sciences, a tradition the OSS has tried its best to evade, as it has so many of its other critically responsible activities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And, of course, acting on behalf of the Northern Territory Government, as the honourable member has pointed out. I should point out that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who is at the table, and Senator Richardson, the Minister responsible for the protection of the environment, are both undertaking a review of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. It seems that the honourable member for Gippsland has no understanding that this is going on. The honourable member for Gippsland should also be aware that I, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) and the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) have made a joint submission to the committee which is reviewing the Office of the Supervising Scientist, and we have put forward a number of propositions in relation to that office. I am sure that the honourable member for Gippsland will be interested to know that we have asked for increased responsibilities for the Office of the Supervising Scientist, quite contrary to the views which he has expressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to honourable members that, in the years that I have been involved in watching what is going on in the uranium mining industry in this country, I have relied very heavily on the evidence which has been provided by the Office of the Supervising Scientist in relation to the operations of the Ranger uranium mine. The Ranger uranium mine has not been conducting its operations in a proper way. It has not been protecting the environment in the way that it was expected to do, and that is the reason why the Office of the Supervising Scientist was set up. It was set up to investigate and to follow very carefully the operations of uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers Region. </PARA>
<PARA> In that respect I believe the Office of the Supervising Scientist has done a good job. In fact the Office has done its job so well that the Northern Territory Government has found it necessary to criticise it because it is worried that some of the findings that it has come up with would mean that the Ranger uranium mine might have to cease operations as it is a threat to the great environmental value of the Kakadu National Park and the tourist operations at the park. The tourist industry, of course, is one of the foremost industries in this country, and the Office of the Supervising Scientist is in that sense protecting that tourist industry. The honourable member for Gippsland makes very wild accusations and gross exaggerations of what the Auditor-General has had to say. Again, the honourable member for Hindmarsh reminds me that they are rather hysterical observations. This is not the first time that the honourable member for Gippsland has made those sorts of statements. He does not seem to understand that it is now--</PARA>

Our Committee has relied very heavily on the evidence which has been presented to us by the Office of the Supervising Scientist in relation to the operations of the Ranger uranium mine.

In our submission we have suggested that the Office of the Supervising Scientist have its operations extended to the operation of the Roxby Downs uranium mine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that my colleagues on this side of the chamber support those views. It is a fact that the uranium mining which is taking place in Roxby Downs has caused some problems related to the health of the workers. It seems to us that the Office of the Supervising Scientist could take a very positive role in overlooking the workers and the health records of workers in uranium mines. That is something which we have included in our submission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to go on, Mr Deputy Chairman, on this matter but it seemed to me that it was quite improper for the honourable member for Gippsland to construe the report of the Auditor-General and the points that he made in that report as a condemnation of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. That is not what the report was indicating. It was, in fact, suggesting some improvements in the operation of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. I agree that there could be improvements, but certainly it should not be swallowed up by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation or taken over by the Northern Territory Government, which in my view has no proper responsibility for the Ranger uranium mine or any uranium mining operations in the Northern Territory. </PARA>

Ranger uranium, of course, is looked at by the left wing arm of the Government-and I say that with respect-with a very finely focused microscope.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do. The Office of the Supervising Scientist is very much overrated in respect of Ranger uranium and a lot of the activities that take place in the Northern Territory in the Alligator Rivers area. The Commonwealth-funded Office of the Supervising Scientist, which takes millions and millions of dollars a year, is an organisation that has financed many doctor of philosophy students over the years, people looking into the most intricate research areas. I think the Auditor-General's criticisms are genuine and probably a little milder than they ought to be. The Office of the Supervising Scientist is an area that needs to be looked at very closely. A lot of taxpayers' money is involved, and from the observations I have made, and I have been very interested in some of their research areas, particularly with regard to Ranger, they need looking at very carefully. That is an area where the Treasurer (Mr Keating) could save millions of dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we conducted an inquiry into the releasing of water from a pond at Ranger into the Magela Creek, enormous amounts of research and emotional language were put forward because the water was coming from Ranger. But in fact the water that Ranger wanted to release was eight times purer than the drinking water in Adelaide. The finding of the Committee was that that water ought not to be released into the Magela Creek, even at a time of high peak flood. It is quite extraordinary. With respect to the Chairman of the Committee, I felt that it was right and proper not to be too conclusive about the report. So it is an open report in many ways; it is not a conclusive report by any means. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General is on the right track and the criticisms that have been made of the Office of the Supervising Scientist are absolutely spot on. I know that the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts is a very honest man; I have no evidence at all to think otherwise. But, if he is really honest-and he is-he has to agree that there is a big question mark over a lot of the things that the Office of the Supervising Scientist does in the Alligator Rivers area. It is very important that I say that. With great respect to the Chairman of the Standing Committee, if he were to take a microscope-he would not need a microscope; just an ordinary magnifying glass-up there and look at all the projects that have been undertaken by that particular office, he would come away asking himself whether we can really justify so much of our taxpayers' money being directed in that particular area. I am very pleased that I have been able on this occasion to express these thoughts with regard to that particular organisation. I support the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) in his comments. It is very important that we look at the work of the Office of the Supervising Scientist much more closely than we have in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure how he can make that sort of outrageous statement. It must be very disappointing to him because, when it comes to discussing primary industry, regrettably the Australian Labor Party is very thin on the ground. That has been proven yet again tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will concentrate my remarks on a couple of areas; in particular, the impact of primary industry on our export earnings and how in fact our export earnings, despite the good efforts of primary industry, are still not managing to keep up with the incredible growth in our imports and, as a consequence, the effect that is having on our balance of payments. I will talk about two or three specific primary industry issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The first issue is the live sheep trade. It was very disappointing today to listen to the Minister say that he had not planned to talk to the Saudi Arabians, despite the fact that a number of shiploads of live sheep have been rejected-in fact over 400,000 sheep. That is deeply disturbing. It will have a very far-reaching impact on primary industries and on the sheep industry-not just on the price of wethers that are shipped. The repercussions will reverberate right throughout the whole of the sheep industry, particularly in the sheep sales that will be coming in the next few months. Regrettably, that impact will be adverse. That is why it is disappointing to see that the Minister has not seen fit to take the opportunity to try to follow through to find out why those sheep are being rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also disappointing to note that the Government seems to have been caught very much with its pants down on this whole issue. Last year the Saudis gave a very clear warning that they were not happy with certain aspects of the live sheep trade. The Government chose to ignore those warnings. One wonders whether the Minister ought really to have been held to account on this very point. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make on the live sheep trade is that I believe that the Government has dithered around. When the problem first arose, when the first shipload was rejected, the Government seemed to be completely unaware of what was happening and dithered around for some weeks before anything was done. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I make about the live sheep trade is that, despite the Minister's answer to the question last week, I do not believe that the Government has seriously tried to answer the accusations that have been made by some very irrational people who have claimed that they have some knowledge of the live sheep trade but whose credentials will not stand up to the test of scrutiny, who have clearly been peddling a very different agenda, who have been trying very hard to undermine the live sheep trade anyway, and who have seen the problem that has arisen with the Saudi Arabians as a golden opportunity to cash in on this, to try to further their own cause. Their cause clearly is not in the interests of Australia and certainly is not in the interests of the live sheep trade or the farmers that are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> For those three reasons I feel that the Minister really ought to think again about the way he answered that question today and said that he would not make any effort to visit Saudi Arabia, because I think that a very serious problem has arisen there and its repercussions will reverberate throughout the industry for some months ahead, even if the trade resumes. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that I would like to talk a little about the export impact of primary produce, and in particular how I feel that the Government has failed to realise the importance of primary industry and how precarious our position is with our balance of payments and what is happening with our overseas debt. That debt is rising. It seems that the Government has so far shown very little concern about it. It is interesting to note that when we look in the Budget papers, in the small print, we find that in the coming year the forecast for our balance of payments deficit is for another record. It certainly was not in the speech of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on Budget night, but in the fine print we find it is forecast to be $18 1/2 billion. Last year it was forecast to be about $9 billion. That blew out to about $17 billion. Already at least one senior economist for one of the big banks has suggested that on his figuring it will be nearer $22 billion than $18 1/2 billion. Yet the Government seems totally unable to come to grips with the enormous problem that it will create for Australians. The fact is that the Government has failed to come to grips with what is needed to allow exporters, particularly the primary producers, the opportunity to improve their performance and do something positive to help that adverse balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw honourable members' attention to a very important report that was given by the Committee for the Review of Export Market Development Assistance, commissioned by the Government, chaired by one of the country's best practical economists, the Australian National University's Professor Hughes, which highlighted, in a very well thought through argument, some of the problems that are facing our exporters, problems which have been highlighted by the Opposition on many occasions but which the Government seems to have failed to address. Of course, these can all be summarised by that wonderful term `micro-economic reform'-something that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made a lot of noise about at the last election, made big statements about following the election but, so far, has done little more than commission a number of reports on. Those reports have again repeated what has been said on so many occasions: that micro-economic reform is not only urgently needed; it is a matter of it being the only way we are going to improve our export performance, and, in particular, to allow those exporters of primary produce the opportunity to trade to improve our balance of payments. As I said, the Treasurer has forecast a trade deficit figure of $18 1/2 billion-a record which he does not want to claim but a record that we have never seen before. It is already being questioned by responsible economists who suggest that it will be nearer the $22 billion mark. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to micro-economic reform, we had a great opportunity in this area just recently with the export of wheat from Fisherman's Island in Brisbane. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who is at the table, apparently because it did not suit the Labor Party and his friends in the union movement, refused to allow the Australian Wheat Board to take a major step towards reforming the waterfront. That is an area of micro-economic reform which is desperately needed. The Government has had the Inter-State Commission report on the subject, which has shown very clearly that at least $600m can be saved by reforming the waterfront. What did the Minister do? He heavied the Wheat Board and told it that it was not allowed to take a very sensible step in opening up an opportunity to reduce this cost burden on the primary producers of Australia. I think it stands to the eternal shame of this Minister that he saw fit to refuse to take an opportunity that would have been to the benefit not only of primary producers but of the nation as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) for intervening. The last speaker made a few statements that have to be challenged. In regard to the live sheep trade, many members of the trade union movement in particular were opposed to the live sheep trade from day one. If predictions are correct, there will soon be a member of this chamber named Ian McLachlan, who caused disruption in South Australia on the question of the live sheep trade. We will hear much more about it. I would be more than happy to debate him and others on the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point that concerns me more is the allegation from the other side that those on this side of the chamber do not care about primary industry. This might seem strange to some, coming from someone who represents an industrial metropolitan seat, but I will stand my record on primary industry questions against that of any National Party member. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member had listened to what I said instead of mouthing off, he would have heard me say that I will place my record against that of anyone individually, and probably collectively, on the question of primary industry. The Minister knows, to his pain, that this is so, because I have taken him to task on many issues and I am quite sure he wishes I would not say these things. I resent it when people paint others into a corner or try to say that they are not interested in certain matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have raised many questions with the Minister regarding organochlorins-dieldrin, aldrin and cadmium. The questions I have pursued through the Minister's office show that those on this side of the chamber are concerned about these matters. We do not just bow the knee to the chemical industry; we challenge what is going on because we are concerned about this country. Primary industry is very important to this country. Far too often we have subjected ourselves to the whims of the chemical industry. One of the issues that have been raised by me is the dung beetle. It is a pity that the chamber is not full because honourable members would all have a giggle about it. They probably do not understand the implications of that particular issue-an issue that I have raised. </PARA>

Likewise, in relation to the importing and testing of materials and foodstuffs that we can produce here better than we can import, I have raised the issue, as the Minister would know, of listeria, a serious problem which is emerging in Europe and which is now slowly being recognised as a problem in Australia. We should not say that people belong in any particular boxes. I do not belong in any particular box. If an issue concerns this country I am concerned about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the first instance I will address my comments to the debate I have heard in the chamber tonight and then comment in more detail on the points made by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who is also the shadow Minister for primary industry. First, I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) for constantly raising, on behalf of consumers, farmers and people involved in agriculture generally, the question of chemicals and the environment, the question of animal health and the possibility of disease in foods. This is the reason why the Government has moved to an imported food inspection regime which will not fall heavily on food importers but which will certainly address some of those problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable member points out, listeria can kill people. We have to look at our own plants in Australia that manufacture cheese, particularly the soft cheeses, where this organism can be found. We now monitor at least 60 brands of cheese coming into this country. There was a case recently where dessicated coconut put 65 people in hospital. These things are very serious indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to comment on the discussion on the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS) that went on here tonight. I recently spent a full morning with the Supervising Scientist and his people going through the whole question of their approach to their task and the legislation they have to work within. There are real problems with that legislation. This is the reason why, quite some time ago, Senator Richardson and I decided that we should have a proper review, a review of functions, a review of legislation, and a review of the resources available to the Supervising Scientist. I was not aware, until I came in here tonight, that the Auditor-General had made comments on the Office of the Supervising Scientist. Senator Richardson and I will certainly consider those comments with a great deal of rigour but we have a review in place and that is the proper mechanism to address them. I will make one simple statement about the claims by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). He wants to give all this to the Northern Territory Government; if one gave it to Bronco Coulter, one might as well wind up the OSS. </PARA>
<PARA> What the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) had to say about the purity of water at Magela Creek probably makes some sense. It is not really a very easy matter and, quite apart from the emotionalism surrounding a world heritage area and a national park, Aboriginal people live on the products of that river and they want to know that they are not drinking poison. Regardless of how scientists or other people may feel about this, people are people, and people want assurances. The Office of the Supervising Scientist is there to give those assurances. I conveyed those assurances recently to the Aboriginal people in that region. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) usually makes very constructive remarks in these debates, as he represents a very rural electorate. He said that I have nothing planned. That is a nonsense. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, my Department, the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the industry are as one. We are in constant contact, on a daily basis. My officials have been working throughout each weekend since this matter came to us. After the delegation returned and reported to me on Monday or Tuesday of this week, we took the decision that I would write again to the Minister for Agriculture and Water in Saudi Arabia, Mr Al Shaikh. I said today in Question Time-and I must correct this-that we thought the Minister would be returning on 10 October. I should first of all have said 10 September. But I am now informed that it may not be the coming Monday. We really have no exact time for when the Minister will be returning to Saudi Arabia. It is very difficult to have contact at the ministerial level when the person is out of the country, but of course we can continue that dialogue. What I am putting forward is a very constructive solution that will be there for him when he comes back. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also referred to the fact that we got warnings from the Saudi Arabians, and I think he was referring to the fact the Saudis want younger sheep. The reality is that the Saudis and the Middle East countries-the Gulf countries-buy the sheep themselves. When the sheep go on board their own ships, they own them. They use Australian agents, of course, so they can buy sheep of any age. We do not let sheep go out under two years old, for animal welfare reasons, but I must point out those sheep, at that age, are probably stronger than some of the older sheep. However, there is that requirement. Recently there was a request from Saudi Arabia to provide a specialty lot of sheep-some 200,000-and the trade is in the process of accommodating that, except that we have this temporary ban on until we can get to the bottom of how we are going to handle sheep when they come off the boats in Saudi Arabia. Unless we can get our own people on ships, unless we can get agreed quarantine protocol, unless we can get an understanding of the procedures to be followed on checking and verifying the health of the sheep and have them agreed internationally, we really have nowhere to go. That is why the trade, and the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation, will keep the ban on. </PARA>
<PARA> All I can say in summation on this whole issue is that the honourable member for Wannon needs to understand the politics and the culture of different peoples, and the realities of the mix of Middle East political power and religions and the commercial dispositions of the actors in this dispute, this matter, and the commercial strategies being engaged in by other people. It is not as if I am free to put forward what I think the basis of the problem is, but I am simply continuing to address that disease question. So far we have absolutely no proof of the three diseases that our sheep are alleged to have. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wannon also made the charge that with respect to micro-economic reform I heavied the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board. The Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board has said publicly on many occasions that that did not occur, and I again say here tonight it did not occur. When I heard about this matter and I heard about the forces mobilising to try to crash through on the waterfront, I rang the Chairman of the Wheat Board to discuss what was happening. He came back to me and I simply advised him, `Well, do you understand what the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority is? I think you might get a rapid resolution if you go and see this authority'. The farm sector people, the agri-politicians, were all saying that one of their real problems is that they do not have representation on the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. I simply point out that that WIRA is one man, and it is difficult to have representation on one man. They may want to sit in a pocket or hang on his back, but the whole idea is that after years of study we decided at Cabinet level to go along with the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission. As a Cabinet Minister who agreed to that, I had an obligation to tell the Chairman of the Wheat Board what the Government had decided. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of realities, I think the amount of money involved was $6,800. We want to get to enterprise employment, we want to get into a situation whereby we do not have these problems on the waterfront any more. Some people may want to crash through to save $6,800 while putting at risk savings that may amount to $650m, but I take the view that I have a very clear obligation, on behalf of the Government, to point out what we are doing and how we think this will work. We are making more progress in micro-economic reform. We have made more progress in micro-economic reform than any other government. There is more on the agenda. The work we did last year in terms of assistance right across the board amounted to an enormous amount of micro-economic reform. I must point out, and the honourable member for Wannon was tying this to the balance of payments, that micro-economic reform, like economic restructuring, does not do much for the balance of payments in the very short term. No-one is saying that one should not proceed with it, but that is one of the fundamental economic realities. </PARA>
<PARA> If I could turn to the comments of the Deputy Leader of the National Party and to the National Party approach in general to these policies, I point out that the policy of the National Party is to preach the whole time here that we have to cut government spending but then to wander around the country promising all sorts of things and spending up big. The most recent example of this that was brought to my attention was when the Leader of the National Party was in the Torres Strait. According to the Torres Times:</PARA>
<PARA>He would like a fleet of 50 customs boats to patrol northern Australia including this Strait. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said on another occasion that he wanted the defence forces to be involved in co-ordinating all of this. I am not going into that issue, but after many years we took a decision with respect to northern surveillance. At present Customs co-ordinates all the activities of the various government agencies, including the Department of Defence, in northern surveillance. We always have this nonsense of `cut, cut, cut, but not us. Don't do as I do, do as I say'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the National Party started off with a discussion of the impact of tourism, and I agree with the points he made. I also point out the correction in terms of the claim being made by my colleague the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) that it is not a blow-out. The impact of tourism in this country means that instead of having an adverse balance of payments figure in respect of tourism we are now coming close to balance. If it were not for the airline pilots and their decision to resign and wreck our tourist industry, I believe we would be in a positive situation in respect of tourism in the very short term. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable gentleman also made some points about wool promotion. All I can say here is that during this Government's term a total of $155m has been provided by the Government to the International Wool Secretariat for wool promotion. This is more than any previous government contribution. We are contributing $25m per annum to wool promotion. We have made a three-year undertaking to maintain our contribution at $25m per annum; we made that in 1988. This year is the second year of the $25m contribution, and the commitment has been made in the Budget to contribute $25m in 1991. No decision has been made yet for 1991-92. With the way the Budget is framed in terms of the papers there is simply no indication, but we will take this decision at the appropriate time. The Australian Government is the third largest financial contributor to the International Wool Secretariat, after Australian wool growers and New Zealand wool growers, and I was delighted to see that the President of the Wool Council of Australia said that the 1989 Budget decision to meet this pledge ensures that the International Wool Secretariat can maintain its marketing and financial planning with confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point the Deputy Leader of the National Party made was with respect to the waterfront, and I think I have canvassed that. For him to say, as he did in today's Queensland Country Life, that the Government's only contribution to the waterfront reform was the formation of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority is a nonsense. We have contributed $145m. Had he or other Opposition members looked at the 17-point plan that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) introduced when he brought this whole package before the Parliament they would understand what we are trying to do and, I believe, what we will achieve. People can rubbish what we see as the possibility of an in-principle agreement, but again we are following the Inter-State Commission and it said it would take three years to put this in place. What we are proposing is the removal of 3,000 people from the waterfront and the hiring back of an additional 1,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The farm industries lecture me that one cannot proceed too quickly in matters of change. For example, the sugar industry says that we cannot change something that happened in 1923; it is a bit too quick. We are told we cannot change wheat arrangements once every five years. I am not denying for one moment that the situation on the waterfront is rather atrocious. It has been a problem for 60 to 80 years. No government has ever attacked this seriously, comprehensively, with financial resources, taking into account the fact that one is dealing with people. The reality on the waterfront, the nub of the problem, is the container wharves in Sydney and Melbourne. Eighty per cent of our goods go through those wharves, and that is the main game. There is nowhere near the problem in the dry bulk trades that we have with the container terminals. That is where we must make changes. I believe, as I say, that we are on the right track. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point made by the honourable gentleman was with respect to imported pork from Canada and the whole question of acceptable risk. The honourable gentleman said that this puts the Australian agricultural sector at risk. Experiments were carried out at the maximum security Australian National Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong. We have had an exchange of letters between us and the Canadians. The risk of transmissible gastroenteritis spread is very, very low. It can only be spread by feeding infected, imported meat to the Australian pig herd. The risk is estimated at one in three million. Removal of the pig meat ban would have very little economic impact on the Australian pig industry. The forecast import volumes range from less than one per cent to about 4 per cent of Australian production. </PARA>
<PARA> There was the charge that we are either not using quarantine as a trade lever or, alternatively, that we are loosening the standards on quarantine. That should be weighed against the fact that we set up the Torrens Island facility and Spotswood, and that we are addressing the whole question of avian imports in a far more coordinated and sensible way than ever before. It ignores all that we have done since quarantine was added to this portfolio. I think we have better quarantine protocols. We are doing far more work, particularly at the official level. I congratulate those people on the hard work that they are doing in trying to get an accurate and scientific base so that we can say, `This is the scientific line', and expose those countries which are using quarantine for trade purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of apples and nashi fruit was raised. There have been no imports of apples and nashi fruit from Japan or New Zealand. Again, the method of contamination is what one has to look at. This would arise only if infected fruit were brought into contact with orchard trees. The nashi fruit that were accidentally passed by officials on both sides of the Tasman were inspected thoroughly and found not to be contaminated, despite the contention by the honourable member for Murray that they were. The fact is that the industry is more at risk from illegal imports of cuttings which are brought in by Australians. Several growers were recently prosecuted for doing exactly this. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point, raised by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), concerned the question of orange juice and milk. Contrary to his assertion that `the Government moved to change the taxation rate on flavoured milk', the Government-that is, the fiscal fiends, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh)-has merely reduced the minimum milk content requirement from 95 per cent to 90 per cent that flavoured milk drinks must meet in order to be taxed at the concessional sales tax rate of 10 per cent. This review followed industry claims that in meeting the 95 per cent requirement producers of flavoured milk drinks have had to bear additional production costs. So the Government has not departed from its previous stance on the application of sales tax to milk and fruit juice products, maintaining a 10 per cent concessional rate on certain categories of these types of non-alcoholic beverages. Whether fruit juice products and flavoured milk products are foods like milk and should therefore be tax exempt or are beverages like carbonated soft drinks and mineral waters and should therefore be subject to tax, is an ongoing debate. I believe that milk and fruit juice should be classified as food, so I am taking part in that debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank all honourable members who contributed to this debate. The farm industries always provoke a lot of discussion. They are terribly important to Australia. Only the honourable member for Oxley raised matters relating to the other part of the portfolio. I make the point that the volume of our minerals and energy exports is even higher than the volume of our agricultural exports. It is a pity that more honourable members did not raise issues associated with those industries, because just as many issues are associated with those industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a comprehensive review of energy and excise in hand. We have recently taken decisions on uranium. We are involved full time in matters associated with the coal industry. We are concerned that the airlines strike is adversely affecting those mines that have a fly in, fly out arrangement for their workers. We are considering many issues associated with the mining industries. As I said, it is a pity that some of these matters were not raised in the debate. But I thank all honourable members who contributed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The estimates of the Department of Social Security this year show an actual per dollar increase. According to the portfolio program estimates for 1988-89 we are talking about total outlays of $21.145m, which is $21 billion, and total staff years of 16,550. It is, therefore, a very significant department in terms of the total area of public expenditure. I think it is fair to say that its responsibilities effectively touch the vast majority of the Australian people. Depending on the circumstances at the time, at least a million people a year go through the system as beneficiaries for various periods. Therefore, the level of efficiency which is required in the control of this substantial area of public expenditure-over 30 per cent of total Budget appropriations-places a very high responsibility on the Department and the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1989-1990 Budget announced several changes in the area of social security, apart from the long overdue age pension retirement income measures. Measures included changes to improve access to benefits for youth who are in need; increases in indexation for rent assistance-indexation measures include the annual indexation of the income test free areas of pensions-some assistance for older unemployed, which I think is consistent with the recommendations of the Cass report; some assistance for those in bereavement, which is a useful move, but again not as beneficial as those proposed by the Opposition in our retirement income policy announced last November; modifications to family allowance supplement arrangements and a significant tightening of welfare arrangements to reduce the loss of funds through fraud and overpayments. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer firstly to the question of homeless youth. The Government's initiatives for homeless youth have been seen by some welfare organisations as somewhat insufficient and perhaps belated. On the other hand, they are welcomed by the Opposition. We especially are pleased to see the realisation-identified initially in the Burdekin report and accepted by the Government-that one cannot approach the problem of homeless youth on an ad hoc basis. It requires the close integration of program delivery from a range of different departments, and that is not easy to achieve. We have different philosophies of delivery between departments. We have different attitudes-certainly different concepts on priorities and so forth-and co-ordinating the range of delivery, whether it be in regard to education, health, welfare, social security, housing and so forth, is difficult, but nevertheless terribly important if we are to make significant progress in the fundamental area of homeless youth. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures were, of course, prompted and recommended by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's report into homeless children, released in February this year. It said that there were conservatively estimated to be at least 25,000 and possibly as many as 70,000 children who have no home and are living in abject poverty. One of the problems emphasised in that report, and in a sense I think the Government may have skimmed over the issue on this, was the difficulty in establishing, and at the same time the need to establish, an adequate level of rapport between the Commonwealth and the States in terms of program management. One of the key elements of this was again demonstrated in the Burdekin report; that is, the problem of the apparent arbitrary cut-off line at age 16. Above that age the Commonwealth accepts some financial responsibility for paying benefits, sustenance, youth homeless allowances and so forth. Below that age, it is generally perceived that the children are the responsibility of the State. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty we are facing in this area is that, depending on which State we visit, we tend to find a quite different philosophy being applied through State department administrations as to how to handle the problems of homeless children. This creates a major difficulty in how we can coordinate the policies at that level. Nevertheless, I think more needs to be done in that area to try to identify the fact that government programs should be related if the concept of need is valid, and I am sure that it is. It should not be related just to the concept of age. There can be homeless children who have been on the street and have had to fend for themselves since their late childhood years. I am referring to children aged around nine, 10, 11 and 12 years. By the time those children are 13 or 14, they have reached a considerable degree of independence and to draw a line at 16 tends to ignore that simple salient fact. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am not suggesting that I have all the answers, because obviously nobody has the answers at this stage to how we can interface our State and Federal programs to overcome that problem, nevertheless it is a very important one. I say so for these reasons: younger children can be placed in various State oriented programs through surrogate parenthood and so forth. A serious attempt can be made to help solve those problems, to make up in some way for the inadequacies of their own backgrounds. But there are other children who, when they get into the early teenage stage, have reached, as I said, a degree of independence which makes it not possible for them to be effectively integrated into normal family environments. Those children, under current arrangements in most States, tend to become wards of the State. They are forced into a system of control, regrettably out of which many of them ultimately find themselves back in the courts, in the legal system and in gaol. Quite obviously, therefore, we believe that putting children in systems of that nature should be the last option. </PARA>
<PARA> For some there may be simply no other option but we should see it as the last option and try our best to integrate systems of delivery in relation to accommodation, using the Austrian model for example where a group of children or young adults, as these people are in many respects, share accommodation but have a degree of independence while they are able to go to school and live in a reasonably stable environment. Stability for these children is the one thing the Burdekin reports emphasise has not been present. It is one of the reasons why we are producing children at the end of this who cannot read or write, they have no social capacities, they are misfits in society and, unfortunately, they are doomed, in most cases, to fail. Often it is not their fault at all, it is just because of the circumstances into which they have been forced for far too long. Accommodation clearly is one of the main elements of the whole equation. We are pleased that the Government has put some significant funds into this area. It actually works out at about $200 per head of total Commonwealth support. One would have to question whether, in the longer term, that is adequate. Clearly, I do not think even the Minister would suggest that it is. We need to be seeing where we can identify more programs which can be targeted specifically at the problems that I have been referring to. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically while the Government has, in this Budget, identified the problems and made some tentative measures in the right direction there is still a long way to go before we can attain the 1987 election promise of the Prime Minister that no Australian child will live in poverty by 1990. The Government now has four months to go and I think nobody would support the view-certainly not the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS), certainly not the Brotherhood of St Laurence, certainly not the Institute of Family Studies-that we will be able to achieve that in absolute terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the mistakes was that the Government talked in terms of benchmarks and dollar signs and equated that with poverty. Those who are involved with trying to live with and solve the problems of poverty amongst children will be the first to tell you that the dollar is not the only answer to the problem. It is a major element but it is not the total answer to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Much depends upon State cooperation. A question, therefore, is to what extent that will be available in the coming months. The Government has not been very explicit in its reference to the contribution made by States in terms of funding arrangements. In South Australia, for example, there are grave concerns that, because of funding measures under the proposed Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, any gains from the measures announced in the Budget could be lost. The concern that many measures are dependent on some form of matching arrangements with States must be recognised and clarified, since there has been a reduction in real terms of about 3 per cent in Commonwealth assistance to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note the promises made by the Australian Labor Party in its 1982 policy platform, and repeated verbatim in its 1984 policy platform under the heading `Homeless People'. It said then that Labor recognised that domestic violence, family crisis and breakdown and transient living and housing problems would create an increasing need for accommodation for the homeless and went on to say what it would do. One has to question whether, seven years on, it has achieved the objectives it set for itself back in 1982, which was, after all, the year when it put forward the program which was to underpin the Government for the last seven years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 is yet further evidence of another progressive Budget in the area of social security. Often when we prepare for our contribution in such debates we try to second guess what the speaker before us might speak about. Despite his hyperbole towards the end of his contribution, I was pleasantly surprised that the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) should choose to emphasise in his comments the measures in this Budget to deal with youth. Yesterday in this Committee debate on estimates for the Department of Employment, Education and Training, I made mention of the social justice statement for youth that forms part of the Budget. I acknowledge the work that was done by the Minister at the table, the Minister for Social Security and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Social Justice (Mr Howe), and also the work of our colleagues the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan) and the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thought it of particular note that the honourable member for Bradfield acknowledged the need for an integrated and coordinated response in the area of youth policy. This statement on youth was a great contribution between departments to put together the measures that are required. It has been announced that there will be an additional $100m spent over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures range across a whole host of portfolios. Whilst I realise that we are speaking about social security, I should briefly mention some of the things that we hope to achieve in the next four years. They include the availability of secure accommodation for an initial 6,000 homeless young people; a fund for an innovative adolescent mediation service; further work in labour market measures to encourage and assist unemployed and other disadvantaged young people and to help them make the transition back into employment, education and training; and new initiatives to encourage at risk students to stay at school. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said yesterday, it is no good just dwelling on an overall increase in retention rates if we do not look in some detail at where the students come from that are continuing their education. In all sectors of the community there should be equal opportunity for people to continue in education. Also established are innovative health services that address the special needs of youth. But of particular note to this part of the discussion, of course, is the major improvements in income support. If one looks at the young homeless allowance (YHA), one sees an increase of $7.50 a week from January 1990 and an automatic annual indexation. There is an abolition of the six-week waiting period for YHA for young people considered at special risk because of physical or sexual abuse and a reduction to two weeks for others. A new independent rate of job search allowance is provided at the higher YHA level. There is a $15 a week living away from home allowance for unemployed 16- and 17-year-olds who are leaving home to attend short courses. The annual indexation of the minimum rate of job search allowance from January 1990 is $25 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> So we see that there have been advances. The honourable member for Bradfield mentioned the Burdekin report. What did the Burdekin report, in summary, have to say about income support? The report, recommendations 14.1 to 14.6, in summary, recommends a significant expansion of age ranges and levels of income support for homeless young people and an easing of access. We see that this Budget has put into place the Government's decision, as I said, to reduce the general waiting list and to abolish the waiting list in exceptional circumstances. But also we did not go into that further thing that was mentioned by the honourable member for Bradfield about support for those children under 16 years. I listened intently to what the honourable member had to say because a couple of months ago I represented the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) at a post-Burdekin seminar held in Fitzroy at which I presented, in general terms, what we knew to be the possible response of the Government to Burdekin. There was one stage at that meeting when I had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The broad extension of income support provisions to under 16 year olds is also questionable. The appropriate form of assistance for most of these young people is not income support but care and protection, which is essentially a responsibility of State governments. </PARA>
<PARA>Now that is an aspect that the honourable member for Bradfield has highlighted and has made some critical comment about. It was also the aspect in the speech that I made on that day that created the most hostile reaction. When I use the word `hostile', in the course of events it perhaps is an understatement. But it was predictable because at this seminar we were mainly dealing with people working with youth. Very little of youth were represented. It was mainly youth workers. It is understandable that they make representation on behalf of those people with whom they are working and sometimes they have differing views. But again we have to query what the shadow Minister brings before us on behalf of the Opposition. Whilst he makes this plea that money is not everything, in situations like this when we have contributions like we have had tonight which involve additional resources and putting forward additional resources, we have to ask shadow Ministers from the coalition where the money comes from. Given the statements that are made by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), the shadow Minister for finance, Senator Stone, and other people who appear to have great influence amongst the coalition parties on the outside-a number of whom are from New Right think tanks who expect to come into this place-we have to ask where this money would come from, especially when a number of these people have talked about welfare in the terms that the expenditure that we have at the moment is unneeded, that it is overdone. </PARA>
<PARA> That has to be the question that the Australian public must ask. They must look for an answer, because it is not good enough for honourable members to come in here and, with either real or feigned compassion, speak of what is required but not tell us how it is going to occur, especially when we have other honourable members from the coalition who have the mentality of cutting back expenditure quite severely. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer back to the point about the seminar that was held on Burdekin and the fact that it was, in the main, youth workers and other people that worked with youth workers and other people that worked with youth that were in attendance. I relate it to comments that were made after a previous contribution of mine in this place today when I talked about people of privilege and said that the Opposition often supported those people. Perhaps rather naively, some Opposition members took that point in a different light from what I meant. They looked upon me as talking about privilege in the form of resources available to people, their income, and things like that. What I was actually trying to illustrate was the view that often the Opposition comes in in support of people of privilege-privilege in terms of having access to the system, of being able to have the ear of decision-makers. When we talk about youth and, in particular, homeless youth, it is unfortunate that unless we address their feeling of alienation, of isolation, they have no such power; they are denied the access; they are the non-privileged. When we address problems such as those highlighted by the Burdekin report, we need to see that those people that do not have the degree of access, that those who are not in what I call a privileged position, are listened to and thought of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Social security accounts for a very large proportion of the total Budget and, irrespective of what the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) said, the important thing about it is that all that the Opposition is asking for so far as social security is concerned is fairness. As political parties today, we all must make sure that we have a pretty true assessment of what the future requirements will be for social security within Australia. The figures are fairly reliable. By the year 2010, 40 to 45 per cent of the population will be over 45 years of age. That will be between 7.5 and 7.8 million people.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VF4">Mr COWAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Macquarie says, it could be higher than that, too. But the fact remains that we have to prepare for that because people are living to a greater age today. In the 1970s, people usually finished their working life at 65 and normally they passed away, on the average, before they reached 75. But now, with many people retiring at 55, and even before that, we can anticipate that many people will live beyond 80 years. This creates a problem so far as the care of the aged is concerned, in many instances, with nursing homes and hostels, but I would say particularly so in regard to the taxpayer. Unless there is adequate planning now, we can expect in the future that the taxpayer will certainly be facing a greater financial responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was pleased to see that there is a move within the Budget for superannuation, and this is vitally required. I would like to see a different kind of superannuation scheme worked up. But the fact of the matter is that now is the time to plan for superannuation. Approximately 67 per cent of our public servants are in superannuation schemes, but in private enterprise, including the self-employed, there is only about 35 to 36 per cent. So there is great scope here to plan for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the Government's actions over five or six years, we will see that it has increased tax on the superannuant by over 1,000 per cent, which is a terrific amount of money. Undoubtedly, it only raises the superannuation issue now because of the accord. It is an extra way in which it can give a little bit, under the accord, to the Australian Council of Trade Unions. These are the facts. I am sure they are quite accessible, as far as the people of Australia are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should be very careful as to the age at which we induce people to retire. I think 50 to 55 years of age is far too young at which to retire, because some people want to work beyond that age. If one is healthy, if one wants to work, and if one can make a contribution-I am pleased to see the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) nod his head-one should be able to work to the age of 65 and even older. It keeps people interested, and it keeps them alive. Our policy, which the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who is the shadow Minister, has placed before us, allows for this type of thing. There is greater flexibility so far as aged people are concerned. I hope the Government learns from this. I know that there has been restructuring in industry. I know that a lot of people have been asked to stand down and that they are compensated for this, but there is a danger in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) is in the chamber, because I want to say something about the assets test. It is terribly important. The policy that the Liberal-National parties will have will exclude farmers in certain circumstances-particularly aged parents who live on a farm that is worked by members of the family and who continue to work it. There may be situations where it is not possible to sell the interest in the farm. We will provide for such cases, because if ever there was an injustice done it was done through the assets test to genuine people who have paid tax for a lifetime and who have been excluded from receiving a pension. I think that that is very sad. </PARA>
<PARA> Time does not permit me to say more about the matter, but I ask the Minister: Why did he make provision for an age pensioner to borrow up to $40,000, when the interest rate is around 17, 18 or 20 per cent? Who does he expect to take advantage of this? I have had many calls to my electorate office asking, `What will we do? Should we avail ourselves of it? We would like to do this and that, but we assume that we do not have to pay it back'. My staff and I have had to say, `Yes, you have to pay it back. It will be a normal loan for which you make arrangements with your lending institution, and certainly you must pay back the debt'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget measures that the Government has announced are quite all right, but as far as social security is concerned nobody will benefit much before April next year. The provisions stretch right through to 1995. I am sure the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) does not understand what this really means. He knows about roads, but social security is another matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to raise a few other matters. Families today seem to accept that they should live off the government. Too many families today are doing this. We do not want to take away the incentive for people to get out and work and use their own personal endeavours. All political parties make a very sad mistake if we continue along these lines. People who deserve it-the disadvantaged, the aged, the invalid pensioners, the widows-must be supported. Let us be very careful on this matter. I wonder whether the Minister is going to do anything about those who were drawing an allowance, who were virtually double-dipping, and who have been caught out by the tax file number. There must be a lot of these because I understand even in my own electorate that there are ones that have suddenly disappeared off the list. Is the Government going to take any action? It might be able to say what it is going to do with these. Is it going to follow them up? Is there sufficient field staff to go out and check on a lot of this double dipping? Let me go further and say this: when I turn my television on for the night-time news, and I look up and see something going on up in the mountains, I see that the same people are there. The same people appear on television night after night and week after week, and I believe those people are on the unemployment benefit. Those people are up there trying to stop genuine forestry workers working. This is annoying my electors, and it annoys me. </PARA>

My constituents are getting sick and tired of seeing these things going on at the present time, so I hope he checks on them. I also have a few comments concerning appeals. The officers of the Minister's Department do a pretty good job, from my experience. If a recipient appeals, after all the work that the officers do, can the Minister please see that there is a senior person at the appeal to represent the Department? Most of those people appealing have a solicitor or somebody to advise them. After all the work the Department does, please see it to the end of the line to make sure that the case is properly submitted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I could go on and on. I could ask how many New Zealanders are here in Australia receiving unemployment relief. There might be a reciprocal agreement, but I am sure there are a lot more New Zealanders here than there are Australians in New Zealand. To conclude, let me say this: let us be fair so far as social security is concerned, and let the Government realise that it is taxpayers' money. This is the important thing. </PARA>

After years of opposing the assets test, the latest shadow Minister for social security, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), has rammed through the Opposition party room acceptance of a modified assets test.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a poor reflection on the honourable member for Macquarie when he yells that out across the chamber, because he knows that is a deliberate untruth. The whole assets test is about fairness, trying to make sure that people who are assets rich and income poor sell part of those assets so that the ordinary wage and salary earner does not have to provide a pension for those people who can afford to provide for themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those opposite say, `Well, these people have paid their taxes during their lives, they should get a pension'. That is a very similar argument to the people from Grey Power who say that everyone should get an age pension. It sounds very attractive and very simple. That is the sort of argument that says that Jim Killen should get an age pension-Jim Killen, having retired from Parliament with a very generous superannuation payout, has been representing Russ Hinze at a certain inquiry in Queensland as a barrister. They say that Jim Killen should get not only his parliamentary superannuation and his income as a lawyer, but also the age pension. That is ridiculous. The Opposition says that would make the system fairer. I hope that a little more thought goes into this in future on the Opposition side of politics but I have to commend the current shadow Minister. At least he has rammed through the Liberal Party an acceptance of a modified assets test. It is a step forward and we hope the improvement continues. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I hand out too many bouquets to the shadow Minister, I return to one of the comments he made. He said `Dollars are not the only answer, Minister.' I suppose that is at least an acceptance that under this Minister we are seeing massive sums of money directed to those who need it, but he should not then have dismissed the massive reforms of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) and this Government in a throwaway line such as, `Dollars are not the only answer'. We have had the revolutionary reforms of the family allowance supplement (FAS) directing massive sums of money to those families with young children that are in real need. We have made sure that those payments also go to families who have wage earners, so they are not just restricted to those receiving pensions and benefits. We have made sure that we are not taking incentive out of the system. We are making sure that people can get support when they return to the work force. We have tried to make sure that families that are battling get the FAS. That is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the excellent changes that have been introduced in this Budget is a modification of the rules relating to the family allowance supplement. In the past, people had to have a reduction of 25 per cent in their income before their eligibility for FAS could be recalculated. I am pleased to see that the Minister has, in this Budget, arranged for the FAS to be reconsidered if people are eligible for the maximum FAS entitlement, and I think that is a step in the right direction. I was very interested to hear the shadow Minister for social security say that he has not been able to make any commitment on behalf of the Opposition as to where it stood on some of the measures in this Budget package. The Minister for Social Security and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) have announced that it is this Government's policy that in 1995 no part pensioner will pay any income tax. I would have thought that that was something worthy of bipartisan support in this chamber. </PARA>

That is our Government's, our Party's, policy. What did the Liberal Party and the National Party say? They will think about it and they will do it to the extent that it is possible at the time. That is the choice we are being offered by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We had a throwaway line from the honourable member for Lyne saying that the tax on superannuation was up 1,000 per cent. Perhaps I will have a talk to him later on about his pocket calculator. He might be looking at lump sums and ignoring those who get regular superannuation payments. If we sat down we might end up with a different figure. The people on superannuation who have been greatly disadvantaged in the past have been those receiving that regular superannuation payment, the people getting the railway superannuation pension, the people who convert their lump sums into annuities. That is why this change to exempt part pensioners from tax in 1995 is so important. It tips the balance back in favour of those regular fortnightly payments. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the biggest problems we have had in recent years is the massive increase in the number of people taking lump sums. They perhaps retire early, spend their lump sums and then expect to get a full age pension at age 60 or 65. That is great for them, but it is not very good for the ordinary wage and salary earners who give them a subsidy for their superannuation and then are expected to pay for an age pension. I ask the honourable member for Macquarie to consider this if he accumulates a good amount of superannuation in his time, in his service as a member of this House-and remember that taxpayers not only subsidise parliamentarians' superannuation, but the superannuation of all people in superannuation schemes who get special tax breaks. How can he expect the taxpayers to let him spend his lump sum and then provide him with an age pension in addition? That is not fair. The honourable member said that is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes that are left to me, I wish to raise one other matter. I have raised it in the adjournment debate once before. Given that the Minister for Social Security is at the table, I cannot resist the temptation. It concerns certain payments made to people who are victims of Nazi persecution. This might be appropriate, given the recent anniversary of the Second World War. The Minister was responsible for introducing a special amendment to the Social Security Act to exempt from the social security income test payments for that persecution by the Federal Republic of Germany. The problem is that former citizens of Austria or the Netherlands, unfortunately, do not have those payments exempted from the social security income test. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office does the right thing; it exempts those payments, whichever country citizens come from. I appeal to the Minister to consider extending that exemption to payments received from the governments of Austria and Holland. Only a small number of people are involved, and these payments would go only to people eligible for pensions. It is a matter which I believe is worthy of consideration, if not in this Budget then at the next available opportunity. </PARA>

The comments of the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) drew attention to the fact that there is a continuing failure on the part of this Government to recognise that economic management is the real reason that social security recipients are having a tough time. They will continue to have a tough time, despite the meagre promises in the Budget of a very slight rise in the pension, with the carrot of a final rise bringing it up to 25 per cent level of average earnings by April 1990. These are the realities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We hear the Minister criticising the Opposition, saying that we would cut pensions, knowing full well that that is incorrect, that it is intended as a red herring to try to draw attention away from the Government's failure to meet its responsibilities to the aged and to those who are in necessitous circumstances. My colleagues the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), the honourable member for Lyne and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), who are in the chamber, have asserted by way of interjection that we do have a practical approach to the problem of the assets test. We have not backed away from it. We have assessed and looked objectively at what is needed to overcome the very real problems of people who are finding it almost impossible to live because of the implications of the assets test, particularly in country areas where property values, but lack of income, place them in a perilous situation. It ill becomes the Government to cast so many aspersions on the Opposition. But the ballot box will tell the story.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) has left the chamber. I was going to say that we have two Ministers in the chamber who, I believe, have a considerable amount of intellect. I suspect on occasions when I see some of the Budget snippets that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), who is at the table, has a compassionate heart. Having said that, I am very concerned about the future of the Australian Institute of Family Studies. The Institute of Family Studies will move from the Attorney-General's Department. The Institute of Family Studies, as a matter of interest, is a statutory body that was incorporated when the Family Law Act came into being. It is a government sponsored body. The Institute of Family Studies will move into the Department of Social Security. It was offered to the Department of Community Services and Health. I believe the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) said that he did not want it. I am very glad that the Minister for Social Security has said, `Yes, we'll have it', although I believe quite firmly that it ought to remain with the Attorney-General's Department because that is the Department that will still administer the family law area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest to the Minister at the table that when and if the Institute of Family Studies, under the directorship of Dr Don Edgar, who has been there for some years and who has been very diligent in his endeavours to undertake studies with regard to the Australian family-the very foundation of the fabric of our society which is under attack from goodness knows how many areas at the moment-comes under his control, he give it the support that it needs. The support that it has been receiving from the Attorney-General's Department has run hot and cold. Last year in the Budget, for example, its allocation was reduced; this year it has been raised a little. Every year since 1984, in every Budget debate, I have been very critical of the Attorney-General's Department with regard to the support it has given to what is the backbone of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We can talk about overseas debt. We can talk about a host of different economic problems that confront this nation, but if we do not have strong, stable Australian families, which is the desire of the majority of people in this country, we do not have anything. In one sense, I am very pleased that the Institute of Family Studies is being moved under the care of the Minister for Social Security, because I know he does have a compassionate heart tucked away somewhere. I hope that the recurrent funding and the money that is so essential to run the research programs of the Institute of Family Studies will be forthcoming. He must relentlessly pursue the cause of this particular institution, which is so vital, in terms of getting Cabinet to agree to recurrent funding that will enable it to undertake research into families, research into why marriages fail, and research into marriage education. For example, we are paying only 25c per head per family per year for marriage education, yet we are paying $500 per year per family to support families as a result of marriage breakdown. That is the equivalent of almost two new parliament houses. I hope the Minister will take my remarks on board. He is an intelligent person. I have a great deal of respect for him. I hope that instead of running around cursing the darkness we will see him light a few candles. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those who have contributed tonight to this brief debate concerning Social Security estimates as part of the consideration of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90. I will refer very quickly to several of the speakers in the debate. With respect to the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), we have had from him, both in an earlier speech and in this committee stage debate, an acknowledgment of the fact that the Government has included within this Budget a significant range of reforms. Indeed, we have had from the honourable member some endorsement of those reforms to the extent of Opposition support. Of course, we have to be very careful to recognise that that support has been qualified and there is a sense in which the Opposition has made it very clear, not only for 1995 but in the shorter term future, that the support that it offers is support that is subject to economic circumstances-that is, that it treats social security not as a first call on the Budget but indeed as a residual matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fundamentally, that is the difference between the Government and the Opposition. We regard the issue of social security as a matter of social justice, as a matter of equity, and not as a residual matter to be dealt with when more important issues have been given consideration. When we hear any discussion of the Opposition's commitments, we are not surprised when we see that those commitments are indeed qualified, because that is a matter of Opposition philosophy. For example, at a time in which we are attempting to put in place a long term retirement income policy and to address the adequacy of the age pension-absolutely crucial to the maintenance of that overall policy-this was never a significant part of Opposition policy; it had half a policy, half of a shadow policy, because it never went to the question of support of the aged. </PARA>
<PARA> I go quickly to the question of homeless youth. Of course, the honourable member for Bradfield would have us extend our commitment to under-16s, I think in a social context which he has not bothered to really understand. The fact of the matter is that children need to be cared for within primary groups, within families or family-like groupings, and supported at a local community level. The problems in that area for children who happen to be homeless under the age of 16 is one in relation to which the Commonwealth Government can certainly provide some support to the States, but ultimately it has to be solved within the traditional structure of State services, although, of course, we know that the States are looking for reform in this area and the Commonwealth would seek to cooperate in that process of reform. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other contributions of a positive nature came from the Government side, but I just want to answer briefly several of the points made by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan). I think we ought to remember that this year New Zealand will be reimbursing Australia about $20m because of pensioners moving to Australia where we are picking up the bill. So that is an issue that the Government has addressed, and of course that reimbursement will grow substantially over the years. We will have in this session measures to deal with people who move to areas of low unemployment. That is a matter of concern to the honourable member for Lyne. We will not, of course, be addressing the issue of the assets test, because we do not think, unlike the Opposition, that those with wealth ought to be the first priority; but then, we have a concern for social justice. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I go to the remarks of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster). I simply assure him that the change made with respect to the administration of the Institute of Family Studies in no sense lessened the Government's commitment to that extremely important institute. We welcome the research. Indeed, perhaps a great reform-the greatest social reform in recent years; the child support scheme-was a direct result of the great research done, particularly in the economic consequences of marriage break-down, by the Institute of Family Studies. So I indicate my own and the Government's very strong commitment to the work of the Institute of Family Studies. For lack of time, I will conclude my remarks at that point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, during a debate today I had cause to raise objection to words being used by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent). In the words he used he accused me of taking on racial attitudes. I objected to those words most strongly. I was not able to have agreement from the Chair that they should be withdrawn and the honourable member for Hotham claimed that he had not said those words anyway. He said that he had said that I had embraced racist terrorists and tried to bring in racial immigration. I have listened to the tape. There was no withdrawal from the honourable member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I will not canvass the ruling but I should sound a warning to those who may be responsible in the chamber that it is not my intention to again accept words like that because I do not think they have a place in this chamber. I take great exception to those expressions. It would be just as eligible for me, on that formula, to accuse-and I do not accuse-the honourable member for Hotham of taking on traitorous attitudes or embracing communist philosophy and seeking to bring that into Australia. I do not think that this House advances its cause if people have instantaneous amnesia and claim that they have not said things that they have said and that the tapes prove were said. I sound a warning to the honourable member for Hotham that I will not ever again accept that sort of comment from him. </PARA>
<PARA> In the three-odd years that I had the privilege to serve the Opposition as shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs I had the privilege of bringing forward two policies for the Opposition, both of them completely non-discriminatory and I made sure that they were. In my relationship with community groups around Australia, in which I delighted, I found all groups to be wonderful Australians and very supportive of this nation. I had cause today to raise matters of concern of manipulation of Australian community groups by outsiders through foreign embassies which seem to think that there are some advantages for their cause by manipulating Australian communities. I reject that approach and I think most Australians do too. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular pleasure that I enjoyed, I think, was getting to know the Indo-Chinese community well and to understand the difficulties that its members experienced in Australia on settlement and how they and their fellow Australians coped with those difficulties. I think Australia is a great immigration nation and I think we in fact accommodate the immigration process very well. I do not think that in the settlement of refugees we were really geared for the large flow of refugees. I think we have learned a lot from that process because the settlement of refugees is quite a different process from that of migration. In one instance we have people willing and anxious to come Australia and the others have usually come to Australia out of desperation to get away from a terrible situation. They have lost a lot; often they have lost everything, including family. So the comfort and support that Australia is able to give refugees can be improved but I think we have done a magnificent job and far beyond what could be expected from a nation of our size. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has been absolutely outstanding, I believe, in its immigration programs and what it has produced by way of population growth and quality of people entering this country. Successive Ministers have indeed been outstanding. I am proud to be part of that tradition and I refute and reject the comments made by the honourable member for Hotham. I warn him never to use them again in this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, in the Queensland Parliament, the Minister for Water Resources, Mr Neal, carried on a tradition of downgrading the institution of Parliament. Months ago, I referred the Bundaberg irrigation scheme to the Public Works Committee of the Queensland Parliament. Yesterday, Mr Neal said that the only outcome of such a referral would be a damning indictment of the Commonwealth. Essentially, Mr Neal has pre-empted the role of an independent committee of the Parliament. He is trying to lean on the National Party members of the Committee to make sure that they come up with the answer the Government wants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the third occasion on which the National Party has prostituted the Westminster traditions. The resignation of the former Speaker, Mr Powell, occurred because Mr Powell wanted to refer a statement from the Premier, Mr Ahern, to the Privileges Committee. Mr Ahern considered that he was above the Committee and refused to allow the matter to be referred. In another incident, the Public Accounts Committee was attacked by the Finance Minister, Mr Austin, as being a kangaroo court. The National Party then closed the Public Accounts Committee to the public. In this post-Fitzgerald era, Mr Ahern's lock, stock and barrel commitment has been watered down. Rambo Ahern has been replaced by Ahern the wimp. </PARA>
<PARA> Today my friend the member for Archerfield tried to have the Neal incident referred to the Privileges Committee and the Speaker, Mr Lingard, blocked it. In Parliament Mr Neal said that the Bundaberg scheme was a top priority. After 17 years the State Government still has not been able to connect all the farmers in the Isis district. Far from being a top priority, over the years this scheme has never been No. 1 with the Queensland Government. This year's allocation of $15m is exactly the same as last year's-a decline of 7 per cent in real terms. In dollar terms, it is $12m less than in 1986-87. Until this year the scheme has lagged behind the Burdekin in terms of amounts allocated. </PARA>
<PARA> This is why Mr Neal is terrified of an independent Public Works Committee finding. This is why he had to lean on it by pre-empting its finding. No finding now will be free of National Party taint. It is the lack of accountability which is the issue at the heart of Queensland's problems today. This is why Queensland needs a change for the better. This is why Queensland needs a Goss-led Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, here we are at the end of the second week of sitting of this session of the Federal Parliament, with Australia on the verge of economic disaster, one of the worst strikes in our history at full steam, and no real sight of resolution before us at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight, before this session of Parliament closes, let me report to the House the latest figures I have from the Australian Hotels Association as to the cost of this strike to the four- and five-star hotels. The total revenue lost through the strike to 1 September this year is $30.7m, with 5,400 people stood down in the hotel industry alone. Eight hundred conventions have been cancelled; $10m in revenue has been lost; over 100,000 room-nights have been lost; and over $30m is estimated to have been lost from four- and five-star accommodation houses alone. At this stage more than 150,000 jobs in the tourism and hospitality industry are under threat. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has condemned from day one, and continues to condemn, this strike. But we must say that we have had no indication from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of his real concern as to what is happening in the tourism and hospitality industry. In fact, in Question Time here over this past week he has pooh-poohed the whole idea of compensation to anyone in that industry while maintaining in a real sense that he is prepared to compensate airline employees. The people of Australia need to know what is happening with this strike. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition suggests that before the night is out the Government give us answers to these questions: When does the Government reasonably expect to restore normal airline schedules between Australia's capital cities? How many pilots have signed up with the airlines under the new contracts? Are these pilots all or mostly management pilots? What are the details of the new contracts that are being offered to pilots, so that we can be sure that they are consistent with the Industrial Relations Commission's pay guidelines? Why will the Government not permit Australian Airlines to sit down with both individual pilots and the Australian Federation of Air Pilots in order that the dispute can be resolved more expeditiously?</PARA>

Most importantly, the people of the tourism and hospitality industry need to know what their future is going to be. They need to hear from the Prime Minister whether he does, in fact, have any concern for them, or whether he is prepared to treat the public of Australia in the same way that he has treated this House in the last few weeks. The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) sits there with a smirk on his face. Let me tell him that the worst affected State in Australia at the moment is Tasmania, where there is absolutely no action. The second worst is his State, where one of the major hotels, with 320 rooms, last night had 13 people staying in it.

The Opposition does not condone the pilots strike-we say to the pilots, `You have to get back to work'-but equally we know that the industrial relations system of Australia has dismally failed and we say that because that system cannot work, we must now get the pilots and the airlines together to discuss these contracts, whether it be on an individual basis, or whether it be between the airlines and the Federation of Air Pilots. We must get those planes flying again, because Australia is truly on the verge of economic disaster, and it is obvious that the Prime Minister of Australia could not care less. He is treating the people of the tourism industry, and the nation as a whole, as he has the Parliament, with utter and hopeless contempt.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In fact, over 500 Australian farms were quarantined. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) mentioned earlier that he has put a number of questions on notice about primary industry matters, and this was one of the areas that he covered. I have noticed that members of the Opposition, who say that they are so very interested in primary industry, have not put as many questions on notice on these matters as has the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I want to draw attention to a Victorian scientist, Mr Ralph Shackleford of Emerald, who has discovered a low cost and a totally safe method that will render contaminated soil dieldrin free within eight weeks, subject to certain climatic conditions. This discovery which Mr Shackleford has made could be marketed for millions of dollars, but it is being offered to landowners, the Department of Agriculture and the public completely free of charge. All that farmers have to do to obtain this technology is to undertake by covenant to protect the gullies and all existing flora and fauna on their properties, and plant 5 per cent to allow the existing fauna a corridor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr and Mrs Shackleford are a husband and wife team-they are associates-and they have always been concerned about man's and woman's relationship with the environment. As the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) knows, I am always very keen to recognise that it is men and women who together work in these areas, and the Shacklefords are a perfect example. I think it is most commendable that the Shacklefords are proposing to use this process for the benefit of all farmers and not to make money out of it. I certainly hope that Mr Shackleford's discovery proves to be viable and I wish both Mr and Mrs Shackleford success in their endeavours. I hope I will have the opportunity, now that we are getting back to our electorates for three weeks, to meet them and to discuss their discovery and to find out whether there is any way in which I can help them in promoting what they have done. If what they are proposing proves to be successful, it will be extremely important to the farming community in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commence my remarks, which are related to the pilots dispute, by saying that the Liberal and National parties right from the outset have utterly condemned the pilots in their dispute with the airlines. I do not think any reasonable person on either side of the political spectrum could possibly endorse the sorts of claims made and the manner in which they have been put. In particular, nobody could endorse the actions that have resulted as a consequence of this dispute. The airline pilots dispute is causing tremendous hardship right throughout Australia. Small business, big business, ordinary Australians are all being adversely affected by it. As the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) said in his remarks earlier this evening, nearly 150,000 Australians are set to lose their jobs as a consequence of the pilots dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It ill becomes the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who over these last few days has done his utmost to blame anybody in Australia but himself for the air pilots dispute, to have the gall to come in here and try to blame it on this side of the House. Let me say that there is absolutely no blame on this side of the House for the pilots dispute. If we want to find the true culprits, if there are to be any in this parliamentary building, they are the members of the Labor Party, and more particularly the Prime Minister of this country. It is the Labor Party's rigid centralised industrial relations system which caused this dispute right at the outset. If we want to know who inflamed this dispute, if we want to know who propelled the pilots into action, who gave them the resolve to go forward into this dispute as a united group, it was the Prime Minister, with his juvenile, stupid, ridiculous remarks. They did nothing less than inflame the pilots into action. It was the war declared by the Prime Minister, those inflammatory remarks which were made by him, and the rigid centralised industrial relations system of the Labor Party that have caused this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is the Government doing all that it can to ensure that the dispute is not resolved? Why do we not see negotiations? Why do we not see the Government giving instructions to Australian Airlines to negotiate with the pilots? Why do we see the Prime Minister giving assurances behind the scenes to the airlines that he is going to compensate them for the consequences of this dispute? Why do we see all of that? It is because this Government is prepared to put the maintenance of its accord ahead of the best interests of every Australian, the best interests of the tourism industry. At the same time the Prime Minister has a vested interest because one of his best mates is involved in it. So this dispute is caused by the Government's resolve to protect the accord at all costs, regardless of what it does to individual Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen also in the process a great act of hypocrisy, of double standards. In the course of a few days the pilots' industrial award was axed. The Government allowed civil law to apply and the military were brought in to break the strike. Overseas carriers were also brought in to try to beat the strike. And whilst all of this has been going on, we happen to see down in Melbourne a strike on the waterfront-a strike that went for nearly a week; a strike that cost this country a lot of money. But did we hear one word from the Prime Minister? No, not one word. </PARA>

Whilst the waterfront of Australia has, according to the Business Council of Australia, cost this country $4 billion a year in terms of gross domestic product through all the inefficiencies, rorts and industrial disputes, we do not hear a word from the Prime Minister on that. Of course, this highlights a double standard. The other double standard is that the Australian people will be paying to those wharfies who will be retiring shortly $300m out of the public purse-half from the public purse, half from importers and exporters. This is the double standard we see going on at present. I am afraid to say that if we look for blame in this place we look only at the Labor Party. It is its industrial relations system that has caused the problem. It is our industrial relations policy that will provide the solutions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Tonight I want to talk about some hypocrisy that I am aware of in relation to asbestos and the town of Wittenoom. Wittenoom at one stage was the largest town in the Pilbara. There was a blue asbestos mine there. There is no doubt that the mining there caused quite a lot of health problems; many people have died from asbestosis and mesothelioma. The point is that since the mine closed down nobody in the town has died. The reason is that when the mine was active, the clouds of asbestos dust that the people lived in caused the problem. The people most at risk were the workers in the processing plant and the people in the offices-not the miners in the mine itself. If the people in the town in those days wanted to tidy up their backyards, the company would very kindly deliver truckloads of tailings for them. As sand was at a premium, they could have tailings for their kids to play in. There is little wonder that the incidence of mesothelioma was quite high. </PARA>
<PARA> But that has changed and the area has been cleaned up. I must say here that Mr Hancock has done a great job in cleaning up his areas. He has, in my view, done a far better job than the State Government has done. I think it was in 1976 that the State Government actually sold State houses to residents, to people wanting to live in the town. I believe that this gives the State Government an ongoing commitment to look after that town. But what does it do? It hides behind the health department, which will not say that the town is safe. It will not talk about relative safety; it just says that it cannot guarantee that it is safe. Of course, no-one can guarantee that anywhere is safe. But it is probably true that the asbestos level at Wynyard Station in Sydney is higher than that in Wittenoom. I have a very firm belief that the health department in Western Australia stopped taking samples of the air there simply because they did not confirm its predictions. I believe that high asbestos counts were not recorded and, therefore, it stopped doing them because it was upsetting its own projections. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the town has now been greatly prejudiced by the irresponsible actions of the State Government and its entities. I understand that recently Mr Neil Bartholomaeus, who heads up the occupational health and safety branch, has told Telecom Australia it should not send its workers there because of danger to the workers. That is absolute nonsense. There is no danger to the workers. But it has for the moment put a hold on all Telecom work in Wittenoom, depriving the people in the town of communications. It is a narrow, silly act on the part of the State Government and one which should be immediately reversed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about occupational health and safety. The mining industry has been under attack recently. There have been a lot of deaths in the goldfields recently. There are various causes. There was a large outcry by some of the unions that the matter of health and safety should be taken over by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. The building industry, which these people control, does not have a very good safety record, anyway. The real problem with the mining industry in Western Australia is that for years and years it has been deprived of money by the State Government. The Department of Mines simply has not had the resources necessary to put into this area. I believe that if this matter is addressed and if the mines Act is written in plain English, as is currently being done by the Hon. Mark Neville, one of my good friends and colleagues in the Western Australian upper House, people will become much more aware of their responsibilities and the Mines Department will be able to police efficiently, as it used to, the safety aspects of the mines. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been so much nonsense talked about asbestos. Governments have spent millions of dollars to placate middle class concerns about asbestos in ceilings, when it would have been much cheaper just to seal up the asbestos. A hazard has probably been created by removing it, but that is the way life seems to be these days. A noisy middle class can force governments to spend large amounts of money which are unnecessary when real health needs go unanswered. </PARA>

The Minister, in particular, continues to deny that the hospital system is in a state of crisis, as the honourable member for Tangney pointed out. The simple fact is that the South Australian Government has blown the whistle on the rest of the Labor Party. It has said that the South Australian health system and the Federal health system are in a state of utter chaos. Remember its words, `It all adds up to uncertainty and insecurity'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In extending the debate I did so for the purpose of answering some of the allegations which were raised by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp). First of all, in respect of some of the allegations made by the honourable member for Fadden when he read out an impressive list of members of the tourist industry who are suffering as a result of this industrial dispute, let me compliment him and let me say that if he had spent some time with me I could have added to his list. Anyone who is being objective about what is occurring in this society would be absolutely clear about the fact that if there are any innocent victims of this particular stoppage they are those involved in the tourist industry at every level and from one end of Australia to another. It is only a question of measuring the size of the potential disaster which varies from area to area and from individual entrepreneur to individual entrepreneur. So there is no question about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me just deal with that because at least if we are agreed about something it is the plight of the tourist industry. I have not done and I cannot do-I have said this to the House-anything more than stress the urgency of the need to deal with this matter. The damage that is being done both internationally and locally, is going to take months to repair. I am bound to say this: in repairing it I will be hoping that the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Fadden, will have a role to play. I will be inviting him to discharge that role. But in the present situation one is not assisted by any analysis of this stoppage which seems to be part of the view that runs through the Opposition which, as a matter of philosophy, as a matter of policy, has made it perfectly clear that it believes that the present industrial relations system ought to be abandoned. That is its position. That is the position it is entitled to hold. It is a position it is entitled to argue for. The view of members of the Opposition is that relationships in an employment situation ought to be determined freely outside the present industrial relations system and argued and arrived at between an employer on the one part and employee groups on the other. That is their position. They do not believe that the industrial relations tribunals that we have have any significant role to play in this situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, that is not clear from the policy. One of the problems with this Opposition is, depending on whom one talks to at any particular time, one is likely to get a different view or a different interpretation. This morning on the AM program I heard Senator Stone argue, as he is entitled to argue, for the view that the Australian Federation of Air Pilots ought to be subject to these negotiations. I say: please make up your mind. The fact of the matter is that since this industrial stoppage-and that is what has occurred and we are all agreed about the damage-we have had on a day to day basis a series of questions put to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and put to relevant Ministers as to the cause of it. Basically the thrust of the Opposition's questions has been designed implicitly to support the position of the Pilots Federation.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Opposition believes in secret ballots. The Federation had a secret ballot. This was not an industrial stoppage that arose overnight. The Prime Minister proved conclusively in the House today that this action by the pilots was cold, premeditated and had the same logistics as a group of people out to hijack an airline. The only difference is that these people are hijacking the economy and the tourist industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
