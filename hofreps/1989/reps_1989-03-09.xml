<TITLE>`Authority Required' Prescriptions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled; the humble petition of the undersigned citizens showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> that your petitioners deplore the Federal Government's decision to remove 53 Pharmaceutical drugs from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme including the best available treatment of high blood pressure, cancer, epilepsy, high cholesterol and uneven heartbeat-and place them for cost saving reasons only on a special list requiring Authority from a Canberra bureaucrat, and;</PARA>
<PARA> that we believe a patient's doctor is clearly the best judge for medication needed for their particular illness and that it is therefore wrong and unfair to force that doctor to seek permission from a bureaucrat in Canberra who has no personal knowledge of that case.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will call on the Government to immediately abandon the proposal and keep its election promise of high quality and universal health care for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of certain electors of Riverina Darling, Sub-division of Broken Hill South, in the State of New South Wales, points out to the House that it is the intention of The Director of Posts and Telegraphs to downgrade the South Broken Hill Post Office and to possibly convert it to an agency in the not so distant future, the reason being given that business has decreased over recent years.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners pray that the House direct The Minister to keep the South Broken Hill Post Office open for as long as foreseeable, as it serves a population of 6000 or more people, many of whom are pensioners and do not have transport. It is significant that the fall-off in business parallels the decision of the local postmaster to close for lunch. The business area has suffered very badly in the middle of the day as a result and in the early afternoon. Many residents who used the Postal Services in this general period mentioned, now bypass the shopping area as they know they cannot avail themselves of mail services when they wish between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.</PARA>

<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1F4">Mr BRUMBY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In essence, the report looks at the ways in which new technology can open up educational opportunities to more people and the ways in which the quality of education can be improved. In the terms of the trade, the report looks at the ways in which technology can improve educational access and outcomes and what this requires. Improving educational access and outcomes using new technology should not be dismissed as an abstract or symbolic endeavour-yet another gentle stroll through the garden of education, pushing the perambulator of better learning; nor should the topic of increasing educational access and outcomes be pigeonholed as a purely technical matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Use of technology to improve the availability and quality of education is not a technical issue which concerns only people of mellifluous manner in dark three-piece suits trying to sell the latest model of machine. Educational technology does not concern only uncommunicative technicians in white coats busy pulling cables through the roof; nor is educational technology only the province of wide-eyed teachers enthralled with the use of facsimile, videos, computer graphics or desktop publishing. The issue of how to use technology to improve educational access and outcomes transcends both social and technical areas of interest. In fact, it is a matter which typifies the close interrelationships in, and complex goals of, Government policies to advance social equity and economic development. </PARA>
<PARA> There is both an economic and a social imperative to expand educational opportunities to as wide a range of Australians as possible. Education can assist people to become socially capable citizens who understand, and are able to contribute to, their society. Not only does education critically and crucially influence personal development and economic advancement, but also it fundamentally affects the wellbeing, productivity and adaptability of our economy at large. There is an economic necessity to ensure that within an expanded range of educational opportunities-in other words, with this improved access-we provide the best learning experience possible, that is, the best outcomes of these opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> In examining access, the Committee was concerned to see how more people, and especially the more disadvantaged groups, could be given further opportunities for education with new forms of technology. This applies particularly to people cut off from access to conventional education by geographic isolation or by other circumstances of their employment or personal lives. In examining outcomes, the Committee focused on how the quality of education can be broadened, enriched and stimulated by the application of new forms of technology to the educational process. The Committee concluded that new forms of technology can improve educational access and outcomes but that new technology is not necessarily the required or the limiting factor. Older forms of technology such as printing, radio and television have their place. I shall return to this point later. </PARA>
<PARA> If technology is to be used successfully to improve educational access and outcomes we must choose the appropriate form of technology for the particular task at hand and manage it well. Success depends on the way technology and learning is organised and supported. New technology is not in itself enough to open new doors more widely. Access to learning must be translated into choice for the learner. In other words access should also involve the application of the principles of what is known as `open learning'. Open learning attempts to give students as much choice as possible-for example, in choice of subject, structure and location of study and method and timing of assessment. Open learning is much more than external study. As I am sure the Minister knows only too well, courses of external study can be remarkably unopen, except in so far as they are offered off campus. An open learning approach can be made possible by the use of new communications and information technology, but there are important organisational factors which also influence the openness of learning. </PARA>
<PARA> At the most basic and fundamental level, learners in any location-metropolitan or rural-must be able to find out what courses are available. Post school learners in Australia cannot do this at present. It is, in my view, a matter of national shame that, in an era of high technology, user computer networks and communications systems criss-crossing Australia, there is no national information base which lets people know what educational courses are available. To redress this, the Committee recommends that the Department of Employment, Education and Training should urgently establish a national database of all Australian tertiary education courses. We believe that the information on the database should be widely available through the TAFE computer network and, in rural and remote areas, through Australia Post offices and agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing was strikingly evident during the conduct of this inquiry, from many of the 109 submissions received, many of the 101 witnesses at public hearings and the numerous people to whom the Committee spoke during its inspections and visits. That is, there is a high level of interest in the development and application of new technology in education. It was also obvious that there is an immense variety in the way this interest has been manifest, and the degree to which the particular initiatives undertaken have been successful. </PARA>
<PARA> To the Committee, success seems to depend on setting goals and having good practical support. This is perhaps nowhere more obvious than in the case of television in education. Television is an exciting educational medium but it could hardly be termed new. It was introduced into Australia in 1956. Nonetheless, there are important initiatives which could and should be taken to improve and extend educational horizons using television. </PARA>
<PARA> The threshold issue to be addressed is that of the availability of educational material of good quality. Many members in this place would be familiar, and certainly their children would, for example, with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Playschool programs on television. What we need is more material like this-good Australian material which takes the education task seriously. We have confidence in our technicians to make such material. All they need is the incentive to do so. Broadcasters, in turn, need an incentive to buy Australian produced material. In this regard, the Committee believes that metropolitan and regional commercial television broadcasts should be required to broadcast educational programs as a condition of their licences. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the future, the Committee believes that if pay television were widely introduced in Australia, a specified amount of that broadcast capacity should be required to be made available free for educational purposes. Service operators should provide assistance in producing the educational programs that are broadcast. Coordination and communication are vital if we are to have both goals for the future and adequate levels of practical support to give effect to these ideas. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the recurrent themes in this report is the perceived need at all levels in the education sector for coordination of effort. The Committee was repeatedly told that coordination and communication were needed in order to avoid duplication of effort, recurrence of mistakes and uneconomic segmentation of services. Organisations and individuals as diverse as the Brisbane College of Advanced Education and the Victorian Department of Education made precisely this point and suggested that the Commonwealth encourage this cooperative effort. The Committee agrees that such coordination is essential from an economic as well as a functional point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> There are coordinating mechanisms in education, but it is clear that many practitioners in education do not think they are working. The Committee looked closely at the coordinating mechanisms and suggests improvements in their structure and operations. The Committee recommends, for instance, that the Australian Education Council (AEC) be instrumental in development, promoting, and implementing national strategies in the use of technology. The Australian Educational Council, known as the AEC, is the joint Commonwealth-State and Territory Council of Ministers of Education. The Australian Education Council should also encourage the adoption of guidelines and standards for communications and information technology. We hope that such standards and guidelines will enhance compatibility within and between educational sectors. (Extension of time granted)</PARA>
<PARA> Just a couple of minutes more will enable me to complete my remarks. Coordination is a particular priority in the higher education sector. The Higher Education Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training should use the national strategies and policies developed by the AEC and the Board should be responsible for ensuring cooperative effort between institutions. A national database of courseware and software information which would be accessible to all tertiary institutions should also be established. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is in the school sector that the challenges of new educational technology are the most pressing and the potential gains most significant. The Committee was told, though, that the rate at which technology is taking off in schools probably exceeds schools' capacity to support it. Teachers are discovering the potential of technology and they are basically hungry for more access. The Committee saw ample evidence of such enthusiasm and this was pleasing. But there is an ongoing and very pressing need to ensure that teachers are adequately trained in new technology. The Commonwealth should allocate more funds to in-service training which deals with new technology, provided that State and non-government systems match these funds. It is also vital that schools themselves have increased opportunities for `hands on' use of computers. A large number of schools have acquired computers, often with the assistance of parent associations and the encouragement of computer companies. However, the Committee believes that the present availability of computers in schools is quite inadequate and that there is a crying need Australia-wide to remedy this situation. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) target is for a ratio of 10 pupils per computer. Our best performance appears to be in Tasmania, with 22 students per computer. Sufficient government funds should be provided to enable schools to meet the OECD target by the beginning of the 1992 school year. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude, I would like to thank the other members of the Committee who worked very hard on this report, and the tireless and very able Committee secretariat and the specialist adviser for the time and effort they put into the inquiry. I commend the report to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make a few brief remarks. I certainly do not anticipate requiring an extension of time. I am pleased to support this very important report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. When we first got the reference I imagined that it would deal mostly with the problems of rural Australia. Indeed, there certainly were problems when the Committee went round rural Australia. It was a real pleasure to see organisations such as the Broken Hill School of the Air and the Darwin School of the Air. They provide an excellent service. But one has even more concern for those students that have to rely totally on correspondence education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the important themes of this report is that technology has a capacity to assist in improving access not only in rural Australia but also in disadvantaged areas of metropolitan and provincial Australia. The other point I would like to make-the report makes it too-is that there is no point in providing technology if we do not provide training for teachers to use the technology. There is really no good substitute for the excellence of face to face teaching, but technology can go a long way in supplementing and complementing that. In some instances, of course, there is just no alternative. I certainly hope that the Government will carefully consider the report. I am sure it will be welcomed by teachers, students and caring parents. I too would like to commend the Committee and also all those members, such as the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) and the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free), who contributed so much to the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The inquiry which led to this report generated considerable discussion around Australia with interested people and organisations, as the Chairman, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby), has already said. Submissions were received from State governments, tertiary institutions, technical and further education colleges, community colleges, correspondence schools, isolated children parents associations, television and satellite service providers, as well as independent individuals, expert and otherwise. The submissions outlined the relative merits of various new and less new technologies in achieving greater access to a broader range of educational options and outcomes. They concentrated on opening more doors to education, not simply widening the existing doors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our report particularly emphasises the need for a national direction in the use of technology in learning and teaching. Furthermore, it is evident that production of Australian-designed courseware and software for schools and tertiary institutions will be encouraged by a more co-ordinated approach to curricula and result in a more consistent relevant delivery of course information to students across Australia. Accreditation transfer and recognition between States will also be greatly improved if this type of cooperation can be obtained. This report is also about the need for informed choice in technology on the basis of fulfilling specific goals. Too often, it seems, the process is reversed and technology is purchased and employed with no clear objective of output in mind. The Committee was firmly of the view that more resources are required to lift the incidence of hands-on experience with computers by children in our schools. An understanding of computer logic and the use of computers in a variety of ways for a number of tasks seems essential, given the prevailing computer culture and the likelihood of exposure to this technology in later personal and occupational life. </PARA>
<PARA> While not believing that computers are the answer to all education problems, the Committee considered that computer literacy among students was an essential national goal. Accordingly, the acquisition of suitable hardware and software and the enhancement of relevant skills among teachers has been recommended. The Committee consciously avoided going down the path of `gee whizzery' and recommending the use of new technology for new technology's sake. That does not mean that we were unimpressed by the displays of video-disk and satellite technology provided nor blind to the possibilities of such technologies in the longer term, and I would like to record my thanks to those witnesses for their informative presentations. It must be remembered, however, that in the Australian context there are still a number of isolated areas where relatively old technologies have not yet penetrated and where the provision of newer technologies would be completely unrealistic. It was, therefore, generally considered that the more intelligent application of a combination of computer, broadcasting, telecommunication and video-audio tape-type technology would be the most efficient and cost-effective way of improving both access and outcomes in the Australian education system in the foreseeable future. I would like to join with the Chairman and the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) in thanking the Committee and the Committee Secretariat for their assistance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My lasting impression of this report, An apple for the Teacher, will be this: there are many, many good ideas in new technology that apply to education and there are many Australians who are working on those ideas. All that remains is for us to pool our best ideas and then to rebroadcast those ideas so that pupils in schools, in senior colleges and in the community can use those ideas to best effect. There are a couple of areas in which I am most interested, these being in the area called narrowcast rather than broadcast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am thinking in particular of a group called TSN11 at the South Brisbane Technical and Further Education College, which has the ability to put a small group-whether it be a classroom or a bowls club or someone else from a community group-into a studio, produce a program at low cost, beam it out to a satellite and then back down to discrete points on the map throughout Queensland. In other words, it is like a classroom from one point to 20, 30 or 40 other points around Queensland. The beauty of this is the ability to use this technology to talk to a very small group of individuals who require specific information. It is unlike television and it is unlike a broadcast medium where one has to talk to a broad and general audience and therefore one's message is often general. I was impressed by the ability of that technology to put people across an enormous area of Queensland in touch with each other about specific issues or topics at relatively low cost. That is one aspect of new technology that I have learnt and experienced. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect-this was pointed out in the report-is that a great deal of software is available, that is, the programs one puts into a computer that enable kids to learn. I was recently at the Bald Hills Primary School in my electorate and some primary school children were playing with a computer. I was interested to know what game they were playing and what lessons they were learning. It was a marvellous little game about the Eureka Stockade. The questions were: `If you were Peter Lalor and were locked up here for five days, how would you cope? How would you get enough water, gunshot, food and all the rest in order to keep the coppers out?'. Alternatively, `If you were a copper, how would you get inside and knock off Peter Lalor and what sorts of resources would you require?'. The thing that thrilled me about this game is that it is very Australian. Some Australians have had the knowledge to write the program about a very important event in our history and to give it to Australian kids. </PARA>
<PARA> We are competing with mainly American television influences, which the kids see all the time. They pick up the language of other countries, particularly America, through watching videos and television programs. I guess we have to fight back, and one way of fighting back would be to give sufficient resources to Australians of great talent to write software about Australian events so Australian kids can learn about our history and become involved in it. The beauty of these software programs is that children can work through the problems of, for instance, what Peter Lalor faced in the Eureka Stockade, get a feel for what it was like and work out how he could possibly have kept the troops together over that time. It gives them a sense of our history. If we can do that sort of thing with new technology in education each of us will be richer and our culture will be enriched through the use of new technology. </PARA>
<PARA> I have learnt a great deal in working on this report. I would like to congratulate all the members, and especially the Chairman and staff, who have assisted us in writing an excellent report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I present the Committee's report entitled A Review of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and Australia's Overseas Aid Program, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which I have just presented is the result of 15 months work by a subcommittee of the Joint Committee. The report follows a request in November 1987 by the then Foreign Minister, Bill Hayden, to review the operations of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) and the overseas aid program generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> More than 90 submissions were received in response to the public advertising of the inquiry and over 1,200 pages of written evidence. This was supplemented by nearly 600 pages of oral evidence taken during a series of public hearings held during the inquiry. Witnesses appearing before the subcommittee included representatives of a number of Government departments and agencies, non-government organisations and industry organisations as well as academics and private individuals. In addition to the formal hearings of the Committee, members undertook a number of visits, both official and unofficial, to countries which receive Australian aid. Information gathered during these visits, such as during the tour of South Pacific nations by members of the Committee's South Pacific subcommittee and by me to the Philippines and Thailand, provided useful background to this aid review. Members of the subcommittee also met with a number of representatives of international aid and development organisations. These discussions did not constitute formal evidence but assisted in the process whereby the subcommittee formulated its views as the inquiry progressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Reviews of our aid agency and the overseas aid program are not an uncommon phenomenon. As the report notes, between 1973 and 1983 there were at least 18 separate reviews of various aspects of the aid program. The most significant of recent reviews was the major review of both aid policy and management conducted under the chairmanship of Sir Gordon Jackson. The so-called Jackson Committee report-the report of the Committee to Review Australia's Overseas Aid Program-presented in 1984, was a watershed in the history of the aid program. It combined a comprehensive review of both aid policy and management. This Committee's predecessor in the last Parliament strongly supported the broad thrusts of Jackson's recommendations, as indeed did both the Government and the Opposition. It is with the background of the Jackson report and the changes in the effectiveness of the aid program, and the efficiency of its administration by AIDAB, that this inquiry has focused its attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is divided into four broad sections. Section one examines the background to the inquiry and the objectives of the Australian aid program. Section two looks at AIDAB's effectiveness as the national overseas aid agency in terms of the mechanics by which it manages the aid program and its accountability as required by the terms of reference. The report examines in section three the appropriateness of the present amount and distribution of the funds Australia spends on aid. In this section there are chapters on the amount of aid, the distribution of aid, equity and effectiveness issues and on benefits to Australia arising from commercial and foreign affairs aspects of the aid program. The report concludes at section four with a chapter that brings together and summarises 64 separate conclusions and recommendations arising from the Committee's inquiry. At this stage I pay tribute to the people from AIDAB for their very good cooperation in preparing the report. The Committee strongly supports the objective of the aid program as set out in paragraph 3.3 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to promote the social and economic advancement of the peoples of developing countries in response to Australia's humanitarian concerns, as well as to Australia's foreign policy and commercial interests. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Before summarising the Committee's recommendations, or some of the important ones, may I say that, not unusually for me, I do not agree with a few of them; but I do not disagree with them sufficiently strongly to present a dissenting report. The report's recommendations proceed from the fundamental conclusion that the humanitarian motive must continue to be paramount in driving the aid program. Aid should be given to promote development. But the Committee also concludes that a concern for development effectiveness can be compatible with the pursuit of national self-interest. With careful management, foreign policy and commercial goals can be pursued without corrupting the quality of aid. In the management of the aid program the Committee makes a number of quite specific recommendations:</PARA>
<PARA>There must be no diminution of the autonomy of AIDAB or of the integrity of the aid program;</PARA>
<PARA>There should be a junior ministry of development cooperation within the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio but ultimate responsibility for the aid program should remain with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade;</PARA>
<PARA>AIDAB must continue to exercise tight control over its staffing levels although a greater proportion of its staff may be needed in such areas as country programs, evaluations and other quality control tasks;</PARA>
<PARA>In terms of aid volume, the Committee has concluded that there must be rapid growth in aid as a proportion of gross national product (GNP). In real terms, between 1985-86 and 1988-89 the allocation of aid has been reduced by 19 per cent. The ratio of Australian aid to GNP in this financial year is 0.36 per cent. The Committee recommends that by 1992 Australian aid should once again stand at 0.5 per cent of GNP, but I realise that this is unlikely to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Some have argued that the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are primarily development agencies. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should replace the Treasurer as Australia's Governor of both the World and Asian Development Banks. I agree that Australia's executive director and alternate director positions for both banks should be filled on the basis of expertise in development and development finance issues, but I am personally not convinced that the Treasury is not the appropriate department to represent us at these institutions, continuing, of course, its present cooperation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and especially AIDAB. </PARA>
<PARA> It remains for me only to thank the members of the Subcommittee for their hard work throughout the inquiry, and the range of witnesses who gave evidence and the persons and organisations who tendered submissions to this important inquiry. I specifically pay tribute to Mr Peter Gibson, Secretary to the Committee; Ms Ali Gillies, Adviser to the Committee; Mr Andrew Moran, Secretary to the Subcommittee until April 1988; and Miss Therese Douch of the secretariat. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the Chairman of the subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), I intend to enthusiastically endorse all the recommendations of the Committee. I have no doubts about the correctness of the views that we adopted on the range of recommendations that are contained in the report. In the few minutes available to me, I will endeavour to give some guidance as to where interested readers might find some of the more interesting titbits of information contained in this report and, I hope, encourage them to read all of it by exciting their interest on some specific aspects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a very comprehensive review and follows a large number of reports on the aid question generally and the performance of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) in particular. Unlike some of the earlier reports which have been fairly critical of the way in which our aid program has been administered, this Committee's report followed a major shake-up of the AIDAB organisation following the report of the Jackson Committee to Review the Australian Overseas Aid Program. We were specifically charged with looking at the way in which the organisation had responded. I think it would be fair to say that our comments are generally not adverse to the organisation. In other words, the review has brought about a number of very significant reforms which have achieved a great deal and AIDAB comes out of the matter well. </PARA>
<PARA> In commenting on that, I draw attention only to one matter that the Chairman addressed in particular in his comments and that is our concern that there were areas in which AIDAB evidenced certain staff shortages. Those areas are particularly important. The one about which I was concerned, which had a very limited number of staff involved, was the evaluation of the organisation's programs over the longer term. In other words, we were not effectively undertaking with a large enough number of people the task of reviewing the way in which programs had achieved their objectives in the countries where they were based. It was our view that the organisation ought to look at the way in which its staff is allocated to ensure that sufficient staff are available for that task. We even had the audacity to suggest that there may be areas for rationalisation within AIDAB as to the way in which these extra personnel may be found. One area that we identified, following an AIDAB review, related to the workings of its regional offices in the capital cities of Australia. Significant staff savings had been made there, and it seemed to us, without undertaking a full review, that there may be further savings if other alternatives, which I will address later, were undertaken by the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I want to address relates to other bodies that have not come out of this report so well. The first is the Government. The Committee comments on the level of aid. In commenting on budget matters, the report says in paragraph 6.3:</PARA>
<PARA>As a result, allocation to aid was slashed by 19% in real terms between 1985-86 and 1988-89 as outlined in Table 6.1 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>However, as table 6.1 shows, Australia's aid program bore a disproportionate amount of the burden imposed by the Government's budgetary strategy. This is a bipartisan report, and this was a level of concern felt by all members who participated in this review. I simply draw attention to the following recommendation in relation to Australia's overseas development aid:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the Government implement a policy of rapid growth in Australia's ODA as a proportion of GNP: by 1992 Australian aid should once again stand at 0.5% of GNP. However this growth must be linked to AIDAB's capacity to successfully undertake specific program initiatives of high quality. </PARA>
<PARA>The next matter I want to address relates to the banks, so-called-in effect, major multilateral development agencies-one being the World Bank, as we know it, and the other being the Asian Development Bank. The Chairman indicated that, for his own part, he was not necessarily convinced of the correctness of our recommendation that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should be the Governor on both the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. I would encourage readers to look at pages 70 and 71 of the report to see the comprehensive argument as to why our representative on these bodies, as development agencies, ought to be a person who has a commitment to the development function of those organisations. It is regrettable that the psyche of Treasury, which has a major input to these organisations, is such that the people we recruit to work in these areas are not necessarily asked whether or not they have any knowledge or understanding of how multilateral financial institutions should operate. In fact, on page 72 of the report we find some specific comments made in a submission by a Mr Abbott, a former employee of the Asian Development Bank. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I should have thought that a detailed knowledge of development issues would have been essential for anyone preparing or helping prepare briefings for Australia's representatives on the ADB's board of directors and that a sound knowledge and understanding of how multilateral financial institutions operate would have been at least highly desirable. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee shared Mr Abbott's surprise that these criteria were not considered essential qualifications, particularly when the Committee noted that advertisements seeking to fill positions to advise in this area said that development knowledge was not essential. That says something about Treasury's attitude to the banks. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to draw attention particularly to our comments in relation to the Asian Development Bank. The Committee sought Treasury cooperation in relation to that organisation and, quite frankly, I think the report understates the concern I had about the way Treasury responded to our inquiries. But the comments of the Committee in paragraph 7.53 are damning enough of Treasury's involvement in this area. Any argument that Treasury ought to have policy formulation responsibilities in this area can be seen, by the way in which the Asian Development Bank issue has been handled, as being quite inappropriate. I put that view as strongly and as passionately as I can. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to address two other matters that arise in the report. I am particularly interested in the way in which AIDAB works with non-government organisations. The Committee commends the way in which the organisation has done that over time. It makes this comment, which I fully support:</PARA>
<PARA>The demonstration of public support for NGOs should continue to be an important factor in determining the level of funding for which they are eligible. </PARA>
<PARA>The degree of Australian commitment to organisations ought to be the guiding influence on whether international organisations are going to be effective in the field. In other words, their ability to garner public support ought to be an important guide to government, and I am pleased that the report says that. In relation to the work in regional offices of AIDAB, I observed earlier that we were of the view that some rationalisation could occur and the corollary of that was that some of the undertakings of these regional offices could be taken up by councils for overseas students in the capitals and regional cities around Australia. I draw attention particularly to the Committee's comments on page 95, which draw attention to the way in which AIDAB should act to support and enhance the role of these organisations. The Committee makes the comment that much can be learned from the way in which in other countries, particularly the United States of America, voluntary groups are used to support students in those countries and other individuals visiting those countries. There are valuable suggestions in the report and I am sure the organisation will willingly take them up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to rise in support of the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) and the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) to speak on the report from the subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which has just been tabled. Perhaps I should begin by congratulating my good friend and colleague the honourable member for Prospect on his chairmanship of this inquiry which, as he pointed out in his opening remarks, took 15 months and covered a most comprehensive range of issues. As he said, there have been numerous reports on our aid programs and policies in the past, including one done by the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, which I have the pleasure of chairing. This perhaps is a narrower report than the last couple have been. It is a very workmanlike report and one which has a good deal of value in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The terms of reference have been referred to. They cover the effectiveness of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau as Australia's overseas aid unit, changes in aid policy and management implemented as a result of the report some years ago of the Jackson Committee to Review the Australian Overseas Aid Program; and the appropriateness of the present amount and distribution of the funds Australia spends on aid. I am not planning to go through the recommendations in detail but I want to comment on several points which seem to be important. Like the honourable member for Dundas I not only urge honourable members to read the report but also hope that it will be read considerably more widely. </PARA>
<PARA> A very different picture emerges from this report from that which we brought down last time, in particular in respect of AIDAB. It is pretty clear that AIDAB is now a much tighter, much better organised, better staffed and better directed agency than when we last reported. This is perhaps the recommendation which Jackson made in his original report which has been most effectively implemented and which gives most promise for the future for AIDAB as an organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> A problem arises, however, when one contrasts that rather encouraging situation with the conclusions the Committee arrived at in its third term of reference, namely, aid volume. There has been what can only be called a catastrophic and tragic decline in the volume of aid over past years, which the report documents and refers to. Aid volume has gone down 19 per cent in real terms over the last three or four years. That has had extraordinarily bad effects on the kind of program we are able to operate. It is perfectly true that Australia has a current account problem. This is perhaps one of the major problems we face but when we compare the depth and scale of our problems with those of the recipients of our aid I am pretty sure that the conclusion we must come to is that we can do more. In that respect the last Budget was a step in the right direction-the first step of that kind for some time. The report points the way to how we can gradually but substantially expand our aid volume in future years so that we can once again have an aid program of which this country can be proud. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other points I want to mention. The report is a bipartisan one. There are no dissents from it in spite of the remarks made by the Chairman of the subcommittee. I believe it will be supported on all sides. That is a good thing. In an area such as this I believe we should have bipartisan policies. The second thing which is not widely realised is that our aid program is not a matter of charity beginning at home and ending there. It helps Australians too. I have recently heard some criticism, for example, of the announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) during his visit to South East Asia of his gift of $30m to build a bridge over the River Kwai. I point to the section in the report which outlines the contracts which have been won with support from a very small part of our aid program, called Development Import Finance Facility (DIFF). There one sees, for example, that the firm Transfield Pty Ltd won a contract for a bridge worth $55m in Indonesia with a very small amount of support from the aid program. Later in 1986 it won a contract in Indonesia for more bridges with a value of $143m. Essentially, these contracts mean Australian jobs and Australian companies are kept in business in an area in the world where we need to be competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> The last thing I mention relates to the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). There has been a public debate about the decision by the Government not to support the third replenishment of IFAD. I must admit that I was one of those who believed that if IFAD did not exist it would not have needed to be invented. The evidence brought before the Committee from the public was enough to convince it that a different course ought to be followed. That recommendation is contained in the report. I realise that time has run out for me but I wish to extend the debate so that other honourable members can participate. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the consideration of Committee reports continuing until 11.10 a.m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for this report on this very important area. Development aid is an area in which it is only too easy for cuts to be made. It needs all the support that we can possibly give it. It is important to mobilise that support out in the community, where development aid is often seen to be in competition with urgent social needs within the community. It is very important not only on humanitarian grounds but also to our long term economic and political self-interest that effective programs of development aid be undertaken by the developed, the rich countries. I think President Kennedy once said that we cannot have a peaceful world one-third rich and two-thirds hungry. In the interests of world peace and our long term economic and political benefit as well as on humanitarian grounds it is important that we support this program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to make a few further brief comments. The Committee drew attention to the importance of raising the proportion of Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) that is spent on overseas aid. That is crucial. It is a measure of the priority that we as a country attach to this matter. The Committee mentioned that as a long term objective it could be raised to 0.5 per cent. I think there is a more immediate target to try to raise it to 0.4 per cent. I draw attention to the fact that in 1982-83, the first year that the Hawke Government came to office, that ratio was in excess of 0.5 per cent of GDP. If that ratio had been maintained-in short, if the Government had maintained the priority it attached to this area which it held at that time and if the proportion were 0.5 per cent today-the total aid would be $1.5 billion. It is actually in the order of $1 billion, that ratio having slid to about 0.36 per cent, as was mentioned in the Committee report. If the priority accorded to this area in 1982-83 had been maintained we would now be spending another $500m in this area. I am not suggesting for a moment that we can immediately go out now and spend that sort of additional money in this area, but the priority nevertheless is there. We need to attend to that. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make is that it is very important in addressing this problem that we use the money we do make available in the most effective way. I believe the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau by and large is an efficient agency, but we do need to carry out closer surveillance and assessment of the results of our aid. It was encouraging earlier this week when the House, in dealing with the Bill authorising our replenishment of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), accepted an amendment to the effect that the Treasurer report annually in detail on the effectiveness and work of the bank with a view to this Parliament more effectively considering its allocations of funds in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I have long been an advocate of the importance in our program of encouraging more participation of non-government organisations (NGOs). It has to be recognised that, in the developing countries, there is a very large so-called `informal' or `illegal' sector. It could be, indeed, as much as 50 per cent of the population. Because it is informal, one does not know precisely what the figure is. It is very difficult for official government aid to get through. In this area non-government organisations have a very effective role. I myself am associated with an organisation involved in getting through to these people, in mobilising the energy and dignity of the millions of ordinary men and women in the nooks and crannies of the developing world, assisting in the process of giving them jobs, a chance to earn a living, and dignity and a place in the sun. </PARA>
<PARA> This organisation-Maranatha Trust-makes advances to the poorest of the poor who do not possess the collateral to get an advance from a bank or other such organisation. I believe it is a measure of the success of the program that as these moneys are repaid the repayment rate is in excess of 90 per cent-better than many banks achieve. The program I refer to in the Philippines, when given full effect, will be of assistance to in the order of 500,000 people in this sector. I urge that increasing attention be paid to the role of NGOs in the overseas aid program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the 1980s developing countries have gone through a depression more severe than the industrialised countries went through in the 1930s. Living standards in Africa have fallen by 25 per cent, in Latin America by 12 to 15 per cent, and in parts of southern Asia by between 10 and 20 per cent. In our region there are more people living in absolute poverty than in any other part of the world. Nearly 400 million people live in absolute poverty in South and East Asia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is an attempt to outline an Australian contribution to addressing problems in those countries. There can be no doubt at all that overseas development assistance plays a very important role in reducing poverty and creating the conditions under which those countries are able to develop themselves. Australia has a fine record of aid to overseas developing countries. All our aid is in grant form; it always has been in grant form. None of our aid has been in the form of loans, as is that of most other countries to some extent. We have allowed the quantity of our grant aid to fall from about 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) about four years ago to 0.36 per cent now, as a number of previous speakers have pointed out. That puts Australia well below the average contributions of Western countries. The unweighted average of overseas development assistance of Western countries is 0.49 per cent of their national incomes. We are well below that level. </PARA>
<PARA> The central recommendation of this report is that aid be increased to 0.5 per cent of GDP by 1992. That is an extremely ambitious target but it is one that is commensurate with the seriousness of the problems of poverty and malnutrition, of absolute deprivation, in much of the developing world. Such an increase is consistent with the concerns of any moderately compassionate country. Many Western countries give much more than that, as I have pointed out. If we move back to 0.5 per cent of national income by 1992, we will only then be back at the level of average aid contributions by Western countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The next stage of the recommendation is that it go through the Budget process. I hope that this recommendation will receive much more informed and compassionate attention than it has received in the past from the Department of Finance. In giving evidence to the Committee the Department of Finance showed complete ignorance of the extent of the depression in developing countries. The Finance official simply did not know the degree of the decline of living standards in developing countries. The Department even had the gall to say in the submission to the Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> A question which needs to be addressed is the extent to which the United Nations target for ODA of 0.7 per cent of the donor country's GNP remains an appropriate target for Australia. Countries such as the USA and the UK have been well below this target for some years. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Department is quoting the two meanest countries in the West, the two countries which under the Reagan and Thatcher governments have most reduced their aid. The Department of Finance went on:</PARA>
<PARA> The rationale for Australia to be ahead of such countries in terms of aid effort is not evident. </PARA>
<PARA>When asked on what basis they made that recommendation, they had no basis at all except a simple minded comparison between those two English-speaking countries. Their ignorance was inexcusable. I hope they will read the material now available in this report, take it seriously, and be much better informed in making recommendations to their Minister about the appropriate levels of Australian aid. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also makes a number of other important recommendations about the way aid is delivered. One of the most important conclusions is that the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) has improved the quality of its aid delivery very substantially in the last three or four years. In other words, we can have confidence that if Australia increased the quantity of its aid, such aid would be delivered in a good quality way as well. Another important recommendation is that the level of development education should be built up. It is absolutely essential that the Australian community have a sound basis for understanding what our aid is used for, the extent of the deprivation it is aimed at meeting, and how effective it is in achieving those goals. Already AIDAB's development education effort has been increased and the Bureau has improved the sophistication of that program in a number of very important ways. But development education needs more funds, and that program needs to be greatly extended. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommends that a Minister for development and cooperation be appointed. That would ensure that more attention was given to this very important area of government policy. A number of other important recommendations made by the Committee have already been referred to. I will not go over those except to support strongly our rejoining the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the United Nations Industrial and Development Organisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The inquiry by the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts examined the use of ionising radiation for a wide range of industrial processes but was primarily concerned with the safety of the use of this technology for food irradiation. In addition, it examined in detailed the operations of existing radiation facilities which are used to sterilise medical equipment. The report which is now before the House is the culmination of two years of extensive investigation which resulted in 4,000 pages of oral evidence and many thousands of pages of written submissions and technical documents. Hundreds of petitions from all over Australia containing thousands of signatures were also presented to the House by individual members, indicating strong consumer resistance to irradiated food. In essence, the report concluded that the processing of food irradiation should not be permitted in Australia until such time as adequate research studies have been undertaken which can conclusively show that irradiated food is safe for human consumption and that a routine commercial method of detection of irradiated food has been developed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Food irradiation is a process whereby food is bombarded by highly radioactive gamma rays in order to kill off the insects, bacteria and other micro-organisms which cause food spoilage. The process can be used as a substitution for other methods of food preservation which are considered harmful and is strongly supported by tropical fruit and vegetable exporters in the northern areas of Australia. In contrast, as previously indicated, there has been overwhelming opposition from consumers all over Australia and little interest from food retail organisations. Importantly, whilst not causing food to become radioactive at the levels which would be used, food irradiation does involve the creation of radiolytic substances which could be harmful to humans and which could also cause a loss in nutritional quality of food. It is interesting to note that while some 30 countries have approved the irradiation of at least some foods, only a minute quantity is being irradiated. This fact reflects not only consumer resistance to the process but also the difficulty in translating the results of laboratory studies to a real world commercial situation. In summary, we found the possible application of food irradiation in Australia to be extremely limited and for most, if not all, applications there are effective and more economic alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the concerns of the Standing Committee was that the World Health Organisation is strongly promoting the acceptance of food irradiation in collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Food and Agriculture Organisation, despite the fact that some research studies had cast doubts on the safety of irradiated food. There was also concern that whilst the majority of scientists appeared to accept that the process was safe, some leading scientists continued to submit that the safety of the process had not yet been proven. Accordingly the Standing Committee recommended that the World Health Organisation review existing data relating to the safety of irradiated food, particularly in relation to the impact of food irradiation on nutrients and that the World Health Organisation produce a fully referenced report on the safety of food irradiation and identify those areas where further research is required. </PARA>
<PARA> Another of the main reasons for the conducting of food irradiation inquiries in Australia by both the Australian Consumers Association and the House of Representatives Standing Committee was the fact that, unbeknown to the Australian public, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) had published draft regulations for the introduction of food irradiation in Australia. One of the recommendations of the Standing Committee is that the NHMRC be required in the future to introduce administrative procedures enabling fuller public consultation and participation in the development of food standards regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The report, after describing the manufacturing process of ionising radiation, which has been mainly used for nearly 30 years in Australia for sterilising medical products, detailed the application of the process as applied to the prevention of food spoilage and for food preservation. Individual chapters deal with food safety, nutrition, radiological and environmental safety and food irradiation regulations. Some people may be surprised that, despite the view of the Committee that food irradiation in Australia should not be introduced at the present time, a large number of the recommendations of the Committee deal with food irradiation regulations. The terms of reference of the inquiry required that the environmental impacts and the adequacy of assessment and regulatory procedures also be part of the report. The Committee has accordingly recommended that regulations require minimum and maximum doses to be stated, that it be applied only to specific foods, and that packaging materials be stated and the products clearly labelled. The proposed regulations involve a strict monitoring of each individual food both before and after irradiation is approved, with strict penalties if regulations are broken. The Committee also recommended that radioactive isotopes not be used in mobile irradiators and that caesium 137 be prohibited for use as a general irradiation source. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence received by the Committee indicated that there is no routine test to tell whether food has been irradiated or irradiated in accordance with regulations. Various public health authorities advised that because there were no routine tests, health inspectors would find it extremely difficult to enforce any regulations relating to doses, packaging and labelling. This was of great concern to the Committee. Accordingly, the Committee recommended that approval for food irradiation in Australia should not be granted until such time as a routine commercial method of detection has been developed. This is in line with other governments, including the United Kingdom Government. </PARA>
<PARA> During the inquiry four major areas of concern with regard to the safety of irradiated food emerged. These were: a general concern relating to the manner in which data has been assessed by scientific panels; that products may be formed in the food which may be harmful; that essential nutrients may be reduced; and the effects on micro-organisms, including the enhancements of aflatoxin growth, radiation resistant bacteria and mutations. The Committee accepted that the majority of studies undertaken suggested that the ingestion of irradiated food would cause no harmful effects. However, there are studies which indicate that irradiated food may be harmful in some instances. The Committee also noted the comments, not only by witnesses opposed to food irradiation but also by some regulatory authorities such as the United States Food and Drug Administration, which indicated that many of the earlier studies are inadequate as bases on which to make a judgment either way concerning the safety of irradiated food. In addition, the Committee notes that the International Joint Expert Committee on Food Irradiation, in its various reports, recommended that further studies be conducted. The Committee also noted the arguments of its own expert advisers that animal feed trials would be unlikely to show adverse effects because cells of all living animals have evolved mechanisms designed to protect against the radiolytic products formed in irradiated food. Indeed, one witness stated-and it is a view with which I have some sympathy-that one gets the feeling that all findings which are in favour of the safety of irradiated food are readily accepted without question, while those findings which question this stand are either rejected or viewed with suspicion, either covertly or overtly. </PARA>
<PARA> For the reasons indicated, it is clear that further research into the safety of food irradiation is required. The Committee had particular concern over the nutritional risks of food irradiation. In terms of the wholesomeness of irradiated food, the Committee found that some nutrients were reduced and others were changed in irradiated food but concluded that the significance of these effects could only be determined by an examination of the sources of those nutrients in the diet, and the significance of these nutrients in foods which could be irradiated. Some witnesses stated that the impact of irradiation on the nutritional value of foods for the average Australian would probably be insignificant. This view, however, was based on the assumption that only a few tropical fruits and a limited range of other products would be irradiated. This view did not take account of the fact that various international assessment bodies, including Australia's own National Health and Medical Research Council, had approved the irradiation of an extensive range of foods. </PARA>
<PARA> We also had difficulty with the concept of the average Australian as this concept does not take sufficient account of individual diets and `at risk' groups. The Committee was of the view that there is insufficient firm data on the practical effects of consuming irradiated food to conclude that the nutritional status of the Australian population would not be reduced. This is particularly the case of those at risk groups of Australians whose diets might be nutritionally inadequate, as stated by some expert witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding my own comments on the report of the Committee, I have to say that I found the argument that there is a need to introduce food irradiation into Australia entirely unconvincing. We are fortunate in Australia in having a wide variety of fresh foods available throughout the year. Australia has a strong reputation as a provider of fresh food products for overseas markets, which could be seriously undermined if the process were introduced both internally and for export purposes. There is not a great demand for food irradiation from potential exporters and there is strong opposition to food irradiation from Australian consumers. For all the reasons indicated in the report, and because of the lack of demand for the process in Australia, I am firmly of the opinion that food irradiation should not be introduced into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I end by thanking the members of the Committee for their tolerance and understanding, which enabled the tabling of what I consider to be a most comprehensive and worthwhile report containing recommendations adopted unanimously. Thanks are also due to the Hansard reporters who produced accurate reports of what was often highly technical evidence. I would also like to place on record my appreciation of the assistance given by the Committee secretariat involved in the inquiry-namely, John Cummins, Ron Kropp and Judy Ferris. Finally, I would like to thank those of my colleagues who were not members of the Committee, namely, the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright), for their initiative in bringing the issue to the attention of the Government and assisting in the inquiry. Unfortunately, I have not been given time to deal with all the matters investigated, but I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts, it gives me a great deal of pleasure and pride to commend this report entitled The use of Ionising Radiation which has been compiled by the Committee. I want, first, to recognise the contributions which made this report so valuable a document. I thank the Chairman, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton), for his hard work, his fairness and professionalism as a chairman, and his enthusiasm for the important policy work this Parliament undertakes concerning the environment. I thank the Committee Secretary, John Cummins, his staff and our Committee's scientific advisers for their crucial contribution by way of advice and the man-hours which have gone into the hearings, analysis and drafting connected with this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thank the hundreds of submission writers and witnesses for both the quality of the evidence and the genuine spirit and sincerity which pervaded our consultation work. Honourable members will note that we received hundreds of submissions and witnesses and took over 4,000 pages of transcript. As the Chairman said, this was a mammoth task for the Hansard reporters. This was a thorough and fair exercise in consultation and analysis. There can be no doubt that this Committee and the staff and processes which undergird it are a fine example of how important the Committee system is, and can be, to the decision-making process of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the report. I do not hesitate to identify with this report and its recommendations. It embodies the prudence of political conservatism and the desire of liberalism to maximise informed choice and freedom, which are the foundational political and social philosophies of my Party, the Liberal Party of Australia. It reflects, again referring to these traditions, the commitment of the Liberal Party to government based on the concurrence of the people. Conservatives believe that technological, social and political change should proceed in tandem with and not against the concern and thinking of the community. Liberalism is based on the central principle of the right of each citizen to participate in the decision making of the community. These fundamental philosophies and principles-prudence, informed freedom of choice, and concurrence between government and community-are evident in the report's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> In brief, the Committee wants to see further collection of data and further research, nationally and internationally, concerning the irradiation process. It wants the further development of safety and standards regulation, and further development of practical commercial methods of irradiated food identification and detection. Most importantly, it wants further consultation within and across the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended, in fact, that the use of irradiation for foodstuffs not be approved until these prudent criteria, and these processes designed to ensure adequate information and choice for consumers, are thoroughly met. The report indicates that the vast majority of evidence and scientific opinion supports the claim by proponents of irradiation that it is a safe and efficient form of sterilisation and preservation. The Committee also notes, however, that doubts still remain for some eminent scientists. </PARA>
<PARA> The report notes that much of the information available to the public is inadequate and that, therefore, much public concern about food irradiation is unjustified. It also noted that concerns about irradiation plants and facilities have thus far been totally unjustified. I recall in passing the experience of Committee members at one plant in particular. We witnessed the sterilisation by ionising radiation of medical supplies at levels far above what would be approved for foodstuffs, within 30 seconds or so we handled the supplies and tested them for radiation levels. There was no registration of radiation at all. We then tested the luminous face of one Committee member's watch and the geigercounter made an immediate registration of radiation. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that, on the whole, the community is not aware of the ever-present, normal levels of radiation and is not aware of how exaggerated claims about radiation can be. The Committee, nevertheless, believes that, politically, policy development must proceed no faster than public awareness and public opinion in this area. The Committee notes that there are other forms of food sterilisation and preservation. I refer to chemical substances and the use of systemic poisons, which would not meet the standards in place and suggested by the Committee for food irradiation. That there is an inadequate framework for assessing and controlling those forms of sterilisation does not justify approval for an expansion of that inadequate framework. The Committee, therefore, argues that the burden of proof rests with those who would wish to introduce the process to allay doubts and to provide an adequate system of safety, regulation and information to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the vexed questions of mining, logging and urban development, there is no economic or balance of payments pressure to take into consideration on this environmental question. The Committee notes that there is little demand or need either by producers or by consumers for irradiated foodstuffs. Indeed, there may be a strategic, market oriented case for ensuring that Australian foodstuffs are seen by the international markets to be radiation free. </PARA>
<PARA> That last point is the good news. There are inadequacies to be met concerning the regulation and consumer information framework. The Committee has been advised that there are still serious doubts amongst the majority of Australian citizens concerning food irradiation. Given that there is no compelling or urgent national economic interest in approving the process, I would suggest that the Committee's recommendations are more than reasonable and appropriate. I would go further: I would be deeply concerned if they were to be ignored or rejected. In that situation I would have to consider whether there was some imbalance in the influence which had been brought to bear on the decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report to the House. I finish by noting that there was considerable interest in this report in my own electorate. In particular, strong and well reasoned views were put to me by the Campaign to Ban Food Irradiation through that group's coordinator, Mrs Mountwinter. I thank her and her group for that interest and involvement and commend the report to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start by thanking all the other members of the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. We spent many hours together. We went to many rooms and places all over Australia and we heard many strange tales. However, we sat through them all. I thank them all. It was a pleasure to be part of the preparation of this most important report. I take this opportunity to thank the Committee Secretary, John Cummins, and the staff. John is sitting in the chamber at the moment. His hair has gone grey in the last few months. I do not think the reason was exposure to gamma radiation; I think it was the pressure of producing this report. It was really hard and he did a good job. I thank Hansard and all the witnesses. I would like to thank one witness in particular-George West, the General Manager of Steritech Pty Ltd, which is an organisation that has a radiation plant in Australia. Even though I did not agree with everything he said, he answered all the questions. Throughout the whole of the hearings and our deliberations, he took quite a battering. I give special thanks to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am a bit surprised that my office has not had one request for the report since it was released. Hundreds of people wrote to us, but I am still waiting for a request for a copy. However, we have probably not had a request because of the findings of the report. This also underlines my impression that there was no real need to introduce food irradiation: there was no general call and no real necessity for it. This issue was raised because of the fear that it might be brought in. That is good. We should look at these problems before they happen. The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) kicked it off, but I thank whoever raised the concern initially. </PARA>
<PARA> During the deliberations I tried to be fair and not allow my prejudices and biases to colour my views on the subject. However, they did. In some of my questioning during the inquiry I did ask what would happen to the famous apple if it was irradiated; what would happen to the atoms, et cetera. I felt that this was important. I really cannot feel comfortable with a process that changes the atomic structure of our food by irradiation. I have spoken to many people about the subject and if I have had an irradiated apple and a fresh apple and asked them, `Which one would you eat?', everyone has gone for the fresh apple. There possibly could be in future some need for it-I do not know what the need would be-but somewhere down the track maybe it could be looked at again. The decisions that the Committee has made, which have come out in this report, will be a guideline for many other people looking at food irradiation in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> We must keep an eye on food that comes in from overseas. If we have in a way banned irradiated food in Australia, whatever food we import we must check, to see that it has not been irradiated. As honourable members know from this report, there is no way of knowing whether food has been irradiated or not. I think it is up to people throughout the community, if they see on the back of a package, in small print, a notice that `this food has been irradiated', they should let us know and we can do something about it. At the moment we have enough chemicals and fertilisers and other things in our food that we do not know anything about. If we added irradiation to our food processes, who knows what it would cause. We do not really know enough about it. </PARA>
<PARA> We had scientists come to the Committee with many submissions and I just could not understand them. I am no scientist. I am a turner and fitter. I am the same as anyone else in the community. I am just an average person. We had advisers advising us on these things and they were trying to get it down to a simple language, but it was very hard for them to do that. We saw quite a bit of political in-fighting within the scientific community, which was interesting. I thought it only went on up here in Canberra, but it is alive and well within scientific communities. I suppose that is good. Food irradiation is a process that I personally think we do not need yet. It is a process that we should keep an eye on to make sure that in the future any food coming in from overseas is watched closely. I again thank the Committee. I thank the Chairman and I especially thank the members of the secretariat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the subject of food irradiation has produced more nonsense and more alarmism than just about anything that I can think of. Some of the submissions to the Committee would have us believe that if a food were irradiated it would glow in the dark and persons who ate it would glow in the dark. Unfortunately, some of the impressions being given today are that irradiated food in some way has been demonstrated to be a very dangerous thing. All the evidence that was provable that came before the Committee was very strongly of the view that food irradiation as presently carried out was safe. I do not think anybody should lose sight of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think some of the alarmism that has been generated in the community is quite irresponsible. In saying that I do not say for a moment that food irradiation is in any way the answer to all the problems of preservation of food. It is certainly not, but I do believe that it has some applications at present and may have more applications in the future. There is no great impetus at the moment for it to be introduced into Australia. I understand that and I support it. But to suggest that somehow this mysterious process is inimical in a greater degree than other food preservation processes is really irresponsible and should not be allowed to continue without challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, food irradiation is one of the most widely researched areas, if not the most widely researched area, of food preservation that there has been. It was discovered in 1908. The concept of irradiating food was patented in 1930. In 1963 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States of America gave approval for the treatment of bacon and the decontamination of vegetable seasoning. Over 30 countries have now approved the use of food irradiation, although on a highly selective basis, and so it goes on. In Australia there have been a number of investigations, going back to 1962. So it is a very widely investigated procedure and to suggest somehow that there is still a major area of concern really is not in accord with the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the scientific evidence that came before the Committee was demonstrably nonsense and some of the so-called scientific evidence upon which the opposition to food irradiation was based was blown out of the water by expert advice to the Committee. The facts of the matter are that the standing committee found that there were very widely held misconceptions about food irradiation, about the irradiation process, about the foods it would apply to, about the levels of irradiation to be applied to those foods, about its effect on human health and about environmental impact considerations. Food irradiation of course does have a major consumer acceptance problem. It has also become a politically sensitive issue because somehow people try to tie it in with the debate about nuclear energy, as though there was any real association between food irradiation and the use of nuclear energy in a broader sense. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons the introduction of food irradiation has met considerable resistance and will continue to do so because there will be some elements within the community which, in whipping up the anti-nuclear debate, will use the subject of food irradiation to bolster their case. This is despite support for the process as a safe process by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO); despite the fact that comprehensive scrutiny for over 30 years by respected international scientific bodies has suggested that the process as carried out is safe; despite the fact, as I have said, that there is approval for use with specific foods under controlled conditions by over 30 countries; and despite the fact that there is total rejection by expert scientific bodies of all the totally alarmist claims. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that the majority of scientific evidence presented to the inquiry indicated that food irradiation was safe. Certainly, no scientist is going to say to anybody that he can guarantee 100 per cent that such and such a thing is going to happen. No scientist of proper repute would do so, and because he will not, because he should not, some people suggest that because there is this infinitesimal amount of concern or of lack of certainty, the whole process must be scrutinised again and again and again. The Committee also accepted that most studies showed that irradiated food would cause no harmful effects, but of course, as we have heard, the Committee expressed concern that some studies did indicate possible harmful effects in some circumstances and that some of the earlier scientific studies had been inadequate. We have heard all the submissions to the Committee about free radicals and these sorts of materials in food. People just do not understand that a lot of these substances are produced by the normal cooking processes. </PARA>
<PARA> I really do think it is time-and I am glad that the Committee did it-that we looked at all this material. Hopefully, people will read the Committee's recommendations and the report very carefully indeed, because there is a lot of rejection of some of the most alarmist statements that are continually being made. It is quite proper that consumers should know whether or not food or a component of food has been irradiated. I totally support that. Until there is a sound commercial way in which foods can be tested to show whether they have been irradiated, in my view there is no case for the introduction of irradiated food in Australia. But I would hope that the commercial discovery of a way in which food can be quickly delineated as to whether it has been irradiated will be found, because the process may be a very useful one in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that some of the other means of food preservation and the destruction of insects in grains, spices, fruits and vegetables, which are currently in use, could be far more harmful to human health than would be properly controlled irradiation. I am not suggesting for a moment that all food can be preserved by irradiation. It obviously cannot. But there are some foods which lend themselves particularly to irradiation treatment, and I believe it could be very useful for them so to be treated. But I make the proviso that until there is a readily available, commercially useful way of checking whether food or a component of food has been irradiated, then it should not be introduced in Australia. But for goodness sake, let none of us go around promulgating this alarmist nonsense about the supposed ill-effects of irradiated food as though we are going to glow in the dark if we eat some of this stuff. That is nonsense and it should be put completely behind us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want first to thank the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts for the work it has carried out on this inquiry. Reference has been made to the fact that the inquiry held a large number of public hearings, taking evidence running to over 4,000 pages. During those hearings the Committee was shadowed by some dark operatives from the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), the former Australian Atomic Energy Commission. Their interest in the question of food irradiation I found somewhat fascinating. I was glad I, likewise, had the opportunity to travel with the Committee to hear what evidence was being given. I still remain fascinated by the involvement of ANSTO. Over the 2 1/2 years of my interest in this subject I have found that ANSTO has been more interested in food irradiation than anyone else in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue was first revealed in a public sense on 14 April 1986, when the Australian revealed the existence of a draft model of the regulations that had been prepared by the National Health and Medical Research Council subcommittee, which was called the Food Standards Committee. Prior to that public release I became involved in a rather strange way. I am glad to say that in public life there are public servants with a conscience about things that are going on. I was lucky in that in the old Parliament House a document was given to me and it was suggested that I have a close look at it because it was thought to be rather sinister. I was fortunate in having heard some preliminary information on food irradiation when I was in Washington the previous year, so I was not totally in the dark on the subject. Nevertheless, I followed the matter up as well as the work of the Food Standards Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Through various questions to Ministers-I think some 200-through demands for documents, letters, records and so on we found out a great deal about what was going on. What is really at the heart of the concern of the Australian community is that this was carried out in secret. It was something that was to be imposed on the consuming public. I have no doubts that this was the case. I think it was exemplified by the work of a subcommittee of the Food Standards Committee, a working party the composition of which was rather loaded, shall we say. I was lucky enough to get hold of some of the minutes, which revealed that that working party had determined to prepare one million leaflets for distribution throughout Australia along with 30,000 booklets, and that it was going to do this `as a matter of urgency'. They are not my words, but the words of the working party. It said that it would conduct the work `as a matter of urgency'. That is quite sinister. There is nothing urgent about the matter. The way it went about its work suggests that it was trying to cover up something or impose it on the public before the public could wake up to it. The minutes of the working party also said that it could not address the question of cost because this was a complex subject that could not be answered simply. Later on I will mention something about the costs of food irradiation, which would have to be borne by the consuming public. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad I was actively involved in alerting the public conscience to what was going on. I would like to take this opportunity to quote a statement that I think is very relevant. It would do all members of Parliament and legislators a lot of good to keep this in mind, because we might all learn from it. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> We live in a community becoming more and more nutrition conscious, diet conscious and consumer conscious. </PARA>
<PARA> People today are interested not just in whether something tastes good-or whether the children will eat it: they are interested in whether it is good for them; they are interested in what it has in it. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement comes from a Commonwealth Department of Health publication and I think it says a great deal about today's consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention has been made of the many petitions on this matter which come to most members on both sides of this House. I have reason to believe that the issue has attracted the second highest number of signatures on petitions in recent years. I want to raise a grievance about petitions which I have raised in this House before. I believe very strongly in the system of petitions, which allows the public to express its views in this House. I am very disappointed and, in fact, very angry at the bureaucratic imposition which limits the number of petitions that can be submitted to this House. We receive thousands and thousands of signatures from petitioners but because some petitions are not worded in the correct manner they are not allowed to be presented in this House. I give warning that I will continue to fight-I am sure members on both sides agree with me-to change this stupid bureaucratic decision. I hope the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure will take on board the complaints that I am making and that many others have made. I think it is nothing but bumptious nonsense that the voice of the people cannot be recorded properly in this House because one or two words happen to be out of place. </PARA>
<PARA> During the campaign to try to impose food irradiation on the consuming public I came across a publication, which would probably never have seen the light of day here if the Committee had not undertaken its inquiry, from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna called the Food Irradiation Newsletter. We now make sure that we get each issue of this publication as it comes out. I refer particularly to two items in that publication. The first is called the `Marketing Plan'. This document, as I said, was prepared by the IAEA under a group called the International Consultative Group on Food Irradiation. We managed to get hold of a copy of this 28-page document, which is quite sinister and which shows the international implications of food irradiation and the push that is on to impose it on the public. An article in this document, entitled `Marketing and Communication Guidelines for Acceptance and Usage of Food Irradiation', is very revealing. Its objects are quite clear, and they are to:</PARA>
<PARA> Achieve the approval, acceptance and usage of food irradiation on a worldwide basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The document goes on to talk about how to set up seeding groups, how to influence governments, how to influence decision makers and how to influence trade unions in the food industry. I am quite sure that it caused the IAEA a great deal of embarrassment when we got hold of this document. Its authenticity has been verified. We have raised the matter in the House and finally received documents from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, now known as ANSTO, which revealed that Australia had been involved in this consultative group. I am glad to say that the Government is taking a new line on that issue. Its enthusiasm for the work of the IAEA on food irradiation is on the wane, and so it should be. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to the April 1988 edition of the Food Irradiation Newsletter. On page 54 there is a fairly long article dealing with the International Finance Corporation, which is a branch of the World Bank. The article explains that the International Finance Corporation is interested in setting up food irradiation plants in developing countries. It gives in fairly great detail the costs of such a venture, and what kind of capital is being sought by way of a sponsorship arrangement. It also gives figures for costs of and profits from food irradiation. It is interesting that, once the plant has been set up and is fully operational commercially, and assuming an effective utilisation of 7,500 operating hours per year, the average processing cost of food can range from $1 to $3 per pound. That is interesting and revealing. It is the first time that any assertion about the cost of food irradiation has been put publicly. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important reason for raising this point is that the International Finance Corporation has been under pressure from organisations in Washington which are opposed to food irradiation and which knew of the Corporation's sponsorship of and support for the process. This matter was taken up with the International Finance Corporation. On 4 August 1988, that organisation, in response to the complaints it had received, sent a letter to the joint Food and Agriculture Organisation-IAEA division of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. The letter is very revealing. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this letter is to correct and clarify the position of IFC that appeared in your April 1988 Newsletter with regard to IFC's possible involvement with food irradiation projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement that IFC is ``in principle ready to finance installations of food irradiation facilities in developing countries'' reflects IFC's position as of late 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, IFC has been carefully examining several proposals. As a result of this examination, we have concluded that the issues related to environment, consumer acceptance, and operating safety of food irradiation projects are so complex that it is unlikely that such projects in developing countries will meet our stringent standards. For these reasons as well as business considerations, we are not actively promoting this type of project. </PARA>
<PARA> We would appreciate your publishing in your next available issue of the newsletter this clarification so as to provide to your readers IFC's current position. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter is signed by the Manager of the Technology and Development Unit of the International Finance Corporation. It is one of the most startling and revealing documents that has surfaced during this debate on food irradiation. Clearly, part of the World Bank has realised that the community does not want food irradiation and does not see the need for it, and it now wishes to get out from under. </PARA>
<PARA> Many issues could be raised on this question. Honourable members who have spoken have touched on a range of them, one of them being the question of the loss of nutritional value of food in the irradiation process. That is quite alarming. The Committee has done a marvellous job in this regard. Its public relations exercise in allowing the community to express its views has been excellent. However, the Committee has been operating somewhat in the dark in that it had no evidence as to the loss of nutritional value. I am glad to say that a move has been made to allow the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL) to conduct such tests. A small allocation of money for that purpose has been made available. I understand that ANSTO, through its greed and its rapacious attempts to grab that money, is ripping off the total amount that was allocated to AGAL. It is likely that the report on nutritional value will be less than satisfactory. It is a matter that must be pursued. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that this report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled Use of Ionising Radiation is significant. I believe that it reinforces the role and importance of parliamentary committees. I also congratulate all other members of the Committee. I believe that this report will have a great impact, as have numerous other reports of the Standing Committee. The Committee's terms of reference were, basically, to look at the human health and safety aspects of ionising radiation, particularly its impact on food, the environmental impact and, of course, the adequacy of assessment and regulatory processes. I believe this report is one of integrity. I believe it dispels all the emotion surrounding this subject and refers rationally to technical and scientific evidence. I thank the staff of the Committee, some of whom are present in the gallery today-Mr Cummins, Mr Kropp and Mrs Ferris. I congratulate our advisers-Dr Hall, Dr MacPhee and Mr Robotham. They have given us expert and balanced advice and put in considerable effort to make sure that this report was as technically viable and feasible as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was tremendous interest in this subject. On the one hand, individuals and organisations were naturally concerned about any process that interfered in any way with food. I believe that many of their concerns were not legitimate, and this report signifies that point. On the other hand, a number of regulatory authorities, scientific organisations including the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and other commercial associations, gave evidence-particularly with regard to the horticultural industry, about which I am concerned-that food irradiation was a safe process and could have significant advantages for the industry and the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> While food irradiation is not used extensively worldwide, 30 countries have given approval for the irradiation of some food products. I had the opportunity during this inquiry to visit China and to speak with a number of people who were involved at both a scientific level and a practical level in the process of food irradiation. It does have potential for both domestic and export use in preservation and quarantine purposes in many countries. For instance, in China, one-third of all food produced is spoiled. There is limited transport potential to distribute food throughout that country, and only 2 to 3 per cent of the population have refrigeration available. It is natural that this process, which has enormous potential for preservation of food, has gained widespread experimentation and usage in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> We express a number of concerns in this report. I will not mention those to any great extent because my colleagues have done so. For the information of those people who are listening to the broadcast of this debate, or those who read reports of this debate, I would like to refer to some of the widespread applications that already exist in this country for ionising radiation. There is a wide range of applications. Of course, the medical application is the most significant. This includes the use of X-ray and injected radioisotopes to produce images of bones and organs, and the therapy machines used to control cancer. There are a number of industrial applications, particularly in thickness gauges used for radiographing welds and pipes. This has been used with enormous success and, in many instances, is unique to Australia. Other major uses of ionising radiation are for sterilisation, preservation and disinfestation. The sterilisation of medical and surgical products by the application of ionising radiation is the largest use of this process currently. It has a number of advantages over the other forms of treatment. It permits the sterilisation of heat sensitive drugs. It is used with low melting point plastic articles. It is used extensively in biological preparations. </PARA>
<PARA> Food can be preserved under this process at a much lower dose level than is required for the sterilisation of other products. Irradiation is used mainly to prevent food spoilage by micro-organisms and insects between harvest and eating. Irradiation is important in the disinfestation and conservation of produce and in increasing market value, and helps in compliance with quarantine restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA> I briefly refer to the positive effects of treating food with ionising radiation. There would be an inactivisation of micro-organisms which may contaminate food and cause spoilage. Food-borne pathogenic micro-organisms would be inactivated. Ionisation can delay ripening and inhibit sprouting. This technique is used in many countries, particularly China and Japan, to ensure that the supply of potatoes and onions through the winter is maintained. It can be used for the decontamination of disinfestation of food to combat bacterial yeasts, moulds and insects. I understand that almost all wheat that is imported into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has been irradiated. So the method is widely used. In compiling this report the Committee has ensured that a balance has been brought to all these arguments. The Committee has determined that, while there is no great demand in Australia for the use of ionising radiation in its application to food, it has a potential for preservation and quarantine purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> We do, of course, express a number of concerns, which relate primarily to the safety of the process and to the transportation of any nuclear material that is used in that process. We have discovered a major deficiency in data collection and availability. This particularly relates to the impact on the nutritional value of food. We have a number of doubts about the levels of experimentation and integrity of experiments that have taken place in Australia and throughout the world. We have specifically recommended against the use of caesium 137 in the process. My major concern-and this concern was expressed by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar)-is that this process should not commence until a cheap and routine method of detection and measurement of radiation has been developed. This report strongly recommends that if irradiation is to be introduced in this country, we should have very stringent and effective labelling and packaging techniques. </PARA>
<PARA> This report does not recommend against the irradiation process. It may have widespread significance in the future, particularly as a quarantine measure, and it could provide this nation with the capacity to overcome the tyranny of distance to world markets. This process would allow the extension of the shelf life of a number of products and would be a significant boost to our export potential. I remind the House that this method is already used by a number of our overseas competitors, particularly to tap into the European market. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to one comment made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) about the cost that may be incurred as a result of the irradiation process. Of course there is a cost involved. The Chinese people recognise that in the use of irradiation in their country. But it has the potential to carry products through periods of shortage when supplies would otherwise not be available. Therefore, it can be a hedge in some countries against food shortage. The process would not be used if a commercial decision determined that a product would not improve its attractiveness or that there would be consumer resistance to it. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been a very long and time consuming inquiry. The report has enormous integrity and it is a great base for the future discussion of this process, which is important for medicine and has potential in agriculture, particularly in relation to exports. I recommend the report to the community for reading. I believe that it has dispelled for all time the fear that the use of products from the nuclear industry in the process has the potential to damage or cause harm to people. As with other processes involved in the preservation of food, whether it be cooking, refrigeration or deep freezing, we need to know a lot more about the impact on the nutrients and the quality of the product that is treated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I want to make one brief comment which relates to the comments made by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott). He referred to the problems which the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories might have with regard to costs in its work on the possible loss of nutritional values of irradiated food. I refer to paragraph 6.15 of our report, which states that the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts had been informally advised that the Government had provided funds to enable such an examination to be undertaken by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories. One would hope in those circumstances that the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) would not charge heavily-if at all. I hope that the item that was mentioned by my colleague was inaccurate and that we will find that the money that is made available, by the Government or through very small charges by ANSTO, will enable this very important study to be undertaken by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories into the possible loss of nutritional values of irradiated food.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give him a bit of a serve later on in the session. I have been trying to ask the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) a question in the House for some time now. The question I want to ask does not pertain to Tasmania. That will probably surprise everybody. Maybe I need a packet of Aspros to distribute to wake everybody up again. Recently I went on a trip to the front line states. The trip has become very famous because of certain reports that have been made on it. The Prime Minister would be aware that aid should be directed to the most needy and that we must always make certain that the aid goes to the most needy. During that trip to Ethiopia my colleagues and I came across a refugee camp. We were astounded to find that the number of people in that refugee camp equalled about half the population of Tasmania-about 200,000-and that they were Sudanese. It has left a very indelible mark on my brain. What I saw there horrified me. We read articles and see pictures of things occurring throughout the world and we take it with a grain of salt for a while because it does not really affect us or our family. When we see it at first hand we start to realise that this world is a very miserable one. There were 200,000 people in that refugee camp. It was horrific.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We saw very tall, gaunt and proud people brought down to the lowest common denominator. They were so thin and frail and most of them had been just living there for about three years. I will not go into the reasons why but it is mainly because of civil war. It is because of the inability of the people in Sudan to get on. In fact, they had to flee across the border into Ethiopia from the army that was attacking them. But because of Ethiopia's problems of drought and civil war there were problems there also. The problem was exacerbated by these 200,000 people arriving. I thought to myself, `God, what is going to happen to them?'. Sometimes we begrudge giving aid. We think to ourselves, `Is it going to the right people?'. But if one proportion goes there and saves or helps somebody then it is reaching the right person. I have been trying for a couple of months to ask a question but it is difficult being a mere backbencher. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XD4">Mr GOODLUCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a compassionate man but it is still difficult to ask a question. On 8 March I read an article headed `Warning on Sudan Famine'. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Starvation in Sudan was so severe it might dwarf the misery of Ethiopia's 1984 famine. The Executive Director of Oxfam, America, a very ethical and well organised organisation said yesterday, `A million people had died since 1983 in a famine created by a civil war in which both sides had prevented food from reaching starving people'. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, we have had a civil war and in between we had these starving people. Of course, it has reached the astronomical number of a million people. It has been mentioned that genocide is occurring in Sudan. It has been mentioned that some of the scenes there are absolutely horrific. I suppose it is difficult for us to send a delegation to Sudan or Ethiopia once again. A fact finding mission is fine but we do not have very much time. I think it would be extremely beneficial for us if we were able to send an organised group there just to determine what the problems are and what can be done to help them and to make absolutely certain that the aid that we give is appreciated. People in Australia are very compassionate; they like to give to a very good cause. If they knew the circumstances first hand-if they knew that people from Australia had been there to determine the extent of the situation-I am sure that they would give and give freely. We need to know. There are a lot of mixed up situations in Ethiopia. It has a terrible civil war. Sometimes we wonder and put a question mark in our minds about the army in Ethiopia, which is larger than the army in Australia. There have been very contentious debates about where the aid is going. I for one would like to be absolutely certain that the aid goes to the right people, in particular to those who really need it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will move to another compassionate matter for a few minutes. It is something that worries me particularly. We are opening a tennis court at Parliament House today. That is fine. A lot of people might not realise it but I was a sportsman once upon a time until I got old and decrepit. Now I am just a great politician. I love sports and love to see openings of tennis courts and sporting facilities in Australia but sometimes I think that far too much emphasis is being placed on sporting facilities and not enough emphasis on some of the homes that are urgently required for the elderly of Australia. I talk in particular about Alzheimer's disease. I will refer to Tasmania because I know what goes on in that State better than anywhere else. In Hobart at the moment we have people selling buttons on street corners. They are elderly people. Some of them are wives of men who have Alzheimer's disease and they are trying to put a bit back into the community by helping. They are trying to get facilities to help their husbands or wives who might have the disease. I think there is not enough emphasis or assistance given by governments. I am not being critical of this Federal Government. It is also the State governments and local authorities which are to blame. Not enough help and assistance is going into helping these particular people. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, we could all be confronted with the disease. It does not just affect people aged 75 or 80. It is touching people of 50, 55 and 60 years of age. It is an unknown disease that some have said is even larger and bigger than the acquired immune deficiency syndrome epidemic in this country at the moment but it is not as contentious or controversial an issue in the press. It is taken for granted that a person can be struck down with it and all of a sudden placed in an institution and forgotten about. I firmly believe that we need to do more about it. I know my good friends here, and those sitting opposite too, would agree with me. It is great going to the opening of a sporting facility and having a plaque put up with the words `Opened by Bruce Goodluck in 1989' but I would like to go far better and open a home for people with Alzheimer's disease with my name on it where people are going to be looked after. I would feel far prouder and it would be far better for me than going to the opening of a sporting facility. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not going to the opening of the tennis court here today. That is not being critical. Somebody said to me that this is an expensive place. I think I made a quip off the top of my head and said that it is only worth one and a half submarines or something like that. We will always be the centre of controversy up here. People will say that we are wasting money. I do not want to exacerbate that by using the tennis courts as an example. I heard over the air that it is being opened and I thought to myself, great, it is good for us and it is good for the people who come here. It would be far better if that money was being directed elsewhere. That is just an example; I am not being critical. </PARA>

I can tell by the eyes of the Canberra people at the table. They sort of glared at me and I knew I was wrong. It was about 58c a litre. In the Canberra Times-I have no reason to refute the Canberra Times-an article appeared headed, `The benefits of shopping around: about $7.50 a week'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to take advantage of the grievance debate to raise in the national Parliament the plight of some of our greatest national assets-Sydney's beaches. It is about time, in my view, that we in the Federal sphere of government became involved in what is a national disgrace-the pollution of our national pride, Sydney's beaches. Everywhere I go as the member for Phillip I identify myself and my electorate with Bondi. Over the years I have got angry and defensive when the name Bondi has triggered the response `sewage' and people have put their fingers to their nose. I have jumped to the defence of the beach I love and the beaches in my electorate that I love. I have been right to defend Bondi. For a start it is almost always cleaner than many of the other beaches. During this season's carnivals in January and February it looked absolutely marvellous and was covered with people swimming and having a great time. But now I am angry and I am ashamed. It is obvious that there is a serious problem of pollution and all our beaches are under threat, even Bondi.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For years we have been conned. We have been conned by the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board, conned by the State Pollution Control Commission, conned by the experts. Even the politicians have been conned. Jack Ferguson, a former Minister and Deputy Premier in the Wran Government, said that he was given the same rosy picture as the public. The public, of course, was not told the facts. Even the current Minister, Mr Tim Moore, appears to have had a great deal of trouble squeezing results from the Water Board. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Sydney Morning Herald revealed in articles this week:</PARA>
<PARA> A cosy relationship between the Sydney Water Board and the State Pollution Control Commission has been instrumental in making the city's beaches unfit for swimming and contaminating the marine food chain. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Herald investigations into the environmental scandal of the beaches leave the two bureaucracies, either singly or in concert, accused of having:</PARA>
<PARA>fixed pollution standards at levels which the SPCC knew to be unjustifiable but which suited the Board;</PARA>
<PARA> consistently understated the health risks of swimming at our beaches and used measurement criteria which both knew to be hopelessly inadequate;</PARA>
<PARA> secretly dumped thousands of tonnes of highly-toxic sewage sludge into Sydney's waters despite warnings of abnormalities in marine life;</PARA>
<PARA> tried to shift the blame for what has happened on to the public. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Throughout the shambles, the two organisations have condemned all opposition. They have kept from the public not only internal reports which seriously questioned their policies but also alarming scientific research. </PARA>
<PARA>Throughout that time they have been spending a fortune on glossy advertisements in magazines and newspapers, assuring us that everything is all right. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been involved with many experts in the great environmental issues over the years. I always quote the record of the asbestos companies when experts are mentioned. As part of the fight on environmental issues throughout Australia, we have had to get the facts. We have fought to save the Franklin in South-West Tasmania; to save the rainforests in New South Wales and Queensland; to save Kakadu in the Northern Territory; to try to save the Great Barrier Reef from overdevelopment, although I do not think we are really succeeding. And we have fought to save Bondi and Coogee from high rise development. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of Save Our Bondi when we were fighting against the proposed developments, I always claimed that Bondi belonged to everyone, that we local citizens had to save and protect Bondi because we had a duty of care to all Australians. We won that fight. We saved Bondi from the developers, and the new council is getting along with some excellent programs. Now I am asking all Australians to help us save our national asset. When I talk about Bondi, of course, I think of all our beaches. As I have said so proudly for so long, Bondi just happens to be the most famous and still the most breathtakingly beautiful. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a national disgrace to foul our beaches and it is a national responsibility for us to be involved in protecting them. First we have got to have some honesty. There have been all sorts of deceptions, deceptions by the authorities, deceptions by those politicians who want to protect tourism and local businesses, which naturally suffer. The impact on tourism of this potential disaster is incalculable. We cannot protect all businesses any more. Today we hear that fish sales have gone down by 30 to 40 per cent. That is half a million dollars a week. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is another sort of deception. It is a deception I get involved in. It is hard for us who live in Bondi to believe pollution is occurring. Some of us steadfastly refuse to believe it. We just do not want to believe it is as bad as it might be. I do it myself all the time. Every time I want a swim, I will use any excuse to pretend it is all right. I ask my own experts, the lifesavers. If the members of the surf clubs say it is okay, I will go in the water. The surf club members are the most handsome, fittest people I know, especially those who have been swimming at Bondi for years and years. I will keep going in for a swim if they do. They are the experts I trust. Like those who swim 365 days a year and remain fit and healthy, I will keep going. I am lucky: I am fit and I love the sea. I go there to feel good. But some people go there and get sick. If I pretend there is absolutely nothing wrong or that the water is perfect, I am as irresponsible as the authorities who have deceived us for years. </PARA>
<PARA> If I look at Bondi on a good day when it is crystal clear-and there are plenty of those good days-and if I turn my gaze from the brown stain heading for Bronte and Coogee, I would be as one-eyed as the company executives at Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd, surrounded by Kakadu National Park, who stand with their backs to the harsh ugliness of the mine, look across the tailings dam to the beautiful Mount Brockman escarpment in the background and claim that the dam is like a lake enhancing the landscape. Of course, Ranger's biggest problem-unsolved as yet-is waste. And that is what the problem at the beaches is all about-a different sort of waste. </PARA>
<PARA> If I claimed there was nothing wrong, I would be like the Queensland Government putting roads through the rainforest, in its words, `so more people can see it', and thereby destroying the forest itself. I would be like Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd at Coronation Hill, saying that the Alligator Rivers catchment area will not be harmed by anything it might do. I will not be like that. There is a problem and we have to face up to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason there should be hope for Bondi-and for Mackenzies, Tamarama, Bronte, Clovelly, Coogee and Maroubra and for Manly and the northern beaches-is that in this struggle for the environment there is no conflict with a profit making body which claims it is necessary to inflict damage for an alleged benefit. There is no profit for anyone in any of this destruction. The only enemies in this battle are dishonesty and lack of will. It is too late for us to pretend ignorance. That was only the result of the authorities' dishonesty and our loyalty anyway. Now even the Water Board is saying it will give Sydney the whole unpleasant truth. It is a bit late, but honesty will be a great help in solving this problem, and lack of will can be overcome if all levels of government-Federal, State and local-make an effort to cooperate. </PARA>
<PARA> Until now the Federal Government has been left out. Some years ago I wanted to propose an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. But when we looked into it, all responsibility in that area lay with the State and local governments. A sewage summit was held in Waverley a couple of weeks ago. I was not invited because, apparently, nobody thought it had anything to do with the Federal Government. Senator Richardson said recently that he had received no requests for Federal assistance from the States-certainly not from New South Wales. Perhaps in New South Wales people are still too confused trying to work out the facts and options after years of misinformation. I certainly hope political motives are not involved, even though Tim Moore said that if the Federal Government became involved it would only be for votes. </PARA>
<PARA> What can the Federal Government do? It is true that it has no legal responsibility at the moment. Some say it has no power to act. Perhaps it has the power somewhere, but there is no legislation it can use to intervene. Stop the Ocean Pollution says we should enforce the 1975 London Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. That convention does not cover land-based outfalls and our legislation simply enacts its protocol. I am advised that we cannot extend it to cover land-based outfalls such as pipelines without involving the Federal Government in every land based water management process, every outlet, every stormwater drain, but it should not be beyond the ingenuity of our legal and constitutional brains to work out the powers to allow us to intervene through legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other way the Federal Government can be asked to help is financially. At this stage nobody can be certain that any money handed to the States will be used in a way that will solve the problem. The record is not too good. Too much money has been spent wrongly already. Bob Carr said he thinks there can be cooperation. Waverley Council thinks there can be cooperation. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has some good answers. Perhaps the Commonwealth Government's most important role right now is to acknowledge that the problem is everyone's problem. It is a national disgrace, so it is a national responsibility to be involved. Perhaps we can initiate the cooperation that is needed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to focus attention during the minutes at my disposal on the plight of Australian families. The present Government has told us that it is contemplating providing tax cuts. I want to say again what I have said earlier this year, that tax cuts for the needy should take priority over tax cuts for all. The needy, on my definition, are Australia's families, families supporting dependent children, families supporting dependent spouses and dependent children, and families supporting only dependent spouses. It is those families, whatever their level of income, who are in great need. Some are in real need; some are in comparative need. The components which provide tax relief for families have declined in real value during the period of office of the present Government. The incomes of taxpayers with dependants-those with dependent children, those with dependent children and spouses, and those with dependent spouses alone-have fallen. The tax brackets have not been adjusted during the term of office of the present Government. The effect of this bracket creep is that the standard rate of tax of the Fraser Government of 30c in the dollar on every dollar earned by the great majority of the full time work force has been increased by a massive 33 per cent to 40c in the dollar. More and more of Australia's full time work force in the lower paid categories are now finding that their nominal income is taking them into that 40c tax bracket. The spouse rebate has not been adjusted, so those who are supporting spouses, particularly those caring for children, have been given no real relief. In fact, the real tax burden on those families has been increasing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The family allowance has also not been adjusted for six years. Indeed, the family allowance for many families has been taken away. The social security system is totally inadequate in its recognition of the role of families in the support of dependants. Even when the components which provide tax relief for families were at their maximum levels, they were inadequate. They were a token gesture. The amounts set were unrelated to a proper assessment of the impact on a taxpayer's reduced capacity to pay tax due to the costs of supporting children and dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week the Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS) produced a very interesting bulletin called Families and Tax in 1989. It raises some issues which we in the Opposition have raised over recent years. But it is inadequate; it does not go far enough. It is unduly influenced by the policies and stated objectives of the present anti-family Labor Government. In this regard it fails to identify the full extent of the need of taxpaying families for tax relief in respect of the children they support. It fails to acknowledge the cost of supporting a dependent spouse. Though it talks of the importance of equity, it makes no attempt to develop proposals which reduce the tax burden to a level which takes account of the costs borne by taxpayers in supporting dependants as compared with the burden imposed on taxpayers with no dependants. Some of the assumptions upon which its argument is premised are based on prejudice. Some of the assumptions are not even stated. Those which are expressed are often not adequately justified. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with family allowance, the AIFS points out that it is the major policy measure that recognises the reduced capacity of people with children to pay tax because of the expenses involved in raising children. The Institute of Family Studies says it is appropriate to regard this as part of the tax system and that it should be reviewed as a negative tax payment. It should not be regarded as a welfare payment. However, it points out that the rationale of making payments to all families has not been fully understood by some and sometimes is not agreed to at all. I draw to the attention of the House that Dr Cass in the Social Security Review paper, which was brought out last year, expressed the view that family allowances should be universally available to all families. The AIFS supports that view and says that such allowances should be paid to all families in order to achieve horizontal equity, so that families with the same level of income should get tax relief, if they have children, greater than the tax relief that is provided to families or individuals with a similar income but not supporting dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> The AIFS points out that family allowances for those receiving them have fallen 43 per cent in real terms, but it fails to evaluate the appropriateness of the level at which they were originally set. The rationale for family allowances and the family income supplement is that low income families should not be worse off than those families on unemployment benefit. Surely, the amount of family allowance and family income supplement is the extent of the impact on the capacity to pay tax due to the cost of children in not only low income families but all families. My view is that the universal family allowance that is being advocated by the AIFS should not be limited to a mean $10 a week but should, in the case of children under 13 years of age, be of the order of $31 a week and, in the case of children over that age, $41 a week, so that all families can achieve a proper level of horizontal equity between taxpayers who are supporting dependent children and those who are not.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1984 the AIFS published a paper entitled Cost of Children in Australia. It offered for the first time a systematic estimate of what it costs for Australian children to be fed and clothed at a basic level. In this report, Kerry Lovering points out:</PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that these figures do not include costs of housing (mortgages, rents, rates), transport, school fees or uniforms, child care, holidays (in the case of low-income families), medical or dental expenses. In the case of low-income families the figures are a basic survival costing only.</PARA>
<PARA> Attempts have been made to quantify the direct costs of children while recognising that the indirect costs of children may have an even greater impact on one or both parents. </PARA>
<PARA>The Institute is inclined to agree with the argument that family allowances should reflect the direct cost of children and that family rebates should reflect the indirect costs of children. This is essentially because it sees that the direct costs of children can be justified by achieving horizontal equity. To ensure horizontal equity, it acknowledges the direct impact of the costs of the support of children on a family's real income and that this impact should be recognised by a universal provision in the tax transfer system. I urge the Government to reintroduce a universal family allowance, but I urge it to do so at the real cost, not accepting the somewhat irrational justification of the Institute of Family Studies for the low figure of $10 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the options are. There are experts who say that there are such things as equivalence scales; that it costs approximately 20 per cent of the cost of maintaining a couple at a basic level to look after children. What the Institute of Family Studies suggests is that the tax threshold for a couple should be $12,373. It then takes 20 per cent of that and, instead of saying that 20 per cent of that figure should be paid by way of universal family allowance, it discounts it to 22 per cent of that figure. It is crazy to suggest that families could support children on 22 per cent of 20 per cent of the cost of supporting a couple when expert evidence and the Lovering report indicate that the figure for supporting children should not be $10 a week but of the order of $30 to $40 a week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Saturday I had the pleasure of attending the official opening of a new service for the intellectually disabled within my electorate. It was the opening of an adult training centre in the suburb of Lawnton in the Pine Rivers shire. The building became available to the Endeavour Foundation, which is the service provider, due to the decision of the Queensland Government to assume total responsibility for the education of intellectually disabled children. The Carawartha site up to that time was a special school run by the Endeavour Foundation. It became vacant at the end of last year, and the Endeavour Foundation has decided to pilot a new adult training centre program in the building.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The grievance that I wish to draw to the attention of the House today is the decision of the Department of Community Services and Health not to fund the Carawartha Centre. I will also touch upon the difficulties that the Endeavour Foundation has experienced since the enactment of the new Disability Services Act. I doing so, I make it quite clear that I do not support the views expressed by my colleague the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) almost one year ago when he spoke about the Endeavour Foundation in a grievance debate in this House. At that time, the honourable member for Petrie attacked Endeavour's attitude to the new disability services legislation. He also attacked Endeavour's financial priorities and some of its service models and outcomes. My experience has been quite to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Endeavour Foundation has a very real and true commitment to the disability services legislation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member points out, it is a good organisation. It has a real commitment to the legislation. I will quote one of the board members, Mr E. C. Baston, when discussing the impact of the legislation. He said that the legislation is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . a piece of enlightened legislation and provides the statutory vehicle for handicapped persons to achieve their full potential and an enhanced quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no dispute between this Government and the Endeavour Foundation about the Disability Services Act. Unfortunately, there is dispute between the Endeavour Foundation and the Department of Community Services and Health about the implementation and the objectives and principles of the particular legislation. The problem lies in the different interpretations which officers within the Department have given over a period of almost two years. For instance, in October 1986, when the new service types under the legislation were first described in document form, this document together with discussions with departmental officers led Endeavour to think that its existing services, with some minor modifications, would certainly be funded under the new legislation. However, by February 1987 this advice had been reversed. It was declared that its existing service types would not be funded. </PARA>
<PARA> In May 1987, the then Australian Director of the Department, Dr Madden, stated that the types of services currently provided by many sheltered workshops, such as those run by the Endeavour Foundation, could be funded under the category of `supported employment' under the new legislation. These contrary messages which have been coming out of the Department have caused a great deal of concern not only for Endeavour in terms of a corporate entity of board members and management but also for the families of the adults and children that have been cared for by the Foundation for decades. Unfortunately, the real problem is the concern being caused to those families. I am not interested in pushing Endeavour's barrow; I am interested in pushing the barrow of those families and those disabled Australians who need service providers such as Endeavour and that need to be adequately looked after under the new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In my opinion, this centre does fall within the spirit and, indeed, almost the letter of the disability services legislation. The philosophy behind that legislation was summarised by the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, when he addressed the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled convention in Melbourne on 10 November 1988. Looking at part of the Minister's speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> In formulating our policy, we all agreed that services for disabled people should be responsive to each person's ability rather than their disability; that they should develop people's strengths, rather than concentrate on their weakness. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We want residential services and living skills services to operate in a environment which as closely as possible mirrors the mainstream of life in which people are constantly learning and adapting to new situations, making difficult personal decisions and exercising choice and independence with the assistance and advice of people they trust. </PARA>
<PARA>They are, of course, fine words and words on which I do not think there is any disagreement from members in this House, and certainly not from the Endeavour Foundation. The difficulty is in taking those words as embodied by the legislation and actually getting a service on the ground, a model that fulfils those aims. In the particular case of the Carawartha Centre, we have an existing facility. Admittedly it was designed as a school, but the infrastructure is there. It is lunacy, in my opinion, to say that this centre cannot be used in order to impart living skills because it is not a community based model; it is not a nice home in a leafy suburb where there are only four or five people in there and one can go in and in an environment as close as possible to that of a normal home learn the skills. What is being taught in this particular adult training centre is exactly the same as what would be taught in that community based model-that is, the independent living skills, the ability to deal with things such as public transport; simple things, such as being able to prepare one's own meal, being able to handle those everyday decisions and cope with those everyday situations which the rest of us who are fortunate enough to have our full faculties just take for granted. </PARA>
<PARA> If those skills are being imparted by the centre and if the people there are able to have a more fulfilled life, are able to enjoy their life more fully and move out into the broader community as a result of the skills which they have been taught by this centre, then why in heaven's name can it not be funded? At the moment the yearly operating cost of the centre is something in the order of $80,000. Under the general scheme of things the Commonwealth could be expected to pay a proportion of that by way of subsidies for salaries. Currently, because of the Department's decision, the Government is not picking up any of the tab and the cost is being borne entirely by the Endeavour Foundation. Endeavour is a large organisation and it can bear that cost. It can bear it in terms of the centre at Lawnton, but it is trying to pilot a similar centre now at Newstead and at other centres throughout Queensland. It simply cannot do it without some form of government assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> Who loses if no funding is made available? Does Endeavour lose? It does not really matter to Endeavour; it already has established service models and a well-developed program. Those who lose are the individuals involved-the individuals missing out on that particular service, the individuals missing out on the opportunity to have their lives enhanced. If there is stubbornness on the part of Endeavour I certainly do not support that in any form, but I think there is a responsibility on the part of the Department and a responsibility on the part of the Minister to make sure the difficulties that have been experienced over the last two years are overcome and that some position can be reached with Endeavour so that services of this type are indeed funded. </PARA>
<PARA> There is hope on the horizon, I am able to report. We are currently awaiting a report of two working committees about eligibility criteria and the sheltered workshops which are run by the Endeavour Foundation, to see how they can be funded and what modifications are needed. I believe that if Endeavour were given clear guidelines on exactly what changes it had to make, it would make those changes. It is not trying to be obstructionist; it is trying to accommodate. I believe it deserves the support of this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) on what was an excellent speech. There is not the slightest doubt that services to our aged and disabled have deteriorated rapidly, and I believe that reflects a general lack of commitment by this Government and its bureaucracy. I want to refer to similar types of problems. There is no doubt that during the past six years living standards in this nation have declined markedly and the average Australian family has been squeezed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nothing has contributed more to these falling living standards than the reduced effectiveness of our public services and the management and distribution of health services and policies. Medicare has been a financial disaster and has thrown public and private hospital administration into chaos. Waiting lists at public hospitals are still a national disgrace. It is not, of course, the well-off in our community who are hurting but the poor and the underprivileged. Medicare has placed additional strains on an already stressed public hospital system by discouraging the use of private hospitals. Not only does Medicare reintroduce the unfortunate concept of so-called free public hospital treatment without income or means test, but it also loads the dice heavily against private hospitals competing for privately insured patients. There are heavy disincentives against private hospitals in the proposed insurance and subsidy arrangements, which have encouraged State governments to pursue their own vendetta against private hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer particularly to the bush nursing hospital system in Victoria, a system developed as a result of great strength and strong leadership in rural communities which through selfless service and the generosity of local communities built and maintained highly regarded hospitals with competent local staff. There are a large number of these hospitals in Victoria, with a bed capacity approaching 900. They are community owned, are non-profit organisations and yet are categorised as private hospitals and therefore must be self-supporting. Patients unable to afford both the taxation levy and private insurance are bypassing their local hospital and, with the penalty of time, expense and risk, are travelling to public hospitals long distances from their own district. </PARA>
<PARA> What therefore is loudly hailed as a universal health scheme cannot be used by those who need it most at their own community hospital. The prime purpose of community health service delivery is being destroyed. The availability of a local hospital has a large social and economic bearing on a rural community as a whole. It maintains services so necessary for doctors, for ambulances and for chemists and, with the excellent expansion of aged persons facilities during the past decade, facilities for the full range of health needs of our ever increasing aged population. The Government's answer is to rationalise and regionalise the system-in fact it has simply been a reduction in services-and penalise those most in need and those most isolated. Today we have a health system that is not designed as a health delivery system but as a financial system. We have reached a position where the very future of health services is under threat. We have a hospital system desperately struggling for survival and we have a system where the Government's cry for social justice in so many areas is becoming a farce. </PARA>
<PARA> Last month in my electorate, at a town called Warracknabeal, we heard of a tragic story for a number of hospitals of rising costs and falling revenues. Representatives from hospitals outside my electorate, in Avoca, Pyramid Hill, Korong and Merino, as well as all the hospitals in my electorate, attended this meeting. Later on that month there was a public meeting at Murrayville, in my electorate, on the South Australian border, and 240 people attended in an effort to stem the financial haemorrhage and maintain a satisfactory level of service. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this Government and the Victorian Government in particular are trying to eliminate bush nursing hospitals, depriving lifetime residents of their rightful chance to use their local facilities. I believe they are giving impetus to the loss from our district of young families and young people who need these essential services. I believe that in some communities in my constituency and in others in Victoria up to 70 per cent of residents are dependent on welfare but of course, with the way the system is administered, they are prevented from admission to their community hospital. Of course the Government is stopping the payment of private insurance payments for long term patients at these hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> We must remember that in some of these more rural and isolated areas people are huge distances from facilities. If the people of Murrayville, for instance, lose their hospital-and there is a very real reason to believe that may occur if something is not done in the next week or two, as they have a $70,000 overdraft all of which is the responsibility of the local community-they will have to travel at least 110 kilometres, from Murrayville to Ouyen, to receive medical and health services. Yesterday, here in the Parliament, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) was concerned that people in the western suburbs of Melbourne had to travel to the eastern suburbs to universities. Of course this is a real problem, but at least those people are only about 20 miles from the university and have a satisfactory rail system to get there. These people in Murrayville are at least 110 kilometres from their local hospital and have no public transport whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> The most disappointing thing about the closure of bush nursing hospitals is that over the years these hospitals have survived almost entirely on community support, relieving government and taxpayers of their expense. I believe the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) must immediately introduce tax deductability for private insurance and he must immediately remove the Medicare levy from those people who do not have a public hospital facility. He must immediately allow a change to the system of categorisation that would allow bush nursing hospitals to take public patients. In the face of growing community and industry concern about the inability of insurance funds to cope with rising costs and declining membership, I think the Minister also has an unequivocal duty to state clearly whether all funds are complying with the statutory reserve requirements designed to guarantee settlement of contributors' claims. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue in one of crisis and I believe nothing better indicates that than an editorial written in the Horsham newspaper, the Wimmera Mail Times, on Monday, 20 February 1989, commenting on both the meeting in Warracknabeal the previous day and subsequent meetings in Murrayville. The editorial is headed `Bush nursing hospitals face crisis', and reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The time for straight talking by federal and state governments on the future of bush nursing hospitals is well past. Health ministers continue to hedge and cower from any kind of commitment to or against the bush nursing system, now in the throes of a desperate struggle for survival. </PARA>
<PARA> If the federal Health Minister Dr Blewett and his Victorian counterpart Mrs Hogg believe there is no place for bush nursing hospitals in the Australian Labor Party health strategy, so be it. But let them come out and say so. Bush nursing communities would then at least know where they stand. </PARA>
<PARA> The current process of attrition, of wearing down by ruthless, regulatory process, is brutal, immoral and a travesty of human rights. The government is saying it does not recognise the need of people who, because of circumstances or choice, live in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA> Simply, the Federal Government wants to knock the bush nursing system out of existence. It refuses to allow the hospitals to accept public patients, and forces people who wish to use their own community hospital to be doubly insured-by compulsory Medicare levy and private insurance. They are denied a tax deduction for their private cover. </PARA>
<PARA> If the bush nursing system collapses there will be chaos in health care. Public hospitals will have no hope of providing the extra beds. </PARA>
<PARA> The urgent need is a policy statement from Dr Blewett and Mrs Hogg. Do they really want to force bush nursing hospitals to the wall? And how do they plan to cope with the demand on centralised hospital facilities and medical staff?</PARA>
<PARA>I am seeing the Minister at 9 o'clock tonight and I hope that he will recognise this need and do something urgently with his Victorian counterpart to ensure this vital health service remains for rural Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most honourable members will have heard reports of Australian travellers who kiss the soil of Australia on their return. It is not uncommon for Australians visiting foreign lands to be told that the present standard of living in Australia is the envy of the world; to be told that our way of life, our freedoms, our security, our unlimited opportunities have made Australia a sanctuary of civilisation. These are the attributes that spur more than one million foreign people each year to inquire about migrating to Australia. There are other observations to make about Australia in 1989. Despite Australia's wealth and its allure to the rest of the world, we still face great challenges. I do not only mean the challenge to ensure that Australia is secure militarily, but also the challenge of building a strong Australia, economically and socially. These challenges can only be met by a nation united, not a nation divided; by a nation that is led by a united government, not by a divided government. For six years Australia has been led by a united government-a government whose policies have given certainty, consistency and security; a government whose aim has been to achieve economic reconstruction, national cohesion and practical cooperation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Later this year, or early next year, there will be a Federal election. The people of Australia will exercise their constitutional right to re-elect the Hawke Government. They will have compelling reasons to do so. Memories of the failures of the Fraser-Howard years will, with absolute certainty, direct them well away from the future Australia re-visited by a Howard Government. I will make some brief observations why the Hawke Government will continue to enjoy the overwhelming support of the Australian people at the next election. I turn first to industrial relations. A great deal of credit for Australia's vastly improved industrial relations during the almost six years of Labor Government is due to the successful operation of the prices and incomes accord. Honourable members will recall that an average of 249,200 working days a month were lost in the period January 1976 to February 1983-that is, the period under the Liberal-National Party Government. From March 1983 to October 1988, an average of 120,000 working days were lost each month. Under the Hawke Labor Government there was a 52 per cent drop in working days lost compared with the wasteful record of the Fraser-Howard Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Independent research by Beggs and Chapman from the Australian National University concluded that the Hawke Government's consensus based incomes policies have contributed to reducing the levels of industrial disputation in Australia. The study estimated that, after adjusting for changes in economic conditions, strike activity during the accord period 1983-1987 was 82 per cent lower than for the Liberal-National period 1964-1982. Is it any wonder, therefore, that effective productivity of the nation's capital stock has enjoyed good results? For example, between 1982-83 and 1987-88 output per unit of real capital stock in Australia increased by 6.6 per cent. Honourable members will compare that increase of 6.6 per cent in five years with the 6.7 per cent decline in capital productivity recorded over the preceding five years, 1977-78 to 1982-83-that is, when the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Commonwealth Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition condemns the accord. The Liberal-National Party's policy document Future Directions, or, as it is more widely known across the nation, `Futile Diversions', calls for a return to the values of 30 years ago-the era of division and disruption-with its constant strikes and loss of production in manufacturing industry. The Australian people do not want back to future policies. They want policies, they support policies, that are certain, consistent, predictable and successful. The Hawke Government's policies on industry development have brought about an attitudinal shift on the part of industry, unions and government-for industry, an emphasis on innovation, productivity and enterprise, for unions, a recognition of the need to increase employment by freeing up industry and modernising work practices, and for government, constant reappraisal of policy to enhance the overall productive capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> The results of these initiatives are there for all to see. For example, in the manufacturing industry between 1982-83 and 1987-88 production grew by 16 per cent, investment grew by 23 per cent and exports grew by 45 per cent. Between 1981-82 and 1986-87 research and development in manufacturing grew by 100 per cent in real terms. These achievements are unprecedented in Australia's history. We will not find the recipe for these achievements in the empty manifesto of the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Educating Australia and reskilling Australia are fundamental to our economy and our social cohesion, and for every Australian to provide the path to fulfilment as a productive citizen. Despite its best efforts, the Fraser-Howard Government failed to have more than just over one-third of young Australians stay on to year 12 at school in 1982. After just six years under the Hawke Labor Government between 57 and 58 per cent of young Australians stay on to year 12. By the early 1990s the Hawke Government policy should have two-thirds of Australian school children staying on to year 12. In the last year of the Fraser-Howard Government, student assistance for 16 and 17-year-old children in low and moderate income families was about $23 a week. Under Labor, it is $53.55 a week. The Hawke Government is opening the doors of tertiary education to every academically qualified young Australian. Within three years there will be another 49,000 new student places, and by 1991 the Hawke Government will have created 130,000 new higher education places in just six years compared with the just 26,000 new higher education places in the previous seven years of Liberal-National Party government. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) is owed the gratitude of the nation for his efforts to educate and reskill Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Will Future Directions give young Australians the chance to gain a university education? It is not likely to, if we read the Opposition's policy on higher education. The Howard policy is to fund extra tertiary places by imposing tertiary fees negotiated by the institution and the student. Not only will the student have to haggle with the institution over the fee, but students from low and middle income families will miss out because the tertiary fees will be just too expensive-with a medical degree costing upwards of $90,000 and an engineering degree costing around $50,000. Future Directions will not help our sons or daughters get jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at the record of the Fraser-Howard Government. Unemployment rose during the Fraser years, at first gradually then at levels not seen since the Depression. More than 200,000 jobs were abolished during the Leader of the Opposition's last 15 months as Commonwealth Treasurer. His back to the future policies put a Depression value on the security of a quarter of a million Australians. By 1983 Australians in every walk of life had had enough. The said `No way' to the future directions of Mr Fraser and the present Leader of the Opposition. Since April 1983 more than 1.2 million new jobs have been created, over 80 per cent of them in the private sector. Job growth in Australia has been almost double that of the rest of the industrialised world. It is one of the most cherished accomplishments of the Hawke Government. The Leader of the Opposition calls for a return to the attitudes of 30 years ago. By that we may assume he means the Liberal-National Party attitudes of 30 years ago. There is no need to go back 30 years to discover the true meaning of coalition values. One need only scrutinise the Leader of the Opposition's five years as Commonwealth Treasurer. This period is not mentioned in Future Directions, and for good reason. It was during this time that there was a collapse of public morality. Tax cheating, fuelled by unbridled greed and manipulated by the coalition's supporters, became, in the words of its own royal commissioner, `Australia's fastest growing industry', at a cost of billions of dollars to the ordinary families of Australia. It was a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> There has never been any public apology by the Leader of the Opposition for his role in this shameful period in our history, yet during his time as Commonwealth Treasurer he perfected an interesting technique when other things went wrong and errors were uncovered. On these occasions the Leader of the Opposition was wheeled out to admit that something dreadful had occurred, but only occasionally was he prepared to take the blame. The newspaper headlines during his period as Commonwealth Treasurer spell it out: `Howard admits a major blunder', the Australian, 31 May 1979; `Treasurer ``reneges'' on promises', the Canberra Times, 25 May 1979; `Financial system a mess: Howard', the Australian Financial Review, 24 July 1980. Are these the headlines that qualify a man to become Prime Minister? Are these the headlines of a man who would keep Australia on a stable course? Are these the headlines that would describe a man at the top who is a force for prosperity, a force for improving the well-being of all Australians, or are they the headlines of a man who leaves behind a trail of tragic blunders? I am certain that it will be with a sense of pride and faith that the people of Australia at the next election once again re-elect the Hawke Government and secure for themselves stable, clean, competent government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has been arguing for some time that Australia is facing major economic problems which the Government has refused to tackle seriously. Recent confirmation of our warnings has come from the continuing poor balance of payments figures and the blow-out in the measured rate of inflation. As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself acknowledged, those two figures were a disaster for his Government-a disaster not so much because they measure poor economic performance but because they let the cat out of the bag, dispelling the myth of prosperity since the Prime Minister and his failing Treasurer (Mr Keating) came to power. Those figures only confirm what the Opposition has been saying for a long time. However, they do the very valuable service of convincing many other people that the Government's so-called economic policy is in tatters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An issue that I want to raise in this debate today is the detrimental influence of political considerations on economic policy in general and monetary policy in particular. The political interests of the Australian Labor Party are divergent from economic commonsense. This was cogently illustrated by an editorial in the International Herald-Tribune a couple of weeks ago. That editorial seriously questions whether the social democratic governments of a number of Western countries, including Australia, can deal with the challenge of competition from a unified European market or from Japan and the so-called Asian dragons, as the case may be. On the rare occasions when the Treasurer has acknowledged that Australia has any economic problems at all, he says that he can deal with them when no other Treasurer in Australia, or for that matter in the world, can because of the unique benefits of the accord. Mr Des Moore, of the Institute of Public Affairs in Victoria, has-despite what the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) had to say just moments ago-effectively demolished the over enthusiastic and plain wrong claims of apologists for the accord, who argue that it has been a tool for reducing industrial disputes, for wage restraint and for employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Herald-Tribune effectively contradicts the claims that the accord is unique and will save Australia from its economic problems. It suggests that Australia might well be less likely to avoid the problems of social contract-style governments than some other countries with social democratic governments which have managed to distance themselves from the rapacious demands of their trade unions. For example, in Spain the socialist Prime Minister, Mr Gonzalez, has said that the unions had `asked him to do things incompatible with the efficient running of the Spanish economy'. We have had no such brave attempts at independence from either our Prime Minister or our failing Treasurer. They remain beholden to the trade union movement in Australia and to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). This has cost Australians dearly, contributing to the economic problems which we now face. The International Herald-Tribune is unequivocal on the costs of devices such as the accord:</PARA>
<PARA>It adds to inflation. It increases the cost, direct or indirect, of the goods the country wants to send abroad. It almost certainly puts more people out of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>That sums up Australia's problems emanating from the accord very neatly indeed. We have persistently high unemployment, growing inflation and an apparent inability to export enough goods to pay for products Australians want from overseas. Indeed Australia's economic problems might be seen as the classic symbols of a crumbling social contract such as the accord between the Labor Party and the ACTU. It is clear that the continuing existence of the so-called accord is dictated by political rather than economic needs. The Labor Party is in a bind since it can no more continue in government with the accord that it can hope to control the demands of the trade unions without it. This bind will result in compromises for the sake of electoral success which will continue to harm Australia's economic future. An economic policy should not be judged by how it appears to work in good times such as the seven-year expansion which the world outside Australia has been going through. If the Government cannot address the long term micro-economic problems now, it will never manage the tough decisions we will be faced with in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer either seriously underestimates the looming economic problems, or is deliberately misleading this Parliament and the public as to the nature of those problems. It might almost be better if he were misleading us. We might then have some measure of confidence that he will attempt the much needed realignment of the economic path which he has set. As it is, the Treasurer is showing all the signs of understanding only the political problems he faces in ever becoming Prime Minister, without any comprehension of the economic problems which his political manoeuvrings have produced. When touting the virtues of his last Budget, the Treasurer's first thought was the political impact of his efforts on the dwindling electoral prospects of the Keating-Hawke Government. We have an economic crisis and the best that the Labor Party has to offer Australians is political hype and a cynical exercise in marketing with an eye simply to the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> What people may not fully realise is that these shallow exercises in politics by the Treasurer and his Party have had serious detrimental effects on our economy. Recently the Treasurer has made it quite clear that monetary policy is firmly under his control. The Reserve Bank of Australia does what he says. The once vaunted independence of the Reserve Bank has been revealed as a myth which obscures the political interference in the development of monetary policy decisions. A growing amount of economic research has examined the links between the business cycle and monetary policy and the political cycle of the decline and fall of governments. Most governments, of course, would prefer to go to an election at a time of expansion in the economy so that they can benefit from the growth in wages, employment and profitability which accompanies such growth. Nevertheless, anyone who is concerned about this country's economic future would be aware that the prospects for lower interest rates in time to save the Keating-Hawke Government are rather slim-unless there is shortsighted intervention in the market, further undermining our economic future and our economic security. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Labor Caucus have been reassured that there is no need to worry about interest rates; the Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, will fix all that. He will bring home the bacon. What cost that bacon? If the Treasurer continues his cut and paste job, he will only bring further calamity to an economy which, particularly in recent times, for cynical political reasons he has ravaged. Inflation over the years of the Keating-Hawke Labor Government has continued at more than double the rate of our major trading partners. It is a major failing which contributes to the high interest rates which Australians now face. One does not have to be a monetarist to acknowledge that monetary policy has a major effect on inflation and interest rates. The Treasurer has burnt his monetary policy bridges behind him by his refusal to use fiscal policy as well as his overuse of loose monetary policy for political benefit. The sly phone calls to the Reserve Bank will not produce the results he desires or we all want. With the rediscount rate charged by the Reserve Bank already at 16.4 per cent the Government does not have much money policy flexibility. Until now the rhetoric of tight monetary policy has been a myth. Over the past 12 months broad money has grown at 18.9 per cent. Is it any wonder that Australia has an inflation problem?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's economic policy has failed to address the long term problems of micro-economic reform. Its forays into macro-economic policy are ad hoc; at best, attempts to make the most of a deteriorating situation. Take the so-called wages policy of the Government. It does not have one. It does not extend beyond the imminent wage/tax trade-off sometime this year. I will concede at one time the accord was a wages policy of sorts-not a very good policy, but the Government had one and was smugly proud of it. As it now is, it would be a brave man indeed who tried to predict wages outcomes in 1989. The wages/tax trade-off is not a wages policy but an exercise in wishful thinking and `see how she goes' improvisation. The basis of the Government's wages policy these days is to have a chat with its masters at the ACTU. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Party Government in Queensland has decided to bypass the Industrial Commission to ram through voluntary employment agreements (VEAs). It is against the background of corruption and incompetence within his own Government that Mr Ahern has decided to stir up the issue. The matter came to a head last week when the State Industrial Commission sought clarification from the Industrial Court on aspects of the largely untested legislation. The Government's response was to remove the condition for VEA applications to go before the Industrial Commission. In future the Office of the Industrial Registrar and the Industrial Inspectorate will simply examine VEA applications and grant approval if minimum statutory requirements are met. Only afterwards will parties to the agreement be able to lodge complaints or seek redress before the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UF4">Mr COURTICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They certainly are desperate, as the honourable member for Fisher says. The Government originally promoted the idea of applications being heard by the Industrial Commission as the prime safeguard against unscrupulous employers exploiting employees. Experience of VEAs to date shows that the conditions are employer determined, with little opportunity for employees to have a real input. Employees, to have a proper input, would be required to negotiate on and understand complex industrial relations issues. Most people do not have this knowledge, expertise or experience. Individuals do not have access to specialist advice. They are open to unfair bargaining arrangements and, in certain situations, this leaves them open to exploitation and discrimination. Employers usually have access to industrial relations specialists, and advice from employer organisations and specialist industrial relations consultants. This is why union participation is so vital in the development of agreements. Union members involved in industrial agreements have access to assistance and advice from their union which can provide support to ensure the negotiation process is not one-sided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Ahern Government is seeking to smash the process in two ways: it seeks to take the unions out of the process and to take the Industrial Court out of the determinations. The Ahern Government claims this is in the name of deregulation, yet it has not shown the same commitment to deregulation in other sectors of industry. The Ahern Government simply shows double standards by singling out the union movement for deregulation. It is simply an attack on working families. The conditions that have been gained did not come out of charity, they came after decades of hard work and sacrifice by the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The State Government has made no attempt to free up agricultural boards and farmer organisation membership. Queensland dairy farmers, for instance, are forced to belong to the Queensland Dairymen's Organisation-in other words, compulsory unionism. Cane farmers are forced to belong to the Queensland Cane Growers Council through an Act of the State Parliament-once again, compulsory unionism. The Queensland Graingrowers Association is currently pressing the State Government for a compulsory levy to force grain growers to become members of their organisation-once again, compulsory unionism. Membership of the Queensland Commercial Fishermen's Organisation is necessary to obtain a professional fishing licence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ahern Government should free up membership of these organisations if it is truly committed to deregulation. Farmers should be able to opt out of these compulsory unions if the Ahern Government is sincere in what it is saying. There is no reform or freedom of choice for many agricultural and resource boards. An Act of the Queensland Parliament determines how much sugar cane can be grown, where it is grown and to whom it can be sold. Acts of Parliament control egg production, dairy production and bean production. Even coal producers are regulated by the Queensland Government. Coal producers must use Queensland railways to transport their product, and they pay one of the highest freight rates in the world to do so. Because of Queensland Government taxes, it costs twice as much to rail a tonne of coal from the mine to the wharf as it costs to ship the same tonne of coal to the other side of the world. All this, allegedly in the name of efficiency, is presided over by the State Government of Queensland. The number of State Government boards shows the extent of over-regulation in Queensland. Despite a promise in 1985 to reduce the number of statutory boards, by July 1987 160 new boards had been created. In July 1987 there were 1,218 boards employing 50,000 people and containing 3,677 elected or appointed members. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Sciacia-Good jobs for the boys treatment. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UF4">Mr COURTICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member says, if the experience in my electorate is reflected throughout Queensland most of the appointed members are not there through any expertise at all-they are there because they are National Party branch members. The last figures I took out for 1987 showed that members of most quangos are paid meeting attendance fees and chairmen of many of the larger boards are paid salaries of up to $45,000 a year. So there is gross inefficiency and over-regulation. Quango members are paid $59 for meetings up to two hours in length or $79 for meetings up to four hours. Chairmen not on salaries are paid $89 for short meetings and $119 for meetings over four hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Queensland dairy industry is a good example of this. Queensland consumers pay the highest prices for milk in Australia, yet the returns to dairy farmers are no greater than in the rest of Australia. When I last checked, there were nine boards governing the dairy industry in Queensland. The Queensland Milk Board has 10 members who ensure there is an adequate supply of dairy products, fix prices and promote the use of dairy products. There are eight other quangos duplicating various parts of the Milk Board. For example: the Milk Transport Advisory Committee is a committee of three which deals with disputes relating to the transport of milk; the Milk Vending Advisory Committee has a membership of three and concerns itself with the registration of vendor vehicles; the Milk Sales Promotion Advisory Committee has a membership of nine and makes recommendations to the Milk Board about the promotion of liquid milk; the Milk Entitlements Committee has five members who determine the size of each processor and establish schemes to regulate access of processors to markets; and the Dairymen's State Council has a membership of eight and they are there to represent dairymen-which all the others are supposed to be doing anyway. The Filled Milk Advisory Committee has three members who make recommendations with respect to newly developed commercial products. Of course, if any of these quangos trying to help suddenly run off the rails, in Queensland there are a lot of quangos ready to put the situation right again. I guess one is looking after the other. There is the Milk Appeals Tribunal and the Milk Pasteurisation Tribunal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Bowman says, it is so sad that although the price is high farmers are not gaining anything out of this. It is just total over-regulation by a State government that talks about efficiency and a vision of excellence, yet it is made up of nothing more than backwoods regulators looking down a time tunnel. Last week I outlined how over-regulation is costing cane producers millions of dollars in lost potential, and just for the record I will repeat it once again: the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics suggests that 50 per cent more sugar could be produced in Queensland under a more appropriate regulatory environment. At current world prices this amounts to $500m in extra income for Australia, and also more jobs. Again we are paying the price for the incompetence of the Queensland Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The quangos that are administering primary industries such as the dairy industry are costing taxpayers plenty of money as well. Instead of applying deregulation across the board what we have, especially in the wheat industry, is a coalition split. In Queensland the National Party is threatening to set up a State wheat board, yet another quango. The Ahern Government has no sophisticated strategy to revitalise the Queensland economy. It has singled out the trade union movement and working families, wage and salary earners, and has made a lop-sided deregulation attempt to take the emphasis and the spotlight off the incompetence of the last 20 years of maladministration and the scandals of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct. I believe that if it is sincere it should apply a freeing up strategy to take the cost strictures off primary producers so that they can expand and employ more people. But as I said, what we have in Queensland is a one-sided attempt to create a scenario for the next State election by attacking average working families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After listening to the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) I must say that an old saying came to mind, something to the effect that people in glass houses should not throw stones, and if he is going to talk about deregulating in one area he ought to look at the area that is causing the greatest concern to Australia right now, and that is whether or not there should be deregulation in the labour market. I doubt that there would be a single member of the Parliament on the Government side who does not privately concede, certainly in his own mind if nowhere else, that this is probably the single most important thing that we have to do in so-called micro-economic reform if Australia is to get out of its present malaise. So I would suggest that he ought to be a bit more even-handed in his criticism of others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thought today I would like to talk a little bit about the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the great play he likes to make on his integrity. We are always hearing the Prime Minister telling us what a great man of integrity he is and how people should trust him, but there are a number of occasions when we have had reason to question this. Let us look at some of the promises he has made before elections. For example, before the 1983 election he was very quick to pledge that, under Labor, Parliament would run its full term and yet we have had three elections in the last six years and there is every chance of there being yet another one this year, which would make four in seven. That is even more curious when we consider that the Government was campaigning last year for four-year terms. </PARA>
<PARA> But we can also point to other promises. Before the 1984 election, the Prime Minister pledged to bring home ownership once again within the reach of ordinary Australian families. The Prime Minister has called a housing summit and has blamed everyone. He has blamed the States, he has blamed everything but his own interest rates, for the fact that Australians are finding it harder and harder to buy a house. Just before the Western Australian election he was very quick to give an indication to Australians that he believed that interest rates would not rise, and he was sure they were going to fall this year. Again, one has to question the man and what he is prepared to do when he claims that he is such a man of integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to talk specifically about some comments made in the biography of the Prime Minister by Miss Blanche d'Alpuget. I note in the foreword to the biography she makes this comment, which I think is important to draw to honourable members' attention:</PARA>
<PARA>It is a mark of his candour and integrity that he has permitted me, as an authorised biographer-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise `authorised'-</PARA>
<PARA>to write about him critically . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In this book Miss d'Alpuget draws attention, on pages 346 and 347, to the live sheep dispute of 1978. It is very interesting to see the way that dispute is portrayed. Much of the story is made up of direct quotes of the then Mr Hawke, now the Prime Minister. I would like first of all to draw to honourable members' attention some of the things that he said and then to go on to refer to a recent paper put together by Mr David Trebeck, who was then the executive officer of the Australian Wool Growers and Graziers Council and is now the principal of the consulting firm ACIL Australia Pty Ltd. His paper shows that on at least five points Mr Hawke quite clearly misleads readers of his biography. On page 347, in reference to the live sheep dispute in Adelaide in 1978, the book states:</PARA>
<PARA>The dispute had abruptly shifted towards flash-point. In South Australia a convoy of sheep trucks had already set out and was only hours away from arriving at the wharves; both the picketers and the farmers were carrying weapons. Hawke recalled:</PARA>
<PARA> `I got to Tony (Street's) office and he told me what the position was: we only had a couple of hours. The situation was appalling-the union blokes and the farmers were armed, and when the trucks arrived at the wharves that was going to be it'. </PARA>
<PARA>It sounds very dramatic. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>`We got on the telephones and managed to get a message to Ian McLachlan, who was the leader of the farmers' group in South Australia. McLachlan is a very able bloke and one of the toughest I've ever had to deal with in negotiations. Finally, we were able to talk to him in a telephone box at Wallaroo. I had a very tough conversation with him-I pleaded then demanded that he had to call his people off because otherwise there would be bloodshed, maybe death, and if that had happened then there was no way the thing could be unravelled, and at any rate, it was just too horrible to contemplate that people might be killing each other. He was very tough-his side undeniably had a case: the farmers were really scratching financially and were fighting for their livelihood-but to his credit he responded. He called his men off. That was just the first step'.</PARA>
<PARA>That quote in the book is attributed to the now Prime Minister. The book goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>A senior government official who requested anonymity, said later that Hawke's handling of the dispute had averted not just a brawl on a wharf in South Australia but the development of a widespread violent confrontation. Both sides had access to weapons-the farmers were carrying iron clubs and batons gnarled with barbed wire, and are rifle owners-</PARA>
<PARA>note `are'-</PARA>
<PARA>while the meat workers could-</PARA>
<PARA>note `could'-</PARA>
<PARA>lay their hands upon a murderous variety of skinning and boning knives. </PARA>
<PARA>All very dramatic staff, but as Mr Trebeck points out in his paper the reality was very different. Certainly individual farmers may have welcomed the opportunity for a stoush and were not intending to retreat if challenged, but apart from several factual errors in these accounts the reality was that the farmer leaders were in total control, at all times. In fact, an editorial in the Adelaide Advertiser a couple of weeks beforehand had commented on the fact that the farmers were properly controlled. That editorial of 5 April 1978 says, in reference to widespread traffic jams in Adelaide a few weeks before in relation to the dispute:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . yesterday's demonstration was no less impressive for the restraint shown by its leaders. </PARA>
<PARA>So that was the control that they had. But if we go on we find that when the dispute was said to have been resolved, in fact the sheep were being trucked away from Adelaide, where it had been intended to load them, and up to Wallaroo, a small port some miles north of Adelaide and where there was no picket line. The whole reason for trucking them there was to avoid confrontation, not to try to provoke it. So the farmers were taking a very responsible attitude. As it pointed out, the meat workers would have had to drive 150 kilometres in order to get there to provoke a dispute, because the farmers were already on the wharf and had already set up their own picket line. While some drove up there, in the end they had the sense not to hang around. The suggestion by the Prime Minister that McLachlan had to call his men off was completely wrong, because they were already there. They were not moving in to set up a dispute. They were already on the wharf waiting to load the sheep. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the suggestion about the farmers' weapons, as has been pointed out virtually the most dangerous piece of equipment on hand were links of PVC pipe-which farmers use quite regularly in yards for moving stock. How some union official could have seen that these were filled with lead, or that the farmers had bits of barbed wire welded onto steel pipes and so on, is just absolutely intriguing. As Mr Trebeck points out, Miss D'Alpuget's anonymous government official, who could see it all from Canberra, was clearly finding the atmosphere too heady. The amplification about rifles and knives clearly was added by the author, but as Trebeck points out the Prime Minister's role in the dispute was far more limited than he and some other people have since made out. He was in the unusual position of facing people who were tough, determined and correct and he had little choice in the end but to try to assist the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union save some face-a task made more difficult by the fact that, as he has admitted himself, he was not widely admired by some of the senior union office bearers. </PARA>
<PARA> But the other important point is that Hawke had already capitulated by the time he spoke to McLachlan at Wallaroo, having earlier spoken to the then President of the Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, Sir Samuel Burston. He had offered to call off the union action in return for discussions. Burston had responded that he would not even convey this proposal to the South Australians without iron clad assurances that all bans would be lifted, all pickets removed and normal loading resumed. Hawke gave this undertaking to Burston, and thereupon Burston rang McLachlan. That was long before Hawke was able to do so, and so at this stage there was no negotiation at all, let alone any pleading with McLachlan. So when we hear this it makes us wonder about the Prime Minister. It raises a further question about what else he has tried to do to rewrite the history of this particular issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to grieve on behalf of 1,000 school children and their parents at Woodridge State High School, because this school has been removed unilaterally by a stroke of the Queensland Government pen from our disadvantaged schools program. This school, honourable members will appreciate, is in an area which has some recognised social difficulties. We have quite a high unemployment rate, and that schools program attempted, by the employment of a number of people, to ensure that children stayed at school till the end of their secondary schooling and so were able to enter the work force with the right skills and training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The school is situated in an area that is recognised and noted as having very little social infrastructure. What other city of 130,000 people in Australia has no hospital and no public transport system? Very little of it is kerbed and guttered, and there are other difficulties as well. What has happened is simply that some people with problems have been placed there, with no contingency plans to meet their needs. The community has responded magnificently, and large numbers of community organisations are working in a cooperative way to help each other-with no assistance, I might add, from the Queensland State Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This State high school attempted through our disadvantaged schools program to address what it considered to be a very long term problem-the maintenance of its children at school, which would then enable them to have a realistic chance of entering the work force in 1989 Australia. What do we see? A government that cares? No-a government that quite simply takes money from those most in need and gives to others. It gives no explanation, no reason-despite the fact that parents and teachers have called for answers and the students themselves have sought clarification. Still we are uncertain, unsure, and we are dismissed because we do not count; the State Government does not care. So I rise on behalf of this school, and remind everyone that Federal Government money is involved. This Government provides the resources and the funding for that program under the disadvantaged schools program. It is then disbursed at the whim of the State Government. It selects the schools; it selects the people who make the decisions. We heard earlier the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) make statements about the way in which choices are often made by the Queensland Government. One has to ask some fairly cynical questions as to what is happening here. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of those students and their parents, the community at large in Logan City and the school community of Woodridge State High School, I make this plea that the school be reinstated into the special education program to ensure that the Australians of the future will have the skills, the talent and the education to meet the challenges of the 1990s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House something which I believe is an absolute scandal. With all the recent talk regarding the role of governments in providing residential land to ease the current housing crisis, particularly in Sydney, I am staggered that the Greiner State Government has the cheek to blame the Federal Government for the supply problem. Within my electorate, at Narellan-which is adjacent to Camden, in Sydney's south-west-land which could ease this crisis is lying idle because of a State Housing Department miscalculation. The land in question, owned partly by the State Housing Department and partly by the private sector, was rezoned for residential purposes in May 1982. I should know because at the time I was the regional manager for the Department of Environment and Planning in New South Wales and was responsible for the rezoning of that particular land. Services to the land, such as water and sewerage, have been available since early 1987. The land itself has the potential to release a total of 9,000 lots to ease the housing shortage. Of these, 3,300 could be developed by the State Housing Department and the balance by private developers. I understand the Housing Department plans to develop a meagre 400 to 420 lots this calendar year and 400-plus a year subsequently. Nearby, private developers with land holdings of 118 hectares with a potential of 375-plus lots are seeking council approval to proceed immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why has this procrastination occurred in the State Government? Why are only 400 lots a year being released? Why did the Department of Housing miscalculate the demand for housing and think its stocks in Campbelltown, nearby, could cope? When will the Greiner Government get its own house in order before it throws stones at the Commonwealth Government? I believe that this is a scandal of monumental proportions. The land, as I said, is serviced; it is rezoned. There are 9,000 potential lots that could be released in Sydney's south-west with easy access to Sydney, to industrial areas around Bankstown and inner Sydney through a freeway system, and through a reasonably developed electrified rail system. But the land is lying idle. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is Greiner sitting on his hands? Why is the State Government not proceeding to ease the housing shortage in New South Wales, and in Sydney in particular, by not hastening and fast tracking the development of this land? I urge the Premier to do so. This is a matter that is above party politics. Why does he not get on with the job that he is supposed to do in New South Wales to ease the crisis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, last weekend there was a public debate in Tasmania and it was a debate about the mill. At that debate I was accused of being a liar. I might be many things but I am not and never have been a liar and I think most people in this House know that. It might have been the result of a bit of a misunderstanding. I will quote what I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Mr Hawke said last October he supported the mill; it was one of the best economic benefits to come to Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) asked me, face to face, `Where do you stand on the mill, Bruce?'. I said, `You know where I stand on the mill, Duncan. Where do you stand?'. He replied, `I support Mr Hawke'. That is all I said. Then I hesitated and I said that there was an equivocation in that debate because there was not very much support from the Australian Labor Party for the mill. That is fair comment. The point that I was making was this: If that mill in Tasmania is to be a reality, we must not brook the Browns of this world, or people such as that new woman who is coming out of the dust down in Tasmania to spread her wings; we must get rid of them. We must construct that mill in order to boost the economy of Tasmania and give jobs to the workers. The Labor Party purports to support the workers. Well, I support the workers and I will support the workers in Tasmania over the rotten greenies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although most Australians are probably unaware of the fact, I believe they would be most concerned to learn that entry into general practice for doctors currently requires nothing more than undertaking one year in hospital service after graduation. They would be even more concerned to learn that currently there are no requirements for general practitioners (GPs) to maintain a sufficient level of competence by regularly updating their skills and knowledge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Congratulations are certainly due to the Hawke Labor Government and particularly to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) and the President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Gates, on the agreed joint initiatives to provide improved patient care by improving the qualifications of GPs. `Raising the Standard of General Practice and Quality Patient Care', an agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, is an outstanding example of leadership by government, combined with professional cooperation and initiative by medical care providers-the GPs of Australia-for the benefit of the whole Australian community. I applaud the efforts of all involved and acknowledge that this agreement is a real watershed in the relationship between government and the medical profession in Australia. I sincerely hope that this agreement receives the publicity it deserves in disseminating the key issues to all Australians. It focuses on primary care and makes the GP the gatekeeper of medical care and service for all Australians. </PARA>

I say `was' because I believe him to be dead, but like thousands of other Australians I want to know whether he is dead, and, if so, what were the details of his death. Raoul Wallenberg saved 100,000 Jewish lives in Budapest in 1944. His work was perhaps more remarkable than that of Schindler, whose deeds have been so graphically chronicled by Thomas Keneally. With the full support of the Swedish Government, Wallenberg outwitted Adolf Eichmann and the Hungarian authorities and in six months he had achieved the most significant rescue of Jews from the Holocaust. He was taken into custody by Soviet forces at the end of the Second World War and his fate is unknown. Virtually all Federal parliamentarians have signed a petition asking the Soviet Government for his release or details of his death. I will join a delegation of Australian Jews tomorrow in presenting that petition to the Soviet Counsellor. I urge the Soviet Government, in the spirit of glasnost, to tell the world what happened to Raoul Wallenberg.</PARA></TALK.START>

Many members of this Parliament, in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, have in the past day signed a petition to the Chinese Government requesting that Government to give autonomy within the People's Republic of China to the Tibetan people.

I am concerned about the aftermath of that declaration and I appeal to the Government and particularly the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) to look much more closely into the question of meeting the requirements of the little people, the many workers in the timber industry, who have suffered almost a termination of their way of life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I take this opportunity of the 90-second statement to draw the House's attention to an article which appeared on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald in January. The headline was `Drug company paid doctors to prescribe medicine', and I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A drug company paid psychiatrists $200 for each patient they enrolled in an open clinical evaluation of a new anti-anxiety drug which had already been approved for general marketing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This evaluation of the drug Buspirone, marketed by Astra Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd involved 44 psychiatrists around Australia who prescribed the drug to a large number of patients. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that it is grossly improper for pharmaceutical companies to pay an incentive to doctors who have the opportunity to prescribe their patients those drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, perhaps you will recall that last year, the year of the Seoul Olympics, the Australian Consumers Association released information which exposed the activities of one pharmaceutical company. That company was running a competition for doctors who, if they filled out a form declaring that they had prescribed that company's drug, would be eligible to enter a competition to win an all expenses paid trip to the Seoul Olympics. I am pleased that the pharmaceutical company withdrew the offer once it was exposed to the public because I think that when they go to their doctors Australians need to be assured that their activities in prescribing drugs are based purely on sound medical reasons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members could hardly have missed the pun and cliche ridden news item revealing that condoms would be removed from sale in the New South Wales Parliament House souvenir shop. The outraged leader of the Call to Australia Party, the Reverend Fred Nile, said that condoms were a symbol of promiscuity and selling them in Parliament House was `a bit like they were under royal patronage'. The souvenir shop may well have been an inappropriate place to sell condoms, but these sorts of comments display an unhealthy attitude to what is a normal, healthy activity. As a pharmacist, I have sold condoms for many years and I can assure the public that condoms are not a symbol of promiscuity, but a necessity for many people. Removing condoms from sale is like praising ignorance as a virtue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My inquiries disclose that condoms are for sale in this Parliament-not in the souvenir shop, but at Aussie's shop. He tells me they are a fast moving item. They are available in red and green packaging, but do not bear a parliamentary seal, only a price sticker. The public can rest assured that politicians in this Parliament and the staff who work here are representative of the general community with apparently varying and normal sexual appetites. And a parliament should be representative of the community if it is to be relevant to the lives of the people. It would be hypocritical of this Parliament if we were to ban the sale of condoms in the parliamentary precincts at a time when there is a bipartisan acceptance that promotion of condoms is a desirable part of sex education and prevention of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most of us are most impressed by the tremendous advances that have been made in technology. One of the areas that have certainly flourished in recent times is the use of computers and the use of modems. I would like to bring to the attention of the House the case of one of my constituents who came to see me the other day, bearing a Telecom Australia account for more than $8,000 for a two-month period. I went to Telecom and its officials have been most cooperative. Basically, what happened here was that this person had put a 215-cycle modem on his telephone. It was thought that his 12-year-old son must have got into the hacking business and managed to contact a number of computer organisations in the United States. But on checking the situation, Telecom found that the actual power of that particular modem would not have given him access to international lines. Telecom has been tracing that problem. It would seem that there had been some interaction between this gentleman's modem and another one of much greater strength, also situated in a Brisbane suburb. It would seem that the larger modem has now plugged into the smaller modem and somebody has been doing the wrong thing by using the modem system to dial the United States, sometimes for hours on end. The cost has been going to the original modem-the one owned by the man who received the $8,000 Telecom account. While this technology continues to advance-</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why is the Government dragging its feet in its attempts to clean up our waterfronts? While I am speaking, there are ships waiting to load and unload at our ports. Some of those ships have been waiting more than 18 days to dock. When they eventually dock, they and their owners will be subjected to the stand- over tactics of the dockside unions. Those tactics are costing this country millions and millions of dollars. One of the hardest hit industries is the one which is currently contributing more than 40 per cent of our export income-the rural industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should consider that the North American wheat terminals can average between 60,000 and 120,000 tonnes per man. Australia's proud record is 14,504 tonnes per man. It is little wonder that we read that it is cheaper to ship aluminium from Sardinia to Tasmania than it is to ship it from Queensland to Tasmania. These delays are costing up to $50m a month. Ten years ago Australia sold 15 million cartons of apples a year to Europe; this season only one million cartons will be exported. One of my constituents in the Saddleworth district was involved in shipping mohair to the United Kingdom. The Australian wharf charges amounted to $261. On inquiry, my constituent discovered that the equivalent charge in the United Kingdom was a mere $61. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members opposite may have noticed that I did answer questions on this matter at a press conference I had this morning. At that stage, I had only seen the press reports in this morning's paper. I have since had reports of remarks made by Mr Chaudry on television last night. Let me repeat that Mr Chaudry's remarks are deeply offensive to me and to the Government and I would have no doubt they are deeply offensive to every member of this place. They are particularly offensive in relation to implicit threats to Australian booksellers. I am advised that Mr Chaudry is an Australian citizen, having arrived here in November 1972 and having obtained citizenship in November 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have sought the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions to see whether any Federal law or laws have been broken and the DPP has advised that in his opinion no offence has been committed against the Commonwealth by Mr Chaudry. I am sure that State governments, which would regard this as a serious matter, will be examining it to see whether offences have been committed within their jurisdiction and I would suggest that they should be doing that. I imagine that they would be.</PARA>
<PARA> I said this morning that this Government was not one which was demanding adherence to one set of values. That is not the sort of society Australia is. But that does not mean that there are not values to which we have the strongest commitment and, in particular, we have the commitment to the right to speak freely without fear of violent reprisal or threat. That is one of the values that I think, on both sides of the House, we hold as of fundamental importance. The Government therefore deplores any threats made against Australians over the distribution of The Satanic Verses. I find it particularly deplorable that the right of free speech, which we cherish in this country, is being abused in order to threaten other Australians who wish to avail themselves of it. As I said in the House on 28 February, I congratulate those in the Australian literary and artistic community and in the publishing and bookselling business who have indicated that they will not be intimidated by such threats. Any violent action in Australia will be dealt with under the criminal law. I can assure you, Madam Speaker, and the honourable member who has asked the question, and I can assure this House, that this situation is being monitored by the Commonwealth and State agencies, which are cooperating in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to say-and I think it is fair to these people to say it-that there are approximately 120,000 Australian Muslims and as individuals or that whole group of 120,000 Australian Muslims, they should not be tarred with the brush of a handful of extremists such as Mr Chaudry or those who used children in a completely unacceptable way in a demonstration at Arncliffe on Sunday.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that virtually without exception the established leadership of the Australian Muslim community-who of course are genuinely offended by The Satanic Verses and we acknowledge that-have totally disowned the calls for violent reprisals against Mr Rushdie. I refer particularly to the concerned but responsible comments made many times in recent days by a respected Muslim member of the Advisory Council on Multicultural Affairs, Dr Ahmed Shboul. The Australian Federation of Islamic Councils has also expressed the same moderate views and it has eschewed any recourse to violence. In conclusion, I add that because the Australian Muslim leadership has declined to provide sensational headlines in this issue, a void has to that extent been created and it has been filled by the abhorrent ravings of a few unrepresentative extremists.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OH4">Mrs KELLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for McEwen for his question and also for his great interest in the Defence Force personnel living at Puckapunyal in his electorate. Yesterday I did launch a new family information network for defence personnel, which we call FIND. This is a 008 information network system which is now available to all defence personnel and their spouses around Australia. The main reason for introducing this is to provide a ready access to all information and advice on all conditions of service that exist in the Defence Force. It will, of course, be anonymous, so people can ring up and find out information without even having to give their name. It will enhance the chain of command and will also support the current family support systems that are available in the Defence Force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I launched this yesterday there were a number of people there, as has already been remarked on in the media, including all the chiefs of defence personnel, many representatives of spouses and one person who actually was not invited, and that was my shadow spokesperson in the Senate. She came along, but not primarily to find out what the system was about, as before she turned up she had already put out a statement condemning it, without knowing any details about it at all. I do not mind that as I have come to expect it from the Opposition and its policies on defence. It has no constructive policies and it spends its whole time condemning ours, whether they be policies on an information system for our families or a major military exercise like Kangaroo 89.</PARA>
<PARA> The comment is made from honourable members opposite that she knows more about Defence Force personnel. If she knew so much about them, she should not have put out a statement which said that the Defence Force families do not support this. The wives were there endorsing it and the chiefs of personnel were endorsing it. It is successful as of today. We expected to get about 50 calls a day but as of now we have had about 167. We have helped 167 people and we will continue to help them despite the Opposition's comments. While I am making these points I would like to raise the matter of the personal and vindictive attacks that have been made against many of our officers in the Department of Defence. This was referred to yesterday by the Minister for Defence, and I want to take that one step forward.</PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, in this statement my shadow opponent criticised the person who had been the project officer, saying dismissively that she had been on my staff. In reality, she was a departmental liaison officer, a career public servant of 20 years standing, an expert in conditions of service and she is currently a Defence Force spouse. I loathe those sorts of personal attacks on people who cannot stand up for themselves. That attack by the shadow spokesperson just links up with the comments she made recently, saying that she would sack half those from lieutenant-colonel upwards in the Russell defence offices. This Government is about constructive policies for Defence Force families, and whether it is providing support services for a contingent going to Namibia or whether it is providing support services for families in Australia, we live up to our commitment and we get on with the job.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to these claims and I thank the honourable member for Fisher for affording me the opportunity to rebut them. They appear on page 37 of that rather pathetic document `Futile Diversions'. That process is part of the futile attempt to denigrate the outstanding successes of the accord. The essence of the accord is consultation, cooperation and consensus. It is about industry, unions and government working together. That concept is totally alien to the Opposition, because all it knows and all it is putting forward in industrial relations policy is a reversion to that age old practice of confrontation, division and fragmentation, the old `us versus them' mentality. That is all the Opposition knows and all it can revert to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look to the successes of the accord. We have created some 1.36 million new jobs during the period of the accord and in the life of this Government. That represents a growth rate of 3.4 per cent per annum-twice the growth rate of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, and four times the growth rate obtained when those who now sit opposite were in power, the disastrous Howard-Fraser years. Some 56 per cent of those jobs have gone to women and 85 per cent have gone to the private sector. So in total, some 7.6 million Australians now have jobs, an all-time record. The document `Futile Diversions' refers to employment not having increased. As I have mentioned, there has been an increase of 1.36 million new jobs, four times better than was obtained by the Opposition. The unemployment rate has been cut from over 10 per cent to 6.7 per cent. That has been achieved at a time when we have seen the highest overall participation rate for 20 years-63.1 per cent-and record levels for women since World War II. The Opposition says the accord has kept prices up. Let us look back to its record. It had an inflation rate of over 11 per cent, in fact 11.5 per cent, and we have brought it down to 7.7 per cent. At the same time there has been an increase in investment, a record increase in business investment, the highest proportion of gross domestic product directed to business investment for 35 years.</PARA>
<PARA> The last figures I refer to relate to industrial disputes. I can tell the honourable member, because he is interested in this matter, that we have seen a reduction of almost 60 per cent in the level of industrial disputes compared with those disastrous Howard-Fraser years. That is all the men of division, the men of confrontation, the men of fragmentation in the Opposition can take us back to. All their enterprise bargaining proposals can offer is the same kind of chaos, the same kind of confrontation, that led to that massive wage blow-out, the industrial chaos, the winding down of the economy, and the massive development in unemployment, that we saw in the Howard-Fraser years. The way forward that this Government offers is through award restructuring, and through government, industry and employees pulling together. We are remodelling the way in which we organise our working arrangements and job classifications. We are providing career paths and safer, more satisfying, more rewarding jobs. That is the way in which we will continue to improve productivity and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, let me say that it is a myth that the Opposition offers any alternative to the successful and effective policy that has been pursued by this Government over the past six years. The Opposition is saying to the people of Australia that the creation of 1.36 million new jobs is a myth. It is saying that the reduction in the unemployment rate from more than 10 per cent to 6.7 per cent is a myth. It is saying that the massive surge in business investment is a myth, and that the 60 per cent cut in industrial disputes is a myth. What we all know is a myth is that the Opposition has a wages policy and a tax policy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All members of the House will be interested to know that the process of consultation with respect to retirement incomes policy is proceeding, I think very effectively. It has been assisted by a task force established by the Prime Minister. That task force has now held about 40 meetings in various electorates across Australia attended by more than 2,000 people. The Prime Minister attended such a meeting in his own electorate of Wills. I think it was very much appreciated that he was able to give up his time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, right across Australia, has been talking directly to the groups that have met in various halls, and has established a consultation process involving discussions with peak councils-the Australian Pensioners Federation, the Australian Council of Social Service and industry, including the insurance industry. Generally, it has been accepted that issues paper No. 6 has provided a very good framework within which it will be possible for the Government to develop a policy for which there will be very broad support. We have received about 250 written submissions on retirement incomes, including one from the Opposition. Those submissions will be taken very seriously. The Government will continue to work to develop its policy.</PARA>
<PARA> In passing, I say that one can contrast that kind of approach-an approach which has resulted in the release of a widely circulated paper, a call for submissions, grass roots meetings across Australia and meetings with the various sectors-with the approach the Opposition has taken. It has recorded a message from the Leader of the Opposition which will cost the pensioner-if any pensioner is silly enough to spend it-at least 53c and up to $2.50, and it says absolutely nothing to the 80 per cent of people on the age pension, apart from the fact that twice yearly indexation will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA> In the area of retirement incomes policy, the Government has taken the view that it is fundamentally important, not to record some message to people in the community, but to listen to people. I think the symbolism in relation to that little exercise is abundantly clear. The Opposition is not listening; it is not willing to go to the effort of sitting down with people around Australia and talking through with them what their concerns are or what the options are that they believe the Government ought to consider and to go about this process in a thorough, democratic and consultative manner.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to a number of reports of comments by members of the Opposition in this place and in the Senate, drawing attention to what they obviously regard as an excessive level of foreign investment in Australia. On a north Queensland television program on 21 February this year, the honourable member for Dawson called for swift measures to alter foreign investment rules to require 51 per cent Australian ownership. A Queensland National Party of Australia senator, Senator Sheil, was reported in the Gold Coast Bulletin on 1 March as saying that foreign investments should be restricted to joint ventures with local companies. The honourable member for Sturt, from this House, is reported in Tuesday's Advertiser as calling it `a foreign land grab that is a threat to the freedom of Australians'. The Deputy Leader of the National Party has made repeated calls for Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) thresholds to be made more restrictive, and the Leader of the National Party on 29 January called for restraint on foreign investment in Australia. I have most of those references with me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Each and every call is completely contrary to coalition policy, which is to abolish totally the Foreign Investment Review Board and the existing regulatory framework. The Future Directions policy document states:</PARA>
<PARA> In recent years these restrictions have encouraged a dramatic increase in the proportion of debt in total capital inflows and in turn this has an adverse impact on our balance of payments.</PARA>
<PARA>And this is the punch line:</PARA>
<PARA> These controls should be abolished, except for certain strategic areas such as the media, and with them the Foreign Investment Review Board. They are out of step with the outward looking entrepreneurial spirit we wish to see in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Some coalition members want tougher rules for a body which they are committed to abolishing, yet this duplicity is marketed all around the Commonwealth as though it is the Government which is allowing in some way unrestricted access by foreign ownership in this country and the coalition parties which stand for something different. The fact is that it is the coalition parties that stand for an open door, open slather, foreign investment policy. The balance we have between the considerations of the dominant control of the economy by the Australian people and the very considerable benefits that worthwhile foreign investments can bring is to be pushed to one side in what is to be some slavish commitment to the entrepreneurial spirit in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the Government has relaxed the policy we inherited from the then Government, the now Opposition. We have substantially relaxed it in areas such as services, manufacturing and real estate. But in some places we have made it tighter, particularly in relation to foreigners speculating and buying in the market for established residential real estate. That is, those changes we announced in 1987 to diminish speculative buying by non-residents, which we believe were driving up house prices, have constantly been attacked by the Opposition and are being attacked this week by the Opposition in the Senate. The Leader of the Opposition and his Party stand in favour of foreigners buying established residential real estate, particularly in the Sydney market. But one would not believe that from their utterances. They actually stand in favour of unrestricted foreign purchases of residential real estate in the Sydney and Melbourne markets, but that is not the position that is put about.</PARA>
<PARA> So a little bit of straight talking and consistency and honesty on the part of the Opposition would not go astray to let the public know where it really stands. Opposition members try to score off the Government with these press releases and stunts when in fact they are hiding behind the real policy, which is to open Australia completely to foreign investment of whatever variety.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, the Pharmacy Guild has chosen to run a campaign designed to scare and confuse pensioners and the chronically ill. Despite this facade of concern, this is not a health care issue; this is all about a campaign for increased payments to pharmacists. The Guild's leaders claim that the Government has cut its members' income and that the pensioners are next to be hit. I can assure pensioners that there is absolutely no truth whatsoever in the assertion that pensioners are a target. There are no targets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite pressures on the Budget due to unprecedented increases in the cost of the PBS, this Government has consistently rejected every suggestion-some of which have come from pharmacists as well as from other people in the community-that pensioner health card holders should have to pay. With the Guild, we introduced a safety net scheme to ensure that the chronically ill would be protected from excessive drug costs, and we have repeatedly affirmed our commitment to ensuring that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme can and will provide the most needed drugs to all Australians. There is no proposal before this Government to alter the situation. It is a total fabrication.</PARA>
<PARA> The real story is that the leaders of the Pharmacy Guild are blatantly causing pensioners and other people fear, confusion and anxiety. That is simply to disguise the fact that they have failed in the eyes of their members. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal-the independent body which sets the levels of pharmacists' remuneration under the PBS-has found the Guild's recent submission for increased rates to be flawed. The Tribunal rejected it and actually reduced the rate by 10c per prescription. This Tribunal's decision has little to do with the Government; it has a lot to do with the Guild and the tactics and arguments it uses to push its case.</PARA>
<PARA> That 10c decision is only half the story. The Guild's leaders rarely mention that payments to pharmacists are made up of the dispensing fee, which has been reduced on this occasion by 10c per prescription, plus a mark-up of 25 per cent on the wholesale price of the drug dispensed. For example, over the past two years pharmacy remuneration has increased by an average of 52c per prescription because of that mark-up element. So now the real story is being heard. We want to know why the Guild's leaders will not accept the umpire's decision. Maybe if they helped the Tribunal with information they would get better results.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me get back to the real concern in the community which this advertisement raises. The Pharmacy Guild's leadership has now embarked upon a blatant political campaign, a campaign which set out to confuse and scare sick people and pensioners. I should like to quote from a letter from Mr Matthews, the President of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, to all his members on 7 February. In the first two pages he criticises the decision of the Tribunal-the umpire-and he continually urges his members to become militant. Then he says:</PARA>
<PARA>This will only be the first step in an ongoing political campaign. The next is to draw to the attention of parliamentarians the chaos that will commence on April 1 when Zyloprim, Lasix, Daonil and Sinequan etc cease to be benefits. Tell your patients, especially pensioners, of what will happen and suggest they write to their MP.</PARA>
<PARA>So here we have evidence of a political campaign against the umpire's decision for more money. The way in which the Guild intends to maximise its campaign is clear from that letter and the advertisement. The Guild's leaders actually want to frighten pensioners. We see the blatant evidence of that campaign in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me make this point clear as it is very important: this is a recommendation of the leadership of the Pharmacy Guild, and I do not expect that Australian pharmacists will indulge in or take up such tactics. My door is open to the Guild to discuss matters concerning their remuneration. My offer to them to assist their customers and pensioners and patients to understand the relatively minor changes to take place on 1 April remains open, but only on the condition that they drops this scare campaign against pensioners and the sick. The Guild now has the opportunity to salvage its credibility.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My ministerial colleague the Minister for Consumer Affairs has received a number of complaints about this particular matter. I understand that the honourable member for Hindmarsh has also made representations in respect of constituents. I am advised that this particular company advertised a directory and calendar for circulation in local areas and invited local businesses to subscribe for advertisements. I understand that the subscriptions were substantial and significant. As a result of no action by the company, in the sense of the timing and launching of the system or the advertisements, many complaints have been received. The complaints were referred to the Trade Practices Commission early this year and it has taken a fair amount of evidence relating to the situation. It has also interviewed the directors of the company concerned. The company undertook to provide a written submission to the Trade Practices Commission on or before 23 October last but this has not happened. As a result of that position I understand from the Minister for Consumer Affairs that the Trade Practices Commission is certainly actively pursuing the matter. It is expected that some action will be taken in the very near future.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and it relates to Austudy applications, which are means tested on the basis of parents' taxable income for the previous financial year. Why does his Department insist that original copies of taxation assessments be submitted with Austudy applications? Why will his Department not accept a simple statement of taxable income on the Austudy application form, as is the practice of the Department of Social Security, for example, in the implementation of the means test on the family allowance? What safeguards are there to prevent information on this assessment notice-for example, the tax file number-being made available to people who are not entitled to the information? What action has the Minister taken to apply the relevant provisions of the Privacy Act relating to tax file numbers to his Department's handling of these assessment notices?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7G4">Mr DUNCAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Basically the reasons why original documentation has been sought is that, unlike many other applications that are made across the Government for various types of benefits, Austudy essentially is a benefit that is applied for once a year and therefore is not regularly checked in the way that some other benefits are. Accordingly, we felt it desirable to ensure that when the application was put in, the original documents should be sought so that there would be a minimisation of any chance of defrauding the scheme. Accordingly, we have sought to ensure that fraud of the scheme is kept to a minimum. There has been some concern about such things, and in reviewing the arrangements during the past year we have ensured that all procedures are tightened up. This has been part of the tightening up that we have undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition brings this matter of public importance before the Parliament today. An element of the concern we have would have been perceived by anyone listening to or observing Question Time today. I asked the Treasurer (Mr Keating) a question, reminding him of his responsibility to the Parliament for the administration of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Act. With the bluff and bluster that we are used to, what exuded through that answer was the answer of a man who does not have a clue about that legislation and does not care. The arrogance and the sanctimony with which he treats the civil liberties of individuals bear out just how hypocritical the Government was last year when we were seeking to hold up the passage of that tax file legislation because we were concerned about the privacy and civil liberties implications. We were constantly traduced as allegedly holding up the legislation to protect the tax cheats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government could not care less about the efficient working of a tax file mechanism. It cares even less about the civil liberties and the privacy elements involved. The answer this afternoon was an admission that the Australian Taxation Office was `working off a list which was somewhat dated'. If that is not a failure in the terms of the matter of public importance which is before the Parliament, I do not know what is. The subject of the matter of public importance is:</PARA>
<PARA>The failure of the Government to take all reasonable steps to ensure that security safeguards and procedures are in place to prevent unauthorised access to and disclosure of tax file information. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members may be intrigued to know that I did a touch of plagiarising when writing this out. The words contained in this matter of public importance are taken from the Privacy Act. It is the Privacy Act that imposes on the Treasurer, in the administration of his tax file number legislation, those very elements. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where is the Treasurer? I will come to the question of the Treasurer. Anything that goes wrong within the purview of the Treasurer is never the Treasurer's fault. It does not matter what it is; it is never his fault. If it involves some procedural element in the Parliament, it is someone else who has dumped that problem on him. If it involves the tax file number, it is the citizens of Australia who have breached privacy-not him. If it involves the consumer price index, God damn us, it is the fault of the Hills hoists and everything else around the home; it is not his fault. If it is the balance of payments, it is the fault of the rest of the world. It is never his fault. Those of us who have to address radio stations and the like around the country know that, in all the interviews that have been done on this issue, most of them have been conducted by the interviewers because they are reflecting the anger in the community about the way in which this Government is going about the processing of the tax file number.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The starting point is not perhaps, as may be thought, the current maladministration that we are seeing. The starting point is the underlying cavalier attitude of the Government from the time it proposed the tax file number. This is an arrogant Government. It exudes arrogance at all times. It cares not a whit for its supporters whom it has always claimed to represent. We know only too well how much they are suffering. The Government cares not a whit for fundamental principles that go innately with a democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Had it not been for the Opposition, this tax file number legislation, honourable members will recall, would be in place today without a privacy commissioner operating. The Government, again with a cavalier attitude, dumped the tax file number legislation in this place in order to get it through and with the intention that at some time, sine die, in the future, the privacy legislation would go through. Thanks to the efforts of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), in negotiations with the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), the 10 amendments moved by the Opposition were locked into the tax file number legislation. So it is not the law at this stage that is wrong; it is the administration. And who is the administrator? Ultimately, it is him. He is not here at the moment, not surprisingly. Our concerns for privacy were the ones that brought about all those amendments. That occurred in the initial stages. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us move to the current breaches. The man who has been so vigilant on this issue and is deserving of the credit is, in fact, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron). He has a multiplicity of examples of the way in which privacy has been stripped asunder from most Australians who reside in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory and who have been recipients of the letters that have been sent by the Australian Taxation Office. Tax file numbers have been sent to the wrong post box numbers and wrong addresses; they have been sent out in multiples. Distressingly in the circumstances of one of our members on this side of the House, they have been sent to his father, who passed away quite some years ago. The honourable member for Moreton has those examples. </PARA>
<PARA> I have raised this matter. The Treasurer seemed to think he was alluding to something secret. I mentioned at a press conference earlier this week that I had been discussing this matter last Friday with the Commissioner of Taxation. As a consequence of that, yesterday we heard that, instead of sending out a plethora of letters to people going back seven or eight years, tax file numbers would now be sent only to those people who had sent in returns in the financial year 1987-88. That is no help. It only cuts down the time frame and the numbers; it does not change the system. It does not meet the objections of people who are receiving or not receiving these letters or the consequences of the letters falling into the wrong hands. </PARA>
<PARA> So what is the law? Let me go into the law because the Treasurer says it is not the fault of the Taxation Office. He says, `Oh no brother, I do not accept responsibility for anything. It is not my fault. It is not the Tax Office's fault; it is the fault of all those people who get these letters and open them up'. My old friend here the honourable member for Moreton used to be a smoker. Honestly, does one really think, in an analogous situation, that if I were to go to his place one night, pour petrol all over it, and the poor blighter comes home, lights his cigarette and blows the whole house asunder, it would be his fault? It is the fault of the one who caused the damage, not the consequence of the action. The fool over there will not accept that. I find him one of the most poorly read, illiterate people in this place. I suppose that, if I were to recite the maxim res ipsa loquitur, while this is probably on the lips of all the constituents of the honourable member for Moreton and they are quoting nothing else, the Treasurer may not understand it. But it does mean `it speaks for itself'. So it does in regard to the law that applies in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 3.2 of schedule 2 of the Privacy Act states, inter alia, that security safeguards and procedures must be in place to prevent unauthorised access to, or disclosure of, tax file number information. There are other applicable sections. Furthermore, interestingly enough, there is a section in the Privacy Act, relating to the Privacy Commissioner, that is headed `Functions of Commissioner in relation to tax file numbers'. Section 28 (1) states:</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to the functions under section 27, the Commissioner has the following functions in relation to tax file numbers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph (d) states that the duty of the Privacy Commissioner is:</PARA>
<PARA>to examine the records of the Commissioner of Taxation to ensure that:</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Privacy Commissioner is given extensive powers. The honourable member can seek further advice for a fee on the penalty. But I will say this: The Government thought about imposing a pretty substantial fee on anybody else who broke the law-$10,000 or two years gaol, hardly a matter of flippancy to be dismissed by the Minister responsible for the administration of this Act. The Privacy Commissioner is investigating this matter now. He is investigating matters that have been raised properly through his office directly to him by the honourable member for Moreton. He is investigating those matters as he should and as he must.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not just these specific elements of the statutory law which I have referred to. I think those of us, at least on this side, with some political motivation founded on principle, with some belief in democracy have some notion and attitude that every right of intrusion which is vested in public officials must carry with it corresponding duties and they must be adhered to. That rights-duties notion does not sit well with a government that seeks to impose many more duties and responsibilities on the public sector. In fact, through that, the duty undoubtedly is on the Treasurer to ensure that the misbehaviour that is occurring ends. The consequences go beyond the breaches of privacy. What are the criminal elements? What are the opportunities for getting access to information unlawfully? What about the prosecutions that are going on now in Western Australia as a consequence of people being able to get into the Australian Taxation Office, get tax files and tax file numbers as well?</PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the Treasurer should be putting his attention towards what ought to be done. Firstly, such mailing actually seems unnecessary. I was moved to interject at Question Time when he was saying how helpful the Tax Office was. I could not help thinking of the old joke that went, among other things: `I'm from the Government and I'm here to help you'. I would say: What was the purpose of the mailing in the first place? The recipients were not people who had to apply for a tax file number; they were being reminded of it.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Moreton will no doubt explain the motivation because he has been to the Tax Office on this issue, but if it is necessary registered mail ought be used. Those opposite say, `Oh, what about the cost?'. I remind them that when they first floated this notion of the tax file number, they told us that it would bring in more than $2 billion worth of revenue. That was subsequently brought back to some $400m. That was enough for members of the Opposition, who are motivated to stamp out the black economy, to see whether we could assist in getting an effective mechanism which properly attended to privacy conditions-a mechanism that the Labor Party regarded in a conference document as being absolutely essential. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable members opposite that the Labor Party, at its conference in 1988, passed a resolution with regard to privacy. I simply refer to one subsection of the resolution in an article headed `Labor updates Constitutional, Legal Platform'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Labor will provide that the introduction of any national identification scheme, tax file number system or other government intrusion upon privacy will be accompanied by safeguards protecting the privacy of the individuals private and confidential information. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not being done. In the terminology of the analagous legislation which we rejected, namely, the Australia Card, the little fellow himself, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) at Question Time, as reported in Hansard on 15 September 1987, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Let me make it clear, Madam Speaker, that there will be no leakage, release of information . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He is at it again. He says one thing and does another. Under this Government faults and breaches, as I say, are always someone else's. Whether it is the balance of payments, the consumer price index, the tax file number, it is always someone else. There is always someone who is sought to be sacrificed by the Treasurer on the altar of his own arrogance. We are seeing it done again on what the Government regards as a simple matter. The Treasurer will not even come in to discuss this matter. Not for him the privacy of the individual. Not for him anything that goes to the interests of people. People? He comes in here and talks to me about holding press conferences. I have had more press conferences than he has had breakfasts. What does he do during an election campaign? Sure, he attaches himself, as I reminded honourable members last year, to a press conference, because that is all he does. We never see him in the supermarkets; we never see him in the pubs; we never see him in the shopping centres or with people in aged persons' homes. All his remarks are in the clinical atmosphere of a press conference. Why? Because he cannot be with people. What flows through from that is an absolute disregard of people's rights, of their entitlements, of what they value in a democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party proclaims in its platform its belief in preserving the privacy of the individual when it introduces legislation such as this. It is about time it backed it up and put pressure on the sanctimonious creature who comes in here and poses as a Treasurer, trampling over people's rights. It is time to straighten out the legislation so that there is some confidence in what is supposed to be an effective and equitable system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Speaker indicated that a matter of public importance was to be raised today I noted that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), was less than enthusiastic in embracing it. But he has given a spirited performance, though not saying a great deal about what was in it. Of course, he launched into the tradition that we have come to expect from the other side, and that is of trying to tear down the Treasurer (Mr Keating), to suggest to the people of this country that he is not enthusiastic in his job. We totally reject that and suggest to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that in the past he may well have had more press conferences than the Treasurer has had hot breakfasts, but that was said in envy of any previous success that he may or may not have had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think a couple of points need to be clearly understood at the start in respect of the particular issue which has triggered this matter of public importance. That, of course, was the error-it is in error and it has been recognised as such by the Australian Taxation Office-in sending out letters to people in three States or Territories of Australia concerning their tax file numbers. What needs to be clearly understood is the basis on which that was done. As we all know, as of 1 April this year a new tax file position comes into force. If someone has not provided his tax file number by that time, he could be liable for paying tax at the highest marginal rate. In order to assist taxpayers of Australia the Tax Office determined that it would send letters to taxpayers for whom it had records, in respect of their existing tax file numbers, to confirm with them that those tax file numbers were still operable and that they would subsequently need to fill in the appropriate forms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commissioner went straight to the Privacy Commissioner. He did not race off to a press conference, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) would have done, to make outrageous statements, for example, about the collection of household information by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and what a dreadful thing that might be. He did not race off to a press conference and say that a person had received a tax file number when he had been dead for seven years. He did not say: `Oh my goodness, isn't this terrible? Oh, what a terrible breakdown in security, in the privacy of tax files'. He did not do that. He said, `We will rectify it. We will go to the Privacy Commissioner, put our cards on the table and get it sorted out'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is exactly what happened. This whole issue of privacy is an absolute laugh. What an absolute joke it is for the honourable member for Kooyong to come in here and lecture us about privacy and lecture this Government about what the Opposition would do to try to enhance the provisions of privacy and security in this legislation. He said-and I agree with him-that he and the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) made an important and significant contribution to the tax file number legislation because they pointed out some difficulties about enforcing privacy. A Privacy Commissioner was the result of that, and we congratulate honourable members for taking that bipartisan approach on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> But that was it. Terrific. They did the job. Why come in here and crow about it now? Why come in and say, `We said you should have a Privacy Commissioner, but obviously sending a letter to a dead person has proved that the job is not being done.'? That is a totally fallacious and spurious argument. It does not hold up when we know what is being done in the Tax Office to overcome the difficulties of privacy and security that really matter; that is, to stop information about people getting through to other people in the community to whom we would rather not see it go, or to other agencies, whether they be government agencies or others. What absolute nonsense it is to suggest that we on this side would not be concerned with issues such as that. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important to get to the heart of this matter in respect of privacy concerns and what has been put in place by the Tax Office itself. Let us get the question of confidentiality of taxpayer information on the record. There are strict safeguards incorporated in the tax file number legislation. That will quite clearly ensure that the use of the tax file number for maintaining records is restricted to the Australian Taxation Office, which is where it should be. No-one can request a tax file number unless authorised to do so by legislation which has been through both Houses of Parliament. No-one can keep a record of another person's tax file number, use the number in their records or divulge it to another person unless authorised to do so. To overcome that, and to ensure that people will not do that, there are severe penalties, as the honourable member for Kooyong mentioned in his speech this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> There is bipartisanship here. I do not know why the honourable member for Kooyong was getting so flustered. I suppose that is why he had to make a personal attack on the Treasurer; he had nothing to say, as always. The Privacy Act, which took effect from 1 January 1989, includes guidelines for tax file number record-keepers on measures that should be taken to protect personal privacy. Those guidelines are clear and specify particular matters. I refer the honourable member for Moreton and anybody else on the other side to the document that has been published by the Australian Taxation Office dated December 1988 entitled Updated Tax File Number Information Kit. They will there see a number of documents presented. Firstly, there is one entitled An Overview of the Tax File Number Legislation. It is written in terms of cat, dog and rat so that even those opposite can understand it, and it says very clearly what it does mean. Secondly, there is one written in even clearer language entitled Provisions for the Protection of Individual Privacy. It outlines all the guidelines-they may be interim guidelines but nevertheless guidelines-for privacy and tax file numbers. If one goes to section 4 on page 4 under the heading `Use and Disclosure of Tax File Number Information', it sets out who can use it and how it will be operated. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned that there was a little bit of bipartisanship here. I refer honourable members who have spoken in this debate to a number of documents which have been published by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which I chair; this Committee, of course, has members from both sides of the House. The three documents that I refer to are a report from the former Expenditure Committee, chaired by your good self, Mr Deputy Speaker, in September 1986 entitled A Taxing Problem, which looked at five efficiency audits of the Australian Taxation Office. Another report is A Taxing Review-Review of Six Efficiency Audits of the Australian Taxation Office. The final one is entitled A Tale of Three Cities, which was a review of an efficiency audit of the Australian Taxation Office on taxpayers in unincorporated businesses. In every one of those reports, which incidentally were totally supported by every member of the Committee, both Opposition and Government members-there were no dissenting reports-the recommendations were that there be an upgraded tax file numbering system put into place with appropriate privacy safeguards. In the course of deliberations on that issue, I suggest that those honourable members opposite who are criticising the Australian Taxation Office for what they have or have not put in place in terms of privacy safeguards should go particularly to the transcript of evidence of the Committee that looked at the question of taxpayers in unincorporated businesses. The transcript of evidence, which is a public record and was incorporated into the records of the Parliament, shows that not only has the Australian Taxation Office said that a tax file number system is important in improving the efficiency of the tax system in this country but so has the independent Australian Audit Office. It is most enlightening to go to these documents. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the question of security is concerned, one of the leading members of the Australian Taxation Office in this area, when giving evidence to the Committee, said that, because of concerns raised by some people, encryption was now being utilised by the Australian Taxation Office so that computer fraud and hacking could not take effect and that, through the in-dial facilities that are utilised in the Australian Taxation Office, information would be protected because of this encryption. He went on to say that a number of other measures were being taken to improve security. He mentioned that passwords were required at the terminals themselves and that right through the various levels of users in the Australian Taxation Office-on the terminals, at the main frame computer and so on-one had to have passwords and that variation gradings of security clearances were necessary. The whole system would stop people with a personal computer, as was suggested in a ludicrous press release put out by Senator Bishop, or using similar sorts of exercises breaking into the Australian Taxation Office in order to get access to information. Those privacy matters were obviously of great concern. The press release goes on to say that the question of the access to that data base was most important. Again I refer honourable members to that transcript of evidence. Mr Highfield, from the Australian Taxation Office, and their computer expert, Mr Seymour, were talking about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax file number system is, as I keep saying, solely administered by and from the Australian Taxation Office. There is no electronic link between the computer installations at the Office and other agencies. There is no intention to create one. So the ability for people to tap in does not exist. I take honourable members back to the good old days here a couple of years ago when people were saying that the Deakin centre was a terrible location where everyone's records of everything they have ever done in this country were being kept on this massive computer. Members from both sides of the House, including the Finance and Public Administration Committee and the Public Accounts Committee, went there to have a look at it. What did they find? They found a building that had windows, a computer and computer terminals, a building where it was not possible for all the storage capacity of Australia to be kept. That just shows how ludicrous those comments were. But some of those claims are still around today. I categorically state, on evidence submitted on the public record, that that just does not occur; that there is every opportunity taken by the Office to protect the data it collects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Only authorised Tax Office staff will have access to the information held on the taxpayer data base.

As I am sure the honourable member knows, that refers to social security exchange of information so that people can properly assess income tax liability. I am sure he has no objections to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat that Tax Office staff have access limited to those areas necessary for their work. The fact that the terminals are there, that passwords are necessary, that the computer is there and that all these people who work there have secrecy provisions imposed upon them by the Government means that the opportunity just does not exist. The evidence is overwhelming. I have a stack of it here, and I refer it to the honourable member. As I said a little earlier, I would suggest that the problem was created by the sending out of those letters. It created unnecessary anxiety in the minds of people. The Commissioner of Taxation and the Treasurer have responded to that. I believe that there is a lesson there and that it has been learned. The Privacy Commissioner is satisfied. The Tax Commissioner has put methods in place to overcome difficulties in the future. I, for one, am convinced that the difficulties envisaged will not arise. I believe that the tax file number system will be an important adjunct to improving the efficiency of the tax system in this country. It is certainly needed, as has been proven in the evidence not only to my Committee but to many other committees of the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not like the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) to be my custodian if he so easily accepts the assurances he has been so prepared to accept. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Commissioner of Taxation have both acknowledged already that they cannot provide a failsafe guarantee that more letters are not going to be sent out to the deceased and to people who have changed their address in the last year. Yet honourable members opposite have the audacity to stand here, lecturing us on the propriety of the Commissioner of Taxation and the Treasurer. They have not only conceded their mass errors but also told us that they will continue with the system, but that they have satisfactorily minimised the extent of the errors. The requirements of the Act apply equally to the Taxation Commissioner and the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday in this Parliament the Treasurer blamed the people for all this. He said that a breach of the Privacy Act occurred only when a misdirected letter was opened and that the opener, and not the Australian Taxation Office, would have committed the breach. He said that it was not the fault of the Tax Office; it was the fault of the opener of the letter. Section 11 of the Privacy Act defines the Taxation Commissioner as a recipient of the tax file numbers. Section 28 of the Act has already been alluded to by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock); but it is so important and so significant that it is worth repeating. That section states that the Privacy Commissioner has the following functions. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> (d) to examine the records of the Commissioner of Taxation to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) he or she-</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the Commissioner of Taxaton; in this instance it is a he-Mr Trevor Boucher-</PARA>
<PARA>is taking adequate measures to prevent the unlawful disclosure of the tax file number information that he-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Boucher-</PARA>
<PARA>or she holds . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We then go into the guidelines for the security of tax file number information. Guideline 3.2 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax file number recipients-</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the Taxation Commissioner-</PARA>
<PARA>shall take all reasonable steps in the circumstances to ensure that security safeguards and procedures are in place to prevent unauthorised access to, modification or disclosure of, and loss of, such information, whether that information is stored in physical or electronic form. </PARA>
<PARA>There is not very much that is electronic about a letter. It is very uncomplicated. It is stored, and the Tax Office is not supposed to lose it. That places on the Taxation Commissioner, if he must post out letters-he does not even have to post them to people-the responsibility, not to get it nearly right, but to get it 100 per cent right. If he is a jerry builder who has an attitude of `near enough is good enough', let him come out into the open now and say, `That is my policy. That is my approach. Near enough is good enough'. He should not hide behind this lairy language of satisfactorily minimising the chances of errors. He is a jerry builder. It boils down to `near enough is good enough'. I contend that, in an issue as important as this, it is a totally reckless and irresponsible approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur, tried to portray a picture of Mr Boucher running along to the Privacy Commissioner and saying, `Help. I think I have made a mistake. Guide me'. I will tell honourable members why Mr Boucher had to front the Privacy Commissioner. It was because I dobbed him in. It is as simple as that. My telephone was ringing like that in a starting price bookmaker's shop, with people whose spouses were deceased ringing. One of my constituents had three letters in his letter box at home and one in his post office box-all belonging to other people. He said, `I have five tax file numbers. What am I going to do?'. I was not going to say, `Go your hardest'. Not me! This is the type of gross error that has been made. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot guarantee the system. It has admitted that it cannot guarantee it. It is all right to come in and try to belittle the Opposition for raising this issue; but the realities are that, in government, one has an obligation to ensure that the administration of the country works properly. Honourable members opposite cannot say, as the Treasurer has said, `Do not blame me. I am going back to my office'. He has sent in a couple of yearlings to run his race. He cannot follow that approach. He has to face the music. No more important thing has been put in place in recent months than the requirement for every person to have a tax file number and the use that is being made of it. It has become necessary only because of the growth of taxation levels in this country. If the Hawke Government was not into people's pockets to the extent that it has been, people would not have turned in such numbers to tax cheating, as sadly we have been told they have. The biggest tax cheat in this country is the Treasurer-nobody else. He is the one who has been into people's pockets. Yet he has the audacity to say, `You all have to have a brand because I cannot trust you'. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the words of the Privacy Commissioner, as reported in the media a couple of days ago. The Privacy Commissioner has a responsibility to ensure that a post-out system is watertight-or there should be no post-out at all. The media reported him as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr O'Connor said he would ask Mr Boucher to adopt a more secure system if the Tax Office continued sending the numbers after the computer check. </PARA>
<PARA>We now have the computer being blamed. It is interesting to refer to a press release that Mr Boucher put out a couple of days ago. Listen to this. He said that the problems arose because in some cases the Tax Office had not been notified of a change in address. I ask honourable members: how can dead people notify changes of address? The father of the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) passed away in September 1982. Whom do honourable members think the Taxation Office wrote to? It wrote to the father of the honourable member for Fadden. I have constituents whose loved ones passed away five or six years ago. Only two days ago another case came to the notice of my office. A man received a letter addressed to a woman he did not know had ever lived in his house. He started checking and found that she had left that address eight years previously. He rang her to tell her that he had her tax file number. She said, `I have not put in a return for 12 years. What are they writing to me for? I am an old lady. I am a war widow. Leave me alone'. That is the type of careless, sloppy approach that is causing people on this side to be concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us go back to the Privacy Commissioner. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I will discuss with him-</PARA>
<PARA>meaning Mr Boucher-</PARA>
<PARA>that if he wishes to continue the circulation of the numbers, a more secure system could be developed. In areas of privacy, it is desirable that the situation be stopped until it is sorted out. </PARA>
<PARA>Fancy that! He knows it all. Good on him. Mr O'Connor's first job, his first official complaint, was probably the letter I sent to him on 17 February. He knows what it is in theory. But honourable members opposite have no right to badger the Privacy Commissioner and say, `We have to get these letters out', when there is no real need to send out the letters. And honourable members opposite have admitted it, because Mr Boucher has continually claimed that the only reason the letters are being sent out is to help the public. There is no real need to do it; it is a public relations act. The system has been put in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has fulfilled many of the predictions that were made in terms of the inability of any government to give secure guarantees. The Government should stop the post-out now. Its system will work without the post-out. But it should not subject another 320,000 people to errors, because 17.5 per cent of the people change their address annually and each year 120,000 people die. The Government will make tens of thousands of mistakes in the weeks ahead. It should stop the post-out now while it is in a position to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The people in the gallery today can see what the Liberal Party and the National Party are on about. All they are on about is having a bit of a laugh and a chuckle down here; not about the legislation. What they are having a laugh and a chuckle about amongst themselves is the fact that an error was made in the Australian Taxation Office-an error that has been admitted by the Commissioner-in sending out notices to people who should not have received them. One has to ask why this matter of public importance has been raised today. The only reason we have it is the actions of the Australian Taxation Office. As the Commissioner has pointed out, he has apologised and said that it should not have happened, and he and his staff are trying to make sure that it does not happen again. But that is the whole thing: this Opposition really does not have a focal point; it does not have any policies; there is nothing of substance in its attacks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All the House heard from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) was a frothy attack, playing to the gallery, much like the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) did. It was all froth and bubble and no substance. Yet the honourable member for Moreton has the audacity to start lecturing us about tax cheating. He is a member of a party that opposed every measure that this Government introduced to put some decency into the taxation system. When we ended entertainment expenses, who opposed it? It was the Liberal Party and the National Party. Entertainment expenses enabled people to go out on slush accounts and book it up to the taxpayer. We said that was not fair. They said it was fair and they fought us tooth and nail. </PARA>
<PARA> With the fringe benefits tax, where previously one could take fringe benefits instead of cash as one's income and pay tax only on one's cash income and pass the rest on to the taxpayer, who opposed that? It was the Liberal Party and the National Party once again. Who opposed the capital gains tax? It was the Liberal Party and the National Party once again. Every measure that we have brought in to make the taxation system decent has been opposed by the Liberal Party and the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> They opposed the introduction of the upgraded tax file number when it was first introduced, and that did not surprise us, given their track record of opposing every measure to make the taxation system more decent. You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, as would the people of Australia, that we moved to make the taxation system decent, taking it away from the painters and dockers days of the Opposition when they were in government, when the rorts were so open that anyone who had access to a smart accountant or lawyer could pay no tax at all. In fact one of their own commissioners told them-in words such as these-that it was not a matter of the rich paying their fair share of tax; it was whether the rich paid any tax at all. That was the sort of system that Opposition members were happy to have when they were in government. They have opposed everything we have done. Yet they come in here today and the honourable member for Moreton talks about tax cheating. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the measures we have introduced, we have dropped the top tax rate from 60c, which Opposition members were happy to have when they were in government, down to 49c. The 48c rate has gone down to 40c. And for the people on low incomes, the 30c bottom rate which Mr Howard was happy to have as Treasurer has gone down to 24c, and we are going to lower it again this year. That has only been possible because we have repaired the taxation system, despite the opposition of the hecklers who have lectured us today about the upgraded tax file number. I never noticed in any of their attacks any mention of the fact that the legislation-for which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has responsibility-was deficient. There was not one word about the legislation. This whole argument and the whole waste of time of the House put up by the Opposition was because letters were sent out by the Australian Taxation Office, and-</PARA>

For pure audacity it takes a lot to knock off a Liberal. When one goes back and has a look at some of the press reports in the days when we passed this legislation, one starts having a look at the impact that they had. The simple fact is that when this Government brought that legislation in, it did not bulldoze it through the Parliament. We took account of everything that the Opposition parties said. A report in the Sun-Herald of 30 October last year said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senior Opposition sources said that Mr Brown would recommend to shadow Cabinet tomorrow that it accept the Bill following the Government's acceptance of virtually all Opposition amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been acknowledged by this side of the Parliament that the Opposition did play a very constructive role in putting up amendments that in our view strengthened the Bill. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) must take some credit for that. He at least saw the need for this legislation and was prepared to work with the Government. We acknowledge his contribution. Another report, in the Sydney Morning Herald of 1 November-and this is interesting in view of the fact that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition raised this matter of public importance-states:</PARA>
<PARA>At that point-</PARA>
<PARA>and we are talking about a break in a shadow Cabinet meeting-</PARA>
<PARA>the shadow Treasurer, Mr Peacock, sent a letter to the Treasurer saying the Opposition would support the Bill if the Government agreed to three new Coalition amendments to strengthen privacy safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA>And the Government's response, reported in the same article:</PARA>
<PARA>Only three hours later, Mr Keating wrote back saying that a full meeting of the Hawke ministry had agreed to the changes. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet today the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has come in here criticising the privacy provisions of this legislation, about which he wrote a letter to the Treasurer, and the Treasurer acknowledged his letter by saying that he agreed to the changes. </PARA>

Now the powder puffs are up here again today, getting stuck into us about privacy. In the transcript of what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had to say, there is not one word about the privacy requirements of this legislation that he attacked. There is not one attack that can be substantiated against the Treasurer. Then we have all this mock horror about the Treasurer not being here. Why should he be? The Treasurer has done everything right. The Treasurer does not have to answer non-attacks. Why should he? He has better things to do than sit around here like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When it comes to privacy, this Government has done everything it can to make sure that the privacy requirements under this legislation have been upheld and the Treasurer, in Question Time today, reiterated that. While I am talking about privacy, I can remember last year that the Western Mail of Western Australia, as it was then, had a front page article reporting that records of the Western Australian Police Force were being sold to people-that is, the names and addresses, incomes and ranks of police officers in Western Australia were being sold on a commercial basis. That was being openly flaunted on the front page of a major newspaper in Western Australia. I took that matter up with the Privacy Foundation, but I never received a reply, in spite of writing to it twice. I have never heard a member of the Opposition here take up that issue or any other issue to do with privacy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I second the motion. The reason that the Opposition is so keen to present this is the importance of the issue. Had I had a little longer to speak earlier, I would have mentioned the fact that in the next day or so the Commissioner of Taxation intends posting out more than four million more letters, and those letters will be addressed to some 320,000 people who would have shifted since they put in their last tax return, and quite a number will be sent to people who unfortunately have met their demise since that time. It is not a flippant issue, as the two Government speakers endeavoured to portray it as being earlier this afternoon. It is a most serious issue, because this tax file number system is supposed to have total integrity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yet the Commissioner of Taxation is about to commence reposting, after having sent 1.1 million letters to Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, of which more than 50,000 to 60,000 went astray, being wrongly addressed. He is now about to resume posting and claims it is all right to resume posting on the basis that he has satisfactorily minimised the error content. If he is going to use as a yardstick those who put in tax returns for the 1987-88 year and post letters to all those people in Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia, there is going to be an error rate in excess of 300,000. That means there are going to be some 300,000 letters floating across those States which may end up in anybody's hands and could be subjected to misuse. It is important for the ordinary citizen that this should not happen, because if people are as dishonest as we are told they are, people will be able to misuse those numbers when they obtain a job and the like. Some time down the track poor old John Brown, the person whom the number was originally intended for, will suddenly be told by the Australian Taxation Office that he has not paid tax or declared all his income. That is how serious it is. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the two junior Government members came in here describing it as a matter of mirth and laughter about which the Opposition is not serious. Well, we are serious. We are putting the Government to the test right now. The motion before the House calls on the Government to take all reasonable steps to ensure that security safeguards and proceedings are in place--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I can speak to that very easily and just as quickly. The reason we are taking this as seriously as we are is that we believe that the issue is so vitally important and that the whole tax file information system deserves to be secure and safe and, more importantly, it is a right of the citizens of this country that we, as a parliament, have an obligation to protect. That is why we are moving for the suspension of Standing Orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been watching the Government Ministers over there in a total flurry, not knowing how to handle it. They do not want to let us present it. They are obviously on the run because they are embarrassed. The whole tax file thing has been an utter fiasco and an utter disgrace of administration of the worst order. The Taxation Commissioner will blame people who did not write back saying that they have shifted, and that will include dead people. People do not have an obligation to keep writing to the Taxation Commissioner. Once is bad enough as far as the vast majority of the population is concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of National Medical Cyclotron facility, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed public work provides for the construction of a building at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney to house the national medical cyclotron, associated laboratories and facilities for radiopharmaceutical production. The work also includes refurbishment of a nearby patient clinic to house a position emission tomography (PET) camera and a rapid transfer system linking it with the cyclotron building. </PARA>
<PARA> The national medical cyclotron will be used to produce radioisotopes for the immediate medical application of ultra short life radioisotopes in the clinical positron emission tomography (PET) centre facility at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney; and for the nationwide distribution to other major hospitals in Australia of the longer life radioisotopes used in other medical applications. In this latter role, the cyclotron will complement the HIFAR reactor at Lucas Heights and will ensure that the complete range of radioisotopes is, for the first time, readily accessible to medicine in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The cyclotron and associated laboratories will be housed in one building. It will comprise a basement for the storage and treatment of radioactive waste, a ground floor to accommodate the cyclotron and laboratories, and a first floor for offices and plant room. The cyclotron will be the focus of the building and will be housed within a 1.9 metre-thick concrete vault. Careful consideration has been given to the safe handling of radioactive substances. To prevent accidental releases, the facility has been designed on the principle of double containment and all waste products will be controlled. An essential feature of the total proposal is the refurbishment of part of the second floor of the hospital's Albert Pavilion to house the PET centre in the mainstream clinical area. The PET camera is being funded separately by the hospital. The third major component of the work is the construction of a transfer system to deliver the products of the cyclotron to patients in the PET centre. Because of the very short radioactive half lives of the radioisotopes used in PET, their time in transit must be minimal. The cyclotron building will be linked to the PET centre by an underground conduit between the buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> The cyclotron building has been designed to follow the pavilion style of other buildings in the hospital complex. The limit of cost estimate for the building works totals $8.9m at January 1988 prices. This is slightly less than half the total project cost, including equipment, consultant fees and training. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation will manage and supervise construction of the cyclotron as well as the installation and commissioning of major equipment. In collaboration, the hospital planning staff will manage and supervise construction of the PET facility and transfer link. Completion is envisaged about 20 months after approval. I believe it is expedient that this work be carried out and I commend the motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of new Communications and Recruit Schools at HMAS Cerberus, Crib Point, Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed work now before the House is for new communications and recruit schools at HMAS Cerberus, 70 kilometres south-east of Melbourne. This proposal is the second phase of a staged redevelopment of facilities at HMAS Cerberus, which is one of the principal training establishments for Royal Australian Navy personnel. The first stage of the redevelopment is nearing completion, with several facilities, including a marina and boat ramp, already in operation. The bulk of the works, including a new seamanship school and a wharf, are due to be completed by mid-1989. On 8 March 1989 the Public Works Committee tabled a favourable report recommending that construction of this second stage of the redevelopment should proceed. The Committee is also currently considering a proposal for the upgrading of living-in accommodation at HMAS Cerberus and I expect that its report on this stage of the redevelopment will be tabled in the House later this session. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this current proposal is for the provision of new facilities for the communications and recruit schools. At present the Communications School provides over 50 courses ranging from the traditional morse and flags through to complex electronic equipment training. The Recruit School offers a 12-week basic training course for new Royal Australian Navy personnel, as well as shorter courses for Royal Australian Navy Reserve recruits. At present the activities of both these schools are carried out in a number of facilities located on the base. These facilities are generally unsatisfactory for the training activities of both schools and most will be demolished to allow construction of the new works. The communications and recruit schools' functions will be temporarily relocated to enable training programs to continue during this construction period. The works proposed for the new communications school are a two-storey building and an adjacent outdoor visual training area. The facilities to be provided include: both general purpose classrooms and special purpose technical rooms fitted with communications equipment; a lecture theatre and library; and administration and instructors offices. The proposed recruit school involves two new buildings: an administrative instructional building with an adjacent partially covered parade ground; and a recruit amenities and functions building including a canteen and recreation centre. The estimated cost of this proposal is $15.95m at April 1988 prices, comprising $9.8m for the communications school and $6.15m for the recruit school. This equates to $16.68m at January 1989 prices.</PARA>
<PARA> Subject to the approval of the House to proceed, it is intended to call the first tenders in mid-1989. The on-site work force during the construction period is expected to peak at between 110 and 120. The facilities for both schools are expected to be completed by the end of 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> HMAS Cerberus has both historical and heritage significance. It was the first training establishment created specifically for the Royal Australian Navy and has been in operation for over 60 years. Today there are still a large number of traditional buildings on the base as well as formal gardens and tracts of natural coastal land of ecological importance. In its report the committee acknowledges the efforts of both the Department of Defence and my Department's Australian Construction Services in designing buildings which will be in sympathy with the historic character of the base. The Committee further considers the merit in involving heritage organisations in consultations on heritage issues at an early phase in the planning process. In all major Commonwealth development proposals such as this my Department ensures that the necessary requirements of the Heritage Act are always undertaken. To this end consultations will occur. I would like to thank the Committee for the support that it has given to this proposal, and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose this motion that the Government has moved, concerning the communication and recruit schools and HMAS Cerberus. This facility will obviously be of some use and will be warmly welcomed, in particular, by those personnel involved with the Royal Australian Navy. I note that the facility will cost $16.7m. That represents a fairly small part of the total capital works program of the Commonwealth in 1988-89 of $3.4 billion. Of course, that includes the off-Budget authorities as well as on-Budget funding, which in itself is $2.2 billion, a 17 per cent increase over the previous year's figure. In passing I point out the incredible fact that some 50 per cent of all non-residential construction in Australia is carried out by the Commonwealth, State and local governments. That is an enormously high proportion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Public Works Committee is obliged to examine projects such as this work done at HMAS Cerberus. One of the things I would like the Public Works Committee to do in the future when it is looking at these projects-which it has not done in this particular case-is to examine the most efficient and cost-effective way of constructing these sorts of facilities and not to take on face value figures and proposals that the Government puts forward to the Committee in terms of methods of construction. For example, I have argued in this House for some time that the Government should be considering, on its own construction projects, greater use of subcontractors than is currently the case. There is no doubt whatsoever that taxpayers' money would be saved on the HMAS Cerberus project as well as most of the other Commonwealth projects-we are talking about $2.2 billion-worth of projects in an on-Budget sense and $3.4 billion altogether including off-Budget authorities-if greater use of sub-contractors was made. Hundreds of millions of dollars could be saved. We could save about 20 per cent of the cost of a project like this through the use of subcontractors. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of concern to me that the Government does not consider the use of subcontractors to be consistent with its industrial relations policy and broader industrial objectives. We on this side of the House consider the protection of the taxpayers' dollar to be one of the fundamental responsibilities of this Parliament. I would hope that in the future the Public Works Committee takes up that responsibility and receives from the Minister a specific reference to examine the cost savings that could come from the use of the subcontracting system rather than the current system which the Government uses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was perhaps very appropriate that yesterday when we began debating this measure, relatively minor in itself, it was International Women's Day because that provides ample justification for the Opposition's amendment which has the effect of enlarging the debate beyond the narrow area of equal employment opportunity for women legislation as such. I will return to that. Nevertheless, the legislation before the House, the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill, makes some amendments, appropriate in themselves, primarily to the 1986 Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act and it is not opposed by the Opposition. I recall that the Opposition supported that Act in the pursuit of its strong commitment to genuine equal opportunity in employment and the removal of discrimination and its strong commitment to equal opportunity and appointment based on merit, but without positive discrimination. The Opposition parted company with the Government in respect of the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Bill in 1987-ironically, a measure with a softer title than the 1986 measure. It did this because that Bill, now an Act, took what we judged as a definite step towards specific and quantitative equal employment opportunity programs which were in effect the equivalent of quotas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not reopen that old debate but it was at that time that I, among others, parted company with the more radical feminists. All along I was an advocate of a voluntary approach to this issue as the preferred way forward. At the time that was not just a cop-out. In 1986 there was a mechanism ready to hand. In September of that year, under the auspices of the Business Council of Australia, a decision was taken to establish a private sector council for equal employment opportunity as a positive self-regulation initiative with the objective of fostering the continuing goodwill of business and the securing of a genuine commitment in the private sector to equality of opportunity programs. It was my view then that such a private sector, self-managed and voluntary approach had a great deal to offer in achieving really effective and meaningful change towards greater equality of opportunity in employment for women. </PARA>
<PARA> At all events, at this remove I believe it can be fairly said that the battle in principle, of the importance of equal opportunity for women and awareness of the issue, has largely been won. Mr Paddy McGuinness yesterday in the Australian referred to that as one of the great social advances of the past few decades. The battle, as I say, has largely been won and the pressing of positive discrimination for women via a continuing insistence on formal quotas and the like, while it may on the surface appear to ameliorate perceived discrimination, brings problems and disadvantages of itself, including the demeaning of women generally as actual appointments of women are put down by the suggestion that `she got the job just because she is a woman'. That, equally, goes against genuine equality of opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of equal employment opportunity and, indeed, of enhancing the lifestyle, status and fair and equitable treatment of women goes much further than this as set out in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). The amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> `whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its effective discrimination against women through the pursuit of policies which are biased against families and which have resulted in six years of declining living standards of women and their families'. </PARA>
<PARA>This is particularly so in the tax area. This is, of course, the highest taxing government in the history of Australia. We have seen that impact on families on average weekly earnings through an increase from about 17 per cent in 1983 to 23 to 24 per cent today in the proportion of their income which goes in tax. The recent authoritative study by the respected Australian Institute of Family Studies shows that this fall in disposable income is greater for families than for single people and greater for ordinary middle income taxpayers than for those on higher incomes. In particular I refer to page 10 of that report which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Families have done worse than single persons-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, over the period from 1976-77 to 1988-89, but particularly from 1984-85 to 1988-89-</PARA>
<PARA>and the extent of their loss rises with the number of their children. This difference between single persons and families relates to the fall in the real value of the family components in the tax system. In 1976-77, a taxpayer on AWE with a spouse and two children was given a 46 per cent reduction in tax compared to a single person. By 1988-89, their percentage had dropped to 26 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Under this present Government's tax system, it costs to opt for the role of remaining at home as wife and mother looking after children. What is not recognised is the cost of having children. The reform of this system is important. We hear about tax cuts which are in the offing, but in many ways this is a phoney exercise. What has happened is that the recent and prospective increases in home loan interest rates and mortgage payments result in the average Australian family paying for these tax cuts in advance, so to speak. It is paying out more, due to those rises in interest rates and mortgage payments, than the amount of the promised tax cuts to be given in July. The fact is that, even with the July tax cuts, Australians will not break even until early 1991, given the cost of increasing interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area in which women are not treated as fairly and as equitably as one would wish is in the industrial relations area which is the real crunch area. There is no doubt that the rigidity and inflexibility of the Australian wages and industrial relations systems are major factors inhibiting greater opportunity for women. What is needed is part time work and, in particular, more permanent part time work with hours attuned to the requirements of a woman who is a mother getting as much time as possible with her young children. The rigidity of present awards often rules this out. I draw attention to the fact that the centrepiece of the Opposition's industrial relations policy is voluntary employment agreements where appropriate hours of work would be a key element in the whole negotiation. In this way our industrial relations approach in introducing greater flexibility in all aspects of the employer-employee situation, particularly in relation to hours, very much meets the needs of families in the 1980s, where increasing numbers of married women want part time work as an alternative to the often difficult choice between full time work on the one hand and staying at home full time on the other. In this way the industrial relations policy of the Opposition is very important indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many reports about the concerns of the Labor Party and the Government at the so-called gender voting gap in the electorate-the falling off in support for the Government, particularly among women. So what happens? We are told that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) got the members of the Government together and, among other things, said, `You have got to moderate your language', referring especially to Paul, whose macho accent is putting women voters off. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Especially the Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), whose macho accent was said to be putting the women voters off. What a line it was! As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said, how old fashioned, chauvinistic, out of date, and patronising can one be to Australian women. The truth is that the falling off in support by Australian women for the Hawke Government has nothing to do with Paul's speech, coarse as it often is, or with the accent of any other member of the Government. It has everything to do with the manifest decline in living standards under this Government as tax and mortgage payment hikes and inflation eat away at the real disposable incomes of ordinary families. It is Australian women, mothers and wives in particular, who come up against it in the supermarkets, who have to cope with the shrinking purchasing power of the household income. It is the opportunity and a fair go for women in the wider area which is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What underlies the adverse impact on Australian living standards is the failure of the Hawke Government's economic policies. While respected economic writers such as Ross Gittins blazon forth headlines such as `Keating has lost control' and `The Government has lost its way', the Treasurer and the Government fail to tell us in this place about the situation as it is. The Government has lost control; it has lost its way; and the Treasurer has lost credibility. All this is reflected in a falling off not only in the women's vote but also in total support for the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Back at Budget time the Treasurer said that inflation would be down to 4 or 4 1/2 per cent by now. In fact, it is stuck, if not rising, at around 8 per cent, more than double that of our trading partners. The deficit in the balance of payments, according to the Budget, was going to come down to $9.5 billion in 1988-89. After seven months it is already greater than that and it is on course to be of the order of $16 billion-a deficit of $1 billion to $1.5 billion a month; $50m extra into hock every day. The result is that the overseas debt is rising inexorably to and beyond $120 billion-a debt of Third World proportions. This is despite the current favourable high prices for our exports. I ask: What will it be like when the world economy slackens later in the year, as predicted, and export prices weaken?</PARA>
<PARA> I end on this note: I had thought to ask the following as a question at Question Time today, but I raise it now. Early in May 1986 I directed a question to the Treasurer, amidst some hilarity-the content of the question, though, was deadly serious-drawing attention to the precarious state of the Australian economy. A few weeks later that was followed-I do not say it was because of it-by the Treasurer's now famous banana republic statement. With inflation at this time stuck at nearly 8 per cent and the balance of payments deficit in no way abating, a `do nothing' stance by this Government, which is what we have, stemming from election considerations, is the stuff of which market crises and subsequent recession are made. Does the Government accept the awful responsibility of a continued `do nothing' stance, or will it take the decisive action which the gravity of the situation requires?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) has repeated what so many speakers on the other side have done, and that is to change the whole course of this debate. Opposition speakers have attempted not to talk about equal opportunity but to bring in some rather ill-conceived ideas based on their propaganda, the booklet they call Future Directions. I think the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is correct in calling it `Futile Diversions'. Honourable members opposite have tried to bring in a series of figures and facts which do not exist at all. They existed in the past; they exist in the figments of their imaginations. I heard someone describe the Opposition policy and program as looking through the rear vision mirror, giving a very narrow profile of the reality of the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition speakers are thinking only about the good days that occurred perhaps once or twice during a year, thinking of the good examples and ignoring the reality of the past. I suggest that if we were to ask women whether they wanted to return to live in the environment put together by the Opposition of 30 or 40 years ago they would all answer a resounding no, because those were the days before we had more humane divorce laws, before we had more progressive affirmative action laws, and when a woman was not even a supporter but was seen as a chattel. Very often she was seen as a person who had to stay at home. She had no choice. Regardless of the mental, psychological or physical abuse heaped upon her, it was her right and bounden duty in society to put up with that. That was the role of women. And that is what comes through with the return to this rear vision mirror, to this narrow road back into the past, which the Liberal Party would like to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to the industrial relations area. The honourable member for Berowra said that he had put forward and supported the idea of the Business Council of Australia on self-regulation; that, if left to their own devices, women would rise to the top, that they would have an equal place. But we know-women know out there-that, if it had been left to the men who dominate commerce, who dominate academia, who dominate decision making in this country at whatever level and in whatever avenue, there would never have been any change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to accept that we can legislate for certain attitudinal changes, we can legislate to put into practice reforms in areas such as the home, but we cannot legislate to make the behaviour of husbands and wives change; we cannot legislate for men to change their attitudes about the women in their families. We keep out of the home with our legislation, but we have a right, an obligation, to put into place legislation that will oblige employers, businesses, to be non-discriminating, to get rid of discrimination, to get rid of the barriers that prevent the best people from progressing in the employment heirarchy. We can do that. We can put that into place. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Berowra relied upon the Institute of Family Studies booklet launched last week to support the Opposition's claim that somehow families are worse off now. The Opposition has totally confused families with women. It uses the words interchangeably. Women are still the centre of most families but not all families have a female head. Sometimes it is shared; sometimes there is a female head. Most sole families are headed by single mothers struggling to bring up their children. What the Opposition and the Institute of Family Studies did not say is that they were looking purely at how much tax was taken out. They did not consider how much money went from the tax system back to the families. Did we hear anything about the family allowance supplement? Did we hear anything about the cost of medical insurance? No. If we were to look at each individual family on its merits, at how much a family received in education allowances, children going to government schools and how much it costs, if we were to look at medical insurance through Medicare-insurance which families once had to pay for, and two million people in Australia could not afford medical insurance-if we look at the family allowance supplement and not just at this narrow spouse rebate that the honourable member for Berowra and others wanted to talk about, we would get a proper perspective of how much this Government has done for women and families. I will come back to that later. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot has been said by the Opposition about affirmative action in the work place doing nothing for women in the home; that somehow affirmative action in paid employment and education areas, to which this Bill specifically refers, actually denigrates women in the home. That is the most distorted logic I have ever heard. There is nothing further from the truth. What women must have if they are to be liberated, to be equal partners in society-or, as the Chinese say, hold up half the sky-is choice. The more educated, the better accepted in society women are by males the happier and more fulfilled they are going to be. Whether at home or in the work place, across our whole culture, the more choices they have the more fulfilled and liberated they are. It is attitudinal changes we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot legislate for that in the home, but we can do it by example. If a government argues for affirmative action, then a lot of that will rub off on our general mores in society. If we request it and legislate for it in business and in commerce, then as men come to work side by side equally with women and respect them those attitudinal changes, those societal mores, will transfer more and more into the home. They have not yet done so because we know that most women who work still go home and do the majority of the domestic work. When they work they still take on one and a half or two jobs. Men have a long way to go before we will have affirmative action where it should be-an accepted practice in every aspect of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we got now? The demand for pornography and the disregard of a woman's worth in the home are signs of an uncivilised society. Business should be accountable for its sexist advertising, where half-draped women advertise a product that has no relationship to gender. Advertising, business, men's pleasures, still very much see women as sex objects, and until that changes affirmative action will not be deep enough in our society. At least this Government legislates where it can, and that is in the employment area, so that we cut down on women being seen as objects, second rate citizens, and try to elevate them to their proper position, which is a partnership in society. </PARA>
<PARA> The Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill concentrates on higher education. Higher education institutions have been required for the last 2 1/2 years to report on how they will bring about affirmative action in their institutions. They have to report to the Director of Affirmative Action. It is pleasing to know that in an area I have been associated with every higher education institution has fulfilled its reporting obligations. However, we have to improve the system. We can streamline the reporting process by aligning the reporting period, which was the financial year, with the academic or calendar year. Because some States also have affirmative action obligations, we can align both State and Federal reporting requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The new series of amalgamations is going to be very important in the employment of women and men. When several institutions come together a new institution is formed, and we have to ask ourselves whether this is a new employer or a state of continuing employment. If we have a hiatus, how does that fit in with the reporting requirements? What happens to all the programs that have been put into effect in the past 2 1/2 years? This Bill covers those transitional arrangements. Just as the terms and conditions of academic and general staff in the higher institutions are meant to be no less favourable after amalgamation, so it should be that the affirmative action programs continue unabated. This amendment will ensure that the new institutions are not regarded as a new employer for the purposes of affirmative action. There will be no break. </PARA>
<PARA> There is still a lot of confusion in the community about what affirmative action means. It is important for us to consider what it means to the average man and woman in the street. Some people think it means selecting women over men for jobs without considering other qualities which make them suitable for a position; that somehow we are setting quotas; that regardless of their abilities a certain number of women will be promoted to the detriment of the quality of that work force-some form of positive discrimination. The public should be reminded that affirmative action involves dismantling the barriers that deny women equal access to the jobs and careers that are available to men. In fact, appointing the best person for the job is the principle that underpins all affirmative action legislation in Australia. By removing unfair discrimination and developing the potential of the female work force, the legislation is designed to make women competitive rather than to remove competition. It is not a numbers game; it is not a quota exercise. It is about removing discrimination. In fact, Australia would be a better place if we realised the unused potential that is reposed in women who are being denied the opportunity to apply their full potential to the benefit of themselves, their families and society. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that this confusion and misunderstanding is coloured by visitors from overseas. For example, last September a lot of media attention was given to a particular black American academic, Professor Thomas Sowell, a former adviser to President Reagan, a doctor of economics and a disciple of Milton Friedman, the free marketeer. I think the honourable member for Berowra embraces some of those principles, but at times he has said in this House when government should intervene, and I respect him for that. He is not a total free marketeer, although he believes that the market mechanism, where appropriate, should be allowed to operate. I respect him for that, and I have said so on other occasions. Dr Sowell says that affirmative action does not work and that women and blacks in America are rejecting it. He says that what happens is that people are promoted beyond their ability-the Peter principle-and that when they are found out they are either sacked or put out with great embarrassment. Seventy per cent of blacks who are put into universities on quota systems fail their university or higher education courses. </PARA>
<PARA> Affirmative action of that type may well be the American model but it is certainly not the model in Australia. We do not base our affirmative action on preferential treatment or quotas. What Professor Sowell said is that we should have equal opportunity and a larger pool of women for employers and higher education institutions to choose from. He is right on both counts. In Australia equal opportunity is affirmative action. That is how we define it. He is right about having a larger pool of women to choose from. He later admitted that he was here to learn, not to tell us how to do our own job. I hope that actually occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Another observer here was Mrs Monique Gagnon-Tremblay from Canada. She is the Minister responsible for the status of women in Quebec. She observed something that I said earlier in this debate. Her observation, as an outsider, was that there is more resistance by Australian men to adopting and embracing the equality of gender than in her own country. That could well explain the tardiness of some firms to adopt the strategies of affirmative action and report on time on how they were going to achieve affirmative action for women. Quite a few firms, while they did get their reports in on time, were very slow. Perhaps it was because they could not quite grasp what equal opportunities and affirmative action are about. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Gagnon-Tremblay nominated child-care centres as one of the most important areas to achieve equal opportunity. She boasted that Quebec, with a population of some six million, had 750 child-care centres and 55 agencies for family home care, and believed that it was meeting 40 per cent of the demand. The objective is to double that. She sees child-care services as not just for women but for parents at work. Until we start talking about parents as equal partners in bringing up our young children, we will never understand the liberation of women. This Government agrees. Since 1983 we have doubled child-care places and, in a further three years, we will have trebled them. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to Dr Sowell's remarks that we need a larger pool. The more women we have to choose from, the more opportunities there are actually to fulfil the objectives of equal opportunity in the work force and higher education. The Government is working and succeeding to that end. Since the Hawke Government came to office 1.2 million jobs have been created in Australia. Fifty-six per cent-that is, well over half-of the jobs went to women. That gives them an opportunity to choose whether they wish to work outside the home. But their opportunities are concentrated in female positions. Although equal pay operates in this country, they receive only 75 per cent of male earnings. Until women are able to be employed in areas now dominated by men, we will not see equal pay realised. </PARA>
<PARA> Five or six years ago only 44 per cent, less than half, of girls finished year 12. Now it is well over half. At the end of last year, 62 per cent finished year 12. In other words, we have to start at the bottom. If we are to have a wider pool in employment, we have to provide girls with the self-confidence and the skills to swim strongly in that bigger pool. More than 70 per cent of the traineeships created under this Government under the Australian traineeship scheme have been filled by women. This is another example of how girls and young women are being given the opportunity. The jobs, employment and training scheme, the JET scheme, is designed to assist sole parents to re-enter the work force. It is still true that out there in society the work one does defines the person one is and the amount of respect one earns-except for politicians of course. All the Opposition's attacks that we have heard are for nought. The runs are on the board: women are being given a greater chance. Dr Sowell was right: if we are to remove the barriers to selecting women, we have to have more women to choose from. </PARA>
<PARA> We still have a long way to go in higher education. Not every institution has child-care. That must be a top priority for both staff and students. Women academics are heavily clustered in part time positions-not full time-at the lower levels such as tutors and lecturer 3s rather than as lecturers and above. They are clustered in contract positions so that their jobs are not secure, whereas males dominate tenured positions. Until we have greater equality in these aspects of employment, we cannot say that we have finished our task. Until we can point to more equal gender intakes across the disciplines rather than gender concentrations of particular professions and courses, we cannot say that we have finished our task. </PARA>
<PARA> This will be an important task for the higher education advisory committee on affirmative action, which had its first meeting a couple of months ago. The committee should look at the compositions of councils, which are heavily dominated by men. When a vacancy occurs on a council of a university or a college of advanced education, the old boy network still operates. Other men are more likely to fill those positions. As the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), suggested to our Caucus-and the Caucus embraced it-at least 25 per cent of boards, governing bodies and councils should be women and at least 25 per cent men. That is one way of saying it in a non-discriminatory fashion and of encouraging women to apply for those positions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the honourable members who have participated in what has become a quite wide-ranging debate. The provisions of the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill are quite narrow. They deal simply with a common reporting date for organisations covered by the provisions of the principal Act. I would like to comment on the points raised by the last speaker from the other side, the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards). He referred to positive discrimination and said that legislation that provided for quotas was unnecessary. No quotas are imposed in this legislation. Obviously, the honourable member does not understand what is in the legislation and how it is intended to work. It demonstrates a gross incompetence by the Opposition about what equal opportunity is all about. It is no wonder that the Opposition can never work out where it stands in this matter. I will refer to that later in my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Berowra also made some comments about inflation and employment. Those comments indicate a mock concern for Australian families and Australian women. The hard facts are that during the life of this Government we have seen inflation reduced from 11.5 per cent to 7.7 per cent. It is higher than we want to see it, but there has been a considerable reduction on the performance of that Government of which the honourable member for Berowra and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and most of his colleagues were members. The unemployment rate was at over 10 per cent. Today it has been announced that the unemployment rate has dropped to 6.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> During the life of the Hawke Administration we have seen the creation of some 1,360,000 new jobs. Of these new jobs, 56 per cent have gone to women. That has happened at a time when there have been record levels in the participation rate, in the proportion of Australians of labour force age who want to be in the work force-working or looking for jobs. Contrast that record of achievement with that of the Fraser-Howard years. In just 12 months of their administration about a quarter of a million Australians lost their jobs. It is just cant for the Opposition to be talking about its concern for Australian women and Australian families. Just look at its performance. The most important thing that any government can do for an Australian family is to ensure that its breadwinner has a job. That is what this Government is about. That is what it has been about. In that respect we are very proud of our record. </PARA>
<PARA> Historically, more has been achieved for women's equality under this Government than under any other government. Labor was the first party ever to bring down a women's policy, enabling greater freedom of choice and participation for women in our society. The Liberals have attacked us over our policies with regard to women and the family. But I ask: What response has their own party come up with? We can turn to the latest little bit of fun and pleasure-they call it Future Directions; we call it `Futile Diversions'-but their policy document is 110 pages of rhetoric. If we look through that we find a miserable one and a half pages devoted to women's policy. In that one and a half pages, what do we find? Motherhood pronouncements; nothing solid, nothing firm, nothing that shows a clear commitment on the part of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members state that they support equal opportunity. But clearly there is the usual confusion amongst the Opposition between the Liberal Party and the National Party as to what this support actually involves. On the one hand we had the Leader of the Opposition telling us yesterday that equality of opportunity is something to which the Liberal Party and National Party are completely committed. In their own policy document the coalition states that it `will ensure that equal employment opportunity legislation is implemented in a sensitive manner'. On the other hand, yesterday we had the National Party member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) telling us that what the legislation before us now and its predecessor are doing is actually enforcing discrimination by legislating to try to change attitudes. So yet again Opposition members cannot get their act together. They cannot get their act together on such a simple matter as where they stand on equal opportunity legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Again we are going to have to sit through another embarrassing, humdrum rerun of the rumpus that the Opposition created a couple of years ago when a number of those from their ranks crossed the floor over the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Bill. They could not make up their minds then. What is going to be the story this time? What surprises can we expect from a coalition government? What surprises are in store for 51 per cent of Australia's population-Australian women-when we hear the National Party member for Cowper telling us that again the Government has come up with this affirmative action nonsense. Therein lies the truth. `This affirmative action nonsense', says the National Party member for Cowper. That is really the view of the National Party towards Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the mock concern that we heard yesterday and today from the Leader of the Opposition and other members of the Liberal Party and I think we can say pretty assuredly that, if ever the chance arose, we would have the National Party-the party of the honourable member for Cowper-pushing for the repeal of the current legislative measures that provide equal opportunity for Australian women. This legislation before us that they would want to repeal received a positive response from 99 per cent of the largest companies in Australia last year. It is legislation that has been hailed as an overwhelming success in encouraging a change of attitudes towards women in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Opposition does not have a future direction on this issue. They do not have a future direction that will stand examination or to which there is commitment from both of those parties. In fact, they have lost their direction in this area of policy. But what are other Opposition policies in this area? Opposition members say they are committed to ensuring that women gain greater benefit from their policies, especially with respect to families, education and training facilities. That is a nice statement. They talk about amending the tax system. How would they do this? Through income splitting, across the board payments, or rebates? But most importantly, how would they pay for it? They can only pay for it through massive cuts in social welfare expenditure, education expenditure and health expenditure, or the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax, which is really the original personal commitment of the Leader of the Opposition. And that kind of measure discriminates quite clearly against low income families, the very families that they purport to want to support and help. </PARA>
<PARA> To put it succinctly, once again we have the Opposition grandstanding on a very rickety stage-another exercise in opportunism. Yet again we have conflict, opportunism and division in the Opposition. Let me just deal with one other area that bears very strongly on that promise of the Opposition. We have the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) and a range of their colleagues, calling for substantial cuts in expenditure by this Government. They cannot tell us where. All they say is that there should be severe cuts-a very tight fiscal policy. When we ask them where, they cannot delineate or specify. But at the same time as they are saying that, the National Party member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) is wandering around the country saying, `Spend more money on roads. Spend another $430m or $450m'. Back here in Canberra the Leader of the Opposition is saying, `Spend less money. I cannot tell you where'. I only mention that because it again highlights the conflicts within the Opposition. It highlights the shallowness of the undertakings and commitments that they make. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday we had the Opposition spokesperson on industrial relations telling us about the need for flexible working arrangements, especially for women working part time. This is the very same issue that is currently being addressed through award restructuring, a process that has been initiated by this Government and is strongly supported. In the life of our Government we have seen a 32 per cent increase in part time employment. Through award restructuring we are creating opportunities for flexible working arrangements, dismantling traditional barriers, creating better career paths, greater skilling and more rewarding job opportunities. And within that process is the opportunity to create greater equality of opportunity for Australian women. The Government has been putting this into place. It is something we are participating in and doing; we are not just grandstanding, talking about it. </PARA>
<PARA> To sum up, this Government has done more towards achieving equality in opportunity for Australian women than any other government. As is illustrated through `Futile Diversions', the Opposition clearly has nothing to offer Australian women. Its behaviour in the past and its inconsistency as illustrated during the debate of this Bill show up the obvious that there is no cohesive women's policy being put forward by Opposition members. The only good thing about that is that they are not likely to have a chance to try to implement the policies that they are putting. I stress again that women have been given more opportunities under this Government than ever before in the history of this country, and they have seized those opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> I will briefly look at the record. Since 1983 1.36 million new jobs have been created, 56 per cent of which have gone to women. We are achieving those objectives in a time when we have had a record participation by Australian women in the work force, since World War II. The gap between male and female earnings has been narrowed. The ratio of adult female ordinary time earnings to adult male earnings rose between 1983 and 1988 from 79.7 per cent to 83.4 per cent. The rate of growth in jobs for females has averaged over 4 per cent annually. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to other initiatives. The national policy for the education of girls in Australian schools and the plan of action for women in tertiary education: in 1987, 57 per cent of girls stayed on to the end of secondary school compared with 44 per cent in 1983. In 1988 women represented 51 per cent of all enrolled students in universities and colleges of advanced education, compared with 46 per cent in 1983. There are more apprenticeship opportunities for women. There is a range of labour market programs aimed at increasing women's participation across a wide range of industries and occupations. There is action to remove the provisions in awards which by their discriminatory or restrictive nature hinder participation in particular occupations. This is a priority issue in the context of award restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA> There is support for improving regulation of pay and conditions of outworkers, paying particular attention to the needs of women in occupational health and safety. There is support for women and their families. Some 20,000 new child-care places have brought the total number of Commonwealth provided child-care places to 110,000, an increase of about 64,000 since 1983. Women are the major recipients of social security outlays, with about 61 per cent of total social security expenditure on pensions, benefits and allowances going to women. Measures such as the family allowance supplement and the jobs, education and training package are both major initiatives to help break the poverty cycle which women find themselves trapped in. </PARA>
<PARA> Further initiatives are the development of the national women's health policy, due to be released shortly; the Government's allocation of $5.1m over the next three years to provide a national screening service for breast and cervical cancer; the ratification of International Labour Organisation Convention No. 156 and the support of the parental leave case due before the Industrial Relations Commission later this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the Government's record is a proud one, to serve Australian women and to better their position. It is through this record that this Government can stand tall on a global level with its ongoing commitment to promote equality and to improve the position of women in Australian society. I commend the Bill to the House, and the Government rejects the amendment moved by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill 1989, the purpose of which is to ratify a protocol which has been agreed upon at the end of a long series of international conferences. I suppose one can best summarise the protocol by saying that its purpose is to isolate civilians and civilian targets from the effects of war. The protocol tries to do this with respect to international war, and we have been told that there is another protocol which seeks to achieve the same objective with respect to internal military situations, which I suppose can best be described as civil wars or perhaps revolutions. We have been told by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) in his speech that the purpose of the Bill is to enable protocol I, that is to say, the protocol relating to international conflict, to be ratified. We have also been told that protocol II does not need legislation to ratify it, but that the effect of the ratification of protocol I will be that protocol II will also bind Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We therefore have a situation where the objective of the protocol, which is the protocol additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relates to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, is to protect civilians and civilian objectives from the dreadful scourge of war and the consequences of international war. Of course, that objective is laudable and one that all people will seek to support. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will, however, oppose this Bill for several reasons. The first reason is that the principal provisions of the protocol are ambiguous, and are not simply ambiguous on a strict legal interpretation but ambiguous in their substance to the extent that the actual operation of this protocol must be left in very grave doubt. The second reason we oppose the Bill is that the protocol, if it applied to Australia and its armed forces, would undoubtedly limit the effectiveness of the Australian defence forces and limit them very severely, to the extent that we must conclude that there would be doubt as to whether the Australian defence forces would be able to achieve their objective in an armed conflict if they were required to comply with the terms of the protocol. </PARA>
<PARA> It goes further than that, however, because, thirdly, we also take the view that if the Australian armed forces were bound by this protocol, they would in fact be put in danger. We are not prepared to go along with a situation where that is to be the result. Enough danger inevitably flows from the conflict itself without imposing excessive legalisms on the armed forces, the result of which must be, in our view, that they would be subjected to additional and unnecessary danger. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth reason we oppose the Bill is that, although ratification has been performed, assumed and undertaken by a number of countries, what can be said of those countries that have ratified it is that they are not countries which are instantly identified as our immediate allies nor are they countries which are in our region. Countries in our region, with virtually no exception, have not ratified the protocol and our principal allies have not ratified the protocol. The United States, so far as we know, will not ratify it. I venture to say that that is almost certainly the case with respect to other countries with which we usually identify ourselves, but it is certainly true of the United States. Therefore, at the outset, I want to make it plain that we will oppose this Bill which seeks to achieve the ratification of the protocol, and we will oppose it for the reasons that I have briefly given. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I also want to make it plain that our opposition is not to the concept of having a structure of international humanitarian law and it is not an opposition to some of the principles and provisions which are set out and contained in the protocol. For our part we support the concept of having international humanitarian law where there is a case for it. We support that notion in principle and we will support it in practice. We support the efforts made by the International Red Cross and other branches of the Red Cross and, indeed, the efforts made by other organisations and people to lay down principles of international humanitarian law. All of that is common ground; we are at one on those points. To take it further, we can also say that we support attempts to protect civilians from the devastating effects of war. Anyone who seeks to argue that, from our opposition to this Bill, the Opposition is opposed to international humanitarian law is completely mistaken. Indeed, for our part we would expect the Australian defence forces to comply with civilised principles when they are engaged in an armed conflict, even those that may not be enforceable under the law that is applicable at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many provisions in the protocol that we support. One would hope that they would be common ground amongst all who are concerned with this subject. They are, and should be, common ground. We say, therefore, that when we look at the protocol, we see provisions in it which we support. No suggestion should be made by anyone that we are opposed to the entirety of the provisions in the protocol, because that is simply not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the House to some of the provisions of the protocol in order to support that proposition. As I say, there is a whole series. In fact, the protocol has about 63 pages and therefore contains many provisions. In that protocol there is a large number of provisions to which we take no exception. Indeed, not only do we take no exception to them, but also we would assume that they would be applied and are applied, whether they are contained in this or any other provision of international law, or whether they are contained in any statement of international law. I refer, for instance, to the proposition that the wounded, the sick and the shipwrecked must be respected, protected and given medical care and attention. Who would disagree with that proposition? Certainly not us. I refer to another proposition contained in the protocol that internees and detainees must not be subjected to inappropriate medical procedures such as mutilation and medical experiments. Who would disagree with that proposition? Who would disagree with the proposition that medical units must be respected and protected and that they should not be made the object of attack? We certainly support that proposition in the protocol. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a provision to the effect that civil medical units must be protected unless they commit acts that are harmful to the enemy. We support that provision. There is a provision to the effect that an occupying power must ensure that the medical needs of the civilian population continue to be satisfied. We support that provision. There is a provision that civilian, medical and religious personnel must be respected and protected. There are provisions to the effect that the civilian population must respect the wounded, the sick and the shipwrecked. And so it goes on. There is no need for me to detail what would total a considerable list of provisions in the protocol to which we take no exception. I want to make that perfectly plain. As I have said before, and I simply repeat it before I move on, we would support those principles in practice, whether or not they were contained in a regime of international law. Indeed, they are probably second nature to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it can also be said that many of those provisions are already contained in the Fourth Convention, which is one of the four Geneva conventions which Australia acceded to and which are enforceable under Australian law by the Geneva Conventions Act, the Act which is being amended by the Bill that is presently before the House. It must be acknowledged by any observer that many of those provisions are already contained in the Convention and there is no need for an additional instrument to set them out again. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that so far I have made our position clear. The first proposition, as I have said, is that we will oppose this Bill. We will oppose it for the reasons which I have briefly given and which I will amplify as the debate continues. It must also be said that we support the notion and the concept of international humanitarian law. We believe very strongly indeed that there should be provisions relating to the protection of civilians in some of those cases of the sort that I have already referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> Our concerns do not stem from the sorts of provisions that I have referred to. As I have said, many of them are already contained in the Fourth Geneva Convention. Our concern arises basically from two fundamental articles in the protocol and, in the first place, from the terms of those fundamental provisions in the protocol. Furthermore, our concern arises from the colour which is given to the whole of the protocol by those two fundamental provisions. In addition, our concern arises from several particular provisions of the protocol which I will refer to as we proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to those fundamental provisions in the protocol, the colour that is given by those fundamental provisions to the whole of the protocol, and some of the particular provisions of the protocol about which we are concerned, we believe that the provisions of the protocol in total give rise to a justification for rejecting the Bill and for not ratifying the protocol. Let me illustrate that point and make it plainer by referring initially to two articles of the protocol, the first being article 48. I draw your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the fact that article 48 is headed `Basic Rules'. We can assume that the draftsmen of this protocol meant what they said and were aware that substance of this basic and most important area of the Convention is to be found in article 48. Article 48 provides:</PARA>
<PARA> In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw the House's attention to the fact that if this is to be applied in the words that are set out in the protocol, the word is `only'. That then is the basic rule. In addition, I will for the purposes of this argument draw the House's attention to article 51, which is headed `Protection of the civilian population'. Paragraph 2 of that article states:</PARA>
<PARA>The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have a fairly basic proposition. But to make the effect of that clause clear I ask honourable members to go back to article 49, which explains in effect what the protocol is talking about at that stage. I draw the House's attention to three provisions in article 49. The first, which is paragraph 1, makes it plain that these restrictions apply not only when a party is engaged in an offensive posture or exercise but also when it is in defence. I think in the version tabled in the Parliament there is a spelling error-I presume it is a spelling error-which might be corrected. Should it not be `whether in offence or in defence'? Perhaps we can change that at some stage. If I am right on that, the intention of the draftsman is to say, `Whether you are engaged on the offensive or the defensive, that is an attack for the purpose of this provision of the protocol'. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing to note is that the provisions of the protocol with respect to attacks apply to all attacks in whatever territory they are conducted. So it is intended to have a very wide ambit. The third provision is paragraph 3 of article 49, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of this Section apply to any land, air or sea warfare which may affect the civilian population . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is not `which does or necessarily will' have that result, it is `which may affect the civilian population'. In further support of that I draw the attention of honourable members to article 52, paragraph 2 of which provides that attacks shall be limited strictly to military objectives. So we find once again this very clear intention of the protocol, being not that we are trying to achieve the best or the best in all circumstances but that the protocol is intended to have a strict limitation and a strict application. One of our concerns is that in military encounters that imposes a burden on the armed forces which is really impossible to ask for and impossible to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic rule is that operations are only to be against military objectives. We know that what is being talked about is a situation that may be one of defence as well as offence. We know it is intended to have a particularly wide coverage. The total effect of all this is very plain indeed. It is to isolate civilian targets in such a way that in our view the armed forces would be neutralised. There is no doubt that this is what President Reagan had in mind when he said that this protocol was fundamentally flawed and when his Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee made a statement in an article on this subject, which many honourable members would have seen, to the effect that there is a lot in this which is simply militarily unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> In many cases the provisions are vague and uncertain. When one adds that vagueness and uncertainty to provisions which almost reek of an inability to apply them with the intention the draftsman had, we believe that the only conclusion that fairly can be reached is in the first place that this will impose very severe limitations on our armed forces engaged in exercises in which we and all Australians expect them to succeed. It really is an unreasonable limitation to impose upon them, a limitation which when they are engaged in those exercises will result in their being in a situation of danger. </PARA>
<PARA> It is probably no surprise for honourable members to find, when pondering provisions such as those I have read out and many other provisions of the protocol, that there is a provision-article 82-to the effect that military commanders are to have lawyers with them. They will probably need them. What will happen in the meantime while they get legal advice as to whether they are allowed to attack a particular objective I leave it to the House to speculate. It goes further. When we look at some of the basic principles of the protocol we see that they emphasise the ambiguity and the uncertainty and the difficulty there will be in applying them. For instance, article 56 is an interesting article. It requires that there will be no assault on dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. </PARA>
<PARA>We take the view that to impose on the armed forces a limitation of that sort, going as far as preventing them from attacking military objectives, goes too far. It limits the effectiveness of the armed forces to the extent that they would be neutralised, and it must add to the inevitable danger that they themselves will be involved in and subjected to by the very nature of the war when they are not able to act with the full flexibility that a military force must have, when they are to be bound by excessively restrictive provisions such as this and, above all, when the restrictive provisions to which they are bound under this protocol are, in many cases, vague and uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA> As an illustration of that, honourable members may ask: How is the article on dangerous installations to which I have referred to be put into practice? As we read on we find a curious provision to the effect that if one is on the receiving end one marks the buildings or structures with three orange circles on the same axis. Then the question arises: what happens if there are no orange circles on the structures? The conclusions are given in paragraph 7, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The absence of such marking in no way relieves any Party to the conflict of its obligations under this Article. </PARA>
<PARA>So those on the receiving end may mark their installations with three orange circles, obviously as a warning to the attacker that they are about to face a situation where a provision of this protocol will limit and prevent them from attacking it. Obviously, that is the purpose of its being there in the first place. Then we find that if those in the defending country, if we can call it that, do not have the markings on the structures, it does not relieve the attacker at all. One might well ask what was the purpose of it all. What were the lawyers doing when the decision was being made as to whether to attack or not. </PARA>
<PARA> In our view, when we put all of that together we must conclude that it imposes limitations on the effectiveness of our armed forces. They would be fighting with one arm tied behind their back. In modern warfare we cannot make this clinical distinction, in the way in which the protocol seeks to do, between military matters on the one hand and civilian matters on the other. We cannot make that clinical distinction between civilian targets and objectives on the one hand and military targets on the other. They are obviously going to be mixed. If the armed forces are going to do what we want them to do-namely, to win-they cannot be denied that flexibility that they need to pursue the war or military encounter with all of the vigour and ability that goes with them. Secondly, in the course of doing all that, we would have to conclude that they would be put in additional danger, which is unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> We find our concern exacerbated when we see, as I have said, that very few, if any, of our neighbours have, as at 1 March 1989, ratified this protocol. Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have not done so, and the list goes on. We find that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries have not ratified it. The United States, Great Britain, Japan, Canada, West Germany, France and even the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have not done so. We obviously have our interests inextricably woven with those of our allies, whether they are in Europe or in this part of the world, and particularly, with the United States. It would seem an unacceptable situation to us if the ratification took place at this stage in the absence of ratifications from those other parties. </PARA>
<PARA> We are very concerned about this. My concern was considerably added to when I discovered that my view was shared by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). We now know that the Prime Minister has been engaging in correspondence with former President Reagan about this matter. One of the letters was referred to in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning. Our Prime Minister took it upon himself to write pursuing this issue with President Reagan because we have an obvious involvement with the United States. If we have a situation where we have joint military exercises with an American commander, who is not restricted by the protocol, who might give an order, then the consequence of our being bound by this protocol and the Americans not being bound by it must be utter confusion and a conflict in orders and in what the combined forces of our two countries are able to achieve. Our Prime Minister wrote to President Reagan saying that there were a number of `ambiguities and operational complexities in the protocol'. He is certainly right about the ambiguities. He says that there are operational complexities in the protocol. He is certainly right there. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give the Prime Minister his due, because he went on and said that despite the fact that there were those ambiguities and operational complexities, `We consider that on balance the practical obstacles are not such as to warrant Australia not ratifying the protocol'. I will give him due marks for making that additional statement. But is that really the situation to which the Australian Government is going to subject the Australian armed forces? Will it tell them to go into war or some conflict under and bound by, with all the force of law, a protocol which the Prime Minister says contains ambiguities and operational complexities? I am not a military person but I do not need to be one to be told that if I am fighting a war subject to international law and a 63-page protocol, that is bad enough; but when I am told that in addition to that it is ambiguous and has operational complexities in it, then I am entitled to make a protest. We make a protest on their behalf. Frankly, I really wonder what the Government is doing about this provision when it is prepared to go ahead on the basis of that admission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's letter goes on to say that there are declarations of understanding which Australia is making about this. Where are those declarations of understanding if they are going to make the effect of this protocol clearer? In his speech the Attorney-General did not expose them. He did not tell us about the provisions of the declarations of understanding, but in this letter from Mr Hawke to President Reagan he tells us that there are declarations of understanding. I would like to know what they are and how they make the protocol clearer than it is now. I would also like a clearer statement, which is not contained in the second reading speech, as to what the Australian armed forces really think of this protocol. That was left out of the second reading speech. It is a notable omission. I gather that their position is that they can live with it, or words to that effect. That is not good enough. We would like to know exactly what their view is and how it is going to affect their operation abilities. </PARA>
<PARA> For all of those reasons, I conclude on the same point that I made at the opening of my remarks. We support international humanitarian law. We support measures to protect civilians in law, but we cannot, for the reasons that I have given, and especially for the reasons set out by the Prime Minister in his letter to President Reagan, support the Bill, and therefore, we oppose it.</PARA>

Let me say at the outset that it is a surprise to us to know now that the Opposition is opposing the ratification of this Geneva Convention. I understand that there might be some ambiguities that the Opposition wishes to have clarified. But I think it ought to be put on the record that the signing of the Convention was in December 1978. That means that the Convention was signed when the honourable member and his Party were in government. The words were the same then. What worries me, from the point of view of this nation, is that we do not want to have a debate here about something that might be deemed to be limiting the armed forces of Australia and creating doubts and ambiguities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will talk for only a few minutes. I will ask leave to continue my remarks later so that the debate will be adjourned. It will be on the basis that the Red Cross and other organisations can talk to the Opposition and see whether they can convince it that the ambiguities and uncertainties which were certainly created for the first time by President Reagan in a letter written in 1987 can be properly debated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ought to put it on the record that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wrote to the President of the United States in reply to the suggestions that the President had made, saying they did not have foundation. I invite the honourable gentleman to look at the reply given by the International Red Cross to the letter of the President to the Congress. It is very significant because it says a number of things. It makes the point that the President's letter mentions that the `Joint Chiefs of Staff have concluded that a number of the provisions of the protocol are militarily unacceptable'. It casts doubts on that issue. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is nevertheless striking that the President's message emphasizes the terrorist argument at great length while devoting much less attention to the military objections. </PARA>
<PARA>In fairness to the United States, the previous President did not have the same objections as President Reagan. At the same time, we should look at what the Red Cross was saying. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The reasons that induced the Joint Chiefs of Staff ultimately to reject Protocol 1 are not specified in the President's message, and their final report on Protocol 1 is classified. </PARA>
<PARA>I can understand the Red Cross being concerned about these matters. It went on to make this final point, in fairness to the whole issue:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the unprecedented language used by the United States to justify its decision not to ratify Protocol 1 will not do lasting damage to such a delicate undertaking as humanitarian treaties always are . . . Moreover, failure to ratify by a major power such as the United States would deprive the world of a common framework for the humanitarian rules governing armed conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that. The honourable gentleman was Parliamentary Adviser to the Australian Delegation to the United Nations in 1976. There is a resolution there which he would have participated in, urging the speedy adoption and bringing into effect of this particular protocol. He knows the detail backwards. I am trying to say that a number of countries, in fact some 60-odd, have already ratified. Well over 100 have already signed. Obviously, the real influence was the United States under President Reagan feeling that it should not sign. That is the issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Act imposes a legal obligation on a country, after signature, not to do anything contrary to the protocol. The words in the protocol were clearly known to the honourable gentleman and others who signed it in 1978. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of 1978 is now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock). It is a bit late in the day in terms of legal argument to come in here and say, `There is something wrong here. There are going to be problems'. I am advised that we can give arguments in rational terms to explain the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue is to try to protect civilians from extermination. Certainly, it is not necessary for a lawyer to be present at all times because the big reservation in all worries that the honourable gentleman put forward, and with some sincerity, is that one still has to balance that with what is called the proportionality of the necessity of the military venture at the time. In other words, the whole judgment as to the circumstances goes to the military commander. There is no question of looking at the situation later and saying that one might have misjudged the issue. The fact is that there is a reservation all the time that the question of military necessity is virtually the guiding light. So all those protocols that the honourable gentleman mentioned ought to be read in toto because that is what it is all about. Military necessity has always to be balanced against the consequences for civilians. That is very clear. </PARA>
<PARA> Article 57 now gives guidance concerning the test of proportionality whereby an attack should not be launched if its effects would be excessive, et cetera. The honourable gentleman expressed concern about attacks on dams, dykes and nuclear power stations. But that would not apply if a particular installation were used for other than what are called normal functions of civilian use. If used in respect of assisting war production, it becomes a target. That is the position. What we have here is an obsessive interest in words when Opposition members saw no difficulty with them when they were in government and signed the document. That is the point.

<PARA> We are debating the Student Assistance Amendment Bill. This Bill incorporates some minor changes to the Student Assistance Act. For example, the explanatory memorandum refers to replacing the words `advanced education institution' and the word `university' with references to higher education institutions. I am not quite sure why the Government wants to do that. It seems to be rather pedantic and churlish. Colleges are still colleges and universities are still universities, whatever we might call them. To change their names to `higher education institutions' seems to me to be a bit of a waste of time and money. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the purpose of this Bill does seem to be a general tidying up of the Student Assistance Act, altering wording and facilitating the management of programs. Accordingly, we will not oppose this legislation. However, we seek to condemn the Government for aspects of higher education as it relates to student assistance. Accordingly the coalition moves the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> `whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) its inability to appreciate the special needs for assistance for students from rural areas; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the turmoil caused by its policies on, and administration of, assistance for students in higher education institutions'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) received a dorothy dix question in the House on 2 March. In the course of answering that question he said:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Opposition wants to engage in a sensible debate on education policy we will be happy to accommodate it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister knew quite well that we would move this amendment to open out the debate for a full view on student assistance and the administration of assistance for students in higher education institutions. The question is: Where is the Minister? The junior Minister, the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan), is here, but the Minister who invited us to engage in a sensible debate does not even have the courtesy to come to the chamber--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, Austudy is an absolute nightmare. Those of us who have seen the form for Austudy, which is about 2 1/2 feet wide by two feet high-that is, three-quarters of a metre by two-thirds of a metre-with a whole series of regulations and qualifications realise that one has to have a higher education to read the form before one can qualify to get the higher education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to draw attention to what the Liberal and National Party policy has to say about Austudy. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Austudy has been bedevilled by administrative deficiencies and suffers from continuing allegations of unfairness in the award of benefits. The Liberal and National Parties will, in government, thoroughly review the rules and administration of AUSTUDY to ensure that they are fair to all and that the scheme runs smoothly. </PARA>
<PARA>As I say, Austudy is an absolute mess and a disgrace and needs to be looked at. The student assistance that arises from Austudy needs to be cleaned up in a proper, effective and administrative way. This Bill does not address those difficulties at all. The Department has been trying to fix these difficulties up with its regulations and changes, but the fact is that Austudy is an absolute mess, bedevilled by inefficiencies and abuses, and something should be done about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Government has imposed a harsh assets test on students from rural areas, isolated students. The Government simply does not understand about students from rural areas. The Government does not understand that those students have to travel in order to get their education, whether it is to schools, which are not the subject of the discussion here today, or to higher education institutions. The Government is punishing students from rural areas by imposing this harsh assets test, as my colleague the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) said. It is an absolute disgrace. Our higher education policy, recently released and widely acclaimed, has this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Particular regard will also be given to the needs of regional and rural students who have to travel long distances, or be accommodated away from home, to attend higher education institutions. We will establish a realistic assets test, including a hardship provision. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that my friend and colleague the honourable member for Lyne is delighted that the Liberal and National parties' policy on the assets test for rural children is phrased in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's higher education policy proposals and its policies on student assistance have created turmoil, uncertainty and outrage in higher education institutions and for students across the country. For example, as far as the amalgamations are concerned, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training is pushing for a complete centralisation of control of higher education institutions and corresponding increases in the bureaucracy that will be associated with higher education. Why does the Government not talk to some people in the system?</PARA>

Quite clearly, the amendment allows me to deal with those matters. I repeat that the Minister is pushing for complete centralisation of control of the higher education institutions, with the effect that has on student assistance. He is talking about the number of institutions coming down from 63 to 35 or 40.

<PARA> If I could refer briefly to that, in December the South Australian Labor Government asserted that it would not toe the Dawkins line on this matter. The Adelaide Advertiser of 21 December 1988 had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The State Government has abandoned plans for a major restructuring of higher education institutions in South Australia . . . The Employment and Further Education Minister . . . yesterday announced State Cabinet had decided against the move, despite his support . . . It was labelled a `fiasco' by the Opposition . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear from what the Advertiser has to say that the effect on students and student assistance of these amalgamations is going to be very detrimental. Furthermore, Queensland is also concerned about these effects on students and student assistance. The Queensland Government on 7 February this year had this to say:</PARA>

<PARA> There is also an effect on students and student assistance from the Minister's insistence on educational profiles-this iniquitous system whereby each institution must negotiate a profile with the Department as a condition of funding. I emphasise `condition of funding' because a condition of funding is clearly tied up with the relevance of students and student assistance. These institutions will be obliged to meet what are called national priorities, which may or may not be appropriate for the institution or for the market that the institution is supposed to serve or for the students. This is simply another area in which the mania for centralisation is apparent and autonomy is blatantly removed from the institutions. Furthermore, we have a situation where the Government is siphoning funds away from the universities and putting them in the hands of what is loosely called the Australian Research Council and the effect this has on students and student assistance--</PARA>

What the Government is doing with research is taking money away--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OE4">Mr BEALE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill seeks to amend the Student Assistance Act 1973, which gives the statutory basis for Austudy and postgraduate awards. When I say to you that the principal Act, which this Bill amends, deals with postgraduate awards, you will recognise how vital it is that we understand what is going on in research. The research area attracts students who are involved in postgraduate courses. The Government is taking money away from the universities, research and postgraduate students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill forms the basis for postgraduate awards. The Government will give that money to a politically controlled group called the Australian Research Council, which will hand out research funds on a political, and not a scientific, basis. In terms of assistance for students, clearly what will happen to research will affect students very unfavour- ably. In order to overcome this difficulty and satisfactorily resolve the question of postgraduate awards, we would scrap the guidelines for the Australian Research Council, reduce bureaucratic interference and award research grants on the basis of competitive excellence-not on the basis of nebulous and rapidly changing government perceptions of national priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Student Assistance Act 1973 not only provides the basis for Austudy and postgraduate awards but also is part of the whole network of the way in which the Government is dealing with students and assistance to students. In that context, the Government's so called graduate tax, its higher education contribution scheme, has a very deleterious effect on students and student assistance. It is a strange anomaly that on the one hand we are debating a Bill that amends the statutory basis for Austudy and postgraduate awards and seeks to streamline the process and make it more effective and therefore give students more benefit in terms of appeals and so forth, and on the other hand the Government is introducing a punitive graduate tax. It seems quite anomalous that on the one hand the Government is seeking to do things to make it easier for students and yet, on the other, it is acting deleteriously in terms of students and student assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the most publicised area of the Government's changes to higher education. It is a system-again inconsistent with this Bill-which, though it purports to be fair, has already, at this early stage, been shown to be filled with anomalies and inequities. It discourages postgraduate work. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Student Assistance Act forms the basis for postgraduate awards. Because of the number of years it takes higher education students to get through to the postgraduate and research levels, the obligation that they build up over that period, which may be as much as $10,000, $12,000 or even $15,000, will discourage students from going on to postgraduate work and indulging in research work-all of which is vital for the future of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to do more research work. We have to be more attuned to what is happening in science. The Government has decimated the science and research communities with its policies, and by cutting down the funds to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, by taking money away from the higher education institutions and giving it to this nebulous Australian Research Council. When we are debating this Bill, which forms the basis of postgraduate awards, it seem incredible that other Government policies are actively discouraging students from going on to postgraduate work. </PARA>
<PARA> We propose a system of awards, scholarships, charges and loans which will be more favourable to students and institutions. Our policy is to open up the system and allow it to react to market forces, for it to be marked by productive competition and corresponding excellence of achievement. We want a system of student driven enrolment that provides choice for the students and competition between institutions. Although we do not object to the changing of phrases and the other minor changes in this Bill, the Government, in this Bill, has completely failed to address the difficulties that exist in higher education institutions, the difficulties that arise with Austudy and the difficulties that arise with isolated children. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policy indicates that it has no faith in higher education institutions, it has no faith in our students, it does not understand the proper need for student assistance and it has no faith in our leading academics. It thinks that the only way to run higher education is to force the institutions to teach what it wants them to teach through the profiles; amalgamate them so that there are fewer to deal with and they are easier to manipulate; amalgamate them under threat, under coercion of less funds; syphon off research funds, which will affect postgraduate students and, hence, the whole system of postgraduate awards to which this Bill refers; and centralise control in a bureaucracy here in Canberra that has control over everything that goes on in the higher education system. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by contrasting what the Government is trying to do in higher education with what the coalition will do in government-that is not too far away. In addition to reviewing thoroughly the rules and administration of Austudy, the coalition will restore autonomy to all higher education institutions, dismantle the centralised bureaucracy, abolish the profiles, withdraw the arbitrary requirements for amalgamations, stimulate healthy competition between the institutions, modify the policy guidelines of the centralist Labor Government of the Australian Research Council, maintain through the 1989-91 triennial system the number of places provided in the 1988 Budget, provide the institutions with funds to allow the grant of national education scholarships and allow those scholarships to no less than 25 per cent of the holders of the awards. </PARA>
<PARA> We would abolish Labor's $1,800 a year, indexed graduate tax and replace it with an annual tuition charge of $600, to be paid by the non-scholarship students directly or through a loans scheme. We would permit institutions to offer additional places on any basis they saw fit. We would facilitate commercial loan arrangements for those students who wished to borrow the amount of their obligations to the institutions so that payments could be made. In sharp contrast to what this Labor Government is trying to do in terms of discouraging postgraduate students and centralising control of higher education, we would open the whole system out so there was a much broader choice for the students and much wider diversity and competition between the institutions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I still do not have a copy of the amendment, so it is difficult to address its contents. I found the contribution of the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale) amusing but erroneous. It did not really contribute to the debate. The honourable member referred to this debate being brought on when it was. Had he had his wits about him, he would have had his amendment drafted and he would have been in the House at six o'clock; but he was not. He was absent without leave. That is why this debate was brought on at eight o'clock. It was not because the Government failed to have business to put before the House. It was because the honourable member for Deakin did not have his amendment prepared.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable member said, this legislation makes minor changes to the Student Assistance Act. It is important to recognise why the changes are necessary, what this Government has done in the area of student assistance and what the results of that have been. For example, in 1982 under the Fraser Government, $188.3m was expended on student income support. The Labor Government, since coming to office, has more than tripled this, assisting students in 1988 at a cost of over $720m. That is something like four times the amount of money put on the deck by the Opposition when it was in office. Under the Liberals, less than 116,000 students were assisted in 1982. In six years this Government has more than doubled that figure, assisting over 285,000 young people to the end of 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Particular attention has been paid to school retention rates. This Government has made it its purpose to attract young people to stay at school and to avail themselves of the educational opportunities that are required to take this country into the next century. By way of comparison, school retention rates for year 12 in 1983 were 36 per cent. In 1988, after five years of this Government, that proportion had been increased to 58 per cent. The contribution of honourable members opposite when they were in government pales in comparison with the efforts made by this Government to increase school retention rates and provide educational opportunities for all sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the House had before it the affirmative action legislation. It addressed the needs of women in education. It highlighted the effectiveness of this Government's policy in the retention rates for girls at year 12. The difference in rates between Austudy and the unemployment benefit is considered by this Government to be a serious anomaly, contributing to the disincentive to continue with further education. This is being addressed progressively and from 1989 Austudy and Abstudy and rates for special disadvantaged groups have been increased to the equivalent of the single rate of unemployment benefit. These special groups include long term pensioners and beneficiaries for six out of the last nine months, Aboriginal people and migrants undertaking special English courses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to increasing gradually the level of Austudy to the level of the unemployment benefit for all students as the Budget circumstances permit. In the last Budget the Government lifted the parental income threshold from $16,000 to $16,950 and the personal income threshold from $2,000 to $3,000 so that more students may take advantage of maximum benefits. Since the introduction of these changes in the last Budget, there has been an increase of around 27 per cent in the number of recipients of Austudy and 24 per cent more applications were received in 1988 than in 1987. That is an effective measure of the contribution that this scheme is making in assisting those young people seeking education. </PARA>
<PARA> The decentralisation of the Austudy administration to Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) offices around the country will ensure that there is greater accessibility to information and assistance, particularly-for the benefit of honourable members opposite-for those living in rural areas. The Government is aware that there are anomalies and it hopes to address these anomalies as economic circumstances permit. These anomalies include the restrictive limit of $500, with dollar for dollar reduction, applied to educational assistance such as scholarships and bursaries. One-off prizes are now exempt from the personal income assessment, as are scholarships intended to be up-front payments of the higher education contribution charge; the provision of assistance to young homeless students during the six weeks qualifying period; the workload concessions for disabled students; tightening the process of transfer from unemployment benefit to Austudy; and the eligibility difficulties for some students from non-English speaking backgrounds. To assist in ironing out such anomalies the Government is looking at simplifying the student assistance regulations, incorporating a plain English text. </PARA>
<PARA> I was somewhat amused by the contribution by the honourable member for Deakin. He said-and I think I have the quote right-there was widespread support for the Opposition's higher education policy. That is laughable. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) and the honourable member for Deakin of a quote from the Australian Financial Review of 24 February referring to opposition from the Vice-Chancellors Committee to the Opposition policy. The article read:</PARA>
<PARA>The new chairman of the committee, Professor Brian Wilson, supported the Government's line, saying the first priority `should be to support the public system'. </PARA>
<PARA>In my own electorate I have a student union which put out a press release recently which said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory University Students Union today warned students not to be fooled by the Liberal/National party's Tertiary Fees Policy released yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> University Student Union Vice-President Michael Parker has attacked the policy as a cunning trick to introduce full Tertiary Fees upon students already suffering under the Tertiary Tax. Mr Parker said, `The Liberals' and Nationals' policy will mean that students will be paying a Fee of between $600 and $9,000 every year before they start'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the reality. Members of the Opposition know that they are going to have full fee paying students. That is the reality. Members of the Opposition are not prepared to accept that it is the reality, nor are they prepared to admit it to the Australian population. As a result, thousands of students will be excluded from tertiary education, and they know that that is the reality. The press release continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal/National plan to allocate 25 per cent of existing places as Fee exempt is also fraught with faults. It would see Fee exempt places not going to students on the basis of need but at the discretion of the individual institutions . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The policy will also reduce the funds available to Public Tertiary Institutions by not increasing the current level of funding and also dispersing it to private institutions, such as Bond University. </PARA>
<PARA>That also is the reality. Let us go to what the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Deakin, said. Let me address a couple of the points that he made. The fee that would need to be imposed on higher education students if the Government were to meet its commitments to growth in the higher education sector, without increasing its own outlays and without contribution of students through the higher education contribution scheme, would be enormous-far more than the $600 touted by the Opposition. In the final year of this triennium, 1991, the Government's legislative commitment to higher education is $547.7m greater than the figure for 1988 in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of this increase is to be funded from increases in Commonwealth spending on this area, but a small part will be raised from contributions from students. Ultimately, students will be contributing about 20 per cent of the costs of their courses through the higher education contribution scheme. By 1991, it is projected, there will be some 400,000 students in the system. Assuming that, say, 25 per cent of these students were exempt from the payment of fees through scholarships or some other means, then in order to make up the $547.7m without extra government funding, each one of the remaining 75 per cent of students would have to pay an annual up-front fee of more than the $1,800 a year of this higher education contribution charge. That is the reality. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members continually harp on about fiscal constraint and lowering government expenditure, but time and again they come into this House making statements or bringing up policy initiatives which will mean further government expenditure. This is just another example. It is clear that, if 25 per cent of students are non-paying students, the rest will have to pay for them. What about the 25 per cent of non-paying students? At present 40 per cent of all tertiary students get Austudy. The Opposition intends to provide support for only 25 per cent. Where does that leave the rest?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is exactly correct. Opposition members seek to make a direct cut in Commonwealth assistance. They are embarrassed by the facts. Each student, regardless of whether part time or full time, internal or external, whether receiving Austudy or not, would have to pay more up-front than is required through the higher education contribution scheme, which of course provides income-contingent pay later arrangements. That is the reality. Opposition members do not like it, they do not want to accept it, and they will not be honest with the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has recently claimed that it can match the Government's commitment with a fee of $600. The honourable member for Deakin has guaranteed that the fee will not be increased or even indexed under a coalition government, yet the Opposition's fiscal policy is for reductions in government expenditure. There is a huge credibility gap. That credibility gap is even larger when one considers the funds that would be siphoned off into the private sector under the Opposition's policy to support private tertiary institutions, such as the Bond University. The impact on the public education system would be catastrophic. There is a very simple way of looking at this credibility gap. In current dollar terms, the higher education contribution scheme when fully operational will raise over $500m. The $600 fee proposed by the Opposition would raise no more than $170m. Who are Opposition members trying to fool when they say that they will not jack up the fee? What is the reality? The honourable member for Deakin said that the Opposition would retain its commitment to the number of places announced in the Budget. </PARA>

Some 25 per cent of students will have free places-no more than 25 per cent-and 40 per cent of current students receive Austudy. One does not have to be too sharp to work it out. The scholarships to which the Opposition refers will not be based on need. And who will they go to? They will go to the Opposition's friends in the private universities. That is the reality, and Opposition members know it. The Opposition has not got a rational approach to education policy, it does not have a rational response to this Government's educational initiatives, and as a result will be rejected at the next general election.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr CARLTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I am going to point out, within Standing Orders, that the honourable member was totally confused between Austudy and scholarships. He said that the Opposition policy allowed for 25 per cent of students in higher education to have free education, which is true, and the Labor Party provides no free education under its policy for anybody, and that is correct. Then he said that currently 40 per cent of students get Austudy which, of course, is for a living allowance and not for fees. He said that therefore, under the coalition policy, the difference between 40 per cent and 25 per cent would disadvantage a whole number of students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He is clearly mixing apples and oranges, quite different matters. Scholarships are totally different from Austudy which is a living allowance. The scholarship ensures that those students will not have to pay the fee. That is either deceitful or just a total misapprehension of what we are talking about, and I have to correct that before I say anything else. Tonight's debate is about student assistance. We are assisting students to enter into and complete their tertiary education. We are talking specifically about higher education in universities and in colleges of advanced education. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr CARLTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are talking about secondary education as well, but the main impact of the debate at the moment is on tertiary education, because that is the area where people have to pay the higher education contribution; that is where they have to pay the graduate tax. That is where the principal bite is at the moment. That is really where the focus of the debate is. The way in which the Labor Party has been assisting students is to require all of them to pay $1,800 minus 15 per cent up front as a fee, or it assists them by saying, `You do not have to pay that right now, but you can repay it when you go into the work force by paying higher tax'. In other words, the students can pay it back indexed so it will cost more than $1,800 later on through the tax. That is the higher education contribution scheme, and that is the way the Labor Party is currently assisting students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I pointed out at the time this Bill was introduced by the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan), this was a severe disadvantage to students in families which were poor or in families which had no previous experience of higher education and perhaps had less motivation to look at it and knew less about it. Therefore it was a disincentive to the very kinds of people we are trying to get into higher education. We are trying to extend the opportunities for a broader group within the population to get into higher education, and that is an objective which is shared by both sides of the House. I argued at the time the higher education contribution scheme-the graduate tax-was brought in that by applying it to everybody it would be a severe disincentive in those families where there was no previous experience of higher education or where there was extreme hardship. I argued very strongly about this from my own experience, because I came from such a family. I had the advantage of a Commonwealth scholarship. I came from a family which had no prior knowledge of higher education, and I came to a university without knowing anything about it. I think the chances of my having got there without there being a Commonwealth scholarship available would have been extremely small. So when I talk about student assistance, I talk about it from personal experience. Because of the means test applied to my parents' income, I was also given a living allowance under the Commonwealth scholarship, so I do believe I know something of what I am talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party has introduced the scheme on grounds which were generally supported. In other words, it was said that students that benefited from higher education should be required to make some contribution towards the additional employability they might have as a result of their higher education. There was no doubt that there was a public benefit in higher education, but there was also a personal benefit. The argument put forward by the Minister, when he talked about the new scheme, was that because there was a personal benefit, in addition to the public benefit, it was reasonable for the student to make a partial contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I actually accept that argument. I do not have any difficulty with it. However, if we are talking about student assistance, which is the subject of tonight's debate, we have to look at the circumstances of the students that front up to these particular requirements. We have to work out ways of assisting them into higher education, and of helping them to remain there. These ways must have some relevance to their personal situations, or to the situations of their families. That is what we are talking about tonight. The Bill makes some changes which are useful in this direction and for that reason the Opposition supports it. The Opposition has moved an amendment which is critical of the Government's administration of assistance. It is within that context that I wish to address my remarks. The higher education contribution scheme requires that students have a liability of $1,800 for a full year of a course. They can meet that requirement, either by paying the $1,800 minus 15 per cent discount up front, or they can sign a contract with the Government, which enables the Government to deduct the indexed amount over a period once those students go into employment. The Opposition opposed that scheme when it was introduced, not on the ground of the basic principle of students making a contribution, but on the ground that the general application of the higher education contribution was a severe--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr CARLTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will help you, Mr Deputy Speaker, by withdrawing that. I would like to refer to the alternative set of proposals by the Opposition on student assistance matters. At the heart of our proposals is the objective of widening participation in higher education. A parallel set of objectives is to release the institutions from the yoke of government interference and to provide them with the sustenance they need to determine their own destinies without bureaucratic interference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not speak about the latter set of objectives. I have cut that out of my speech because it would be out of order under the present rules for me to mention it. With regard to student assistance, instead of having the $1,800 higher education contribution charge-the graduate tax-and a very lengthy requirement to repay it by way of the taxation system or, alternatively, an up-front payment of $1,530, which I think is the current requirement, we propose to introduce a tuition fee of $600 which would apply to every student. This scheme would have the following offsets: the first one-this will assist students in a very material way-is that 25 per cent of the places will be free, because the institutions will be allowed to award a minimum of 25 per cent of the places without a fee being imposed. I think the institutions will accept the very new and important discipline of deciding who will be given these free places. This will not be done on the basis of a general national scholarship, because all the prospective medical and legal students who apply to enter universities in Sydney and Melbourne would win all the scholarships as they get the highest school results. Each institution would have its own set of objectives in regard to which students ought to be admitted. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the general approach of the university and college administrations will be to administer such schemes wisely. In the past they administered scholarship schemes. Some of those schemes have become so small that they are only in place in an embryonic fashion. I think it will be an important new responsibility for institutions to administer the 25 per cent free places component to make sure that they are distributed equitably. I have great confidence in those who run the institutions, advised by student groups, lecturers, and the various bodies which deal with student assistance within universities-people who handle housing, personal problems, student problems and so on-being able to work out schemes which are equitable and humane. This will remove the barriers to students from disadvantaged families which currently exist under the Dawkins scheme. That will be a very important advance in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The second important contribution that can be made to student assistance is to encourage private bodies, statutory authorities and government departments which need particular skills to provide scholarships and thus pay the $600 fee on behalf of students. That is already being provided for under our policy; I must say that it is done under the Labor Party's policy. Nurses will be covered under a Commonwealth-State arrangement-in other words, the $600 fee for nurses will be paid by the State governments. The New South Wales Education Department has indicated that it will provide the equivalent of scholarships for teacher trainees. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that companies which are anxious to employ graduates of colleges and universities will come forward with $600 scholarships. I also believe that statutory authorities such as metropolitan water, sewerage and drainage boards, electricity commissions and so on that are interested in taking on students will provide scholarships. I believe that the major companies will provide them. Further, I believe that local communities that are interested in the development of their communities and regions will provide them. I can see the possibility of Lions clubs, Rotary and other groups providing scholarships. I can see a whole raft of private or semi-private scholarships in addition to the taxpayer funded scholarships which the institutions will make available to 25 per cent of students. So I would see a larger percentage of students being assisted. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining fees would be paid directly by the students with money derived from whatever means. But, in order to ensure that nobody is denied a place because of an inability to get a free scholarship or because of a lack of support from parents, companies, statutory authorities or whatever, a Liberal-National government will facilitate, by government guarantee or other means, commercial loan arrangements with generous repayment periods for those students who wish to borrow the $600 to be paid to an institution. This will ensure that no prospective student is denied access to higher education because of inability to meet his contribution towards tuition costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me contrast the assistance being given to students by the Government and the assistance that would be given by a coalition government to enable students to participate and remain in higher education. The Labor Party has imposed a blanket charge of $1,800, less a 15 per cent discount for an up-front fee, which brings the charge down to roughly $1,530. Alternatively, a student can opt for a lifelong charge or less, depending on what is earned, paid through the tax system with an indexed $1,800 having to be paid back for each year of study. Under a Liberal-National government, a $600 charge would be applied to all initially, with a minimum of 25 per cent of students selected by the institutions being given a free $600 scholarship. In addition, a series of private or semi-private scholarships would increase the number of free places. Students who could not find $600 from their own resources, from their parents or whatever, could possibly take advantage of a guaranteed loan arrangement with generous repayment provisions. As a result, nobody will be denied access. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a far better scheme than the Labor Party's scheme. It also has the additional advantage that the money received from the fee would go directly to the institution that earns it. It would not go into a special fund in the Commonwealth Treasury, as does the higher education contribution charge. Of course, the fee would be received immediately in the year the tuition is given. We would not be dealing with some kind of delayed process which used the taxation system to collect the higher education charge that is then paid into a Treasury account. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal-National program for student assistance is clearly better designed-it is better for the students and it is better for the institutions. All we have to do is explain it to rebut the kind of obfuscation and misrepresentation employed in this House tonight by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. I have absolutely no worries that this policy will be fully supported when it is looked at and read by students in the institutions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale), who opened this debate for the Opposition, spoke bravely but revealed his inability to comprehend the complexities of higher education in our nation as we prepare to enter the twenty-first century. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) spoke persuasively but with some unease, I suspect, causing a suspicion that he had no real belief in the arguments he presented. I reject their nonsense claims that this Government has catered inadequately for educational assistance for rural youth. Our record of success surpasses the Opposition's wildest dreams of what it could hope to achieve were it to gain the confidence of the electorate. Our policies for tertiary education have caused ripples of discontent, certainly. Some Melbourne University students-a vocal minority of the university student body-yesterday demonstrated against the higher education fee. That was an example of the greedy trying to mislead the needy. The majority of students, parents and academics have praise for the Hawke Government's educational philosophy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remember my education odyssey well enough and the hardships my parents and I faced. Before the honourable member for Mackellar, having made a rather soft presentation, leaves the chamber, let me rebut this nonsense about scholarships. He may well have received a Commonwealth scholarship and gone to university, but what about those people who, having received payments for 10 months of the year, did not have parents who were sufficiently wealthy for them to fall back on during the two months when they received no payments? Did the honourable member for Mackellar ever work as a railway station assistant cleaning out latrines? Did he ever have to become a call boy-that is an interesting term-at a railway workshop, calling in demolition and emergency crews? Let us not talk about scholarships. I suspect that the honourable member for Mackellar may have come from a wealthier background than I did.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me go back to students' needs and the lot of students in a period when we had a conservative government in this country. The richest 10 per cent of students were getting an average of $35 per week for education purposes. What were the poorer 10 per cent of the population getting? Those poorer kids had an average of $3.50 per week spent on them-one-tenth of what the children from the better class families were receiving. The Liberal and National parties seek to perpetuate an unjust system. They seek to perpetuate a policy which results in the poor subsidising the rich. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to tertiary students' needs, let me take the Hunter, a working class area, as an example. Five per cent of people in my electorate have tertiary qualifications. What is the percentage in electorates such as Kooyong or Bradfield or Ryan, which are represented by conservative members? We find that 25 per cent of the people in those electorates have tertiary qualifications. We should ask ourselves when students most need assistance. I have had no trouble selling the higher education fee in my electorate. When students come to me I say to them, `You are paying an administrative fee. What would you rather do? Would you rather pay $5.50 per week at the time of your greatest need, when you have the backside out of your trousers, or $7 or $8 a week when you are earning $22,000 a year?'. Overwhelmingly, the reply is, `Gosh, that is not a bad deal. I find it very difficult now to find the $5.50 a week for the administration fee but certainly $7 or $8 a week will be no great impost upon me when I am earning $22,000 a year'. So we must destroy some of the nonsense arguments that are being presented by those who sit opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Student Assistance Amendment Bill is to make a number of minor changes to the Student Assistance Act, which provides the legislative basis for Austudy and the postgraduate award scheme. In 1987 the Hawke Labor Government introduced Austudy as the main scheme for community-wide student assistance. Austudy replaced the former tertiary education assistance scheme, the adult secondary education scheme and the secondary allowances scheme. Essentially, Austudy gives assistance to students from low income families or disadvantaged backgrounds to enable them to complete their secondary education and to undertake higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the fact that approximately 58 per cent of students now complete their year 12 education. Contrast this figure with the record of the previous coalition Government, under which only 36 per cent of students completed their secondary education. Under the coalition Government fewer than 116,000 students received education assistance. But this Government, since coming to office, has more than doubled the number of students receiving assistance. There were over 285,000 students receiving assistance at the end of 1988 and the number is still growing. I think most people would agree that the Government's record speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at expenditure on the Austudy scheme. The 1988-89 Federal Budget committed a massive $785.5m to Austudy. All up, the Federal Government's commitment to the education sector has risen from $438m in 1986 to $840m this year. Let us contrast that figure with the 1982 coalition Government's expenditure of a lousy $188m of student income support. No wonder honourable members opposite sink low in their seats. Again the record speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth pointing out that this Government, since coming to office, has more than tripled student income support. That is what this Bill is all about-assistance for students. Total outlays for student assistance are expected to exceed $1 billion by 1999. In 1989 it is estimated that Austudy assistance will be provided to some 42 per cent of tertiary students and 40 per cent of secondary students aged 16 and over. When this Government came to office in 1983 it was clear that Australia needed a highly skilled and adaptable work force in order to became internationally competitive. It recognised that, by international standards, Australia fell short in its knowledge of new techniques and the supply of skilled personnel. The Hawke Government has sought to address this shortcoming by encouraging our young people to stay on at school to complete their secondary education and then to undertake higher education or participate in work skills training programs. </PARA>

Maranoa is a very wise electorate and it sends wise members to this place. I am so proud that the honourable member assisted me. The points I have mentioned on student retention rates give a clear indication that the Government's strategy is working and working very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When Austudy was introduced in 1987 it was not without its teething problems. Delays in students receiving their first Austudy payment were caused by the changeover from the tertiary education assistance scheme and computerising the system. But fortunately the problems in that first year were rectified to a large extent and there has been a marked improvement in the time taken to process applications. I welcomed the announcement in the 1988-89 Budget that from 1989 Austudy payments to students over 21 were being brought into line with unemployment and sickness benefits. Previously, people on social security benefits were precluded from undertaking full time study to enhance their career opportunities because of the difference in the Austudy payment and the social security benefit. In my electorate of Hunter many people were desperately trying to improve their career opportunities but they were not able to make ends meet on the Austudy payment. Therefore, they had to undertake part time courses or maybe go to university or technical and further education colleges only one night a week so that they still qualified for their social security benefit. Not surprisingly, these people are delighted with the increase in the Austudy payment as they are now able to undertake full time study without being financially disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> Even this excellent move by the Government to increase Austudy payments this year has brought its own set of problems. I am pleased that the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan) has been quick off the mark to recognise that there are still a few bugs in the system. He is now looking at ways to iron out these problems and generally improve the system. The move to decentralisation is a good one, particularly in rural areas with selected Commonwealth Employment Service offices now able to deliver a range of information about Austudy and Abstudy. However, in my electorate of Hunter, our local CES office of Maitland was inundated with requests for Austudy application forms and quickly exhausted its supply. The Maitland CES was unable to secure additional supplies quickly. I had at least one constituent each day come into my office for an application form. This continued for some time because supplies were depleted. Although this delay was no cause for joy, it has now been rectified. There should be no recurrence. But there was obviously a substantial underestimate of the number of application forms supplied to CES regional offices. No doubt this will be a one-off situation, with adequate supplies being on hand for future years. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also drawn the Minister's attention to the problem that has arisen when people notify their social security office that they are undertaking full time study. As a consequence their social security benefit ceases from the day the commence their course. There seems to be too great a gap between that time and the time they receive their first Austudy payment. One instance that comes to mind concerns a constituent who was retrenched from his job early last year. He was married with two children. He quickly realised that the only way to further his career prospects, obtain secure employment and have a better lifestyle for his family was to further his education. He was accepted into a course in about June 1988, but it took eight weeks for his Austudy application to be processed. Those bugs are still occurring, but the whole basis of the scheme is excellent and is receiving overwhelming endorsement from the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Although we have ranged rather widely in this debate I have tried to stick to the facts. I have not debated the higher education fee. However, as I said earlier, the Minister is moving quickly to iron out the bugs. I am sure that from now on we will have no more of these minor hiccups. I welcome the Minister's advice that as soon as economic circumstances permit a few remaining anomalies will be addressed. These include the restrictive limit of $500-with a dollar for dollar reduction-applied to educational assistance such as scholarships and bursaries. One-off prizes are now exempt from the personal income assessment, as are scholarships intended to be up-front payment of the higher education contribution scheme. The Minister is also examining the provision of assistance to young homeless students during the six-week qualifying period. Following the Burdekin report's revelations this is very pleasing indeed. I have a number of disabled students in my electorate of Hunter and I am pleased that the Government is looking at the question of workload concessions for disabled students. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has a proud record in the education sector and is committed to gradually increasing the level of Austudy to the level of unemployment benefit for all students as Budget circumstances permit. I would also like to mention that in last year's Budget the Government lifted the parental income threshold for Austudy from $16,000 to $16,950, and the personal income threshold-the amount of income that people on Austudy can earn before losing part of their allowance-from $2,000 to $3,000. Other budgetary measures include a new Austudy and Abstudy assets test which will make student financial support much more equitable and will ensure that financial support goes to those most in need of help. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to stress, once again, that by any fair assessment this Government has taken giant strides forward in the provision of assistance to higher education students. Since taking office in 1983, the Government has progressively improved the level of financial assistance to students from low income families and disadvantaged backgrounds, including Aboriginal and disabled students. It has substantially increased the level of funding to the education sector. It has faced the challenge and has acknowledged the responsibility of better equipping Australia to take its place in an increasingly competitive world. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I congratulate the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the Hon. John Dawkins, and the Minister for Employment and Education Services, the Hon. Peter Duncan. By any estimation, their contribution has been outstanding. I am quite confident that in years to come people will look back on the Hawke Government's achievements in the field of education and applaud long and loud. </PARA>

This allows members from both sides of the House, but particularly our side of the House, to question the recently introduced assets testing by the Labor Government of the revamped education assistance which the Federal Government wrapped up in a new package some two or three years ago. It put a new name on it and sold it as Austudy. Obviously, the Government has put a little more money into that. But, in typical fashion, with its socialist thinking and trends, the Labor Government has introduced an assets test on this allowance. As usual, anyone with a bit of capital in Australia is discriminated against by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government wonders why we have a balance of payments deficit of $1.5 billion a month and interest rates at 20 per cent. There are lots of families in the area I represent. The electorate of Maranoa, in south-west Queensland, is a very large and isolated area. It is very difficult for people in outlying areas to educate their children. They have to rely on boarding schools, particularly once the children get to secondary school stage. A number of parents have to send their children to boarding school for all their education unless they employ teachers or teach their children themselves by correspondence classes or School of the Air classes which operate throughout Queensland and inland Australia. We on this side of the House believe that, because of this assets test, those people are being totally discriminated against. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that an income test should apply to education. All people pay tax. People on large incomes pay large amounts of tax and I do not see why they should not have some assistance to send their children to school. If they are denied that assistance, they are in effect paying tax twice: they pay it through the normal method of indirect or personal taxation and then they are asked to pay again because they are excluded from any assistance being offered. I must say that, under the isolated children's scheme, the first $989 is paid by the Federal Government. Of course, that is taxable. For students over the age of 16, that amount is added to their income for tax purposes. Obviously, not many students would be liable for tax as not many would receive income. But, if they do receive income, this Government, having given them assistance on the one hand, takes it away with the other. That approach is typical in a whole range of Government assistance measures. Such assistance is included in one's income and thus taxed. With bracket creep, the higher one's income the higher the amount of taxation. Under the tax system with which we are saddled, there is no adjustment for inflation. People move into a higher tax bracket and so pay more taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> State governments also pay some assistance to isolated children, but it is not enough to cover the cost. In my case, I send a child to a grammar school, which is in most cases cheaper than a number of boarding schools. It costs $2,500 a term just for the basic boarding and teaching fees. About half that amount is for boarding fees and the other half is for teaching fees. If one multiplies that by three, one is looking at about $8,000 a year. Then there is all the travel involved, although there is some travel assistance for students. But most parents who live in isolated communities have to pay large amounts for travel, and there are other associated costs. So I would estimate that it costs about $10,000 to educate a child who is not able to walk daily to what is usually a state school. Each State has its own education system. State schools have been provided for over 100 years now by the taxpayers. </PARA>

In some States, particularly in my own State of Queensland, agricultural colleges run boarding schools. But in most cases it is the churches that have become involved in running boarding schools. They do an excellent job. The Catholic Church has its own education system. It does an excellent job educating children throughout the States, not only at the primary level but also at the secondary level of education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unlike the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), I do not believe that there is necessarily such a thing as an underprivileged child in Australia as far as education is concerned. The education system is universal. It is available to all. It is just a case of the Government putting in place systems and allowing people to make use of them. There is no excuse on the part of any government for any student not to have equal opportunity or equal access to the education system. That is the policy that we on our side of politics adopt. Our policy is to abolish the assets test on the isolated children's allowance. We also advocate the inclusion of a hardship clause in the assets test on Austudy. I believe that is how it should be, and I am sure that most parents listening to this debate tonight would agree with me. </PARA>
<PARA> It is amazing that the Labor Government excludes the family home from the capital gains tax but does not exclude it from the assets test. Some homes around Sydney Harbour are valued at $10m or $20m. I know I am taking an extreme example, but one can live in such homes in many suburbs in the capital cities of Australia, sock away one's income and build up one's asset in the family home. That is forcing up the price of the family home. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) decided to exclude the family home from the capital gains tax. He had a whim in a radio interview in Perth before an election-I cannot quite remember which election it was-and decided that the family home should be excluded. The result is a total distortion of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> We are opposed to the capital gains tax. We intend to abolish it and put in a system involving depreciation over a five-year period. But the Australian Labor Party, the socialists of this country, have excluded the family home from the capital gains tax. As I have said, they have built up a system whereby people can put all their income into their homes. But the family home is not excluded from the assets test. Rural Australians do not pour all their money into their homes-obviously they build reasonably good homes-because there is no incentive for them to do so. They pour money into their businesses. So they build up their farms, although it is difficult these days for them even to do that under this Government because the Government has abolished the depreciation allowances. The Government wonders why there is no investment taking place in this country. One only gets a 5 per cent investment allowance for most items, so it is pretty difficult. </PARA>

That is a lot of nonsense. How can anyone invest with interest rates at 18 or 19 per cent? It is just nonsense to think that investment is taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One night here in the House $1 billion was wiped off the investment allowance. There is no investment allowance in our tax system at all. There is no encouragement in our tax system at all to invest in business. Those on the other side wonder why it is not happening. One wonders why Australia is going bankrupt. It is not hard to work out. No-one wants to invest in this country-except the Japanese. They are pouring money in because they have got money at 4 per cent. Under the investment guidelines the Government is operating, there is money coming in in bucket loads. The Japanese are building schools here. They wish to build specialised Japanese schools here to teach English. There is plenty of that going on in New South Wales because they are the sorts of schemes the Labor Government is encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not mind joint ventures but I am opposed to the 100 per cent investment that the present Government is allowing. Capital investment in Australia may have picked up in the last few months, but it has been abysmal until now and it will not last long because interest rates have gone to where they have. Interest is one of the biggest costs there is in business, although in business they are a tax deduction. But if one does not have the cash flow one does not have the tax deduction available to one. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I am getting a bit off the track, but in 1988-89 Government funding for the isolated children's allowance was $26.9m, down 17 per cent or $5.5m from the 1987-88 contribution, which was $32m. In 1988-89 Government education places for assistance to isolated children were down by 4,500 or 23 per cent. There are 4,500 children out there now who are not getting assistance. I was at Peak Downs electoral council at Capella last weekend where I was told that there were so many children staying away from boarding school that the school of the air system, the radio system that people there have to use to educate their children, is being clogged because there are not enough channels available and so people do not get a proper education. These are the sorts of problems and distortions which the Government puts in place once it introduces something like an assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $3.2m has been transferred into Austudy. As a result, 4,500 children in remote areas of Australia will not be given education assistance under the Labor Government. These are facts and figures straight out of the Budget Papers, under student assistance. It is there in black and white for those on both sides of the House to read. I am sure the Labor Party does not want to know too much about it but that is the sort of system it has introduced. Of course, the Austudy assets testing is precluding many people from obtaining a decent education. There are no universities at Charleville that I know of, none at Roma, none at Goondiwindi, none at Birdsville. But if one happens to be a child who lives in one of those places one has to go 1,800 miles to university in Brisbane-because that is where the closest university to my electorate is. Such children need assistance. Families can have millions of dollars of assets, but if they have no cash flow, no cash income, they are expected by this Government to sell their assets. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what the Government is doing with overseas investment. It is selling off Australia, bankrupting the country and offering it to the highest bidders from wherever. Most of them are coming from Japan. We are being asked under this assets test to do exactly the same thing. The expected net market value of assets is the price expected once the assets are sold less any debts associated with the assets such as loans, mortgages, hire purchase agreements, et cetera. The Government is telling people that if they cannot meet their education costs, if they need to sell their assets to educate their children, it expects them to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> What is this country coming to? It is no wonder we are broke. These are the sorts of policies that this Labor Government has put in place. As I said previously, I believe that all children should get an education even without an income test, but I guess if we need to have an income test we probably would be prepared to face up to that. But to introduce an assets test on top of the income test which we have today is beyond the pale because it means that certain children are excluded from getting a reasonable education. I did not think that was what the Australian Labor Party was about. I do not know how rural Labor members feel. I do not know how the honourable member for Hunter and others feel about the sorts of policies that have been introduced by the Minister. I would imagine that they would find it pretty tough and awkward in their electorates when they are asked to explain why so many children do not have the same opportunities. That is what we are on about. It is tough for families to have to send away to school children of age five and onwards. Not only do parents have to break up families but also they have to struggle and do all sorts of things in order to get enough money together to pay the exorbitant costs that are now involved in giving children an education. </PARA>
<PARA> The isolated children's allowance (ICA) is income-tested and cuts off at $300,000. A 50 per cent allowance means that this limit can be extended to $600,000. But it is not difficult to reach that figure these days. Most businesses and farms are worth that sort of money. If one does not have the income because of droughts or whatever, it is very difficult to get the money that is needed to have one's children educated. I agree with the honourable member for Hunter that greater educational opportunities should be available to all children. All Australians should have equal opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week Mrs Patricia Mitchell from the Isolated Children's and Parents Association was in Parliament House. The Association is very concerned that the children's allowances are in no way indexed. There is no guarantee that the allowances will continue, even at the reduced rate. The Association wants legislation to be enacted to guarantee that its members' children will continue to be eligible for this sort of assistance. The isolated children's scheme, which appears as a one-line entry in the Budget, has been allocated nearly $27m in 1988-89. Of course, as I mentioned, in 1987-88, $35m was allocated. There has been a reduction of $8m some of which has gone to Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the Government would not take a private member's Bill on board. But I am looking at ways in which we can put in place some legislation which will guarantee ongoing assistance. This item should not be just a one-liner that can be wiped out of the Budget Papers. </PARA>

He talked about abolishing the assets test and wondered why it imposed was in the first place. I can tell the honourable member that a number of people in my electorate from working class families on fixed incomes were upset because their children, who had to pay their fees in cash, attended schools or they were going to school or on to higher education institutions with the children of wealthier parents who were receiving Austudy. There was a basic inequality there. I suppose it always comes back to the way in which one measures income or wealth. The assets test is one way that the Government has come up with to make sure that we can more effectively target that money to where it is going. If all we are going to do is abolish the assets test on Austudy, then that inequality will be put back in and we will get people of substantial wealth adjusting their incomes so that they can get Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>

He also talked about education in the country. I have sympathy for some of the points raised by the honourable member, certainly in regard to isolated children. When one looks at education in the country, one has to admit that there is a basic inequality in the distribution of incomes. Not everybody in the country is poor; there are a lot of rich people, and one has to ask oneself whether they keep their children at the local primary or secondary school. By and large, the answer is that they do not. What they do is send them down to the city. The effect of that on local education is that there are smaller class sizes, smaller schools and fewer offerings for those people who are left behind. If the Opposition had addressed those problems when it was in government or in its contributions here, we could perhaps say that it was thinking a little about what is happening to the quality of education in the country. But there is nothing about that. It is all about assets tests and a private member's Bill to make sure that people get as much money as they need and that it will not cost any more.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no way that they would go to the nearest one either, which is the point I was making. I think it is fair to say, looking at education over the years, that up until quite recently we did not take education as seriously as we should have or as seriously as our trading partners did. The statistic that is always talked about is that in 1983 only 36 per cent of our young people finished high school, which was abysmally low. That was reflected right through our educational offerings. Less than 7 per cent of our young people were going on to a university education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was just talking about inequality in the bush. There is also inequality in the cities. As the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) put it, at university one could usually tell where a person came from by his postcode. It was education by postcode. Those people who happened to live in the better off areas were by and large the people who went to university and got the benefit of a degree. This Government is on about making sure that everybody has the opportunity, and the legislation before us tonight aims to do just that. The Government realises that not everybody can afford at the end of secondary school to stay on for a very expensive tertiary education. That is what Austudy is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the advances in education in this country, by and large they have been under Labor governments. The Whitlam Labor Government brought in Austudy. This Government has drastically expanded education, not only in universities and colleges of advanced education but also in technical and further education institutions and primary and secondary schools. Our policies have been aimed at making sure that education is expanded right across the board. Of course, one of the features of the previous Government's education policy was the need to import skills. It always found it easier to go overseas and bring in tradesmen than to train our own. This Government has adopted a very different policy of home grown skills training. Our training is now done in this country, as do all those countries that are going a lot better than we are. </PARA>
<PARA> The education system in 1983 reflected the economy-basically agrarian and no value added. The Government is changing that education system because there is massive change to the work force. One can tie in with the award restructuring that is going on the sort of educational offerings this Government is putting into place, in cooperation with the employers, the unions and the education providers of this country. One starts looking at getting out of the system all of those unproductive work practices. </PARA>
<PARA> On a number of occasions the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has pointed out to the House the investment in new plant and equipment coming into this country. We have to have people to run all that new plant and equipment. We have to have people to operate it and maintain it. That is what the Government's education system is aimed at doing. Once again, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business quite rightly pointed out that in 1983 anyone who wanted to see an industrial museum had only to look at Australian industry. That was quite true. The plant and equipment we had belonged basically to the 1920s, we were importing our skills and we were not trading enough. The whole thing had to change. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said before we silenced the honourable member for Maranoa, in terms of expanding education we were confronted basically with the need to make a decision about whether to take the necessary money from tax revenue or to ask the students to make some contribution themselves. I have always been of the opinion that the students should make a contribution. There is absolutely no doubt that our society benefits from our education system, but there is also a personal benefit. I had that personal benefit quantified for me by the Parliamentary Library. I asked the Library to look at the expected lifetime earnings of people in different categories. The figures they came up with are all expressed in 1986 dollars, so honourable members can make a direct comparison between the lifetime earnings of those who go through the different strands of education and those with no education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Labourers and related workers, people with few or no skills, can expect to earn $750,000 over their working lives. That figure jumps to $930,000 for people such as electrical tradesmen and for clerks-those who have received some formal training. For the university-educated such as natural scientists, building professionals and engineers, the figure jumps to $1.34m. For people in the health area, such as diagnosticians and treatment practitioners, it jumps to $1.5m. It can be seen that education does benefit the individual, and to ask individuals to pay back the $1,800 after they have received the benefit of that education seems to me to be a very fair and honest way of seeking a contribution from them. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no upfront changes to deter people from going into higher education. As I have pointed out, there is not much hope for anyone who does not take advantage of higher education, knowing the benefits that accrue to those attaining it. I do not think people have really sat down and thought through the benefits of having a higher education, as reflected in those figures. Certainly, if they did, a lot more people would want to get into higher education. I think that is happening now. A lot more people want to get into our universities. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the alternative to that method of fund raising was to take the necessary funds from taxation revenue. I viewed it in this way: Either the recipients of the benefits of higher education were to make some contribution themselves or we were going to ask the vast majority of the Australian population, over 90 per cent of whom would never go near a university, to fund all university places. I thought it was a bit unfair to ask truck drivers trying to bring up families and buy houses on an income of less than $20,000 a year to pay higher taxes to help fund the expansion in universities. I fully support the Government's moves in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> When one compares that with the Opposition's policy of a $600 up-front fee-as the Minister has pointed out-one sees that, even allowing for the money that that will generate, there will be a $500m shortfall. The obvious conclusion one would have to draw-it was drawn by the students on day one; the first day this policy hit the streets-is that that is only the tip of the iceberg. Once that policy is in and there is that shortfall from the funds, the obvious thing to do is increase it. It was not properly costed. The up-front charge, especially for people on low incomes, is a poor feature of the Opposition's policy and certainly one that we would not embrace. That is one of the reasons why we have condemned it. </PARA>
<PARA> When one takes the Opposition's figures on education and sees that it maintains that 25 per cent of students will get a free education, no one has any idea about how it is to be allocated. Will it go to the poorest 25 per cent of students? Will it go to country students? Will it go to all students? Will it be a bit of dog's breakfast as to where those students come from? I really do not know and neither does anybody else. When one looks at that 25 per cent and remembers that currently 40 per cent of students are eligible for Austudy, one comes to the conclusion that there will be a 15 per cent shortfall. So even on its own figures of free education for 25 per cent, it will not cover the students that are currently in need. That point should be made when viewing the Opposition's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> When looking at the way in which education in this country has been expanded one only has to go back-these figures have been used before but they are worth repeating-to the last year of the Fraser Government, when $188.3m was expended on student income support. In equivalent dollar terms $720m has been expended this year-a massive increase in student support. One would expect that because we have expanded tertiary education quite dramatically over that time. Even allowing for that growth, one can see that the income support going to each student has been raised dramatically. In the last year of the former Government, 116,000 students were assisted in their income support. In only six years, the Government has more than doubled this figure, assisting over 285,000 young people to the end of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> In one sense we cannot be too critical. The Opposition has at least thrown up a policy in this area. It was shot full of holes the first day not only by the Minister but also by the students, who said they would have nothing to do with it. But at least it has a policy out that we can have a look at. We can start costing it and come out with figures such as the ones I have just quoted. It will have to have policies in other areas that complement it. We have not even seen a taxation policy yet. How do students know how the taxation policy will tie in? What about the medical benefits? The whole area is related. At least under this Government Medicare covers their health insurance. The Opposition has to start explaining to the people of Australia how it would run this country in many areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The policies that have been thrown up by the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale), are not a very good start. For the reasons that I and other speakers have outlined, the Government's record stands in stark contrast to that of the Government that preceded it. I am sure that at the next election the Government will be returned and will carry on the good work. </PARA>

The Bill proposes instead that authorised persons be identified as officers whose departmental duties include making decisions on Austudy or postgraduate awards. </PARA>
<PARA>It is that section of the Bill to which I shall be addressing my speech this evening. The relevant clause is clause 4 (b), which includes definitions. The definition of `authorised person' is in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> ``authorised person'' means an officer of the Department who is required or permitted by the duties of his or her office or, if he or she is acting in an office, of the office in which he or she is acting, to perform some or all of the functions, or excercise some or all of the powers, of an authorised person under this Act or the regulations;</PARA>
<PARA>The explanatory memorandum tells us that the expression `officer' is used in the new definition of `authorised person':</PARA>
<PARA> The latter definition needs to be consistent with the concept of `senior authorised person' in section 17 (5) of the Principal Act, i.e. `authorised person' needs to be limited to officers in the normal hierarchy of the Australian Public Service. Accordingly, the definition of `officer' is amended so as not to include employees in general, who would not necessarily come within that hierarchy. </PARA>
<PARA>So this section of the Bill is to make it a little easier to handle Austudy applications and the assessment of them. It is to widen it. It is to make certain information available to more people. The thing, we are told, at the moment is administratively too complex and we need more people available to do it who are doing other things as well, but every now and then they are going to do something in this Bill under this requirement. Today I addressed a question to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and it was the Minister for Employment and Education Services who answered. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> My question . . . relates to Austudy applications, which are means tested on the basis of parents' taxable income for the previous financial year. Why does his Department insist that original copies of taxation assessments be submitted with Austudy applications? Why will his Department not accept a simple statement of taxable income on the Austudy application form, as is the practice of the Department of Social Security, for example, in the implementation of the means test on the family allowance? What safeguards are there to prevent information on this assessment notice-for example, the tax file number-being made available to people who are not entitled to the information? What action has the Minister taken to apply the relevant provisions of the Privacy Act relating to tax file numbers to his Department's handling of these assessment notices?</PARA>
<PARA>In his answer the Minister slid right from under. I do not know whether he realised what the implication of that question was or whether he simply did not know the answer. The Minister for Employment and Education Services said:</PARA>
<PARA> Basically the reason why original documentation has been sought is that, unlike many other applications that are made across the Government for various types of benefits, Austudy essentially is a benefit that is applied for once a year and therefore is not regularly checked in the way that some other benefits are. Accordingly, we felt it desirable to ensure that when the application was put in the original documents should be sought so that there would be a minimisation of any chance of defrauding the scheme. Accordingly, we have sought to ensure that fraud of the scheme is kept to a minimum. There has been some concern about such things and in reviewing the arrangements during the past year we have ensured that the whole procedures are tightened up. This has been part of the tightening up that we have undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's entire concern is to tighten up in relation to fraud, which of course I would applaud, but he has had no concern at all for the Privacy Act, which has been a matter of some debate in this House today. There is no need for an applicant to submit an original of a taxation assessment form if fraud is the concern. For example, an applicant could submit a certified copy of a taxation assessment form, certified by a justice of the peace, which would be just as good. In fact, people are required to hand over the original of their taxation assessment form and hope that they get it back. That is the central point of what I will be talking about tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no need, further, I would submit, for the taxation assessment notice to be submitted at all. I referred specifically in my question to the family allowance. It is in the same category as that described by the Minister. It is a once a year application form. It is not periodically reviewed throughout the financial year. Family allowance is assessed on the basis of taxable income in the previous year. On 1 July a person's income could reach $1m. It does not matter, it is what was the person's taxable income in the previous year. That is exactly the same position as for Austudy. People are not required to provide their taxation assessment notice when they apply for family allowance. There is a section on the form where they are required to state the amount of their taxable income for the previous year. The Department of Social Security makes whatever checks are necessary, presumably of the Taxation Office to guard against fraud. There is no reason why Austudy could not be handled in exactly the same way. Therefore, the Minister's answer in that respect is quite wrong. He did not answer my question and misrepresented what is possible. As I have said, it is not necessary in any event to require original documents. The Privacy Act has a direct relevance to this debate. I shall briefly refer to the relevant provisions and return to them towards the end of my speech. Guideline 3 of the Privacy Act says:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax file number recipients-in this case this is officers of the Department of Employment, Education and Training; they become recipients of the tax file number by virtue of having in their hands a taxation assessment-</PARA>
<PARA>shall take all reasonable steps in the circumstances to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) introduce information handling procedures to protect the privacy of individuals in relation to their tax file number information;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) make staff aware of the rights of individuals to privacy in relation to their tax file number information . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is what I was referring to further in my question today. The Minister said that there had been some concern and that procedures had been tightened up-and I shall come to that matter in a moment. Further, in guideline 3 one sees the statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax file number recipients holding tax file number information shall take all reasonable steps in the circumstances to ensure that security safeguards and procedures are in place to prevent unauthorised access to, modification or disclosure of, and loss of, such information, whether that information is stored in physical or electronic forms. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax file number recipients shall take all reasonable steps in the circumstances to ensure that access to records which contain tax file number information for authorised purposes is confined to persons who have a need for access to such information for the purpose of carrying out tax-related functions of the tax file number recipient. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not even sure whether this Bill complies with that guideline in widening, so that it is nice and easy for the Department, the number of people who will be handling the application forms with the attached taxation assessment. An expert would be able to answer whether the Bill does comply with the guidelines. Yesterday, certain information came to me. I want to relate a case in point about the handling by the Department of Employment, Education and Training of tax file number information. Another member's constituent, whom we will call the Smiths, received back the Austudy assessment of their son. Attached to it was the original tax file assessment notice of a constituent of mine, whom we will call the Browns. The Browns had put in an application for their daughter. So the Smiths received the assessment, presumably for their son-we cannot be sure because the wrong tax file assessment number is attached to it. The Smiths got the Browns' tax file assessment complete with tax file number. The Browns had received the assessment for their daughter-presumably the right one-with no tax file assessment notice attached to it. They did not have the Smiths' tax file assessment. The Smiths took this matter to their member of Parliament, expressing some anger. They had asked whether they could submit a certified copy rather than part with their original. However, the Department said no and insisted on the original-only the original would do. I say to the Minister that after the Privacy Act no review was done of departmental procedures, or that would not have happened for a start. The Smiths got back somebody else's assessment notice and the somebody else did not have theirs. They were advised to post the tax file assessment back to the Department. Yesterday the Browns received a notice in the mail of their tax file assessment in a plain brown envelope. There was no indication of where it came from. There was no covering letter saying, `We omitted to return this to you with your daughter's application'; nothing-just whack it in a plain brown envelope and hope nobody is the wiser. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's Department is in breach of the Privacy Act. I hope very much that my constituent pursues the course of action I suggested, namely, a complaint with a view to prosecution of the Department for its handling of that tax file assessment. In the meantime, the Smiths do not have theirs; nobody has theirs. It is on a desk somewhere, or in a wastepaper basket, in a file or in Heaven knows whose hands. Maybe the Joneses have got the Smiths' tax file assessment. Who knows? It still has not turned up as of today. Sloppy would be putting it kindly. </PARA>
<PARA> It was this Government that brought in the tax file number provisions for tax cheats. It is that action of this Government that means we have a Privacy Act, and thank God we do, which covers this very clearly and simply. There has been some reference to guideline 4 in the debate here today and elsewhere, and I will refer to a paragraph of it so that it is very clear what I am talking about. Guideline 4.3 (c) states:</PARA>
<PARA>Government agencies, including the Commissioner of Taxation, shall not directly or indirectly disclose tax file number information . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This Government agency, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which apparently wants much lower ranking officers to have access to this information, cannot handle it at present. I do not know why we should be making it easier for it. I would like to refer to section 11 of the Privacy Act and its relevance in this matter. Section 11 (1) states:</PARA>
<PARA>A person who is (whether lawfully or unlawfully) in possession or control of a record that contains tax file number information shall be regarded, for the purposes of this Act, as a file number recipient. </PARA>
<PARA>So when the Smiths got the Browns' tax file assessment and tax file number, under the definition of the Privacy Act they were tax file number recipients. They were in possession of it unlawfully, but that unlawfulness, of course, related to the actions of the Department and not the Smiths. There was no unlawful act. Mind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) would say that the Smiths, by virtue of opening an envelope addressed to them containing information that was not theirs, could have been acting unlawfully-the parallel he is giving is about people opening envelopes containing information that does not belong to them. If the Smiths had not dealt with it expeditiously, let us say if they had handed it over to a staff member of the member of Parliament they went to see, according to the Treasurer they would have committed an unlawful act. However, they posted it back to the Department. Who knows who in the Department has since handled that tax file assessment with the attached number and the other information on it. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether the Minister cares. I will be interested to hear whether he does. He is going to have a lot of time to do his homework, because this debate will not finish tonight, it will be in continuation when we come back in more than three weeks time. But I would expect the Minister to come back with something a little better than the answer he gave me to my question today. I think we should have a detailed statement from the Minister on how his Department is handling people's taxation information and a detailed explanation of how this could possibly have happened. He does not have to know what happened in the case of the Smiths and the Browns, as they are not their names. He will find out their names well and good if they decide to pursue a prosecution. But that is not the point. If it has happened in this case-where the recipient just happened to go and see the member of Parliament, who said, `Post it back straight away'; she did not even take a photocopy because he knew the implications of it-who knows how many cases it has happened in. In any event, where is the Smiths' assessment?</PARA>
<PARA> There is only one physical way this could have happened; after applications are received, at some stage tax assessment notices are physically removed from the application. They are not kept attached in such a way that they cannot be removed. The fact that it has happened to two people, Smith and Brown, shows that it is not just an isolated incident. The fact that Brown's assessment can be attached to Smith's form-the form was the right one-shows the amount of diligence taken by officers of this Department in the handling of highly confidential and personal information about applicants for Austudy. The possibilities are, of course, endless. I would like the Minister to give some details about that. I want to know who handles the assessments now and how they are handled. I want to know the changes that this legislation will bring about; who will be handling the assessments in future and how they will be handled. Why must it be the original assessment, and not the alternative that the Department of Social Security quite adequately uses for a totally parallel payment? Why is it not possible for the Department of Employment, Education and Training to follow the same course?</PARA>
<PARA> My time is close to running out and I know others are hoping to speak tonight before we adjourn. I strongly support the second reading amendment moved by the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale). It is a pity that the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), who spoke before me, is not still in the House. When he made his waffly speech about `our tax policy' and `our Medicare policy', `our health policy' or our whatever-else policy, we found out what his Government was really doing and how little it cares. We have had a lot of lip service on the subject of privacy, confidentiality, care and concern about people. Here are some really distressed people, who are not wealthy, or they would not be receiving Austudy. What is the Minister going to do about those people?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As previous speakers have indicated, the Student Assistance Amendment Bill seeks to make a number of relatively minor changes to the Student Assistance Act 1973, which gives a basis for both Austudy and post-graduate awards. Its purpose is a general tidying up of the Student Assistance Act altering wording and facilitating management. In some areas it is pedantic, as the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale) so rightly said in this place earlier this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst the Opposition generally supports the provisions of the Bill, more important are the Government's philosophical and practical flaws inherent in its general approach to higher education. I do not wish to delay the House at this late hour. However, it is impossible to talk about student assistance without drawing on the rationale for student contribution. In order to do that, I would like to highlight, and draw to the attention of the House, two media releases and to contrast them; one by the honourable member for Deakin and the other by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). </PARA>
<PARA> Taking first the media release by the honourable member for Deakin, I will highlight the points he makes in relation to student contributions and student assistance. In the context of releasing the Liberal and National parties' higher education policy on 23 February, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Policy also commits a Liberal National Government to a thorough review of AUSTUDY with improved income support as budgetary circumstances permit, and an independent enquiry into inadequacies in the post-graduate award system. </PARA>
<PARA> A loans scheme with generous repayment terms would help needy students meet the costs of the annual tuition charge. </PARA>
<PARA> The graduate tax is nothing but a tax on knowledge imposed by a Labor Government that has no respect for academic excellence and no vision for the young people of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> By forcing students into debt to the tax man, the Hawke Government has shown that it does not understand the needs of young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an appalling act of discrimination, which will make it harder than ever for young people to get ahead and make ends meet when they graduate and find jobs. The $1,800 a year graduate tax discriminates against young people and will cause students to start their working lives with tax debts of over $6,000. A Liberal and National Party government would ensure that one in four students, as previous speakers from this side of the House have said, funded by the Federal Government through national education awards, receive a totally free education, with the others paying $600 a year as an annual tuition charge. On 1989 enrolment figures, this would mean that in excess of 100,000 higher education students would receive a free education on the basis of merit and/or need in Australian universities, colleges of advanced education and institutes of technology. The policy guarantees that the number of national education awards presented during the 1989-91 triennium will not be less than the number of student places projected in the 1988 Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties are committed to easing the burden on young people in general, and have decided to set a level of $600 for that annual tuition charge. We believe that the charge of $600 for other student is a fair and affordable contribution to full-time study. We will ensure that students have a choice of paying it up-front at the time of enrolment, paying it off through the year on a semester basis, or repaying it through a loans scheme. The annual tuition charge is a sensible and practical response to students' concerns while also satisfying their educational and economic needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the press release issued by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training in which he criticised the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale). He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Students would not be exempted on the basis of merit, but on some dangerous sounding system of Commonwealth-State assessment which sound reminiscent of the proponents of the master race during the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA>How absurd can one get! He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Not only do Mr Beale's and Mr Howard's sums not add up, but their plans to impose a $600 up-front fee will mean thousands of young Australians will be discouraged from going on to university and college by the fee. </PARA>
<PARA>That is clearly not true. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . The system of funding would produce a funding shortfall relative to the resourcing levels committed in the current Government's funding decision for the 1989-91 triennium. </PARA>
<PARA>That is blatantly untrue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very misleading; it is untrue. I would like to point out to the Government and to the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan), who is at the table, that the Government has indicated that it expects to raise $41.8m this year, rising to $170m in 1991-92. Even if one uses the figures for student places of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, our scheme would raise $146.7m in 1989, rising to $170.1m in 1991. I suggest that the Minister's maths is almost as bad as his famous interest rate predictions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unlike the emotive, ideological rubbish-and it is nothing more than that-which I heard in this place earlier this evening from the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), I do not believe that higher education is the preserve of the relatively privileged in Australia. It has been possible over the years for people on relatively modest incomes to enter higher education. By what stretch of the imagination could a massive increase in costs to students be said to improve the access of the under-privileged? I believe that, on the one hand, the higher education contribution scheme, the so-called graduate tax, is objectionable philosophically, that it provides a significant financial disincentive for students from low income and disadvantaged families, and that, from a practical perspective, it is unworkable administratively. On the other hand, the Opposition's alternative policy, whilst acknowledging that there is no such thing as a free education if the number of tertiary places is to be expanded, at least provides a workable and equitable solution. </PARA>
<PARA>Papers</PARA>
<PARA> I favour any higher educational system that will restore a sound funding basis and that will give State governments greater responsibility for planning future development in our States. On that point I welcome the Queensland Government's decision to afford full university status progressively over the three years from 1 January 1990 to the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education in my electorate. Not everything the Minister puts forward in his higher education policy is wrong; some of it is very sensible. </PARA>

It is one which rebuts so much of the ideological bent of the Government's approach to higher education: the Government's forced merger of a great many tertiary institutions which are so reluctant to downgrade their standards in these forced amalgamations; the Government's widespread appointments of political hacks to senior positions within tertiary institutions so as to reflect its particular ideological prejudices; and, moreover, its discriminatory, unfair and burdensome higher education tax. However much the Government tries to dress it up as a graduate tax, the truth remains that this form of levy acts as a disincentive to students obtaining higher education in this country. Who could argue that this country needs a greater number of graduates from tertiary institutions?

It is bleeding to death the flagship of science in this country. It is doing to CSIRO exactly what it is doing to the research effort in higher education institutions. It is tragic for the future of this country that so few young people see science as a worthy career. It is not simply a matter of remuneration; it is more a matter of career structure. They have to know, firstly, that there is some sort of security in the form of tenure, as well as a career path which they can follow to senior positions. At present the universities are in absolute uproar as they band-aid outdated equipment, some of which, incidentally, poses a serious health risk to scientists who operate it and daily undergo risk of personal injury.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) gave a wonderful audition for the comedy hour. The essential attributes of the agreement `Raising the Standard-General Practice and Quality Patient Care' between the Commonwealth and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is based on a sound rationale. It develops appropriate processes that acknowledge the special relationship between general practitioners (GPs) and patients. It is task orientated to provide an improved quality care for patients, better qualified GPs and cost effectiveness for the taxpayer. The package is completed by an effective review and monitoring independent of the Government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. The focus of the agreement is on the provision of primary care. It is a preventative policy that raises the status and influence of GPs whilst providing improved quality medical care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The agreement reaffirms the precious relationship between patient and GP. It also reasserts the primary role of the GP in medical care. Patients would benefit from a person continuing comprehensive care. The long term plan well into the next century deserves the overwhelming support of the community, the medical profession and this Parliament. By continuing their medical education and quality assurance programs, GPs will improve the quality of care for their patients. There has been indicated a sensible transition period until 1995, after which doctors seeking to enter general practice will be required to undertake specific postgraduate training in general practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Well trained and experienced GPs could significantly reduce health costs in the secondary and tertiary sectors by appropriate investigation and management at the primary level and by accurate referral to other sectors where appropriate. This greater emphasis on the GP as the gatekeeper of medical care will have obvious benefits. GPs will be able to spend more time with patients where necessary and they will be in a better position to discourage inappropriate and expensive referrals to specialists and unnecessary ordering of pathology, radiology and pharmaceuticals. In effect, changes are being sought in work practices which will result in increased productivity in general practice through improvement in the quality of patient care. </PARA>
<PARA> The new schedule, including fee differentials, will be implemented from 1 August 1989. It is expected that around 90 per cent of GPs will immediately qualify for enrolment on the new vocational register-a similar arrangement to that currently applying to specialists. The new schedule will contain four new content-based descriptors for GP consultations, some of which would include a time element in addition to the content element. Standards of GP practice will inevitably be raised. The inclusion of the time element in some of the descriptors will limit the potential for a drift to higher priced services and, immediately, will make it easier and simpler for patients to understand just what they are paying for. The date of 1 August 1989 is appropriate for the implementation of the agreement. This will allow for the passage of the necessary legislation, for the voluntary registration of GPs, and for the information on the changes to be widely distributed among doctors and patients. </PARA>
<PARA> The package is completed by an effective monitoring system. The monitoring and auditing of the use of the new content-based items will be carried out by a peer review body independent of the Government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners but, importantly, with the support of the college. It is, of course, in the best interests of the profession that the standards and codes of conduct are maintained. The new monitoring process will extend the current profile-based system to include random practice audits and assessments of the appropriateness of specialist referrals, diagnostic tests and prescribing pharmaceuticals. For doctors who do not qualify or who chose not to enrol on the vocational register, the present time-tiered items will remain, which will ensure that patients of doctors not enrolled are not disadvantaged by the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In summing up, it is patently obvious that agreement to this package will mean that the overwhelming majority of all those directly affected will be winners-patients, general practitioners and government. Patients can be sure of receiving top quality medical care at a reasonable cost. General practitioners will have an improved status and will play a more influencial role in health care, and government and, therefore, the community at large can be assured that the taxpayers' funds are properly spent through Medicare on the most cost-effective care for patients. But most important of all, it focuses upon positive and constructive benefits for people. </PARA>

<PARA> From time to time, messages of concern are conveyed to the Council over the lack of interest by many unemployed to find full time employment. We note these concerns, but until now have not thought it our business to take up these complaints with the Department of Social Security or yourself; however the following situation occurred recently which directly affected the Council.</PARA>
<PARA> A local unemployed person had approached the Council seeking casual work and we did engage him for a short while last year giving him employment doing footpath work. He worked quite well on his own and we advised him that we would consider his services again when the need arose. </PARA>
<PARA> Soon after he ceased work with us, he and his wife returned to England for about six months. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently we were again in need of casual labour and employed this person to carry out various manual tasks working both alone and also with the Council Work gang. In all he was employed for 10 days and paid $655.21. </PARA>
<PARA> Once the person began working with our other permanent employees he began complaining that the work was too heavy and demanding, and that financially he was better off on the unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> This was causing concern to our workers and affecting their morale so the matter was reported to our Works Supervisor, who confronted the employee. </PARA>
<PARA> He was informed by the employee that he would be giving up the position because:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) He was $50 per week worse off in direct payment</PARA>
<PARA> (b) When the fact was taken into account that he had to have a cut lunch and also a shower every day there was a further loss of $50 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) The work was too demanding</PARA>
<PARA> (d) He did not like the early start in the morning</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously this person will not be employed again by the Council, although at this time we would still have about 4/5 weeks casual work available immediately with the possibility of more later in the year. </PARA>
<PARA> This type of situation can only be described as ridiculous, when a person has no incentive to find work being paid more to stay at home. Obviously the unemployment benefits are too high when considering all the fringe benefits as well. This person has only his wife as a dependant. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also aware that another local unemployed person was offered fulltime work at over $400 per fortnight, but refused it because of the same reasons as in our experience. </PARA>
<PARA>The Clerk goes on in the letter but time will not permit me to read the rest of it. I simply want to conclude on this note: I do not stand here making a plea for sweatshop conditions. I stand here making a plea not on behalf of a private employer who might be accused of exploiting these people but on behalf of a local governing body obliged to meet minimum standards. We are denying this person the right to a sense of self-achievement, a sense of incentive and a sense of doing what he ought to be doing in order to make provision for his family. We are denying it because we simply do not oblige him to work in order to receive unemployment benefits. The honourable member may sit gloating but while he does so he denies him what is a fundamental human right-the right to make provision and not merely live by some sort of cargo cult mentality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to an urgent constituent inquiry of 16 February 1989 which has confirmed, to my disappointment, the widely-held suspicion that there exists amongst the medical fraternity a small clique of doctors who are waging, to the detriment of the physical and emotional well-being of their patients, an insidious campaign against the Government's 1988 May statement decision to place certain expensive drugs on the authority list of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It is well known, of course, that some doctors have strongly disagreed with the original decision to place some 53 expensive drugs on the authority list, and it is recognised that a legitimate and proper campaign exists to convince the Government to review the matter. This is despite the fact that this decision, and the subsequent re-evaluation which resulted in 34 drugs being withdrawn from the list, were taken on the advice of the Pharmaceuticals Benefits Advisory Committee, which is a committee consisting of medical practitioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, in light of the events that have taken place following the abovementioned constituent inquiry, it is now obvious to me that some doctors have been prepared to elevate this campaign to a sinister and morally indefensible level. In this constituent's case I was approached by a migrant woman with a very restricted knowledge of the English language. She had been sent to my office by a local consulting physician, Dr Lunn of 17 Moore Street, Liverpool, after he had advised her that he was unable to prescribe the urgent heart medication that her mother required because he first required Government authority. Evidently Dr Lunn had told her that it normally took two weeks for authorisation to be received and there was nothing he could do to assist, despite the fact that the constituent's mother had already used the last of her supply of the medication. As the constituent's English was marginal at best, I asked my electorate assistant to contact Dr Lunn at his surgery to get more details on the matter. Dr Lunn's secretary confirmed that the good doctor was unable to prescribe the medication required and she further confirmed that the doctor had asked the constituent to visit her local Federal member to protest by saying that Dr Lunn was not in favour of the recent change and was in no way prepared to dispense the prescription. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously on hearing of Dr Lunn's actions I was most concerned, and I made enquiries to ascertain the substance of the allegations. What I discovered, of course, was that Dr Lunn's advice to his patient was false because the Government has already made allowances to give urgent prescriptions. Simply, this amounted to doctors either phoning the emergency number sent to all doctors for immediate authorisation, or writing `urgent' across the prescription, in which case pharmacists would instantly dispense in lieu of authorisation. After receiving this information I instructed my electorate assistant to contact Dr Lunn and advise him of the avenues of action that were open. At this stage of course I was assuming that Dr Lunn was not aware of the emergency arrangements that were in place. After all, nobody could really believe that a doctor would be so vicious and cold-blooded as to allow a patient to leave his surgery knowing that the patient could be worried and confused over not being able to obtain what he might believe to be a crucial medication. Certainly nobody could conceive of a doctor taking that course of action with a patient with little understanding of the English language. I was wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately it was the case that Dr Lunn was not interested in knowing about, or utilising, the two available methods for prescribing authority list medications immediately. Dr Lunn's receptionist offered, after conferring with her employer, the spurious excuse that he could not mark the prescription as urgent as it would not be a legal prescription without a stamp on it. They were not prepared to even discuss the issue of the emergency phone numbers. My request to speak with the good doctor personally was rejected outright and the conversation was concluded there. Fortunately for my constituent and her mother my office was quickly able to contact another doctor and he carried out the appropriate procedure to obtain the necessary medication immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the question does remain as to how many other innocent people have been put through the same emotional turmoil by doctors who have turned their backs on their Hippocratic oath, and the ethics of the medical profession, in order to strengthen their hand in what amounts to a glorified industrial dispute. How many other patients have left their doctor's surgery frightened and confused at their inability to obtain important medications? Unfortunately, my investigations have revealed that Dr Lunn's reprehensible actions are not unique in the medical fraternity. Certainly the overwhelming majority of doctors would never contemplate using such cruel and callous tactics to further their industrial aims, but most of those to whom I have spoken confidentially are aware of others who have taken part in such a campaign. I am sure all members of this House will join with me in saying that it is a sad day for medicine and our community in general when such tactics can even be considered, let alone used. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly about the Government's latest action in relation to the review of migration applications. Last year the Government put forward an amendment to the Migration Act which was to require those who were applying for a review of a migration application to pay a fee with their application. Also, the legislation said that in future the grounds for a review would be limited. However, it did not detail the grounds of the limitation. An objection was raised by the Opposition in debate on that amendment to the Act because we said that there was a change of policy and the amendment, saying that the grounds for a review in future being provided for in regulation, was not acceptable; in other words, the grounds for review had to be detailed in the legislation and not done by regulation. In the event the Bill was amended in the Senate and the requirement for the paying of a fee was removed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has proceeded to require applicants wanting a review to pay a fee when putting in that application. I believe that the Attorney- General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has advised the Department that the requirement for people to pay a fee is illegal, which is something we said at the time. In the meantime many hundreds of applications have been put in, none of which would be entertained without the payment of a fee. The people putting in the applications have paid the fee and it has not been made clear what will happen in their case. My office-as I am sure is the case with the offices of other members-has simply been contacted verbally by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to say that, as of several days ago, the Department would not accept any more requests for reviews of applications until 30 March. So now the situation is even worse than it was before. Before people were required to pay a fee that legally they could not be required to pay, but their only recourse was to go to court to challenge the requirement for the fee. Now they cannot even submit an application for a review until 30 March. The only applications that are being considered are those which were postdated a few days ago. We are told that the rule will be changed, we will have another fee called a second application fee and there will be some requirement for legislation. I hope that this time the Government will get the requirements straight and will put in that legislation the grounds on which a review will be considered, because that is yet to be clarified. </PARA>
<PARA> I question the right of the Government to take the actions that it has. When it has been queried in the past we have been told by departmental officers that because there was a lack of legislation in a certain area they could do these things; in other words, they were doing it without Parliament's scrutiny. They were doing things that were not provided for under legislation. They were being done in a backdoor sort of way and nothing could be done about it. It is now clear that the Attorney-General has told the Department that it was not legal to require the payment of that fee. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Minister should explain fully just what the Government proposes to do. Does it intend to charge a fee as from 30 March on the same basis as the previous, now discontinued, fee? If that previous fee were illegal, surely the new fee will be illegal. Maybe giving it a different name will change that, but it ought to be explained. On what grounds is the whole question of review of applications to migrate to proceed? At present those who want to put in applications to review do not know on what basis they should proceed and, as a member of Parliament, I do not know on what basis I should advise them. I can only tell them that they cannot do it at present; it is all frozen until 30 March; sometime after 30 March they will be able to do it again; they will have to pay a fee of $240; and I am not sure whether they will have to pay that fee as from 30 March or not. In short, the whole thing is a great jumble. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister at the time-the former member for Port Adelaide, Mick Young-had got the procedure right when he had been the Minister, none of this need have happened. At the time the Opposition offered him its full cooperation, but said the cooperation would not extend to something as fundamental as policy on immigration review being contained in regulations; it had to be contained in legislation which was open to debate by the Parliament. I trust that the new Minister will show a greater regard for the Parliament and for those seeking a review of migration applications in his future acts in this matter. As a member of parliament, I anxiously look forward to what he will do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to reply to the speech that was given in this chamber last night in the adjournment debate by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). I tried to reply last night but, unfortunately, I did not get the call. The speech was devoted to what he perceived as the current situation in Ethiopia. I must say that I thought the speech was a disgrace not only in that it was inaccurate but also because it was grossly offensive to a delegation from Ethiopia, which delegation was entertained last night in this Parliament by the Presiding Officers. Members of the delegation visited the Parliament at Question Time yesterday and have been here for the last few days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) talked tonight about traditions. Members of the Opposition are very fond of talking in this place about traditions and standards when it suits them. There are certain matters of courtesy and tradition and I must say that last night the honourable member for Curtin breached all of these. Having been the leader of a parliamentary delegation to Ethiopia last year, I issued the invitation, on behalf of the Presiding Officers, for a delegation from the Shengo to visit Australia. Wherever my delegation went in Ethiopia, we were met with kindness and help. We were not abused in the way that the honourable member for Curtin abused our guests last night. It was also my pleasure last Sunday to welcome the Ethiopian delegation to Australia. I wonder whether, in the week or so that the delegation has been here, the honourable member for Curtin has taken the opportunity to meet with any member of the Ethiopian delegation, or whether his mind is so closed that he could not do this. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not hear members of the Opposition saying very much about Nicaragua or places like that. They support the brutal activities going on there. They support brutal regimes. But, immediately anyone is regarded in their view as being from a leftist government, venom just spews out of their mouths. One of the things the honourable member for Curtin talked about last night was 2,000 Cuban troops in Ethiopia. I do not know whether there are 2,000 Cuban troops in Ethiopia. I did not see any Cuban troops, and the information I have is that there are none there. </PARA>
<PARA> But, having said that, Ethiopia does have problems; no-one would deny that. Ethiopia has dreadful problems. Since the time of the revolution, it has been faced with not one but two civil wars. It has a huge refugee problem. Hundreds of thousands of its refugees are not Ethiopian refugees but have come from the Sudan. Ethiopia, one of the poorest countries in the world, is looking after and caring for these refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> I am somewhat constrained in what I can say here because the official delegation report has not yet been presented to the Parliament, although I must say that that has not stopped some members of the delegation from releasing their own reports, which have received wide publicity. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night the honourable member for Curtin said that the drought in Ethiopia was caused by the resettlement program. That is absolute rubbish. We went through Eritrea and Tigre. We saw the ground there and the results of poor agricultural policies over many years. In many respects, the only way that that land can regain productive capacity is to have a villagisation program. We discussed with the people there some of the aspects of villagisation. I must say that I was not terribly impressed with some of it; nevertheless, we understand it. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the plea I make to those on the other side: it is all very well to criticise these countries but we should try to understand some of the problems they are facing. For example, at the time of the revolution, they had an illiteracy rate of about 90 per cent. The brutal regime of Haile Selassie kept the people down. They are trying to come to terms with some of the problems they are facing. If we reopened our mission in Ethiopia-which, in my view, we should never have closed-perhaps with that direct link with Ethiopia people such as the honourable member for Curtin might be better informed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in the Senate Senator Newman made a very clear personal explanation related to a misrepresentation by the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) regarding his claim that she intended to sack half the lieutenant-colonels in the Royal Australian Army. That furphy was repeated today by his colleague, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly). It can only be assumed that today's gross misrepresentation is not an accident and that it almost constitutes a deliberate attempt by the Government to mislead the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a very unsatisfactory situation. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel further misrepresented Senator Newman today in answering a dorothy dix question about her new telephone number system, which she launched with the help of two admirals, one air vice-marshal, one general, two brigadiers, a deputy secretary, a first assistant secretary, together with 50 assorted others. Senator Newman did not proceed to debate the cost of the media launch or the Minister's expenditure priorities in relation to the needs of Service families. The Minister complained that Senator Newman had already put out a statement before her media conference while not knowing anything about her new telephone number at all. This is the misrepresentation which has to be answered. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman has been very well informed about the Minister's secret weapon for several months-that the computer equipment for it cost $108,000, that the Minister has retained an advertising agency, that she has employed three staff, that she has acquired new office furniture for it and that she plans to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on advertising in the months to come. Senator Newman has known for some time that the Service spouses regard this as a very low priority in terms of the needs of Defence Force families. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman also knew that the family liaison officers are not allowed to be counsellors, that there are 38,000 married Service personnel and that 34,000 of those personnel have children. All of these are basic facts which the Minister revealed her ignorance of at her own press conference. </PARA>
<PARA> Another misrepresentation was made today. The Minister accused Senator Newman of attacking quite viciously a former member of her staff, somebody who could not return the attack. I want to place on record precisely what the `vicious attack' was. I quote from Senator Newman's press release:</PARA>
<PARA>When you phone Mrs Kelly's new 008 hot line, not only will you hear Mrs Kelly's former member of staff tell you what the Family Liaison Officers and Service Commanders have already told you, but at a cost of only $108,000 you will also receive a new computer system. </PARA>
<PARA>This hardly constitutes a vicious attack. </PARA>

I would like to give him some documents in relation to Mr Bernie Newson of Cooma, a Vietnam veteran who is totally and permanently disabled due to war caused injuries while on war service in Vietnam. On a later occasion I propose to say a little more about this matter. I appreciate, as I said, the fact that the Minister is in the House. In letters to the Minister, Mr Newson has concentrated on the report of the Royal Commission into the Use and Effects of Chemical Agents on Australian Personnel in Vietnam. I believe that I have new material that will assist the Minister in his investigations. Mr Newson has concentrated on discrepancies that he has found in the report and he has asked me to help him and thousands of other veterans in getting that message across. Mr Newson says that the Minister has not considered American D declassified documents that completely contradict the findings of the Royal Commission. I propose to get those documents to the Minister. I know that he will consider them in full detail when I do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
