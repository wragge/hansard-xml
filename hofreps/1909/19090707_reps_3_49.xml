            <para>.- I shall do my best to comply with the request made by the Prime Minister yesterday, bycurtailing my remarks as much as possible, and confining them strictly to the terms of the motion. Honorable members must therefore excuse me if I do not dip. deeply into the records of the past, reading numerous and lengthy quotations from newspapers and other sources, such as we have been treated to during the currency of the debate until now. In proposing* the motion, the Leader of the Opposition stated that the Government and those be. hind it do not represent the views of the majority of the people, and that, therefore, he wishes to bring the House before the country as soon as possible. I- hold, on the contrary, that we, on this side, represent a majority both of those inside and outside the House. The honorable member also complained that the Labour party was put out of office before he had an opportunity to explain its policy to the House. It seems to me that there was no need for explanation. The policy of the party had been known to every one for a considerable length of time, its programme being merely the setting forth of propose tions which the Labour leagues had already adopted and incorporated in the platform of the party. Furthermore, I understand that the members of the Labour party expressed a desire to be in Opposition. Why, then, are they complaining so bitterly now? The fusion at which they carp is easily justified. In my opinion, it will result in an era of settled and good government. It has, for the first time in the history of this Parliament, divided the -House into two parties, and ma.de what is known as responsible government possible. When the last elections were being held, it was thought that,  the Tariff once settled, there would be nothing to prevent all those who - were not elected as . Labour members from coming into the one camp. That has now happened. The present juncture is a most critical one. We have to deal with questions which are important, not only in their immediate bearing, but especially as they concern the future. If the financial question, for instance, is not settled in a manner equitable to the Commonwealth and the States alike, friction must be created, which may make it impossible to have anything like true Federation in Australia for many years to come. From a. Government composed of moderate and progressive men, I see the best chance of obtaining a fair financial arrangement. There will be no crippling of the States, and the State authorities will not take fright at what will be proposed, as they have had reason to be frightened by some of the propositions which have emanated from honorable gentlemen now sitting on the Opposition benches. </para>

              <para>- I am alluding to the proposition of the Leader of the Opposition, that the States should receive a fixed sum of&#163;5,000,000 per annum. The people expected, when voting for Federation, that the Commonweal th. Parliament would deal with finance, defence, immigration, and other questions of national importance in . a national spirit, and I welcome the fusion, because I think that it will make that possible. A Government composed as the present Government is will prove an effective check on the extreme and Socialistic planks in the Labour, party&#39;s programme ; and, at the same time, open the way to progressive legislation.- When a motion such as this is launched by a leader of a party, we have, before we can support or oppose it, to see what that party is aiming at; and, to my mind, the aim of the Labour party is Socialism. Some members of that partv have distinctly declared themselves to be Socialists ; though many of them have said they are not of that school ; but the party as a party is merely what the Political Labour Leagues like to make it. When those Leagues meet, and there is a majority in favour of a particular plank, that plank becomes part of the programme ; and members who are not prepared to sign the new platform must retire, there being many others ready to take their places. If members of the party are not absolute Socialists, they vote for measures which pave the way for the introduction of that baneful system. It is easy to prove that Socialism is behind the Labour movement in Australia, as I have already shown ; indeed, the very notice-paper of the House, during last session, contained many Socialistic propositions by members of the party. </para>

              <para>- One plank of the Labour party,I believe, was at&#39; one time the nationalization of all means of production, distribution, and exchange : but that has been watered down now to the nation alization of monopolies.&#39; But can any sane person believe that, if the Labour party were successful in nationalizing all monopolies, the system of nationalization would stop there. The system must go on until everything is nationalized ; and to support this contention I shall read what the honorable member for Barrier said, speaking about the time of the last elections. </para>

          <para class="block">That gentleman is now, I believe, a paid organizer by the Labour associations; and the quotations I have read show that if there are members of the Labour&#39; party in this House who disown Socialism, there are members of the party outside, at any rate, who intend to make it their aim. When one thinks of such questions as new Protection, immigration, and other measures of the sort, which are accepted by&#39; honorable  members on both sides, one. is struck by the contrast between the way in which the&#39; present Government intend to deal with them, and the way in which they are. regarded by the Opposition. As to new Protection, there is . an effort by the Government to bring the policy into operation by providing that each State shall have its Wages Board, or Arbitration Court, which shall be the judge as to all local industrial conditions ; whereas the Labour party desire an alteration of the Constitution, whereby there shall be placed in the hands of the Federal Arbitration Court the power to interfere and deal with practically all the industrial life of the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- It practically amounts to that. I hold with the present Government that the best judges of proper conditions of labour are the local tribunals. These have a better chance of dealing fairly as between employer and employed, and securing good wages, which, after all, is the object of the new Protection. I cannot see why there should be the alteration of the Constitution desired; and, in my opinion, there must be some ulterior object in the demand of the Labour party for new Protection. The method which the Opposition would employ is a fillibustering method, as compared with tha.t which the present Government would adopt to meet the difficulty. Another contrast is shown in the way in which the Opposition regard the question of immigration. They will have no immigrants until there is land for all the people coming in ; and that, I regard as a delightful bit of veiled opposition to a. policy which is urgently required in Australia. If anything is required to-day, it is people of the right sort, not only to fill up the empty spaces, but to enter into all forms of industrial life. So long as the right people come in, there will always be plenty of room for them j they will be no burden on the community, and there will be no displacement of the workmen already here. Such immigrants would soon acquire wealth in a country that offers so much to people who come to it with good character and a desire to get on. In this connexion the Labour party are always talking about a land tax, on which to base an immigration policy. They are also going to obtain revenue from the same source. When asked how they would finance any large scheme put forward by them, they invariably answer, &#34; By means of a land tax.&#34; In this way they propose to obtain the most diametrically opposite results. When the tax was first advocated, we were told that it would lead to the subdivision of large estates, and that it was not likely to produce much revenue. But honorable members of the Labour party now contend that it would be a heavy revenue-producing item. All the land alienated,- or in process of alienation, in Australia to-day does not amount to more than <inline font-style="italic">61</inline> per cent, of the total territory, and while this reforming party intend to direct a land tax at that proportion, no one knows what they are going to do in regard to the lands remaining unalienated. It seems to me that a progres sive land tax would not lead to the subdivision of large estates. I have listened most attentively to every honorable member who has touched upon this question, and have heard from the Opposition no cogent reason for believing that the tax would have that effect. Some honorable members have said that they would impose a heavy tax on unimproved land. If they &#39; found that the tax did not lead to the subdivision of large estates and therefore went on increasing it until it amounted to something like is. in the <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;i,</inline> they would certainly bring about the disruption of the estates. In that way, such estates would undoubtedly be confiscated, because their total annual value would be eaten up. Honorable members opposite might just as well talk of taking the land from the owners as to propose to filch it from them in that way. </para>

              <para>- The land tax in operation in New Zealand has not led to the subdivision of large estates, for there are more large holdings there to-day than there are in Victoria. New Zealand certainly has a larger .territory than Victoria, but honorable members of the Opposition are never tired of pointing to its position as a shining example of the wisdom of imposing a land&#39; tax. The objections to such a tax are legion, but I do not intend to say more at present than - that I have heard nothing in, this House to show that it would lead to the subdivision of large estates. Since its advocates have failed to prove that it would, I do not think that I am called upon to make any further reference to it. Another subject in regard to which the Government and the Opposition are in direct conflict is that of defence. The question may be divided into three parts - land, coastal, and deep-sea defence - and the point of difference between the Government and the Opposition relates, not to land or coastal defence, but to our first line of defence, that of our ocean-borne commerce. From a statement made some two or three months ago by members of the present Opposition, I gathered that their desire is to create a deep-sea navy for Australia. In other words, they would say to Great Britain. &#34;Do not trouble about the Southern Seas. We  shall guard them with battleships of our own, and so preserve commerce routes for the Empire.&#34; Such a proposal has much to recommend it, but there is a still better scheme for effectively checking any hostile raid - a scheme which I think must appeal even more strongly to the patriotism of the people, not only of Australia, but of the rest of the Empire. It would also give us better value for our money. After we have made adequate provision for land and coastal defence, Ave should contribute our share to the maintenance of an Imperial Navy. That Navy would be controlled by one central authority ; all vessels composing it would be built according to certain approved types, and a uniform system would be followed in training the men who manned them. This would not interfere with the full development of shipbuilding or of maritime pursuits in Australia. Indeed, it would open up a far better field for ambitious Australians, since they would not be confined to ships that would be practically chained to these seas. </para>

              <para>- Both are good, but I think that an Imperial Navy as our first line of defence, would &#39;be the test for Australia. If Great Britain is to retain supremacy of the sea she must maintain the two-power standard. Until recently she has been able to keep up that standard, but shipbuilding in some European countries is now proceeding so rapidly that it is clear that within a few years more strenuous efforts must be made. The people of Great Britain are now contributing 18s. per head to the cost of defence, but an even more strenuous effort is necessary if the twopower standard is to be maintained. It would seem that such a standard is absolutely necessary, and if Great Britain is unable to maintain it, surely the rest of the Empire should be prepared to assist her to do so. In that <inline font-style="italic">&#34;ai</inline> we should secure a navy large enough to protect all the interests of the British Empire - a  navy  which would possess advantages over and above those of a purely Australian Navy. Surely it should be the desire of Australia to remain a partner in the greatest national partnership the world has ever known. </para>

              <para>- No. The adoption of the system I have suggested would be far better than spasmodic offers of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline> .It would mean continuous Imperial action, and would lead to the creation of a navy of the extent and calibre requisite for the absolute protection of the whole Empire. How could an Australian Navy protect the trade routes of the Empire ? Australia&#39;s trade alone amounts to something like ^170,000,000 per annum, and surely that is worth protecting. But what chance should we have of protecting it with an Australian Navy as compared with a grand Imperial Navy which would be stationed along all our trade routes. While our trade remained within a hundred miles of Australia it might be safe, but could we hope to protect it a thousand miles from the Australian, coast, say, for instance, on the South African route?&#34; fit seems to me that we must agree that, so far as our first line of defence is concerned, the Imperial, system that I have mentioned promises the best results, and I am glad that the Government intend to give effect to it. </para>

              <para>- I an: not in possession of all the details of the Government policy, but I am here because I know from their manifesto that they intend to give due effect to the Imperial side of the Defence problem. We heard a great deal from the Leader of the Opposition, when  proposing the  motion, about the offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline> It seems to me that the Government have done a very wise thing, and I am struck by the difference between their action and the action of the late Government in laying hands on ^250.000 that had been put into a Trust Fund bv Parliament orr the word of a Minister that it would be  kept  intact until Parliament directed how the money was to be employed. The present Government have pledged the country to an expenditure, let us say, of something like  ns.,000,000  without any authority, but they have done it in a constitutional way. The\ are ready to take the consequences of their action, and are risking their existence as.  a Government upon it. There is no comparison whatever, as some honorable members opposite seem to think, between that and the act perpetrated by the late Government. If, after a Minister has given an assurance that money put into a Trust Fund will not be touched until Parliament has decided how to spend it, his successor does not consider himself bound by that promise, all confidence in Ministerial utterances in this House will be destroyed, confusion will be created, and business will no longer be conducted according to the best methods of British parliamentary history. That sort of thing is utterly different from pledging the country to an expenditure of ^2,000,000 in the gift of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> because the Government have to carry that through the House or go out of office. I am in favour of the gift of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> chief! v because it gives a fillip to the feeling of Imperialism which H am glad to see growing throughout the Empire. </para>

              <para>- I am certainly against their action in seizing that money, because they had only two months to wait before Parliament met. I could have understood their taking action if it had been a matter of great urgency or if some despatch requiring secrecy in the interests of the State had come from the Colonial Office, but to. allege as an excuse that they are not bound by the promise of their predecessors is simply to flout the House, and certainly lowers my opinion of the administrative power and ability with which I was once ready to credit the other side. </para>

              <para>- That puts the position in a nutshell. If the sort of administration to which I have referred is approved of by honorable members, then apparently any sort of administration will do for them, but I hope it will not suit this side. I am glad the Prime Minister took action as quickly as he did in offering a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline> We have marked evidence that the spirit of Imperialism is growing, in the fact that it is now proposed to have an Imperial land force, in the proposal to hold a Defence Conference in London, and in the recent Press Conference. It is also evidenced by the fact that for many years past, whenever Great Britain has been in trouble, any assistance required has always been spontaneously offered by this and other parts of the Empire. Those instances show that when the people .are thus appealed to, not only their heart but their reason responds. &#34;When the public really grasp the idea which underlies Imperialism, we shall have a cement that will bind the Empire tighter and more naturally than anything .at present in existence, and which will long preserve it. The best authorities place the beginning of the British Empire about 1606, when English &#34;people founded the colony of Virginia. It grew rapidly during the seventeenth century, and even more rapidly during the eighteenth. It has been a great agent of civilization wherever it has extended ; it has spread justice, and it has conferred freedom. We should be proud to maintain it in all its greatness, and one of the best ways to achieve that object will be to instil the spirit of Imperialism into the people. I hope that our delegates at the Imperial Defence Conference will be able to infuse into all the delegates from the other parts of the Empire the same spirit as animates them. If so, we shall have Canada and South Africa, which has lately become united, also desirous of playing their part in Imperial affairs. In time we shall probably have an executive body controlling those affairs. When we get that, and every member of the Empire is doing its part, the Imperial system will be safe. The British Empire will then be able to offer a united front to its enemies, and will continue from century to century maintaining and improving its position. I hope that the reasons which I have given will appear to others, as they appear to me, to justify my action in voting against the motion of want of confidence. </para>

            <para>. - I suppose that even the representatives of the people must occasionally consider the interests of those who sent them here. Indeed, my experience is that the majority has always been ready to pay attention to those who are its masters. At the present time, however, we are being told by Ministerialists, and by the newspaper organs which support the Government, that the terrible party of which I have the honour to be a member is retarding legislation which should be passed in the interests or the people. I confess that, if there were the remotest chance of such legislation being passed, not a moment of the time of the Parliament would be occupied by me. But it is well known to all that this debate was inevitable, and not a waste of time. In the interests of good government, it is necessary to have an expression of the opinions of those who are supposed to represent the people, though in most cases they do not. What hypocrisy it is to characterize the present debate as a waste of time ! </para>

              <para>- Certainly. I know that if a general election were held, 1 should be returned by a thumping majority. The Government, and the press which supports it, are trying to make the people believe that we, on this side, are wasting time by preventing the introduction of necessary and beneficial legislation. As a matter of fact, however, Ministers should be thankful to us for what we are doing. They know, and we know, that they will not be ready, for six weeks to come, to present legislative proposals likely to benefit the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- Certainly not. As the Government and its servile majority are aware, the Labour party will do nothing to help them, and, of course, does not expect their assistance. This Parliament is a dying one, and, at the best, cannot do more than square its finances, and make better industrial arrangements for the future than we have had in the past. The Treasurer has admitted that he cannot present his Budget until towards the end of August, which is seven or eight weeks hence. This, we have been told, is to be a session of finance. Of course, every session is to be more important than its predecessor; that is the usual clap-trap for the occasion, and the Government is repeating it now. Ministers tell us that they are determined to deal successfully with the financial question, and that to it will the energies of Parliament be chiefly devoted. There is also the great . industrial question  to be solved. With that I am more concerned, I do not pretend to be a financier. Having been reared in a workshop, and not in a bank, my <inline font-style="italic">forte</inline> is not finance. But many of those who are supposed to be financiers seem to me to be not much better versed in finance than I am. At any rate, whatever financial knowledge they have is concealed from their fellow members. I know, however, that the workers and the commercial and business men in the community desire a settled industrial policy. Both those who have money invested in either small or large businesses, and their, employes, wish to know how they are to stand in the future. Seeing that the two great questions of the session are involved in financial and industrial legislation, and that we cannot expect any financial proposal for another six or seven weeks, while there is no hope at all of obtaining useful industrial proposals from a Ministry constituted as this is, there would be no waste of time . if the debate occupied much longer than it is likely to. The Government programme speaks of the appointment of an InterState Commission. The only merit of that appointment would be that it would provide good billets for a number of persons. As a matter of fact, it will be so expensive that the Treasurer will have to seriously consider how it can be financed. Then the powers to be given to it are to be so large as to practically make this Parliament useless. As a matter of fact, I think the public would benefit, rather than be harmed, if we did shut up for a time. The appointment of an Inter-State Commission would, in no sense, benefit the workers. Ministers must admit that I have no wish to say nasty things,, but I am constrained to ask how my constituents, can expect beneficial- legislation from a Government whose Ministers hold views so contrary that it is next to impossible, especially in industrial matters, to fix upon any point of agreement between them. In my opinion, the Government does not possess the confidence of the House. Nearly half of its supporters sit behind it, not in the hope of passing legislation which will&#34; benefit Australia, but to . save their political skins. They know that they have to fight the Labour party, and to make themselves safe at the coming election they have agreed to a fusion, no matter what its effects may be upon legislation. We are told that we are squealing because our Government were removed from office. The supporters of the Government, and the Government themselves, know well that men who are highest in the Labour party might have enjoyed the sweets of office long ago, had they so wished. As a new man, with no chance or hope of office, I think  I  may say that men in our party who are recognised as strong men of the House might have become Ministers had they thought fit. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member knows that there could have been a coalition of Liberals and the Labour party, and that the latter could have dominated by numbers both in the House and in the Ministry. Honorable members opposite have been saying, both inside and out of this House - and so have the newspapers that support them- that the Labour party are squealing; but, as a matter of fact, it is not a squeal of defeat, but a howl at the treachery that has been perpetrated. While the Prime Minister is not a member of our party, I, for some twenty-two years, have regarded him as a politician and an individual whom I personally could respect. I have been abused, by those who, it now appears, knew better than I did, for the strong support and sympathy  I  extended to the honorable gentleman ; and  I  have to admit now that  I  was wrong - that what they said the honorable gentleman was capable of was true, and that what  I  expected from him as a man and a politician  I  might expect in vain.  I  have wasted some months in reading <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in view of this particular debate, so that I might be able out of the Prime Minister&#39;s own mouth to prove that he was not what my friends said he was ; but  I  find that it is possible to make anything one likes from his utterances.  I  might say that a speech of his meant a certain thing, but he could refer me to something he had said just prior, and, if that failed, to something he said after wards, or might tell me I had overlooked a comma or misconstrued his meaning. I have, therefore, to admit that I cannot bring evidence out of the Prime Minister&#39;s own mouth to prove that my friends&#39; condemnation of him was wrong. I am now speaking of the honorable gentleman entirely as a politician, but in the future I shall endeavour to think of him only as a person with all his known graciousness. Quite lately in this House I mistakenly interjected that I wished I were endowed with his eloquence. In a farce which . I once saw, the low comedian said of the leading lady, &#34;Oh, she says nice things so nicely&#34; ; but the Prime Minister goes one better, and can say, not only nice things, but nasty things, nicely. It is of no use my attempting, by quotations from the Prime Minister&#39;s speeches, to prove that the stand he takes now is one he should not take ; but I should like to refer to one or two remarks of his during the debate on the no-confidence motion moved by the right honorable member for East Sydney, in regard to the financial policy of the Deakin Ministry. The speech the Prime Minister then made was only another splendid piece of eloquence, piled on others which we have heard, but the outcome of which has always been nil.

How have the mighty fallen ! Victorians at one time looked on the honorable member for Bendigo as one of the Democrats of the State; but only on one occasion do I remember his extending any support to the Liberal Prime Minister, and that was when the right honorable member for East Sydney submitted his motion of no-confidence. At that time the honorable member for Bendigo evidently was of opinion that the financial policy of the Government was all right, because he voted against the motion. </para>

              <para>- Exactly. It is not hard to see why he could see no reason for voting against the present Prime Minister. At that time the honorable member for Bendigo was sitting in the Opposition corner, the members of which could not agree on a policy ; and the honorable member for Parramatta and the right honorable member for Swan failed, to bring about a fusion of parties, thus leaving the right honorable member for East Sydney on his &#34;lonesome.&#34; The honorable member for Bendigo possibly saw that if that motion of noconfidence were successful he would not be in the Ministry, and, therefore, he supported the present Prime Minister. What is the great dividing line of principle&#39; between the honorable member for Ballarat and the honorable member for Bendigo? If such a line existed then, surely it must exist now. As a Victorian I know that the political opinions of the people of Bendigo and Ballarat are identical, and I well remember the attitude qf the different parties at the last general election. The honorable member for Bendigo was then opposed to the honorable member for Ballarat. </para>

              <para>- Unfortunately for all of us the people of Australia have an excellent political memory, and even if they had not they would find in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a full report of any statement made in this House. Some honorable members also have an unfortunate habit of preserving newspaper reports of political speeches, and although the Labour party have not the support of a daily newspaper, the honorable member for Ballarat and the honorable member for Bendigo must admit that there are in this State newspapers entirely in sympathy with them, both politically and personally. That being so, we mav assume that reports of their utterances which appear in those newspapers are fairly accurate, and when&#39; such reports are not contradicted we must accept them. In days gone by the present Prime Minister and the Postmaster-General were considered to share the same political opinions, and since they are now in the one Ministry, it must be assumed that they are still in agreement. When we find, however, that for a period of two years the honorable member for Bendigo fought strenuously against almost every proposal submitted by the Deakin Government, what are we to think ? </para>

              <para>- As a Protectionist, T. have no pleasure in recalling the many occasions on which the honorable member was not present in this House to vote on Tariff questions. As  Chairman of  the Tariff Commission, he was regarded as one of the staunchest Protectionists in Victoria, but in some cases he neither voted nor paired in favour  of  the Government. During the consideration of the Tariff, the honorable member for Hume, as a member  of  the Deakin Government, sat here day after day. and night after night, doing the work of three Ministers and fighting for the policy of &#39;Protection, while the present Postmaster-General, on many occasions, was not present to give him the assistance that he might well have expected from him. I say without fear  of  contradiction that there is in reality a great dividing une between the Prime Minister and the PostmasterGeneral. &#39; It existed during the life  Df  the Deakin Government - when the honorable member for Bendigo sat in the Opposition corner - and it exists to-day. Whilst on the surface it would seem that their differences have been smoothed away, there is in fact, as the Prime Minister himself has said, a clear cut issue between them. It existed eight months ago, and it still exists. On the occasion to which T have already referred, the present Prime Minister said - </para>

But, all the world over, the modern tendency appears to be to depart further and further from the old system, under which there were only two parties, although many minor divisions. The old system appears to have gone; it has gone in Great Britain and France, is gone, or going, in Germany, and is threatened even in the United States, in spite of the vast machinery which makes it so difficult for independent parties to spring up. lt seems to me, therefore,, inevitable that we shall have to deal with more than two groups or parties, whichever we mav term them. </para>

              <para>- It is shared by others sitting behind the Government. We point to that fact in support of our contention that no waste of time is involved in .the submission of such a motion as that now under consideration. We are offering  certain honorable members opposite an opportunity to candidly say &#39; to their constituents that they have no confidence in the Ministry. There are some nine honorable members sitting behind the Government who, while* having no sympathy with the Labour party, have still less for the Ministry. They know that we are honest and candid in regard to the opinions that we hold, and that the Government behind whom they are sitting are simply humbugging them. .Whilst they may profess to have no sympathy with us, I am satisfied that when communing, one with another, they admit that we know what we want and mean what we say, whereas the Government do not honestly intend to propose any legislation that will be really beneficial to the people of Australia. So, while the outcome of the present motion may not prove our assertion, there is every evidence that the Government have not the confidence of the majority of .the members of the House. It may be said with truth that at no time during the existence of the Federal Parliament has any Government had the entire confidence of a majority of the House, but previous Governments have had it on cardinal principles, or they would not have remained on the Treasury&#39; bench. Even on primary principles, however, it is not true of the present Government. Getting down to the primary ideas of honorable members on that side, they have really nothing in common, and, according to the views which they put before their constituents at the last election, there are about four parties among . them now. The right honorable member for East Sydney, who had a large party behind him at that time, and his lieutenant, the honorable member for Parramatta, and another estimable gentleman and a strong advocate of that party&#39;s views in the person of the honorable member for North Sydney, all claimed at the last election that they were fighting, not only the Labour party, but every man who was in any way associated with the Labour party in politics. Bitterly as they fought us at that time, they knew well that they were fighting the whole of the following of the honorable member for Ballarat. Yet now there sits behind the Government a composition including the party from Western Australia - the right honorable member for Swan and his following, which consists of the honorable member for Fremantle - and parties from Tasmania and South* Australia.

          <para class="block">Swan and the honorable member for Fremantle fought our party bitterly at the last election. In fact, the right honorable member for Swan might have had a walk-over but for his energetic interference in the political situation in his State. He was looking for a fight and got it. I do not know, from what I have heard since, that he appreciated that fight too well, for when he got a thundering blow he objected. The right honorable member must have thought there was a likelihood of his being knocked out in the fight, because he appealed to the electors of Swan to remember how he had served their fathers and their grandfathers.  His  appeal was quite pathetic. I remember reading in a Western Australian newspaper - not a Labour paper, but one which supported the right honorable member, and had nothing but friendly remarks to make on any act of his, no matter how foolish - how the right honorable member appealed to his electors to be allowed to continue to serve them in the Parliament of Australia, in memory of the services which he had rendered to their fathers and grandfathers in the past. I hope that at the next election he will have to appeal to the great grandchildren of those who returned him before, and will not meet with so much success as on the last occasion. But the politics which he and the honorable member for Fremantle advocated then, and the pledges which they gave, had nothing in common with the politics and pledges placed before the people of New South Wales by those honorable members who were then sitting with the right honorable member for East Sydney iri Opposition. </para>

          <para>Mr.MATHEWS.- I am an infant in politics compared with the honorable members who were then sitting here, but I could never have made a mistake of that sort. No one believes th.it those gentlemen made n mistake at that time. The bitter-sweets of office farmed the only consideration which retarded them, and glued them to their seats when the opportunity arrived to prove the truth of their claim that the only clear-cut issue between them and the Deakin party was association with the Labour party. I do not know whether it was the attendants, or the thoughts of the sweets of office that did it, but there was a let of glue along these benches oh the day when that vote was taken. Some of them rose, but in their cases the glue seemed to possess some of the properties of gutta-percha, and drew them back again. The only member who admitted on that occasion that  they  made a mistake was the honorable member for Kooyong, who said afterwards that he should have crossed the floor. Therefore, the honorable member for Ballarat was correct at that time when he said that only some large principle could1 keep them apart. There was a great principle that kent them apart then, but where is it now so far as regards the Deakin party, or the Reid party, or the party ot thirteen leaders who then sat in the Opposition </para>

              <para>- There are just as old political birds in this party as the right honorable member. It is a pity that he and the honorable member for Ballarat did not possess the tact and common sense of the Labour party on certain occasions, because both of them have given so many reasons for their actions that all their time is occupied in explaining those reasons away. They think they have deluded us and the people outside, but a great deal more explanation is required from them before they can bring that about. The honorable member for Robertson is still smiling, but they will have to give him a lot more explanation as to why the present fusion took place before he is satisfied.

              <para>- We are &#39;making a fuss about it because we are determined that the electors shall know how the fusion came about. The honorable member for Riverina told us yesterday, and the honorable member for Gippsland agreed with what he said, that they knew nothing about the proposed fusion beforehand; that they left a meeting of the party at which it was unanimously resolved that there should be no fusion. When the fusion was brought about, all but four of &#39;the Liberal party abandoned their principles to obey the dictates of a caucus of three. The Labour party has been called the caucus party, and its members have been told that they must obey the decisions of the caucus. But in the caucus I, like every other member of the party, have my say. On the other side, three members arranged everything. It is honorable members opposite whose brains are cramped, and whose tongues are tied. When the right honorable member for Swan and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> came back with the marriage lines drawn up, if not signed, there were five honorable members, in addition to the four who have not joined the fusion, who were opposed to it ; but, inasmuch as there would have been a majority of only one against the Fisher Government, and a consequent dissolution, had they come over to this side, they were bludgeoned into joining. They, then sold the interests of their constituents in order to retain their seats a little longer. They were bludgeoned into compliance with the wishes of the leaders of the fusion by the threat that if they did not join, candidates would be run against them. </para>

              <para>- I know who were to be two of the candidates. One is a gentleman who, at the time of the last election, was  chairman  for one of the members of this House. The five honorable members to whom I have referred did not go over straightaway. They were bludgeoned severely, and lay on the floor thinking for a time. Finally they crept under the mantle of the honorable member for Ballarat, hoping thereby to find shelter from the storm at the next election. That is a secret of which many honorable members were not aware. I doubt if even all the Ministers know the strenuous efforts and barbaric methods which were used to bring certain honorable members over to the right way of thinking We are not all born heroes. I used to imagine myself one, until an occasion arose which showed me that I was a man of only ordinary strength of mind and muscle. The occasion to which I refer proved that the honorable members of whom I am speaking are not heroes. They showed themselves only too willing to accept the support of the voluble tongue of the honorable member for Ballarat and the leaders of the newspaper organs which support him. I say that these five honorable gentlemen have no confidence in the present Ministry, and that if they voted according to their consciences, they would vote for the motion. But to save their political skins they must vote against it. The excuse they make is that the Labour party has threatened to oppose them at the next election. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> were so opposed, but you did not squeal about it. Whv should they squeal? They were able to fight and to win their seats, notwithstanding Labour opposition. </para>

          <para class="block">Every honorable member remembers the occasion when the Prime Minister, with his foot on his chair, and in the pose of a hero, uttered words which every man could stake his life on. accepting. If the words about being trapped meant anything, they meant that, while the Prime Minister and his party were fighting the &#39;Cook party for their existence, his sympathies were with the Labour party, and he was preparing a way for the latter instead of the then direct Opposition to supplant him. The meaning was that, if ever occasion arose&#39; again, he would not be trapped into voting a Labour Government out of office and putting some other party into power - that the honorable gentleman recognised that his political existence was possible only with the support of the Labour party, and that he appreciated that support to such a degree that in the future he would not vote against a Labour Government until they had had a further trial. The Fisher Government were certainly in office longer than the Watson Government, but it must be remembered that during the term of the former Parliament was in session, whereas the term of the latter was mainly in recess - and, by the way, a shorter recess than the present Prime Minister or any other leader would have taken under the circumstances. Despite the words of the Prime Minister, we found that on the first or second day of this session, without giving the Government an opportunity of showing what they could do, he agreed to apply the bludgeon in the form of a motion that &#34; the debate be now adjourned.&#34; Can we expeet . that any promise the honorable gentleman may give in the future will be kept? Are we justified in saying that the Government has the confidence of the House?

          <para class="block">I have desired to annihilate a man with a look or a word, I have wished for the honorable gentleman&#39;s power of expression. We have heard the Minister of Defence charge his present equal-in-all-things leader with the most heinous crimes that could possibly be imagined ; and we have heard him make use of choice language across the table to the honorable member for Hume when that gentleman was holding the fort for the Prime Minister during the latter&#39;s absence through ill-health. We all admired the energy and the action of the honorable member for Hume; and if the press, and others, take exception to some of the scenes that have taken place here during this session, we have to remember how strongly the honorable member must feel the peculiar position in which he has been placed by the action of the Prime Minister. I do not know that I should like to be a subordinate at the orders of the honorable member for Hume, who is a strong man inclined to give forcible expression to his opinions; but even the honorable member for&#39;C&#39;orio, who has admitted saying that he would not follow the honorable member for Hume, must admire that gentleman for the Herculean work he did during the passing of the Tariff, and while the present Prime Minister was absent. And, further, I may, in passing, say that the only weak spot I ever found in the armour of the honorable member for Parramatta was when he made the gracious concession to the Prime Minister at that time. The Prime Minister is the one man in a thousand who&#39; could get such support and consideration ; but I venture to say that he will never get such loyal support from his present followers as he did from the honorable member for Hume. That gentleman, if he speaks strongly, feels strongly ; and sympathy can be extended to him in the treatment he has received. </para>

              <para>- No. Since the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> has helped him to secure the sweets of office I think that he will be more generous in his criticism of it. I cannot find in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> one statement by the Prime Minister that can be used against him. When I have happened upon a sentence or a paragraph in a speech made by him that appeared to place him within my grasp I have found that a littie later on he has explained it away, and left himself free to pursue any course he might desire. In support of my contention that the Government do not possess the confidence of the House, I think it well to read some paragraphs in the brief Ministerial statement submitted to us by the Prime Minister. Short as that programme is it includes proposals that must necessarily involve weary years of consideration. The honorable gentleman declared . that the policy of the Labour party, as- set forth in  His Excellency  the Governor-General&#39;s speech, was sufficient to engage our attention for years, and he gave that as a reason why he did not propose to waste time in discussing it at that stage. Within a few days, however, he submitted on behalf of his Ministry a programme that would take years to give effect to, and I am satisfied that as the outcome of it there would not be placed on the. statute-book one measure that would be beneficial to the country. I except from that statement the proposals of the Government to extend the old-age pensions  system, to deal with the question of silver coinage, and to provide for the construction of docksand ship yards. Apart from the question of the silver coinage we find no proposal to deal at once with the great financial problems awaiting our attention. The Government are not yet prepared to deal with them. Their programme is divided into three sections : industrial, defence, and finance, and we have as the opening statement the following - </para>

              <para>- That, I think, is an underestimate if the Inter-State Commission is to do all that is expected of it. Indeed, I think that some honorable members whose seats are shaky would do well to resign with a view to securing appointments on it. This proposal is really one to delegate the whole of the functions of the Commonwealth Parliament to an InterState Commission. Among the many questions to be dealt with by that Commission, we are told, is that of the new Protection. The Free Traders on this side of the House have always been favourable to, and have promised to support, the new Protection. Even the honorable member for Dalley admitted when the Tariff was under consideration, that he was glad to &#34;come in out of the wet&#34; and to get under the shelter of the new Protectionist &#34;umbrella.&#39;&#39; I may say in passing that we were very thankful for some votes that he cast during the consideration of the Tariff when certain so-called Protectionists ratted on us. For years the Labour party have been preaching the gospel of the new Protection, but we find in the Ministerial programme only the vaguest reference to it. What does it mean? It means that the members of the Deakin party who have joined with the late Opposition, at the request of the Employers&#39; Federation, the Chambers of Manufactures, and of every &#39;organization in Australia representing vested interests, have sold us. After obtaining from us all that they desired in the matter of protectionist votes, they have thrown us overboard. That can be proved by reference to the utterances of some honorable members now sitting on the Government benches. The honorable member for Illawarra and the honorable member for Parramatta have said time after time in this House that the manufacturers were robbers, and were trying to rob the people of Australia. </para>

              <para>- In the sense that we were proposing to impose duties to benefit the manufacturers at the expense of the rest of the community. During the consideration of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Bill, we were told by the Free Traders in the then Opposition that we were proposing to rob the people in the interests of a few manufacturers. I was returned to this House as a Labour man, and every manufacturer in my electorate fought me, and will do so again. On the other hand, those who, when the Tariff was under consideration, sat in the Opposition corner, were supported by the large manufacturers ; but whilst I remained here on many occasions until 4 a.m. and 5 a.m., in order to vote for duties designed to assist the manufacturers, honorable members of the Opposition corner went home to rest. We now find that they are able to laugh at us, and that the Free Traders have assisted to prove the correctness of the assertions they then made. The workers of Australia will derive absolutely no benefit from the coalition of so-called Protectionists with the late Opposition. Am I expected by the Government and their supporters to believe that those who formerly sat in the Opposition corner, but are now sitting behind the Ministry, would vote for anything calculated to benefit the workers? If I am, then they must think that I was born but yesterday. Is the honorable member for Bourke, at the next general election, going to try to cajole the electors to return him by promising that the proposal of the Government in this regard means that effect will be given to the. policy of the. new Protection? On a previous occasion he told us that we desired to go to the country, without even passing a Bill to enable a referendum to be taken on the desirableness of so altering the Constitution as to provide for the carrying out of what we proposed. </para>

              <para>- Who was responsible for that? It was the fault, not of the Labour party, but of the honorable member for Bourke and others of his party, who professed to be in favour of the new Protection. It was due to the action of the five honorable members I have already mentioned, as well as two others, that we were unable to arrange for a referendum on an alteration of the Constitution, to provide for an effective method of new Protection. </para>

The present Prime Minister times out of number has invited the Premiers of the States to confer with the Commonwealth Government on various questions, only to be met with the statement that the sovereign rights of the States must be maintained. The States have refused hitherto to part with any of their powers. </para>

Why should they hand over to the Commonwealth, which is charged with the duty of dealing with Customs and Excise, the power to legislate for the benefit of workers engaged in protected industries?&#34; Is it reasonable- to expect that the State Parliaments will concede to us anything&#34; save that which they are made to concede? The whole necessity for a Federal Act arose from the . fact that the workers in all the States found that the existing State machinery was useless to achieve what they needed. </para>

              <para>- They were opposed, not to Federation, but to the Bill then submitted to the people. The honorable member and his late leader, the right honorable member for East Sydney, opposed it also. There were a lot of fanatics in Victoria who wanted the Bill and nothing but the Bill ; but the Labour party had more commonsense, and, unlike some of the &#34;others, had no personal axe to grind. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> only caved in on the last day, so far as the Bill was concerned. The men who run the political machine in that office knew, as we&#34; did, that the Bill was not what it ought to be, and the honorable member for Parramatta was in accord with us, but for entirely different reasons. One would hardly expect him to agree with me on many points, nor, in fact, would one expect him and the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> to agree on many points, as they have done on the present occasion. We were beaten on the question of the Constitution Bill, but, like the practical politicians that we are - for we are not in the clouds like the crowd opposite - we determined to make the best of things as we found them, and I think the Conservatives on the other side must admit that we have made a very good showing, so far as we have gone, in the Federal arena. It was thought, for instance, that the provision for the representation of the States in the Senate, which was to be the States House, would act detrimentally to the Labour party. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> and the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> all expected the senators who would be returned on clouded issues to be representative of vested interests, but how cruelly were thev deceived ! The Senate contains at present fifteen Labour men. Little did those who formulated the scheme of equal representation of the States in the Senate dream that the Labour party would benefit bv that undemocratic method of election. Yet it has come about. . </para>

Why  this professed desire on the part of the Government to get on with work? They are not prepared to do work. They will make a pretence of introducing some Bill which may  possibly  suit a few in the community, but which will -be of no interest to the people as a whole.

              <para>- Exactly. We want to have an election now, which the honorable member does not. &#39; The  party opposite  cherish the hope that the public wi&#39;l have short, memories, and will forget all about -recent events when election time comes round. The honorable, member for Parramatta is  not the worst in that .direction. He may POSsibly have an easier mind than most of the others, but man: on the other side ish to  delay  the appeal to the people. The  Ministerial  memorandum &#39; states that amongst the duties of the Inter-State Commission - will be those of a Federal Labour Bureau, comprising a study of unemployment and of a scheme for insurance against unemployment. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Echuca did not give it up. That bombastic, fighting gentleman told, us, in his nice, winning way, that the present Government have a better chance of getting concessions from the States than a Labour Ministry would have. The honorable member for Echuca is not so foolish as some honorable members opposite seem to think. They may laugh, but the honorable member knows that what the State Premiers will give will not be really concessions, but will be something that the State Parliaments or the State Premiers care little about. Anything that they care little about will not be of much benefit to those in whose interests industrial laws are supposed to be enacted. As a further proof that the Government  should not have the confidence of the House, the honorable member for Dalley, and two other honorable members, admitted that it is an utter impossibility to get any real concessions in this direction from the States, and vet he and the others still sit behind the Government. Notwithstanding all the threats that have been made towards us regarding what will happen to us for assisting the Government to retard business at this juncture, I am willing to stand on any platform in Victoria and justify our refusal to believe that there is anything to benefit the workers in the industrial legislation which the Government announce their intention of introducing. They favour the  appointment of a High Commissioner, and announce that- - </para>

              <para>- Whilst I do not belittle the work . of municipal councils, I say that State Parliaments have more important functions to carry out, and their continuance is necessary under the Constitution. I would point out, however, that, while the Commonwealth, by taking over what were formerly State Departments, has reduced the claims on the States, the State Governments and Parliaments have increased1 their expenditure, and continually ask for &#34;more revenue. Like the daughters of the horse leech, they are never satisfied. The States are very ready for the Commonwealth to take over Departments whose administration is unremunerative, but they are not ready to allow us to retain the money necessary to do this. The fusion is an attempt to bring together all parties opposed to the Labour party. It contains the advanced politicians hitherto supported by the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and now taken under the wing of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> as well. It has the support of the Women&#39;s National Association and the Farmers&#39; Association. I have at- &#34; tended meetings of the latter. On one occasion, in a Gippsland township, the assembly was composed of two cockatoo squatters and five or six stock agents, not one farmer being present. Therefore, the title is a misnomer, applied to deceive the farmers. </para>

              <para>- If he is opposed by a Labour candidate, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> will support him. The honorable member for Flinders is another so-called Liberal. According to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Leongatha Star,</inline> a newspaper published in his electorate-, he stated at the beginning of May that the fusion of parties, or of a large number of parties,  under any one leader would be a most dangerous condition of things. We have a recollection of some of the illiberal political acts which he has perpetrated. Yesterdny the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> pleaded with the Liberals not to oppose him at the next election. The newspaper was justified in doing this, because the honorable member has always endeavoured to express and give effect to the political views which it publishes, its policy being to &#34;down&#34; every proposal put. forward for the benefit of those who have to earn their living by physical toil. The honorable member for Indi is another socalled Liberal. When the Deakin party was in power, supported by the Labour party, he did not lose an opportunity to harass it. It could not then make any useful suggestions. No Bill brought forward by it got his support. He was especially opposed to Democratic legislation, and was a stubborn opponent of the Tariff. Whenever opportunity arose, he voted against the Liberal party of the day. But now he is a member of the fusion, in the hope of deceiving the Liberals in the Indi constituency. </para>

              <para>- I am sorry the honorable member does not agree with my utterances. He happens to be built differently from myself, though that is the fault of neither of us, and may be my party&#39;s good luck. I might have quoted extensively from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to show that the honorable member for Indi has always voted against Liberal legislation; and I do not see why he should not, seeing that that was his intention when he came here. It is strange that the honorable member&#39;s predecessor should have been a Protectionist; but, however that may be, we find that, on the Tariff, the honorable member voted thirty-seven times for and 118 times against the Government ; paired three times for and sixty-five times against the Government, and on sixty-four occasions neither voted nor paired. The only object I have in laying these facts before the House is to show that the honorable member, as an opponent of Liberal legislation, has no right to sit behind the Liberal Government, although, at the same time, there is no room for him on this side of the House. There is a clear-cut issue between the political ideas of the honorable member and the political ideas of the Prime Minister, as shown by their votes; and, by no stretch of the imagination, can the honorable member be regarded as politically Liberal-minded. I feel certain that it will take him all his time to assure his constituents that he is a Liberal in any sense of the word. On one occasion, during a visit to the honorable member&#39;s electorate, I did what nasty Labour members always do, I held a meeting ; and I was, I think, able to convince the people of the town that the honorable member&#39;s views were wrong. However that may be, I repeat that he is not a Liberal politician, and has no right to sit behind the honorable member for Ballarat. </para>

Interjections up to a certain point I take no notice of, but, when they are so frequent as to manifestly interrupt the member who is addressing the House, it is my duty to call attention to them and ask that they cease. I have asked the honorable member for Indi to cease interjecting; and I hope he will do so. </para>

              <para>- Amongst the measures promised by the Government is one&#39; in which I, as the representative of Melbourne Ports, am deeply interested, namely, the Bill to compensate seamen for injuries received, owing to faulty gear, unhealthy conditions, and so forth, when following their vocation. A large number of seamen live in my electorate; and, of course, any measures which tend to better their condition, will have my support. We know that seamen, when they attempt to obtain compensation, are always, and very naturally, met with strong opposition by the shipping companies. For years, efforts have been made to pass satisfactory Acts of this kind in the States Parliaments, and those which have found a place on the statute-book, while meeting certain cases,have not met all ; and there is always difficulty in fixing the State in which the suit should be brought. The sea-board of Australia must be regarded as a whole, and, therefore, it is only proper that laws of the kind promised should be the business of the Commonwealth Parliament. I cannot hope, however, for any satisfactory Compensation to Seamen Bill from the present Government. </para>

              <para>- I may say that on three occasions I approached the Government to that end, but, as honorable members know, up to the end of last year, the Tariff and other pressing business monopolized all the time. The Navigation Bill was left unfinished in the Senate, to my regret; because I think that, when the Deakin Government was in power, supported by the Labour party, a good opportunity was presented for legislation of the right stamp. The Senate is, as we know, largely tinged with Labour, and we had hopes of passing a navigation measure on the lines indicated, while I am convinced that any Bill emanatingfrom the present majority of this House will not satisfy those who desire to see that seamen have fair dealing. I shall view with suspicion the Bill when it is presented; and I am only sorry that I have not had a legal training in order that I may ascertain that it will have the effects it should have. As it is,&#39; however, I cannot hope to pit myself against the lawyers and others in the Ministry, who will support the Government proposal. Then another measure promised is one for the prohibition of inequitable rebates by trusts and combines. This is a Government supported by the Employers&#39; Federation, the Chambers of Commerce, and similar bodies; and it is only reasonable to suppose that any measures introduced will not be to prevent trusts and combinations in the future, but rather to increase them, and to still further strengthen those already in existence. We know that the Government proposal means something entirely different from what honorable members opposite would have us believe. I come now to the question of defence. Much has been said as to the action of the Fisher Government in expending the sum of , &#163;250,000 which was specially earmarked for defence purposes. There has been what may be described as a howl of indignation on the part of some honorable members, and it has been declared that a distinct promise was given that the vote shouldnot be expended until Parliament had been consulted. I should like to ask the Government whether they consider themselves bound by any promise made by their predecessors. I am sure that they do not, and that they will be disposed to go out of their way to flout any promise made by the Labour Administration. Asa matter of fact, the vote was expended in the direction desired by Parliament, and the late Government gave no promise that they would not spend it without consulting Parliament. </para>

              <para>- May be they look up that attitude because they felt it would not be spent properly bv the Deakin Government. This complaint comes with an ill-grace from a Government who, without consulting Parliament, have pledged the countrv to an expenditure of &#163;2,000,000. There is a story told of a boy who, hearing his mother quarrelling with another woman, suddenly said : &#34; Call her a rogue, mother. She is going to call you one.&#34; That, I think, sums up the attitude of the Government and their supporters in regard to the Labour party&#39;s action in expending&#39; the special defence vote. The Ministry knew that they had taken an unconstitutional course in making an offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to Great Britain, and so pledging the country to an expenditure of &#163;2,000,000, without consulting Parliament, which was then in session, and in order to cover up their own act they made a mountain out of a molehill by constantly harping on the way in which the special defence vote had been expended by the Labour party. Although many newspapers and various political partiec may take credit for having first suggested that a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> should be offered to Great Britain, the credit belongs reallv to the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> We know well why it made the suggestion. The <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> although supposed to be the organ of the Liberal party in Australia, is opposed to the Liberal party in the Old Country because it is a Free Trade body. I have read in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> many splendid articles that would convince most people that its complaint against the fiscal proclivities of the British Liberal party is wellfounded. As a Protectionist I have naturally approved of those articles, and I think it was because of its opposition to the Liberal Government now in office in Great Britain that it was induced to introduce into Australian politics the demand made by the Opposition in the House of &#39;Commons that the two-power standard should be maintained. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> endeavoured to force the Fisher Government to make the offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> without asking the leave of the people or the Parliament. They would not do so, and the stand they took is admired even by thousands of those who are opposed to the Labour party. They adopted a statesmanlike attitude, and when it was found that the contributions made by the public towards the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> fund were not likely to be sufficient to provide for the construction of one, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray,</inline> the Premier of Victoria, not desiring that this State should lag behind New Zealand, or that the Mother Country should be led to think that we were disloyal, was forced to make the offer that Victoria would join New South Wales in- presenting the British people with a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline></para>

              <para>- We say that the Mother Country does not need such a gift. A country that has been able during the last few years to pay off such a&#39; large proportion of her public debt as Great Britain has done does not require our assistance. Even if it did, we could not give it. We should have had to borrow the money to pay for a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> and in making the offer should have known that we could not afford it. &#39;In this connexion, I think it will not be out of place to make two quotations from articles which appeared in the same issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> On Saturday, the 3rd May, the following paragraph appeared in regard to the State Charity Vote - </para>

Even then he has been unable in a number of cases to allocate the full amount that in the Ordinary course would have been allowed. The allocations of the previous Government were -&#163;6,000 for building grants, an annual increase of &#163;1,500 for the Children&#39;s Hospital, a special vote of . &#163;400 for the Infant Asylum, East Melbourne, and&#163;1,700 for the treatment of consumptives in institutions, making a total of &#163;9,600. Thus nearly 10 per cent, of the total vote had been hypothecated by the promises of the previous Government. </para>

In the one case we have the statement that the State Government could not make extra building grants to charitable institutions, and in the other a declaration that money could be found to provide for the gift of a warship to the Old Country. I have more quotations illustrating the loyaltv of some people, who are never tired of talking of their loyalty to the Crown and the Mother Country. In the matter of patriotism, I give way to no man.  I  was born in the army. My family for seven generations before me were in the army, and I was, at all events, reared in a patriotic atmosphere. In my case, it may be said that patriotism is bred in the bone, and yet I am charged with disloyalty by men who really do not know what loyalty is. I have heard the party of which I am a member charged with disloyalty by position -seekers, whom I should describe in stronger terms, but that I should probably be out of order in doing so. Their loyalty is ever on their tongues, but never reaches their pockets. Whilst we are condemning the Germans for constructing a large navy- </para>

          <para class="block">The Victoria Falls Company are carrying out some big engineering works, for which certain electrical machinery is required, worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. They called for tenders, and, like great patriots, gave Germany the opportunity of manufacturing the goods. Hundreds of similar instances of the patriotic feeling and sentiments which actuate men who are always talking about their loyalty could be enumerated. There is in the Old Country an association known as the &#34;Empire Builders, Limited.&#34; Their idea is good and laudable. It is, with a view to bettering the Empire, to take people from the overcrowded portions of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and place them in Australia, Canada, and elsewhere. They know, as we do, that there is plenty of&#39; room here if the people have an. opportunity of getting the land, and that there are&#39; thousands in the Old Country who would like to have a chance to expand themselves away from their present cramped conditions. That association, however, have more sense than we have here; they do not invite people out, and leave them to find land for themselves. They arrange to bring them out here, get the land, and place them on it. That, however, is by the way. What I wish particularly to bring under the- notice of honorable members, especially those who favour the offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> and talk so much about patriotism, is the last part of the following extract - </para>

            <para>An association, entitled &#34; The Empire Builders Limited,&#34; was formed in London at the beginning of last year, with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> M. N. Young as  president,  for the purpose of encouraging and assisting by emigration the peopling of the large unoccupied areas of British dependencies, and principally Canada and Australasia. One of the originators of the organization was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> S. Bromhead, a farmer, who has had ten or twelve years&#39; experience on the land in this State, and who is consequently well fitted for the work of selection of suitable immigrants for Victoria. He arrived in Melbourne yesterday on board the German mail steamer <inline font-style="italic">Zieten</inline> with a party of twelve immigrants, the first, he hopes, of many hundreds of British agriculturists to arrive in this State. </para>

If they would leave us alone when talking their cant, we should not mind, but they attack us for want of patriotism when we have more true British feeling in one drop of our blood than they have in the whole of their bodies.

              <para>- We were quiet then, but the right honorable member is quiet now. He made out a good case, and what he said was true then, as it is true now ; but he is sitting behind the very men whose financial methods he. then denounced, so that he cannot blame us for our conspiracy of silence. But the right honorable member is not the worst offender. He did tell us that the financial position of the then Deakin Government was &#34;cronk,&#34; but the honorable members who were &#39;then sitting in the Opposition corner, and some of whom are in the present Government, did not support him. The right honorable member, while in every other sense he is a fortunate man, is in one particular phase of his life the most unfortunate that I ever met. Whilst others recognise his great ability, as I do, they have never been willing, since the advent of Federation, to sink their little differences and follow him. Although they knew that he was speaking the truth from these benches on that occasion, they were afraid that they might not get their share of the loaves and fishes, and so did not support him. Afterwards, when he quietly and kindly obliterated himself from the leadership, and the question arose of who should lead the party that was to supplant the Fisher Government, the others said, &#34;Reid is out of the way, and that simplifies it to a certain extent.&#34; The right honorable member for Swan, however, would not play second fiddle to the honorable member for Parramatta. We know, as a matter of fact, that the right honorable member left the Deakin Government because he did not like playing second fiddle to the honorable member for Hume. That was the real reason, and it was not the domination of the Labour party at all, as the right honorable member gave out. He might be willing to play second fiddle to the honorable member for Ballarat, but not to the honorable member for Parramatta. The retirement of the right honorable member for East Sydney apparently removed all the bitterness that previously existed between the parties,- but I could never understand why his retirement, any more than that of the right honorable member for Swan, or the honorable member for Parramatta, was necessary in order to bring about a Coalition. All the really nasty things that were said - everything with a sting that was personal, and not political - came, not from the honorable member for East Sydney, but from the other gentlemen who were sitting in the Opposition corner, and on the direct Opposition benches. That is where the right honorable member for East Sydney is unfortunate.  His  peculiar habit of telling the truth could not be appreciated or forgiven, but other members&#39; speeches could be glossed over and obliterated. The right honorable member for East Sydney knows as well as we do that the Government have not, and never will have, the confidence of the House. The honorable member for Mernda, who is a manufacturer, now sits beside men who would bring into operation, if they could, laws which -would shut up his factories, but while the <inline font-style="italic">statu quo</inline> exists he continues to sit there.. It is funny to hear the Government talk about &#34;the anomalies in the Tariff.&#34; The only anomaly that I know of is that the Tariff is not high enough. The only anomaly which the Free Traders recognise is that the duties are too high. Whenever we have to consider the question of reducing duties on the commodities in which the honorable member for Mernda is so largely - politically - interested, I think he will have serious doubts whether the Government, backed up as they are by about twenty-one Free Traders, have the confidence of the majority of the House. Certain honorable members from Queensland, who are not Labour men, and who, so far as I know, have never claimed to be &#34;as good as Labour&#34; men, cannot feel too safe in their positions. I admit that I should not lose any sleep if they. were politically obliterated, but I ask them seriously whether they believe that the sugar industry is safe in the hands of the men behind whom they are now sitting. I do not think thev do. No doubt, while they do not feel very safe where they are, they console themselves with the reflection that if is &#34; better to have the devil you know than the devil you don&#39;t know.&#34; They say. they are not quite sure what the Labour party would do with the sugar industry. </para>

              <para>- The Sugar Trust or monopoly as it now exists in Australia is a land octopus. Its tentacles grasp everybodygrower, consumer, and workman. The combine keep their sugar at just such a price that the imported sugar,, after paying the duty, cannot undersell them. Having a monopoly, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company can pay what it likes, and does not give the growers the full value of the cane which it crushes. In my constituency, it pays its workmen wages which would not be considered fit for a black man in Northern Queensland. Some of them get. only 6s. per diem, and, unfortunately, they are glad to get that, because nothing better is offered elsewhere. </para>

Unfortunately, when most of them reach the age of fifty, or thereabouts, they are regarded as so much worn-out machinery, and have to leave the company&#39;s service, certain repayments being made to them. </para>

              <para>- Directly there waa a Labour Government in power, an attempt was made to carry out the planks of the party&#39;s platform. I do not blame those who are interested in the Colonial Sugar Company for joining the fusion, but I ask the Free Traders, and those who have talked so much about protecting the interests of the consumers, what action they propose to take to end this monopoly. I cannot imagine the honorable member for Capricornia saying that he would vote for legislation to wipe out these monopolies and trusts. The legislation for which he would vote would be legislation like the Harvester Excise Act and the Industries Preservation Act, which are practically inoperative. We Labour men are not the only persons who object to monopolies like the Colonial Sugar Company. The grocers and the jam manufacturers - this affects the representatives of Tasmania - and all other users of sugar, are concerned. We wish to know whether the Government intends to introduce legislation to suppress these monopolies. It was the expression by the Fisher Government of the intention to put an end to trusts, combines, and monopolies that caused the fusion. </para>

              <para>- For a strong disease a strong medicine is required,It would take a very strong medicine to get rid of the monopoly which the Colonial Sugar Company enjoys. No doubt honorable members regard it as peculiar that I should assist the Government by making a long speech, seeing that I know that it cannot proceed with business until the financial position of the Commonwealth is known; and that the Treasurer will riot be prepared to present the Budget until the end of next month. I admit that Budget statements always puzzle me, as, I believe, they do the majority of honorable members ; and the confusion is not removed by the explanations of one and another in dealing with the millions of money. I think that on. one occasion in the State Parliament nf New South Wales, when the right honorable member for East Sydney introduced, a Budget, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes said that the balance-sheet presented showed &#163;2, 000,000 too much, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McMillan contended that it showed only &#163;1,000,000 too much, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Dibbs insisted that it showed &#163;1,000,000 too little. We have here a difference of &#163;4,000,000 in one Budget, according to the opinion of the great financial authorities of New South Wales. </para>

              <para>- The Lord above only knows ! In admitting that I am no great financier, I know I shall not do myself much harm with my constituents; and my real concern is as to how the Government, in view of the three or four debates to follow this, including the one on the AddressinReply, will be able to present to the House legislation of benefit to the country.- The greatest factor in the downfall of the Fisher Government was the projected land tax, but 1 do not intend to hold forth on that question. I listened to the honorable member for Riverina, and if he did not convince honorable members opposite as to the necessity for a land tax, it is not because those honorable members are too dense to understand. </para>

              <para>- What point is there in that interjection? If the honorable member said that the land tax will not affect any one who voted for me, he would be quite right; but his interjection scarcely meets the fact. What I got up to prove was, that the Government do not possess the confidence of the House, and I think I have done so. I have listened to splendid addresses by honorable members who have had long years of experience in comparison with my own few short months ; and, while I know that the vote will be in favour of the Government, it is evident that there is no stability in the fusion, and that the Government cannot expect the support of the House as it will be constituted when our differences have  been  submitted to the judgment of the people of Australia. </para>

            <para>.- Much has been said against this fusion o&#163; parties; but, for my own part, I regard it as the best thing that has happened since Australia federated. The people of Australia had a right to demand some arrangement of the kind in order to put in their proper places those honorable members who are opposed to really sensible legislation. I claim that Federation has been only a farce up to the time of this fusion. In the beginning the Premiers of the different States were appointed as Ministers of the Commonwealth, and that, of course, to a certain extent, federated the Ministries; but the members of this House were never federated before, or sorted out in the manner they are now ; and it is on that ground that I claim that the real Opposition to Federal legislation is in its proper place. Up to the present, it has been a jumbled affair - the passing of legislation, which, in nearly all cases, on reference to the High Court, has been thrown out, until we have become the laughing stock, not only of Australia, but of the world. There never would have been any Federation if the Constitution proposed to allow what has been attempted by the present Opposition, as is shown by the fact that they cannot attain their aims without crying out for amendment of the Constitution. I claim that the Government and its supporters can do, and will do, what the Opposition are not allowed&#39; to do - that is, represent all parties in Australia. The Opposition are allowed to represent only one party, and on one line, and if they overstep that line, they will forfeit their seats at the next election. I do not propose to quote what has been said by honorable members on one side or the other, as has been done by honorable members opposite, in order to fill up time; I shall not go into ancient history, and declare where the fault lies for what has, or has not been done. It is almost amusing to hear the arguments and statements -from the Opposition benches. The chief trouble of the honorable member for Riverina appear? to be that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> has &#34;&#39;gone back&#34; on him - that that newspaper advocated something which he has followed religiously for years, whereas now it has turned round, and is backing up the new party. </para>

              <para>- Although I never made a profession of it, I have always had the interests of Australia at heart, and have done my best for every one in the country. I claim to-day that if we had more men of business ability in the Government,&#34; we should have more legislation for the benefit of the people. I desire to show that I have in no way altered my opinions by joining the supporters of the present Government, but, rather, that the party to which I have belonged since I entered the House, have strengthened up and brought about this fusion. I say that the Corner party have all through been in the right ; they had the common sense to see that there must be a medium somewhere for the good of Australia between the views expressed by the present Opposition and the views expressed by the previous Deakin Government. It is impossible for any party to do justice to Australia when the members of that party are compelled by a machine to represent only one section of the community. We, on the other hand, can stand here as the representatives of all, and we claim to be able to represent even the workers better than do the so-called Labour members. The Opposition are returned on majority rule, and talk much of that principle, and yet they object to it as applied in this Chamber. One of the best proposals ever made since I entered this House is that of the present Government for the establishment of a Board of Trade, which means more to Australia than many people think. I mean a Board of Trade to deal with, say, the Customs Tariff, and industrial and kindred subjects, which do not call for legislation -every year, but need consideration at the hands of a permanent tody, very often for years, before any enactment can be passed. I claim that the old Opposition. Corner party, to .which I belonged, acted rightly in voting for reasonable protective duties as being best calculated to conduce to the welfare of Australia, and I shall show that such duties have /proved beneficial wherever they have been imposed. </para>

As far as I can learn, the system of Wages Boards established in Victoria is the best that can be adopted to insure fair treatment being accorded to employes, because, under it, each industrial dispute is dealt with by a body of experts. That system is preferable to the settlement of disputes by an Arbitration Court such as obtains in Western Australia, where it is composed of a representative of the employers, a representative of the employes, and a Supreme Court Judge, who acts as referee. </para>

              <para>- He represents the Crown. The system adopted in Western Australia is unsatisfactory, because it is not possible for any two men representing the employers and employes to be familiar with all the ramifications of every trade and business. . . I  dp  not think representatives of employers and employes are competent to decide these questions on evidence. How can they be expected to deal with disputes relating to the clothing industry, the boot industry, the saddlery industry, and the mining industry? It is impossible for them to possess the requisite expert knowledge. The intricacies of some trade disputes are such that it is puzzling even to read the evidence. I consider that the determination by Wages Boards partake more of the character of mutual agreements between persons who have expert knowledge of the particular industries in which the disputes arise. Most of the troubles which we have experienced in the Commonwealth have been due to decisions arrived at by persons who do not .possess that knowledge. </para>

          <para>It is merely a matter of constituting certain boards to deal with certain industries. The determinations of these bodies would, I think, generally be in favour of the workmen. Of course, it is conceivable that a Judge of the Arbitration Court might suddenly be called upon to leave a temperate climate like that of Victoria to hear a dispute in the interior where similar climatic conditions obtain. But he might happen to strike a very hot day, and his decision might be influenced by the consideration that such days were the rule, and not the exception, in that particular locality. On the other hand, his visit to a tropical region might be made on a cool day, and&#39; he might be induced to think that men working there experienced no more discomfort than is experienced elsewhere. </para>

            <para>Although he is an ardent advocate of a living or minimum wage system, as artificially regulated by an Arbitration Court, his words constitute as strong a condemnation of that system as any of its most hostile .critics have pro- nounced. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>A needs wage is necessarily more or less uniform in the different trades, and this uniformity would produce the same discouragement of superior care, skill, and industry as is found under the present conditions. It is idle to assume equality of industrial efficiency in the workers in all the different callings unequality, and not equality, is nature&#39;s rule; and any law which fails to give an incentive or encouragement to the exercise of superior efficiency causes <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> dead and heavy loss to the whole community. It causes, indeed, a double loss - first the loss of that additional wealth that would otherwise have been produced, and secondly, in time, the loss from non-exercise of that very superior efficiency itself. We all know what freedom of opportunity has done for progressive people  -  we all see what the denial of it has done to those Eastern peoples still in the thrall of caste, upon whom a miserable dead-level is imposed by law or custom. Progress demands that extra care,  skill, and effort should have extra reward, or you will in time produce an industrial stagnation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Those are the words of a man who has studied industrial legislation from start to finish. His remarks are straight to the point. No law that we can make will help people if it does away with the incentive to excel. If we could enact the good old system of apprenticeship, whereby each boy who enters a calling, could be made competent, we should do more for Australia than all the Labour unions that ever were formed, and the unions would be ten times stronger if they demanded that every man should be competent before he was allowed to join. My memory carries rr.e back to the time when men had to go through a certain training before they were considered competent or could get the full benefits of a competent mechanic or tradesman. It is the crowd of improvers who dodge from, one trade to another that cause half the strikes and troubles in this country. The unions would be a great success if they could say that every member was a competent man. </para>

              <para>- I never mentioned the words. It would be to the benefit of all if employers who required labour could apply to the Unions to send them so many men, and could be sure that they were competent. The weak point of Unionism at present is that any one may join, whether competent or not. That must and will kill Unionism in the end. The word that should be written up outside their establishments is &#34;competency.&#34; I believe the&#39; reason why the incompetent are grasped by the hand and asked to join unions is that there are so many more of them. I have another report of a speech which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Findlay</inline> delivered upon Labour and the Arbitration Act of New Zealand.

            <para>Some believe; others&#39; faith has been shaken. To this second class obviously belongs <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Findlay,</inline> the Attorney-General for New Zealand. About the middle of last year he delivered two addresses on Labour and the Arbitration Act, which throw highly interesting sidelights upon the practical working in New Zealand of the principle of compulsory arbitration - the corner-stone of the modern system of industrial legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Findlay</inline> is to be commended upon the fair and moderate manner in which he has dealt with the subject, and has obvious predilection in favour of the Arbitration Act, gives all the more weight to the admissions that he finds himself constrained to make.  His  field of argument, moreover, is the best that an advocate of LabourSocialistic legislation could possibly select whereon to take his stand. New Zealand was the first country to adopt such legislation. She has prospered exceedingly ever since. What can be more natural, therefore, than to assume cause and effect, and to affirm that New Zealand&#39;s prosperity has been due to her legislation? Such an assertion is difficult to counteract, although there are not wanting indications that the prosperity of New Zealand is on the wane. </para>

              <para>- I am under the impression, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that I must address you. Both in New South Wales and Western Australia, the effect of compulsory arbitration has been distinctly to increase industrial friction, and embitter the relations between employer and employed. Strikes instead of being decreased have actually been created, and the effect of the Federal Arbitration Court has been. that troubles have been created with the sole object of bringing them to&#39; the Court. I would instance the timber trouble. They have tried to rake up evidence from all parts of Australia, and to connect it in some way so as to make it a dispute extending beyond the confines of a State. The thing is on a par with the story of the American town that was so healthy that some one had to be killed in order to start the cemetery. Our Federal Arbitration Act has been just about as much use. Any such Act which is inoperative unless a dispute is created to refer to the Court is not much good, and that is why I advocate what the Government now propose. I want something sensible, reasonable, and workable that will allow the States to retain the control of all industrial affairs in the shape of Wages Boards, and all that kind of thing, providing that if they cannot agree, they mav then come to the Federal Court.

I showed that from the use made nf the Act, and for the reasons I gave, the Court has  steadily  become a State regulator of fair wages in each industry, and, although the wage fixed by the Court is merely the least an employer is allowed to pay, it is in general practice the highest the employer will pay. The result of this has been a marked tendency to a uniform or dead level wage in each trade for all workers, good, bad, or indifferent. </para>

When the parties gave up trying to settle these disputes - gave up, indeed, having any genuine disputes - but worked the Act for the sole purpose of wage regulation, conciliation really had no place, and the Boards, as they now stand, have become a kind of fifth wheel in the coach of which they were intended to be the most important part - an agent wrested from its true purpose of conciliation into one of expense, friction, and delay. </para>

          <para class="block">A north of Ireland man named <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> Lowry Moore, who recently returned to Great Britain, in speaking of West Australia, says to a press interviewer :  - &#34; Only the fringe of the Continent is occupied, and much of the unoccupied land is magnificent. There is not the least reason why any one should want in Australia. I wish I had gone out there twenty years ago. There are thousands and thousands in Great Britain who would not hesitate a day if they only knew of the possibilities for energy, brains, and capital. &#34; Western Australia has a great future before it. Make no mistake. Besides the rich mines the State is studded with, the pastoral and agricultural resources are really great, though very little known to outsiders. Many people &#39;are more than doing well on the land there. If the mines were to shut down at once - and they still have a long life before them - the State would go on and prosper.&#34; </para>
          <para>Everv word of that is true, notwithstanding all the high falutin about land not being available. It seems to me that many people who are looking for land fix their eyes or some estate that has been improved, and expect to get it at from 10s. to&#163;1 per acre, although the original owner, and possibly a son after him, may have spent their lives in bringing it to its present state. It is unfair to abuse people who took up land years ago, and, by their great pioneering work, have made the country what it is to-day. Some honorable members hold the idea that there should be no borrowing for the development of the country, but we must not forget that it took millions of money to bring Australia to its present position. Millions of money created by the discovery of alluvial gold in Victoria were spent in clearing the scrub and making the country which is now available for settlers. That was not borrowed gold, but gold taken out of the earth, and also money made by means of other industries ; and yet people expect to get, for practically nothing, land on the improvement of which that money was spent. I could show, in Victoria, land where there is a clear line of  demarkation  between the cleared and cultivated land and the forest; and I am convinced that it would take &#163;10 or &#163;15 an acre to put the cleared land in the condition in which it is to-day. If one attempts to clear timber  away  in its green state it costs ten times as much, as it would if it were allowed to stand, for, say, twenty years. I am quite satisfied that the pioneers of Australia were more real workers than the so-called workers of  to-dav.  I have been  thirty  years in Australia, and I could drive honorable members to large areas where the houses, originally erected by the old pioneers, are still standing. Yet we have men coming from the Old Country and complaining that the Government have not cleared land and provided houses for them. Such preparation was never expected by the early pioneers, who carved their way to fortune, and have made Australia a country for  us to  live in, and, indeed, a country in which many can get a living without working. What I mean is that those pioneers, by their energy and labour, placed the country in such a condition that trade unions could be formed to send representatives to this Parliament who do not work. All of us are now reaping the benefit, not of past labour agitation, but of the pluck and energy of the pioneers. What has been done in the past is open for any one to do in most of the States to-day. and especially in Western Australia. I know of one man in that State who, within the last ten years, on a very moderate salary, has cleared a large area of country and utilized it to such an extent that last year his crop, I am told, was worth &#163;3,000. He has now under crop some 600 acres of wheat, and he has achieved his present position by spending what he could afford out of an ordinary salary in bringing the land under cultivation and making a home. Hundreds of others could do the same, not on the advice of agitators who tell them to go to the Government for assistance, but- </para>

              <para>- When I used the word &#34; agitator,&#34; I had in my mind the proposal to burst up big estates that have been improved. In some parts big estates may be a menace; but I contend that if land, whether in large or small areas, is put to the purpose for which it is best fitted, there is no ground for complaint. There are immense areas in Australia, fit for nothing but sheep country ; and I think it is a cruel idea to tax all land over &#163;5,000 in value, if it has been put to its proper use. If any land tax is imposed, it should be without any exemption whatever. </para>

              <para>- The suggestion was made in Western Australia long before there was any Labour Conference in Queensland. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Year-Booh</inline> for 1907-8, New South Wales then had a surplus of ,&#163;1,865,170; Victoria a surplus of &#163;452,244; Queensland a surplus of &#163;115,301; South Australia a surplus of &#163;&#91;273,872; Tasmania a surplus of ;&#163;7 5 &#62; 389; while Western Australia had a deficit of &#163;&#91;2,365. For this year the total increase in the States revenue is &#163;1,196,863, of which- New South Wales claims &#163;568,328. That being the position, we must acknowledge that Western Australia, which was the only State which entered Federation with a surplus, is entitled to special consideration. We find also in the Government programme a proposal to take over the Northern Territory. All that I have to say in regard to that proposition is that if we do take over the Territory, the agreement should be free from any stipulation as to the route to be traversed by any railway that may be constructed. This Parliament should be free to determine what route should be selected. This proposal affords another reason why, in my opinion, special consideration should be given to Western Australia and Queensland, since both those States are developing large areas of country very similar to the Northern Territory, without the assistance of the other States. The Federal Parliament has seen fit to impose a heavy duty on steel rails, and no one can say that that impost is likely to help Western Australia and Queensland to open up their northern areas. Coming to the question of defence, I feel constrained to refer to a statement made in this House on the 1st instant by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, that the offer which the Commonwealth Government had made to Great Britain would tend to increase the unrest now prevailing in India, and would kindle there a blaze that it would be hard to extinguish. It would be just as reasonable to say that the Naval Subsidy that we have hitherto granted is responsible for the trouble in India. There is absolutely no ground for such an assertion. I still hold the opinion that I ex-, pressed in this House on 3rd November last, when I said - </para>

            <para>That is what I wish to know. Personally, I think that we should have training ships stationed at each port. Then any of our boys who happened to  become rowdy, could be sent aboard, and taught discipline in addition to something useful. In alter years these lads would be very thankful that the opportunity was afforded them of becoming good citizens. The best men in the British Navy have gravitated from &#39;training ships, and in Australia there is certainly a class of boys running about our towns who would make better citizens if they were cleaned, disciplined, and taught something useful. If they are permitted to run wild they will find their way into our gaols. Regarding military defence, I think that the Government propose to start at the wrong end. I believe that the key to the whole position is the compulsory training of our bow whilst they are at our schools and colleges. </para>

          <para>If we adopted the -principle of compulsory training in their case, in a very little time we should have an army which would -be quite capable of defending Australia. Whilst they are at school they are at an impressionable age when  it is most easy to inculcate lessons of discipline -lessons which once learned they will never forget. </para>
          <para>In the matter of defence, we stand in much the same relation to the British Empire as does the citizen to the State in regard to the protection of property. The man who owns a shop in Collins-street or elsewhere is expected to take reasonable precautions ro safeguard it by seeing that the windows and doors are securely fastened. But, having done that he has to trust to the authorities - to whose maintenance he contributes - to insure the safety of his property. In the same way, if we attend to the defence of our parts - if we see to our coastal defences - and make a reasonable contribution to the cost of the British Navy, we shall have nothing to fear. Before Australia could be taken by an enemy, it would be necessary, first of all, for the British Empire as a whole to be vanquished. A great deal has been said as to the offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to the British Government, but I am inclined to think that the gift the Government intend to make will not take that form. I should like our present naval subsidy to be increased from  &#163;200,000  to  &#163;500,000  per annum, and (hereafter increased at the rate of  &#163;100,000  per annum until it amounted to  &#163;1,000,000  per annum. </para>

On 8th December last I urged that a permanent Commission of Management should be appointed, with a staff of experts, to control the Post and Telegraph Service, and I am under the impression that we shall not secure a satisfactory service until that is done. The Ministerial head of the Department is changed so frequently that complications must necessarily arise, and I think that the one way out of the difficulty is the appointment of a permanent Commission or directorate to manage the whole of the service under the control of the PostmasterGeneral.

That could be easily worked out by stamping all wage sheets and making it necessary to give a. receipt for all wages. I should like to ask the Treasurer if he will, when amending the Old-Age Pensions Act, cause the Act to be altered so as to allow all institutions, State or private, to collect the pensions to which any of the inmates would be entitled if living outside such institutions. I find on looking through the Act that if any one in receipt of a pension misbehaves himself, the pension can be paid to a minister of religion, or some one else representing the pensioner, but if a man through no fault of his own goes into an institution, there is no provision for his pension still to be paid, the pension being stopped. </para>

              <para>- It should not be so. in the Commonwealth law. The pension once paid should be always due, wherever the pensioner is. He may be living with his family and receiving a. pension, and if It is necessary for him to go into an institution where he can be looked after, his pension should not be stopped. I hope the Treasurer will consider this suggestion, and that members of the Opposition will assist me in making it law. In the end, some such provision will have to be adopted in Australia. I cannot see that the question of a man getting old has anything to do with it. I think the pension system must be converted into something more like a State insurance. A man of twenty or thirty, with a growing family, may be incapacitated from work, and the fact that he would receive an old-age pension when he reached the age of sixty-five would not be much consolation to him. The system we have adopted is very crude, and in the end we must go back to the methods of some of the older countries that I have mentioned. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cockburn puts my view forcibly in his report in these words - </para>

            <para>.- The honorable member for Wimmera was good enough to say that nothing was so calculated to destroy the influence of the Labour party as the ungracious way in which thev went out of office. The honorable member, when he made that statement, could have been neither a partisan nor. patriotic. I take it that when he crossed the floor to vote to dismiss the Fisher Government from office he was actuated by the belief that it was dangerous for the &#39; Labour party to dominate the politics of Australia, and that it would be better for the country that our influence should cease. When an&#39;honorable member holding these views is good enough to tell us that what we are doing tends to lessen our influence, he cannot be either a good partisan or a good patriot, or he would not give us such a hint. Certain sections of the press, and some honorable members opposite, have stated that the members of the late Ministry have been whining a good deal, because,&#39; to use the elegant phraseology of the Prime Minister, they have been ,: dragged from, the tart shop.&#34; If I have whined since I was removed from office, I have absolutely no justification for doing it. As far back as the beginning of the second session of this Parliament, I expressed the hope, when speaking on the Address-in-Reply, that the time would not be far distant when there  would be only two political parties in the House, one representing the wealthy class, the well-fed and the splendidly housed, and the other representing humanity, and the people as a people. It seems to me that that time has come. It came a little sooner than I expected, and I have no reason to complain because my hopes have been realized. I therefore cannot raise a single complaint, because honorable members, who, a few weeks ago, sat on this side, have fused, and dismissed the Fisher Ministry. I have always argued that there was really no fundamental difference, and no vital principle separating the party which called itself Liberal, and the other which called itself Conservative, whereas there was a vital principle separating us from every other party in the House. Consequently, far from objecting to what has been done, I rather rejoice that it has happened, because, to some extent, what I previously hoped for has come about. The right honorable member for Swan, a little before the fusion took place, stated in an interview with the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> that it was necessary to bring it about, because the common interests of the then existing sections of the party opposite demanded it. They had, therefore, interests in common which were antagonistic to those of our party. That bears out my argument that there was a vital principle separating us from them, whereas there was none separating them from one another. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> when the Fisher Ministry were dismissed, published a leading article to the effect that usually, when one Ministry followed another, there was practically no change of policy, so that it did not matter much what Ministry was in power. But it stated that in this case there would be a reversal of policy; that what the Fisher Government proposed to do would not be proceeded with, and that what it would not do would be proceeded with. Those remarks show that the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> holds that there is a vital and distinct difference &#39; between the Labour party and other political parties in this Parliament. But a number of those who call themselves Liberals - I take no exception to the term if they choose to apply it ito themselves - have frequently declared on the public platform that their views differ radically from the. views of those who for years occupied the Opposition benches, and whom they called Conservatives. By so doing they got many electors to vote for them. A fusion has now been brought about, and a. number of the Liberals have told us that the reason for it is that their seats are in danger. The honorable member for Ballarat, speaking at the Brisbane Exhibition, Building, said that he was practically forced into his present  position, because the seats of himself and a number of his party were being threatened by the Labour party. Other honorable members have frankly admitted that they were actuated by the same reason in joining the fusion. Honorable members who join with those of an opposite political camp simply to secure their seats have no very high ideal. I have been a member of Parliament for fourteen years, and  having  breathed the political atmosphere during the whole of that time, can understand some members taking that stand; but it has surprised me to find that the party press, and the organizations supporting these honorable gentlemen, excuse what they have done. The Liberal party is in a somewhat pitiable plight. Its members have shown that they are prepared to abandon their principles, and to swallow any proposals, to secure their political lives. Apparently they would advocate the policy of the political Labour leagues, or the contrary policy of the Employers&#39; Federation, to save their seats. In this they are lineal descendants of the Vicar of Bray. Imagine what would be said if the members of the Labour party acted in similar fashion ! Had the honorable member for Wide Bay declared at Gympie a policy differing from that on which he was elected, excusing it bv the statement that he had made compromises here and there to give himself a walk-over at the next election, what would the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> have had to say about his conduct? Or what would the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> have said of the honorable member for West  Sydney  had he told his constituents that he had ceased to advocate certain measures in order to secure his seat. I know that if I entered into an alliance with political opponents, or gave votes contrary to my principles, my constituents would quickly tell me that they had sent me to Parliament, not to provide me with a seat in Parliament,  but  so that I might advocate certain * principles, and that, as I was not doing so,  they  would get some one else. No doubt it would be inconvenient to some honorable members if the newspapers were to demand that they should be true to their hustings pledges, irrespective of personal  consequences. That would be awkward for the mere place hunters, for those who think rhat, having, with a lot of trouble and expense, got into Parliament, they should stay here, come what might. But it would purify the public life of Australia, and raise Parliament in the public estimation, if members, no matter to what party they belonged, were true to their election promises. The honorable member for Robertson said some time ago that the members of the Labour party are not free men. </para>

          <para class="block">That testimony that each day the Ministry remained in office it would become stronger because it would grow in public favour is one which I, as a humble member of the Ministry, took as a great compliment, coming as it did, not from the Labour press, but from a newspaper bitterly opposed to the Labour party. In Australia no Ministry can live long in opposition to public opinion, and I hope that the time will never come when our Governments will have to depend on soldiers or policemen to keep in power. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> on 1 2th May gave another rea&#171;son for the fusion.

I must confess that when I read those words, I thought they were rather rough on honorable members opposite.

              <para>- I do not think that the honorable member for Robertson should be so silly. A little while ago, the honorable member for Maribyrnong, at a public meeting, stated that the policy of the Fisher  Government was practically the same as the policy of the Deakin Government, with a few extras thrown in. Of course, it all depends on what the &#34;few extras&#34; are; and it is because a &#34; few extras &#34; are lacking that I have no confidence in the Ministry. As a Labour party, we advocate a land1 tax; and we know that the Government are not prepared at present to bring forward a proposal of the kind. The question of land value taxation is one not only for the country, but for the city, and I am in favour of a land tax not merely for the purpose of bursting up large estates, but also for revenue purposes. I contend that, as a Federal Legislature, we have a perfect right to resort to direct taxation in order to carry oh the necessary services. I have always held the opinion that if a person possesses a piece of land, and, by his own toil or the application of his experience, adds to its value, that added value should belong to him, and ought not to be taxed by any Government unless driven by the greatest of extremities. But, on the other hand, if a person has land which is increased in value by the energy of the people, by the building, of roads, bridges, railways, and so forth - the added value, it seems to me, should belong not to the owner, but to the people who created the value. I am glad to know that in this view I am supported by people in high places. The Minister of Defence some time ago said - i  do not believe in paying for land at all.  i  believe in taxing it, and if we tax it to its full unimproved value we shall have no need to sell it ; indeed, no one will buy it. When a man wants a bit of land in this Colony he has to go hundreds of miles back into the bush, behind his strong neighbour, who has picked out the eyes of the country. We ought to tax the strong neighbour for every ounce of privilege which he possesses over the man who proposes to go into the bush. </para>

          <para>These axe noble sentiments. I am not prepared to go to the whole extent - though I go a long way - and say that we should not pay for land at all.; and it would be interesting to know whether the Minister of Defence has since gone back on his word. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Asquith,</inline> the Prime Minister of England, speaking in the House of Commons within the last week or so, said - </para>

One reason why the Government have not my confidence and support is that they are not prepared to make a step in this direction. There was a time, I believe, when the present AttorneyGeneral was a very brilliant exponent of the policy of land values taxation ; and I do not know whether he has changed his opinion. </para>

              <para>- We do not know what may . happen in the future; and we ought to do something now. Then, again, I differ from honorable members opposite on the question of new Protection. We ought not to be obliged to go cap-in-hand to the State Parliaments in order that we may protect the people of Australia. We have full power, under the Customs Tariff, to protect employers and manufacturers to any extent; and I simply ask that, without the permission of any State Parliament, we should have a similar right to protect the workers. I should not be content with power to protect only those who are employed in protected industries, because, in my opinion, we ought to have the right, full and complete, to protect any citizen of the Commonwealth,- irrespective of what his work may be, or where or how he is employed. Although we have a bicameral Parliament, &#39; there is no property qualification for either House; and if the wealthymanufacturers and employers may be protected, surely we might be_ entrusted to protect the toilers. Then, further, we ought to have the right to nationalize monopolies ; and I see no suggestion to that end in the statement by the Government. About two years ago, this House, on the suggestion of the Deakin Government, ratified a contract with an English company for carrying the mails between here and England. But, although that tender was accepted, those&#34; interested were unable to &#39;fulfil their obligation. It was considered that there were influences in England brought to bear on the company to prevent it from entering into the Australian trade; and the Prime Minister said - </para>

              <para>- Quite so. The power, if given, will not be used unless a good case were made out; but it ought to be there, in view of the danger that trusts have become in other countries, and may become here. We say that majorities ought to rule; but, although an overwhelming majority might be returned here, who were of opinion that some monopoly ought to be nationalized, no step to that end could be taken; and the least we ought to do is to ask the people at the next general election to give us the power. I have dealt with three points on which I differ from the present Government, and they are very important points. There are honorable members, and some sections of the press, who hold that the honorable member for Hume, in the vigorous action he has been taking lately against the fusion party is actuated simply by personal spleen and disappointment. I am not here to defend the honorable member. He is well able to defend himself, but I think I shall do him no injustice by referring to a conversation which I had some two years ago with a friend of mine who is also a great personal and political friend of the present Prime Minister. I was spending an evening with the gentleman in question, shortly after the honorable member for Ballarat had become very unwell - so unwell, indeed, that a large number of his friends were very anxious about him. And let me say, in passing, that however bitter may be the political vendetta that the Labour party are now waging against him, we are all pleased that he has been completely restored to health. In the course of my conversation with the Prime Minister&#39;s friend, I think that I&#34; must have said something that was not very complimenary to the honorable member for Hume, because he replied, &#34;Thomas,- I do not think you ought to say that about <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was so ill, a little while ago, he was anxious to resign the office of Prime Minister, but <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> said to him,  Do not resign. Go away for two or three months. Go to some place where you will hear nothing of politics; try to forget everything about the Federal Parliament, anl in your absence, I shall do my best to carry on the Government.&#39; &#34; At that moment the glittering prize of the Prime Ministership of Australia was almost in the hands of the honorable member for Hume. The Labour party had not dissociated themselves from the Deakin party, and many of us would have been even more ready to support the Liberal party led by the honorable member for Hume than we were to support it under the leadership of the honorable member for Ballarat. </para>

              <para>- Quite so. To the credit of the honorable member for Hume be it said that he refused to seize the glittering prize. But what can we say of the right honorable member for Swan, who left the present Prime Minister in his hour of need? Well do I remember the occasion when the honorable member for Hindmarsh in the course of the debate on the Address-in-Reply, in 1907, attacked the right honorable gentleman who was then Treasurer in the Deakin Government, and who, turning to him said, &#34; Why do you not pitch into the Prime Minister? He has said more unkind things about your party than I have.&#34; I was sitting close to the right honorable member at the time, and I asked, &#34; What, do you want Hutchison to pitch into a sick colleague?&#34; </para>

              <para>- I repeat that I am not. It is immaterial to me whether the right honorable gentleman sits on the Treasury bench or in any other part of the House, but since some honorable members have found fault with the honorable member for Hume because he has felt called upon to sit in Opposition, I have felt it necessary to refer to this incident. If some honorable members think they are justified in sacrificing their principles in order to save their seats, I am not surprised that an honorable member, believing that his leader had abandoned him, although he stood by him when he was ill and in difficulties, should speak strongly.&#34; Is it not reasonable that he should speak strongly when he believes that in such circumstances his former leader has abandoned him and has taken to his bosom an honorable member who was prepared to sacrifice him. </para>

              <para>- An honorable member recently quoted in this House a statement reported to have been made by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coulls</inline> at a congress held in Sydney, to the effect that he was not prepared to fight for his country ; that he would allow the Japanese or the Germans to take it, and offer no de fence, since he had nothing to defend. I have no hesitation in saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coulls,</inline> who made that statement, is a very decent fellow, and that those were not the opinions of the real man. They were no more his honest convictions than they are mine or those of the Prime Minister. I remember some years ago listening to a sermon delivered by a leading Methodist minister in South Australia whom you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> know very well, in the course of which he said that if he were unable to satisfy the cry of his children for bread - if he could do nothing to satisfy their hunger - he would be driven well-nigh mad, and should not like to be held responsible for what he might say in such circumstances. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coulls,</inline> who made the statement to which I have just referred, has known what it is to enter his home and to find those near and dear to him short of the necessities of life. That was his experience as the outcome of a very serious industrial struggle at Broken Hill, and it was in such circumstances that he made, the statement. I bave been refreshing my memory by a reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as to some statements made in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales by the present Minister of Defence regarding a strike that took place at Broken Hill in  1892.  The honorable gentleman said- - </para>

            <para>I do not agree with those who have denounced the leaders in the strike. It is always a popular thing to denounce a man who is leading on the losing side. I refuse to believe all that has been said about the leaders in the Broken Hill strike. Whatever has been done by them great allowance must be made for men in their position. Their words ought not to be weighed with such nicety as under ordinary circumstances. Those who condemn those men in a sweeping manner do not know from experience what a strike  really  means. If they had had, as I have had, experience of a seven months&#39; strike, their feelings would be  very  different indeed. I will not condemn in a  wholesale  way men who are hundreds of miles way, living under very strained conditions. </para>

          <para class="block">Those were kindly, just, and noble sentiments, and I am satisfied that every generous and fair-minded citizen of Australia is prepared to make a very liberal allowance for words that are uttered by men in straitened circumstances. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coulls</inline> made the statement attributed to him, I should prefer to trust to him to assist to defend Australia in its hour of danger than to rely upon the honorable member for Corio, who quoted his remarks. I would rather trust him to assist to defend Autralia than put mv trust in any man who volunteered to go to South Africa  at the time of the Boer war, and on the day set apart for the examination of candidates, did not parade. </para>

              <para>- Why did the honorable member for Corio quote the remarks made on the occasion in question by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coulls?</inline> Who is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coulls</inline> that his name should have been brought into this debate? The inference was this : The remarks were made at a Labour Congress, he is a Labour man, and therefore the Labour party are disloyal. I grudge no member and no party any vote or adherent won by the misrepresentation of opponents or by false deductions, because votes so won, adherents so gained, cannot be permanently retained. Happily, the schoolmaster is abroad in Australia, and no party can live merely by misrepresenting its opponents. The Labour party lost votes at the last election because certain members went about saying that we were prepared to interfere with the sanctity of the home and the marriage tie. But we won more votes than we lost because our opponents  made those statements. The Labour movement, or Political Labour party as we understand it to-day, entered the political arena twenty or twenty-one years ago, amidst the jeers of the people and the sneers of the press. But we have so made headway that to-day we have been able to make the great National Liberal party of Australia bite the very dust. The Liberal party, a few years ago, had a policy of its own, a programme of its own, a flag of its own, and watchwords of its own ; but that flag has been lowered, that policy is now dictated to it by outside organizations, and others coin its watchwords. Its members have had to do this, in order that they may be saved from annihilation by the onward march of the Labour party. The Liberal party has struck its tent, and has gone, bag and baggage, into the camp of its hereditary enemies the Conservatives, in order to escape annihilation. We started as a Labour party about twenty years ago, amidst the scoffs and the laughter of the parties that for so long had held sway in the political arena. But to-day we have forced every other party in politics to readjust their party lines. We have compelled them to sweep away ancient political landmarks and to obliterate life-long animosities. We have compelled Alfred Deakin, the&#34; idol of Victoria, to eat his words. We have made him in this House do that which, before his constituents at the last general election, and again and again in this House, he said he would never do. We have forced the honorable member for Maribyrnong, who would have us believe that he is not only the apostle of anti-sweating, but the be-all and end-all of the Anti-Sweating League, to become the associate of the honorable member for Parkes, who makes it his boast that he advocates freedom of contract. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, there</inline> is a greater triumph even than this. We have compelled the honorable member for Bourke, whose immaculate soul stands aghast at the very idea of having anything to do with the Labour party, because in his constituency a Labour league passed a resolution condemning the municipal council for spending money on temperance legislation, to enter into the political fight under the distinguished patronage of the manufacturer, of Boomerang brandy. Those are the victories that in twenty years we have achieved, and, in view of them, I do&#39; not think that, as a party, we need show any impatience with the progress we have made. Let us but make the same progress during the next ten years, and complete victory must be ours. We have made that advance against the press, because we have had no daily papers to support us ; we have made it in spite of every vested interest, and we have made it against the brilliant orators&#39; of Australia, because thev have been on the platform against us. We have not had the rhetoric of the schools to help us ; we have only been able to go on the platform and, with stammering tongues, to put our programme before the people. But, in spite of all that, we have made the advances and achieved the triumphs that I have spoken of. That shows conclusively that righteousness is on our side. I have been, with my colleagues, accused of whining&#39; because T have been dismissed from Ministerial office. I grudge no one his seat upon the Treasury bench. It is an honorable ambition for any member to endeavour to obtain a seat there. If members, when sitting there, are able to carry out the policy that they believe in, it adds charm to the office; but, if they are&#39; unable to do that, the office is robbed of its chief attraction. I am prepared to admit that if we had been allowed to sit there for some time longer we should probably not have been permitted to carrv out our policy. I believe I look just as happy as does the present Postmaster-General, and I grudge no one his position in the Ministry ; but one member whom I deeply regret to see there is the Minister of Defence. There are those who say that, as the outcome of the fusion, Free Trade is thrown overboard. Others say that Protection has been sacrificed. I care not which of those statements ds correct, because I do not worry in the slightest about fiscalism. Some say that Liberalism has been sacrificed, others that Conservatism has gone overboard. I care not which of those claims is true, because I take no interest in the fortunes of any party but my own; but I do regret to see the Minister of Defence sitting upon the Treasury bench, because he has betrayed the&#39; class from which he sprang, and to which he belongs. For, although he and i did not enter the State Parliament in the same year, we were elected practically on the same platform, and the miners of Lithgow had the same idea in their mind when they elected him as had the miners of Broken Hill when they elected me. If, when he was returned for the first time by the miners of Lithgow some one had said to him that the time was not far distant when instead of sitting on the same side as the  President  of the Australian Workers Union he would be sitting on the side of the Employers&#39; Federation, I venture to say that with indignation he would have turned upon his assailant and asked, &#34; Is thy servant a dog that he should do this thing?&#34; The first time he ever visited Ballarat was, I venture to say, as one who was attending the Trades Union Congress, in order that the workers might be welded together to fight their common enemy, capitalism. But the last visit he paid to that beautiful city was as the champion of the women&#39;s section of the Australian National Association. In Australia there is no league which is more bitterly, opposed to the ideals and the aspirations of the Labour Party than is the league under whose auspices the honorable member went to Ballarat om the last occasion. It may be that in his heart of hearts he thinks that in twice helping to dismiss a Labour Ministry from office he was doing that which he believed to be the. best for the people who sent him here, for the community of which he is a member, and for the Commonwealth of which he is a citizen. If he honestly holds that belief it is not for me to Judge him or question his motives. I cannot but express my regret - I avow that it is not in anger, but in sorrow - that one to whom I, in 1892, sent a telegram from Broken Hill, congratulating him with delight upon being made the Leader of the </para>

I express my regret that one to whom the Democracy of New South Wales looked in 1892, 1893, and 1894, with so much hope, pride, and expectancy, has, instead of being with us, permitted himself to be associated with those forces which are ever assailing us, and has become the sworn ally of those interests which, if they had their way, would sweep the Labour party out of politics to-morrow, which would remove every protection that the worker to-day possesses, which would sweep away every privilege that the toilers have wrung from an unwilling and impudent plutocracy, and would once more place us under an industrial despotism as  cruel as that of the taskmasters of Egypt and as remorseless as that of the slave-drivers of Carolina. </para>

            <para>.- The speech which has just been delivered by the honorable member for Barrier, the ex-Postmaster-General is, compared with other speeches delivered from the Opposition side, very much like a strong sea breeze on a summer&#39;s day. I was very pleased to hear the speech, because it was free from whining and most manly. If you, sir, have watched the debate very carefully you will have noticed that the honorable member apparently takes Theodore Hook as his model. He says that those that weep best weep as mutes. He certainly has not been mute to-night, and he has not wept. I agree .with him that the members of the Labour party, especially those who have not been Ministers, have no occasion to weep. If ever a political party had a good turn done to them it was done to the Labour party when it was displaced from power. In my opinion, it was a bad piece of tactics. I think that those who, to-day, call themselves fusionists forced the position too quickly. If the Fisher Government had been kept in power by an alliance with what was then known as the Deakinites they would have had to do what their allies told them. But they are liberated from all that, arc can now attack the Ministry, live up to their ideals, which the honorable member for Barrier referred to so pathetically, with&#39; great cheapness to themselves and at no cost to any one, and parade their high virtues, as they never neglect to do, at the next election.

          <para class="block">Barrier is to be complimented for another reason. He went out of the beaten track. On each side of you, sir, there is a most intricate instrument. I looked at them yesterday and on the previous nine days. They are put in those positions for the purpose of registering the humidity of the atmosphere. Every time I looked at the instruments after listening to the Opposition, the register was &#34;Very dry.&#34; I am certain, however, that during the last speech the dryness was not quite so apparent. My honorable friends used the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> every time, and that no doubt accounts for the dryness. It has been quoted from by every  speaker  on that side, except the honorable member for Barrier, who gave the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> a turn. Too many honorable members on the other side have been leaning on what the newspapers have said. When it suits the idealists on the other side they tell me not to believe the newspapers, but they can themselves use extracts with a good deal of avidity and force. The writers on the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> are very much like politicians. They accuse politicians of speaking with their tongue in their cheek, but I, a humble politician, accuse the journalists of writing very often with their tongue in their cheek. What the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> has said on one occasion it will depart from on the next occasion. In this age of enlightenment, with easy access to the electors from the public platform the average politician need not fear the press. This is not a pressridden or press-directed age. The journalists certainly take up certain lines of public thought, and just as it suits them they present their views ito &#39;the public. But for members of the Labour party to shelter themselves behind the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is a sign of weakness, an admission that they are prepared to use the old weapon of party warfare just the same as do those whom they have replaced. Suppose, said the honorable member for Barrier, that at Gympie the honorable member for Wide  Bay  had made a speech for the purpose of securing immunity from opposition here, what would have, been said of him? That sounds very well until it is properly analyzed. The honorable member for Wide Bay could not have said any more at Gympie than he did say, and he could have said no less, because the Gympie speech was only a repetition of what the Labour Leagues of Australia had said two years before. Probably the language in which it was expressed was chosen by the honorable mem ber, and by some of the members of his Cabinet, but I do hot think that I am doing the honorable member any injustice when I congratulate him upon the Gympie speech as an evidence of his powerful memory in being able to repeat so well for the electors the previously-expressed intents of the Labour Leagues. The pathos of the remarks of the honorable member for Barrier approaches very closely to bathos, when we remember that the honorable member for Wide Bay could not, in announcing the policy of his Government, depart from what had already* been written down for him by the Labour Leagues of Australia. </para>

              <para>- No; the honorable member would have us believe that he and other honorable members on the other side are self-reliant. Honorable members opposite are buttressed outside by a very powerful organization. &#39;Their programme was an electors&#39; programme. I must admit that, coming as it did from the people to the politicians, no one could cavil at it. Unfortunately, the reverse of that course is followed on this side. I admit that candidly, both as regards the Deakinites or the allies of the honorable member for Parramatta. What honorable members on&#39; this side lack unmistakably is a welldefined organization. They may think that by calling up their financial resources, and beating the press drums, they will  effect  a victory, but, with the exception of one or two unimportant organizations, the party on this side, particularly in view of the programme they have submitted, have no powerful outside organization to support them. Honorable members opposite are indeed very &#39;fortunate in one sense, seeing that they have a very powerful organization clamouring for their&#39; return, insisting upon their privileges, and excusing their mistakes. But they must pay the full price for that, and the full price is the loss of personal freedom. The leagues and Labour Conferences direct their policy. I do not say that they object to the policy, because I know they take a part in framing it, but for the assistance of the disciplined force outside that fights their battles, holds their seats for them, and make excuses for them,  they  must, as individuals, pay the price. The honorable member for Barrier has said that honorable members on this side hold up the picture only of those who are well housed and well fed - the wealthy  classes.  That is a statement which every honorable member on this&#39; side, who has any manhood in him, must resent. The utterances of the honorable member for Barrier represent the height of insolence and impudence in political life. When the honorable member says that we are concerned only about the well-housed, well-fed, and wellclothed, he will allow me to say, &#39; without the slightest restriction on my personal inclinations, that there is hardly a member, on the other side who is not possessed of more of this world&#39;s goods than <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> am. </para>

              <para>- And I shall say it again. I resent the statement of the honorable member for Barrier that members on this side are the advocates only of the wellhoused and the well-dressed. Humanitarianism is not confined to members of the Labour party. There are members of the Opposition who are as avaricious as are any honorable members on this side. There are many honorable members opposite who are as desirous of improving their personal position as are honorable members on this side. </para>

              <para>- I am replying to the actual statements made by the honorable member. I am not dealing with extracts from the newspapers. Ministerialists can defend themselves, but I take the honorable member&#39;s remarks as personal to me, and I defend myself. As a native of Australia, I think so well of my country, and of the class from which I come, that I am glad to be able to say that the Labour party of to-day is not the Labour party of twentyyears ago. The Labour party of to-day is not the Labour party in which the honorable member for Parramatta was such a prominent figure. I agree with the expressions of regret by the honorable member for Barrier that the honorable member for Parramatta has, apparently, removed himself from the direction of those for whom he was fighting. </para>

              <para>- No, and I should not ask the honorable member for Parramatta to do that. The Labour party of to-day have, for some time past, been trying to become the Liberal party in the Commonwealth. Twenty years ago the members of the Labour party put on no Liberal uniform. To-day it is only the ardent Socialists in their ranks, who -take up the position that the party occupied twenty years ago. The fact is the present Labour party should always be designated by their correct title as the &#34; Political Labour party.&#34; They are becoming a political force, and I do not blame them on that account. If they had been permitted to remain on this side, assisted by the Deakinites, they would actually haVe been the Liberal party in Australia. They were drifting into that position. But, placed in Opposition, they have, according to my judgment, escaped very serious consequences. Their Socialist brethren, the advance guard&#93; the propagandists of the Labour movement to-day, were hesitating as to whether they should leave them or not. I feel that the more ardent spirits in the party should be delighted that they are now in Opposition, and able to&#39; carry on the forward movement. The force they commanded would have been surrendered if they had remained on the Government benches backed up by the Deakinites. Now they -are again in a position in which they can fulfil their destinies, and take up the work of their brethren of twenty years ago. I am willing to admit that, assisted bv their organizations, honorable members opposite have done good work in the political education of the people. The honorable member for Barrier complained that they were not assisted by a mighty press and mighty platform orators, and in doing so the honorable member decried the very organizations to which he belongs. If there are speakers with passion, and orators with conviction and power on the public platform, they are to be found in the Labour Leagues to-day. They are skilled in parliamentary warfare, and are not children. It is of little use for the honorable member for Barrier to say that they have &#39; not the assistance of a mighty press and &#34; powerful speakers. At the last election the Labour party made strong appeals to the emotions of the electors, whereas the a,nti- Socialists had a coldblooded policy of analysis, which made no appeal to the electors. Though it may have, been well suited to the temperament and ability of such people as the honorable. member for Flinders, it was. not a policy that was calculated to carry votes at the ballot-box. At the next election, so far as I am personally concerned, I shall take good care that an -appeal to the emotions of the electors is not neglected. Last time some of us had to fight with one hand tied behind us. I am not whining about that, but the same will not occur at the next&#39; election. When we are all on an equal footing in that respect it will be found that in districts where candidates like myself are well known, and where their political lives have been before the electors for their scrutiny for many years, the Labour candidates will not have so easy a time of it as they imagine. I do not care to put matters in a boastful way, but I must be pardoned for saying that I challenge any man in the Opposition ranks to dispute the attitude that I have maintained throughout my political life in regard to social and Liberal legislation. The Labour party, I have no doubt, mean well; some cf them think well ; and a great number of them in the . Parliament of the Commonwealth mouth well. But at the same time I consider that the Labour party do an injury to their own cause in the way in which they sometimes picture matters to the electors. They draw fancy pictures of the contentment _ that reigns in the homes of people at Potts Point and Toorak as compared with the condition of things in the homes of the poor. But I venture to say that there is far more discontent in the homes of the wealthy than is generally realized. I have no fear of the consequences when I make an appeal to the class of people to whom I belong. </para>

              <para>- I am &#34;on my own.&#34; Since the honorable member interrupts me, I may remark that I cannot understand why the Labour party should draw the line at the honorable member for Hume. Why should he not be opposed, as well as other members? If he is a good man from the Labour party&#39;s point of view, let him put on the uniform. Indeed, I do not think it will be very long before we shall see him in the uniform of Labour, and wearing a marshal&#39;s insignia of office. Of course, he will not be an ordinary private; he will be an officer. </para>

          <para>I regret to have to mention a personal matter. I have been subjected to a good deal of misrepresentation at the hands of honorable members opposite for reasons which I cannot exactly understand. I do not desire, for my own part, to indulge in personal attacks. On several occasions recently I have hadto interject, in contradiction of statements which I considered to be opposed to the facts of the case. To-night the honorable member for Barrier made certain observations, which were absolutely unnecessary, unless&#34; his desire was to say something that he knew would pain me. He knew that my feelings would be hurt if he attributed statements to me of a certain character concerning a friend of mine who was at the head of the Government at the time he. referred to. The honorable member said that on the 5th July, 1907, when the honorable member for Hindmarsh was speaking, I interjected: &#34;Why do you not attack the Prime Minister?&#34; whereupon the honorable member for Barrier alleges that he replied: &#34;What! attack a sick man?&#34; Now, as  a  matter of fact, I have looked up <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the date mentioned, and find that there is no observation by the honorable member recorded in it. If the honorable member made that observation, it is not reported, &#34;and I have no recollection of it myself. I  think that if it had been said concerning me I should have said something in reply. Now, fortunately, the day in question is  clearly in my recollection. It was the 5th July. 1907. On that day the honorable member for Kalgoorlie made some remarks adverse to me politically, principally in regard to my actions during the general elections in Western Australia. While the honorable member for Kalgoorlie was speaking I had a message from the Prime Minister; the honorable member for Ballarat, that he wished to see me in his room. I went there, and talked with him for a long time. The matters we discussed had relation to business that he had undertaken in London. I always had a suspicion that the Prime Minister sent for me because, perhaps, he thought that I should say something disagreeable in reply to the remarks of the honorable member for Kalgoolie. I mentioned that suspicion to my honorable friend, the member for Eden-Monaro. Now I find that on the  5th  July the Prime Minister was present in this House. That bears out my recollection, which is in accord with the records of the House. I certainly had no intention of diverting attacks to the Prime Minister when I said: &#34;Why -do you not attack the Prime- Minister?&#34; What I was thinking of was that no one had been more severe in referring to the methods and organization of the Labour party than the Prime Minister had been. That is known to every one. Therefore, I wondered why the members of the Labour party should always be directing their attacks at me, who had not . referred to their methods of organization to such an extent. Having that in mind, I made the remark which has been quoted. But I certainly do not remember anv one saying : &#34; Do not attack a sick man.&#34; I find that the Prime Minister was present, although I know he was not very well on the  3rd, 4th,  and  5th  July. It is very unfair that the despicable meanness of desiring to attack a sick colleague should have been attributed to me, and the remarks of the honorable member for Barrier have given me great pain. I should be ashamed to attack one who was ill, and more especially an old personal friend and colleague. </para>

          <para>I desire to say, on behalf of every member of the Cabinet, that we sincerely regret the step which has been taken by the right honorable member for Swan. He is a gentleman who is esteemed throughout Australia, having held office for many years as Premier of the State of Western Australia, and having been a member of a Commonwealth Ministry, and a colleague of many of the present Ministers almost. ever since Federation began.  His  relations with the members of the Cabinet individually have been most harmunious, in fact, I may say, in rebuttal of statements which have been circulated at various times, that the harmony has never been disturbed. We have been a united family^ as a Cabinet should be. There are, of course, occasions when Ministers differ, as they must when their principles compel them to do so ; but, although there have been slight differences of opinion, there has never been acrimony in the relations between the right honorable member for Swan and his late colleagues. That fact makes it the more regrettable that he has left us at this time. In view of his past career, and the work he has done for Australia, not only as a politician, but as an explorer of the interior of the Continent, a very large number of people must also regret his determination. It is no doubt an inconvenient time for him to leave, but I am sure that his relations with Ministers will continue as cordial and as sympathetic ns they have been in the past. </para>

The speeches of honorable members opposite in which  I  have heen so continually charged with having deserted my chief when he was ill, have been so painful to me, ascribing, as they did, conduct quite foreign to my nature, and absolutely without any foundation, that I have felt it&#39; necessary to make this personal explanation. </para>

              <para>- Your ruling, sir, will perhaps curtail somewhat my remarks. The honorable member&#39; for Swan has read a statement I made when I was acting for the then Prime Minister. I was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> to act for him when he was ill, and it was at that time the honorable member for Swan resigned his position as Treasurer. I endeavoured, and, at least one other colleague endeavoured, to induce him not to resign under the circumstances. </para>

I shall not now quote the words I used in Sydney, but I shall probably quote them many times in the future.

            <para>. - As soon as the correspondence is completed, I shall have pleasure in laying it on the table. At present it is passing between the States rather than with the Commonwealth, but will no doubt lead to further communication to the Commonwealth from the Premier of New South Wales, who acts on behalf of the States as a whole. As to any instructions supposed to have been given to the member of the Government who is to attend the Imperial Defence Conference, a member of a Cabinet, under such circumstances, has never, in my experience, received instructions in writing from his colleagues. He proceeds to the Mother Country as a member of the Government to attend a confidential, consultative Conference ; and in the course of that Conference he will, if necessary, consult his colleagues*. When he has advised his colleagues as to any action to be taken here, it- will then be necessary to consult Parliament before effect can be given to the conclusions we shall arrive at, after full consideration of the representations made to us. </para>
