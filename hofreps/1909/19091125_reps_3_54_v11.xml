                        <para>- In view of the refusal of the Newcastle Coal Combine to meet the miners in open conference, and the fact that the existing strike is prejudicial to Inter-State trade and commerce, causing disastrous unemployment, depreciating the value of property and increasing the cost of living, will the Government during the present session introduce the legislation necessary to bring all industrial disputes under Commonwealth jurisdiction, thus enabling them to operate industries during the continuance of strikes? </para>

                        <para>- It is rather late in the session to propose an amendment of the Constitution in the direction suggested. I do not think there would be time to deal with the present strike, even if such an amendment were made. The Government is following very carefully what occurs at Newcastle, with a view to ascertaining if the Federal sphere is touched at any point. </para>

                        <para>- The only purpose of the Bill is to define " income," so as to exempt payments from the Miners Accident Fund of New South Wales. The measure is being introduced to fulfil the promise made some time ago that these  payments should be put on the same footing as those of friendly and provident societies. We have not time to consider any further amendment of the law this session. It is only by arrangement with honorable members that it has been possible to have this Bill brought forward. </para>

                        <para>- Is the Minister of Defence aware that statements continue to be made in the Western Australian press to the effect that the inquest concerning the death of the cadet who was killed at Karrakatta by the explosion of a cartridge in his rifle was not satisfactory, so far as the question of defective cartridges is concerned. Has he seen the following statements :  - </para>

                        <para>Lieutenant Jennings also stated that cartridges varied in size, and it sometimes happened that a boy was unable to get them into the gun. </para>

And there is a gunsmith, long established in his business in Perth, who can testify to the number of times that rifles with jammed cartridges have been brought to him by cadets, and what he has done with them. </para>

                <para>That leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act to amend the definition of the word " income " in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act 1908. </para>
                <para class="block">The only object of the Bill is to explain the definition of "income." Under the principal Act that word does not include " any payment by way of benefit from any friendly society registered under any Act or State Act," nor does it include any payment made " during illness, infirmity, or old age by any trade union, provident society, or other society or association." It was thought by many persons that the words "other society or association " would cover other associations, especially the Miners' Accident Relief Fund in New South Wales, which is maintained by contributions from the men, the Government, and the proprietors. But a ruling of the Attorney-General has been given to the effect that the words do not admit of an exemption to payments from that association, and a hardship is said to have arisen, especially in Newcastle. Some time ago a promise was made by me to the honorable member for Newcastle that I would see whether something could not be done, and, as the result of my inquiries, I now ask leave to introduce a Bill for the one purpose only, and that is to place the Miners' Accident Relief Fund of New South Wales in exactly the same position as trade unions, provident societies, or other societies or associations of that kind : and to place payments from the fund in the same position as payments from a registered benefit or friendly society. From the Treasury point of view this is not a very important matter, but, of course, that does not make it any- the less important to those whose pensions have been reduced in consequence of the payments from the relief fund having been reckoned as income.I believe that at present only three persons are involved, and that their pensions are  affected to the extent of ,£13 each. If the Bill is passed, those persons, and, of course, others later on, will not be subjected to a deduction of .£13 a year. I have already explained that it would have been impossible for me to introduce the Bill, except by an arrangement with honorable members generally that no unreasonable time would be taken up in discussing what every one agrees is equitable, so long as the law remains as it is. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall offer no objection to the motion. I have been fortunate enough to see a draft of the Bill, which, I may mention, bears out the statement of the Treasurer, that the Government only purpose to amend the Act by inserting after paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of section 4 the words - " By way of allowance to the Miners Relief Act 1900 of the State of New South Wales." This is a mere technical alteration, the object of which is to enable persons who are receiving assistance under the State Act referred to to obtain the full pension if otherwise they are entitled thereto. I am sorry that the Treasurer has not seen fit to remove a number of other anomalies, which are obvious to any one. </para>

                        <para>- There may be other opportunities. If the Government have made up their minds not to deal with those anomalies at present, of course, it would be of no use for us to press the point. In the meantime, however, if the Treasurer desires it, we are bound to grant relief to this particular body, and await an opportunity when either this or another Government may be willing to remove the anomalies. Of late, the administration of the Act has been very faulty in some respects, as I think the Treasurer knows. In Maryborough, in my electorate, claims are accumulating Indeed, hardly a claim has been dealt with by the Commonwealth. I am sorry to say that that is the position, and I hope that the right honorable gentleman will call for inquiry. So far as I can assist him to get the Bill through all its stages without debate, I shall do so. </para>

                        <para>- I know that. I regret that the Treasurer has not included an elastic provision in regard to the definition of property. A few days ago, I brought under his notice a claim which had been made for an old-age pension in Queensland, where property to the value °f <inline font-style="italic">£3°</inline> had been assessed. I do not think that when the Act was under consideration here it was intended that so narrow a limitation should be adopted. The right honorable gentleman says that he cannot, and will not, extend the limitation. </para>

                    <para>. - Seeing that the Minister has found it necessary to secure an amendment of the Act, I regret to find that he has not thought fit to ask for greater powers, so as to allow hospitals and other public institutions to receive the amount payable to a pensioner while he is an inmate seeking nursing and other personal relief. I hope the right honorable gentleman can see his way to make that concession to benevolent institutions, which are all supported by public subscription. It would really be an assistance to the invalids if they were permitted to pass on their pensions to the institutions. The payment of ah old-age pension is stopped when the pensioner becomes ill, but I do not think that that was contemplated by the Parliament. Again I ask the Minister whether in this Bill he will not take power to grant to hospitals and other benevolent institutions the opportunity of collecting the pensions payable to pensioners when they get too ill to remain outside. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that power has not been taken to remedy the defect to which I have called attention. At present, there is a tax on benevolent institutions, and the pensioners feel that they are the recipients of charity, although the whole idea in passing the Old-age Pensions Act was to prevent anything in the nature of pauperism. </para>

                    (Grey)  [11.33).-  The Act, as it stands, penalizes the thrifty, and those who have received the most benefit under it are persons who have never done any good for themselves. Poor old people,' who, after the struggle of a lifetime, have managed to secure a roof, have the value of their dwelling deducted from the pension. The valuations are based on the local valuations for rating purposes; and we have to remember that there is often a high valuation with a low rate, so that the injustice is intensified. Only yesterday, I had a case before me in which a dwelling was valued at  £400,  though I venture to say that, if the property were put into the market tomorrow, it would not fetch  £200.  Then, again, the value of the little bit of furniture which an old person may have gathered together is also considered in the fixing of the pension ; and I regret that time will not permit of a review of the whole of the provisions of the Act, with a view to removing a large number of anomalies.

                    <para>. - I congratulate the Treasurer on the introduction of this measure, which will relieve a growing, if not a large, section of very deserving people of disabilities they at present suffer. The Miners' Accident Fund is largely in the nature of a friendly societies arrangement, and, to some extent, is an insurance fund. The difficulty arose owing to the fact that the fund is subsidized to some extent by the State Government; and the object of the Bill is to place this fund amongst the exemptions under the Act. The members of the fund will then enjoy the benefits extended to members of other similar funds which are' not subsidized by the Government. For my part, I' think it would be a good idea to encourage the State Governments to subsidize friendly societies and accident funds of this nature, because that would encourage the thrifty and industrious to help themselves. The Bill ought not to be limited in its operation to New South Wales, but should apply throughout the Commonwealth, so as to meet cases which may arise in other States. I am prepared to do all I can to assist in passing this Bill ; and I regret that the time at the disposal of Parliament is .so limited as to make it impossible to deal more extensively with the principal Act. </para>

I do not think that, as the Federal Parliament, we should legislate for particular States. Similar societies may be founded in other States; and, unless the Bill is made generally applicable, the members of such societies will be excluded from the full benefits of the old-age pensions system. . I think the Department has administered the Act in a very liberal way so far; and we have to remember that the machinery is new, and may, as yet, not work altogether smoothly. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member will not be here after the elections to receive any congratulations. The fact of such measure being necessary emphasizes what I have already said on several occasions, namely, that no old-age pensions scheme will be satisfactory until it is made universal. Whatever Ministry may be in power after the elections, I hope to see some scheme presented for pensions which shall include every member of the community. From some interjections made by the Minister of Defence when he was Leader of the Opposition, I take it that he is in favour of this idea. I do not know whether the honorable gentleman has abandoned every principle that he entertained when in Opposition ; but, when I . was speaking and pointing out that such a scheme would involve considerable expenditure, he interjected that the money would still be in the country. This, and some other interjections, led us to suppose that he was in favour of universal pensions. Then, the honorable member for Robertson has said, and I think quite rightly, that the genteel poor, who silently suffer, now pay towards a system, while their independent spirit will not permit them to accept a pension as a public charity. I think that that statement by the honorable member for Robertson was quite correct. I trust that the next Parliament will be able to carry a measure providing that old-age pensions shall apply universally. </para>

                    <para>.- I also am glad that an opportunity is afforded to the House to remedy some difficulties which have been experienced in the working of the Old-age Pensions Act. I notice that the order of leave permits the House to alter the definition of the word " income." But I think that we ought to go further than the Government propose. I should like to bring two cases under the Treasurer's notice. One is that of an old woman who was making a living by letting rooms. She is qualified by age and residence to receive a pension. But she grew too feeble to continue to attend to the rooms she was letting. Consequently, she became destitute. She applied for an old-age pension. The Department calculated the amount she had been able to earn in previous months, and based their decision on that amount ; although at the time of her application she was absolutely without means. Another case is that of an old man who had been earning his living, and who .was qualified for the pension in every way. He broke his leg. He was then unable to provide for himself. He was destitute. But because he had been able to earn his living for the previous year, the Department wanted to prevent him from getting the pension. I admit that these are matters of administration, but if the law is to be administered so unsympathetically, I can see no alternative but to insert a clause in this Bill which will prevent the Department acting in such a way. </para>

                    <para>.- This seems to be a favorable opportunity for the Government to disclose their intentions in regard to invalid pensions. It was understood that the section of the Act enabling payments to be made to invalids would be proclaimed and brought into force at the earliest possible moment. The assumption at present is, however, that there are not sufficient funds to meet the payment of invalid pensions., The Treasurer is well aware that there is a great necessity for the part of the Act referred to being brought into operation. </para>

                        <para>- I want to impress on the Government that an invalid pension is often more necessary than an old-age pension. The old people seldom have parental responsibility, the family having grown up; but an invalid may have little children dependent on him. A man in the prime of life contracts miner's complaint, and his family loses the breadwinner. The plight of such a man is even sadder than that of an old-age pensioner. I understand that the Government propose to borrow a certain sum of money for defence purposes. If that be the case, the Treasurer will be able to make more generous provision for old-age and invalid pensions. I really think that we ought to hear something from the right honorable gentleman as to the time when the Government propose to bring into force the invalid pensions section of the Act. </para>

                        <para>- Order ! I have called " Order " several times while interjections were being made. It is usually when interjections are being hurled across the chamber that the most disorderly expressions are used. I again ask honorable members to refrain from interjecting; and I also ask the honorable member for Barrier to withdraw the statement that a remark made by the Minister of Defence was " untrue." </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Hunter really said that anybody who spoke on this Bill was opposing something that was beneficial. He had no right to make such a remark. All I wish to say is that similar funds to the New South Wales fund mentioned in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 2 may be instituted in other States, and, in fairness, the Bill should be made wide enough to cover them. Cannot the Minister meet me on that point? </para>

I admit that it applies to a peculiar state of affairs in New South Wales, which does not obtain, so far as I know, in any other State, but it is a good and sound principle to encourage other State Governments to subsidize funds of this character. Cannot the Treasurer agree to add to new para-, graph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> the words " or any similar Act that may hereafter 6e enacted in any State of the Commonwealth " ? That will obviate the necessity of introducing similar amending Bills in subsequent sessions. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that what the honorable member suggests is necessary, because all the Acts in New South Wales that amend the principal Act are automatically incorporated with it. I remember reading both Acts, and believe the second amended the first only on the one point of varying the allowance, and also £Re proportion in which the State contributed to the fund. With regard to what the honorable member for Melbourne Ports and the. honorable member for Calare have said, as a matter of fact, there are no similar bodies in other States which it is necessary to bring under this provision. If we included more in the Bill than was actually promised, I do not know where we should stop. </para>

                        <para>- There may be some honorable members who might not care to vote against his amendment, and they are placed in a difficulty by his action. The honorable member is not treating honorable members quite fairly. Many instances have occurred in which the incomes of applicants for old-age pensions, at the time they made their applications, have been afterwards lost by them, and in many such cases the magistrates have been asked to re-investigate them, and make a fresh recommendation. The acceptance of this amendment would not do any more than is already being done in the administration of the existing Act. I am unable to accept the amendment because I do not wish to include in this Bill any more than I promised. It was introduced as I have said, to meet the special case of persons affected by a New South Wales Act. If I had not been able to assure the Prime Minister that it would not take five minutes to deal with it, he could not have given me the opportunity to bring it forward this morning. There are other provisions of the existing law which it might be well to amend, and other opportunities will no doubt occur which will afford the honorable member for Cook to do what he desires. I ask honorable members opposite to accept the Bill as introduced, and so enable me to carry out my promise, and at the same time not place me in a position of difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree that it does. The Government, through the Treasurer, have said that they cannot agree to any extension of the provisions of this Bill, and I agree that it was understood that when this matter was brought forward, there should be no attempt to debate the main question. The anomaly referred to by the honorable member tor Cook is one which can be met by administration. A person seventy years of age may be earning his living, and may suddenly break down. Under the strict reading of the Act, he would not be entitled to a pension until nearly twelve months afterwards. That would be grossly unfair, but I understand from the Treasurer that such cases can be dealt with by administration, and we have the right honorable gentleman's word that they will be dealt with in that way. In the circumstances, I ask the honorable member for Cook not to press his amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to oppose the Bill, but I should like to say that I think the clause would be improved by the omission of the last line, and by making the second last line read, " by way of allowance from any Miners' Accident Relief Fund subsidized by the State Parliaments." That would meet the difficulty in New South Wales, and would be free from the objection which I have to the clause as it stands, that it refers to a particular State. I am opposed to the enactment by this Parliament of special legislation affecting any one State, and to references to the legislation of a particular State. </para>

It is proposed to reconsider clause 19 because of the amendment carried by the honorable member for Gippsland. I have seen the honorable member, and he quite realizes that a. mistake was made in inserting his amendment. The honorable member is quite willing that it should be altered. Clause 33 is to be reconsidered merely in order to correct a drafting error ; the word " alteration " appearing in the Bill instead of the word " attestation." </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to direct the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to the clause providing that a person who disturbs a political meeting, in certain circumstances, may be sent to some place of detention seven miles away from the polling place at which he would ordinarily record his vote, in order that he might be able to take advantage of the postal voting provisions. I suggest that it might be necessary to make some amendment of the clause, because I understand that under the Constitution a prisoner is not allowed to vote. </para>

I would remind the Minister that, although the Bill-'ILs originally introduced provided that persons having reason to believe that they would not be within seven miles of a polling booth on election day should be entitled to vote 'by post, that limitation was reduced to five miles. In the circumstances, I think that we ought also to amend in the same way the new clause to which I have alluded.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller.</inline> - I intend to have the matter dealt with in another place </para>

I have since consulted with the honorable member, who realizes the difficulties that are likely to arise under that amendment. An elector moving from one division to another, under the clause as amended, would have to reside in that division for at least a month, in order to be entitled to vote for the House of Representatives, whereas there would be no such condition imposed upon his recording a vote for the Senate. I therefore move, with the consent of the honorable member for Gippsland - </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that it is fair to the Committee that the Minister should accept a proposal at one moment, and oppose it the next. In the present instance, he approved of the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Barrier, but now, merely because a member of the Opposition has objected to it, he declares that he is quite willing to strike it out. I think that the cabmen are just as much entitled to consideration as are any other persons in the community. In many districts it would be very difficult for electors to get to the polling booths if they were not provided with vehicles. Consequently, it would be better to say, without any qualification, that candidates shall be at liberty to employ them. </para>

                        <para>- We are not children. Nobody can seriously urge the contention put forward1 by the honorable member. It was unfair of the honorable member for Balaclava to say that the Minister was playing into the hands of the Opposition. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie acted upon his own initiative in this matter. He did not consult the Minister. Of course, we all know that votes are decided in this Chamber by the position which is taken up by the Minister who happens to be in charge of the particular measure occupying our attention. When a division occurs, the bells are rung, and honorable members troop into the chamber, not knowing what is taking place, and caring less. Last night we witnessed the extraordinary spectacle of a number of honorable members entering the House and taking their seats on the side occupied by the Minister. Then, when he moved to the opposite side of the chamber, they immediately followed him. The Minister of Home Affairs accepted the proposal of the honorable member for Barrier, because he said that it did not interfere with any vital principle of our Electoral Act. It is a. pity that he does not take up the same position now. I agree with the honorable member for Balaclava that a candidate should be permitted to spend any portion of the .£100 to which his electoral expenses are limited upon the hire of cabs or other vehicles to convey electors to the polling booths. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret that the Minister has agreed to the proposal of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie. A long debate took place upon the amendment which I submitted the other evening, and the honorable gentleman knew a week before that that amendment was to be moved. It was printed and circulated, and the Minister declared his willingness to support it. Now, however, he suddenly comes forward with the strange political doctrine that he does not regard that amendment from the stand-point of whether it is good or bad, but simply from that of whether the numbers are for or against it. I think that if he regards it as right he should support it; and that he should oppose it if he deems it to be wrong.- But he has openly told us that that is not the way in which our Parliamentary business is to be conducted. </para>

                        <para>- I can only apologize to the Minister for having so utterly misunderstood him. I certainly thought that he had accepted the proposal of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, because the numbers were against him. Of course, it is a good thing to be on the side of the big battalions, but I scarcely anticipated that the Minister would have made such an open declaration in that connexion. I now understand that he intends to support the retention of the clause' in its present form. </para>

I need only point the honorable member to the list of the original division upon that proposal.

                    <para>. - I voted for this proposal before, and shall vote for it again, because my opinions remain unchanged. I am glad that the Minister intends to stand by his original position, but I should like to know why so many other honorable members have changed their views. They must have made some discovery, though we have not been told what it is. Cabs are used at elections, and will continue to be used, but if the provision in the Bill is allowed to stand, the cost of hiring them will have to be accounted for in the return of electoral expenses, and the wealthy members of the party opposite feel that they will spend £100 on the hire of halls, advertising, scrutineers, and in other directions, and therefore wish the cost of vehicles to be excluded. In my opinion, when vehicles are used, they should be paid for out of the <inline font-style="italic">£,100</inline> which each candidate is permitted to expend. The Labour candidates in South Australia will be able to get all the cabs that they need without increasing their election expenditure beyond the limit allowed by the Act. This proposal has not been made in the interest of the purity of elections, but to promote corruption, by allowing something to be done which the law does not contemplate. I shall not be a party to that. I do not wish to make the hypocritical pretence that cabs are not used. Every political party uses them. </para>

                        <para>- On the last occasion, the honorable member had not to contest his seat. I did not use a vehicle of any description at the last election, and only on one occasion have cabs been used in connexion with contests at which I was a candidate. But in South Australia, cabs have been used illegally at every Commonwealth and State election. There has not been a breaking of the Act, but it has been evaded. Friends lend their vehicles, or pay for the hire of .vehicles, no one knowing what vehicles are so paid for. For every paid vehicle that has been used to assist a Labour candidate, there have been a dozen unpaid vehicles used. But, on the other side, I have known all the cabs in Adelaide to be engaged on behalf of a person who was prepared to pay any fine that might be imposed for an evasion of the law. That was done to prevent Labour candidates from obtaining vehicles. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cresswell</inline> could have said how it was arranged. The cabs were paid for by the National Defence League. </para>

                        <para>- Because I do not object to the use of vehicles so long as the cost is included in the candidate's return of expenses. But if the proposal now before the Committee be carried, I shall, at the first opportunity, move, in the interest of the purity of elections, that the use of vehicles be not permitted. Honorable members opposite intend to reverse their votes in order to give the wealthy an unfair advantage over the poor. At any rate, no o':her reason has been stated. I do not object to the use of free vehicles. In my own electorate, some electors have to travel a mile and a half to get to a polling booth, and that is too far to expect aged persons to walk. But it is not necessary to engage all the cabs in the city to assist in the return of a candidate, as was done in Adelaide on one occasion. </para>

                    <para>.- It would seem, from the speeches we have heard, to be almost as hard to get to the electoral poll as it is to reach the North Pole.

                        <para>- The honorable member has just mentioned a case in which the law was evaded. I hope that he will not in future lend himself to anything of the kind. The hiring of cabs at election time may be a source of abuse. It is, as I know, a great relief to poor candidates to have election expenditure limited to ^£100. I am a poor man compared with many who sit opposite. It is marvellous how they accumulate money. But such is the generosity of my nature that I should be glad to employ every cabman in my electorate at double fares would my pocket stand it. Of course, no cabman would come to a candidate and say, " If you do not engage my cab, the seven votes in my family will be cast against you." But some one else might do it. </para>

                        <para>- I am showing how pressure might be brought to bear on a candidate. Of course, there would be no guarantee that the votes would be cast for him if he engaged the cab, and possibly the cab would be used to convey to the poll electors who intended to vote against its hirer. If my friends choose to carry electors to the poll, that is their concern. I do not propose to encourage it, but I cannot prevent it. Some honorable members seem to think that there are none but metropolitan constituencies, whereas in the country electors have often to travel many miles to get to the poll. I have a great respect for the Minister, but I cannot understand his present position. I hope that we shall have a majority against the proposal, so that the hiring of cabs may be included in election expenses. </para>

                        <para>- These changes of opinion in the Ministerial party are remarkable and significant. I have never had a cab in my service at election time. I have been afraid to employ vehicles. There are those who may do things with impunity, while others are prosecuted. Undoubtedly, there is one law for one class and another law for another class. While a prosecution for the evasion of the Act might not be successful, the proceedings might be very expensive for the candidate concerned. The honorable member for North Sydney, who says that he has never used cabs at election time, has had no need to do so, because he has not had to fight seriously for his seat. Even had there been a fiercely contested election, he would probably not have needed cabs, because there would have been any number of private vehicles placed at his service, as is always the case with a candidate supporting the Fusion Government or the Conservative interest. At the last election, no fewer than  100  vehicles were at the disposal of my opponent, whereas I had not half-a-dozen. In certain parts of the Commonwealth, the weather, at the time of the elections, is not only likely to be extremely hot, but very wet; and it is absolutely necessary that candidates should be in a position to hire vehicles without infringing the "law. As a matter of fact, the present law simply leads to evasion ; and people should be permitted to do openly what they are certain to do surreptitiously. </para>

We have heard a good deal about corruption, but, while I' cannot see any possibility of this in the case of the halls, I can quite conceive how much could arise in the hiring of cabs. Halls are an absolute necessity in large electorates, in order that the candidates may make their views known. </para>

The honorable member who submitted the amendment seemed anxious to provide for his own particular requirements, while .ignoring the views of others whose circumstances we all desire to meet. We have had a great deal of experience now, and we should so amend the law as to afford the best means of obtaining the sense of the people at an election. I shall support the exclusion of the provision in regard to cabs, although I voted for it the other day, under the belief that honorable members opposite were desirous of being fair and reasonable in regard to the hire of halls. </para>

                <para>Air. SPENCE (Darling)  [2.35].-  I shall support a reversion to the old practice; and I understand that the Minister has declared that he will not oppose the amendment, or, in other words, that it is quite open to the Committee to support it if we so choose. I have no great patience with electors who live in town, within a mile or a mile and a half of a polling booth, and yet demand motor cars and cabs. I have always been a country resident, and know of the immense distances that electors have to travel independently of vehicles. The reason for stopping the hire of cabs was that, otherwise, the wealthy candidates -would occupy a privileged position. We have heard of cases where all the vehicles might be "cornered," and either not used at all, or for one side exclusively. To allow unlimited expenditure is to favour wealthy candidates ; but we know that, in the country districts, very many people own vehicles of their own, while in town there are trams and trains at the disposal .of all. It is admitted that there is a great deal of apathy on the part of the electors,' and we remember the evidence given by officials of organizations, to the effect that people would not trouble to vote unless their fares were paid, and they were enabled to ride, not by omnibus, but by cab. What is the use of such electors until they are educated up to an intelligent interest in public affairs? I do not think any great evil arose under the old method, and, if any fraud does arise, it is the duty of the Department to put a stop' to it. Every amendment in a Bill of this character ought to be treated by the Minister as this has been - that is, left to the good sense of the Committee, and not made a party matter. </para>

                    <para>.- Like most honorable members, I find it quite difficult enough to keep my expenses within the  .£100,  without taking a step which would add very considerably to the trouble. But I do not believe in excluding cabmen from an opportunity of deriving what benefit they can at election time. There may be honorable members who do not require to engage halls, as we have to do in the metropolitan areas, and who may desire to devote a portion of their expense to vehicles; and I certainly should not support any proposal which would deprive the cabmen of any advantage they can so derive. </para>

                    <para>The use made of motor cars and other vehicles on election days has now reached such a point that the practice is resented on several grounds ; it has become a great cause of annoyance and expense to motor owners to be asked and expected to send cars great distances to elections where they are likely to be roughly used ; it has become an unworthy practice to bribe voters by offering them a motor drive to and from the poll ; it has even been used as an argument against increasing polling facilities that free rides in vehicles are now provided to all and any. </para>

If the friend of a candidate, on polling day, provides vehicles for the use of his supporters, will the expenditure so incurred on behalf of the candidate be regarded as an illegal outlay ? So much of this is done, that it would be well to have a clear interpretation of the law before we finally dispose of this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- It is perfectly true that the honorable member, as a representative of New South Wales, in submitting the amendment of the amendment was endeavouring to safeguard the interests of that State.  The amendment moved 'by the honorable member for Batman does not commend itself to me, and I trust that it will be rejected by the Committee. The honorable member stated that he was led to submit it merely because of a desire that the whole question should remain unsettled. If ever there was a question that ought to be settled by this Parliament, it is that of the site of the Federal Capital. In view of the reports that have been submitted to us, it is ripe for settlement, and in the interests of the people, as well as in the interests of the proper conduct of business in this House, it should now be finally dealt with. Does the honorable member for Batman think that the people of Australia, to whom he desires to refer this question, are, or ever could be, in a better position to determine it than are honorable members of this Committee? </para>

The various sites have been examined by experts, whose reports have been presented to Parliament, and the Committee is now in possession of the fullest information with regard to them. The various physical features of the proposed site, dealt with in this Bill, have formed the subject of elaborate reports by experts, and the Parliament of New South Wales has given every facility to the Commonwealth Legislature to bring this matter to a final issue. We have gone far beyond the provisions of the Constitution, as to the area to be set apart for the purposes of the capital. The Government of New South Wales have given us, not 100 square miles, as they might have done under the Constitution, but 900 square miles, and, in addition, 580 square miles, covering full water rights over the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers. They have also given us access to the sea, and the right to construct a railway from the Capital Site to Jervis Bay. In addition to that, at Jervis Bay an area of 2 square miles has been handed over to the Federation, a grant which was never contemplated by the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; does the honorable member desire us to obtain another large Federal territory there? All that we asked in that respect was that we should be given access to the sea, arid that request ha:, been granted, under the agreement entered into between the Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales. In addition, New South Wales has given us an area of 2 square miles at Jervis Bay to provide for our requirements at the port. When it was suggested that it would be necessary for the Commonwealth to obtain from the Snowy River water power required for electrical purposes, the Government of New South Wales responded by giving us authority to construct whatever works are necessary to carry from the Snowy River to the site of the Federal Capital the necessary power. In all these matters New South Wales has done all that could be reasonably asked or expected of her. And now, although this question has been discussed again and again during the last nine years, it is proposed, in order to prevent a final settlement, that the whole matter shall be submitted to a referendum of the people. The people of Australia could never be in a position - even if it were possible to submit this question to a referendum - to deal with this matter as this Parliament can deal with it. The honorable member for Batman has admitted that his sole object in submitting this amendment is to keep the question still unsettled, and I hope that the Committee will not support him.

                    <para>- - In view of the fact that the Government, and most of their supporters, a few weeks ago, implored us to trust the people, and to refer to them the very intricate question of an alteration of the Constitution, in regard to the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, I am exceedingly surprised to  hear the Minister of Home Affairs declare that the people cannot be in anything like so good a position as we are to decide this question of the site of the Federal Capital. The decision of this question would be child's play compared with the decision of the intricate constitutional question. Honorable members blow hot and cold about the referendum, just as it suits them. I regret that advantage was taken of the absence of opponents of the measure on the Oodnadatta trip to get it past the second-reading stage: The creation of the Fusion party has caused a reversal of opinion amongst many of the members who are now supporting the measure. During the last ballot the honorable members for Bourke, Ballarat, Richmond, Fawkner, Swan, Darling Downs, Fremantle, Kooyong, Coolgardie, Maribyrnong, and Wimmera cast their votes against the Yass-Canberra site, but on the division on the second reading of the Bill voted for it. So far as I know, they had no reason for changing their views, except a desire to please the powers that be. When, after the selection of Dalgety by the Parliament a measure was introduced to define the metes and bounds of the proposed Federal territory, those who are now supporting the Bill were not in any hurry to have the matter settled. What they wished for then was an amendment which would secure the choice of another site. The Bill had been introduced to honestly give effect to the decision of the Parliament that the Capital should be located within  17  miles of Dalgety. When another ballot was arranged for, only one vote was cast for Canberra, and none for Lake George. </para>

                        <para>- I am not now dealing with the Senate. The House determined that whatever site might be chosen in the Yass-Canberra district, it should not be Can berra. Does this Bill give effect to that decision? Certainly not. It seems to me that we should be allowed to take another ballot. When the matter was last before the House the Prime Minister stated distinctly that there would be that opportunity. He said, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> Vol. xlviii., page  2540,  referring to myself </para>

Except for a small area, the soil is barren, the scenic setting is "merely that of a poor type of Australian bush, the rainfall is deficient, and the water supply for a large city is inadequate.

                    speaks of the site as by no means ideal, but the best obtainable in the Yass-Canberra district. He says that drainage will present some difficulties, and that nowhere in the district can timber suitable for building purposes be obtained, while it is doubtful whether good building stone can be obtained locally in any large quantity. He tells us, too, that as a whole the district is not an agricultural one.

This is not a fulfilment of the promise given in the private canvass which induced many honorable members, including the honorable member for New England, and' the honorable member for Adelaide, to vote for Yass-Canberra. The Commonwealth could not even run out a jetty in Jervis Bay. </para>

The grant of land at Jervis Bay gives us no proper control over a port there. Moreover, from  a  Government point of view, the ballot decided that the site should be in the Yass-Canberra district, but not at Canberra. </para>

                        <para>- The House negatived the lesser. Canberra got only one vote on the first ballot, and in the other two ballots also ; the honorable member for Robertson voted faithfully for that site. Having selected a district called Yass-Canberra, we are presented to Canberra, which we are told, represents the wish of the House, and we are asked not to delay the matter. Every honorable member was in favour of our being granted a strip of land giving access to the coast ; but all we are getting is an easement in addition to what seems to me an absolutely barren spot - one of the most extraordinary looking areas that anybody ever saw on a map. I suppose it will be some years before we are able to shift to the Federal Capital ; and I do not envy the lot of honorable members, and still less do I envy the lot of the public servants, who will have to live in that God-forsaken spot ! </para>

                        <para>- Here is another admission from a Sydney member ! The honorable member for Lang supported a proposal for a referendum on the question of taking over the Northern Territory with a direct line, and also on the financial question ; but, in regard to the Capital site, he is altogether averse to such a proceeding. As a matter of fact, the Constitution should have provided either that the Capital should be anywhere in Australia, or anywhere in New South Wales; and the amendment would afford the people an opportunity of deciding where it should be. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that the  Capital site was not selected long ago is the fault of the people of Sydney and their representatives in this and the State Parliaments. The great proportion of honorable members were always willing to settle the question. But the members representing Sydney and its surroundings, and those immediately influenced by the interests of Sydney, have always voted against the settlement of the question in the way in which this House would be inclined to settle it. Because they could not get the Capital where they wanted it, they would not have it where the people of Australia wanted it. There has been the greatest amount of lobbying and underground engineering, as many of them have candidly admitted, in order to fix the site in such a way that the trade of the Capital will flow to Sydney, and Sydney only. </para>

                        <para>- It is far from being even the best place in New South Wales. We now offer the people of Sydney an opportunity to still further test the generosity of the people of Australia. Every benefit that could accrue from Federation has been gained by Sydney. The first question considered by some honorable members in this House is whether a proposal will benefit Sydney. Anything that will not have that effect is fought tooth and nail by every Sydney representative. We had evidence of that the other day when the question of the Northern Territory was considered. The representatives of Sydney came together shoulder to shoulder to fight against the almost ratified agreement for taking over the Territory from South Australia. Everything proposed in this House that does not suit Sydney and its environs is laughed at and thrown out if the opportunity occurs, but a great fight is put up by the men who represent that city, and I admit represent it ably, for everything that will materially benefit it, or add anything to its glamour. In this case we are offering them an opportunity to wipe out the hundred mile limit. I admit that I have hopes that if the hundred mile limit is wiped out the Capital will still not be in Sydney or nearer Sydney than is Canberra; but I am giving away that point so that we may take a referendum of the people of Australia as to where the Capital is to be. The representatives, the press, and the people of Sydney say that no one else has a right to be considered in the question of selecting the Capital Site. Have we come down to this, that after getting everything that is to be got from Federation, they are to claim that nobody but themselves has a right to a say in the matter? I arn fast coming to the conclusion that there is only one State in the Commonwealth - New South Wales - and that the sooner all the barriers are wiped out and Australia unified, with Sydney as its capital, the better it will be for the welfare of the Commonwealth, because apparently until that is accomplished, until Sydney rises paramount above every other city and has within its grasp the trade of all the other centres, it will never be satisfied. Like the daughters of the horse leech, it is always crying out for more. Although New South Wales is the only State that has gained anything from Federation, its representatives still refuse to give the people of Australia an opportunity to put a stop to one of the greatest wrongs to Australia ever perpetrated from a national stand-point. The- New South Wales members know well that not one phase of the whole question points to the fact that Canberra ought to be selected as the site of the capital, but they are strenuously fighting to get it, because they know that a Federal city placed there will never rise above the status of an ordinary village. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; on three occasions, and I can state, whether I am believed or not, that I have always endeavoured to deal with the question from an unbiased stand-point. I do not care how near the Capital is to Sydney, so long as the site is suitable. In view of the attitude of the Fusion, and the help which they will get on the question from members on this side, I recognise that it is hopeless to fight against the Bill. Those who are supporting Canberra have thrown over all the national spirit which they were supposed 10 possess. Just as the members of the Fusion party on the financial question have handed over to the States, and primarily to New South Wales, functions which ought to be retained by the National Parliament, so, on the question of the Federal Capital, which is expected to endure for ever, they, are pandering to the same feeling. How many members now on the Fusion side who voted for Dalgety, as against Canberra, and could not see one good point in the Canberra site, will be manly enough now to vote against this agreement, although they know that Canberra is unsuitable? I know that in this matter mine is like a voice crying in the wilderness.  If I thought it would do any good, I should be prepared to go on until the closure was applied, but it is useless to do so in a House composed as this one is at present. The matter will not be made a party question on this side, because the honorable members who represent New South Wales will fight for their own State. I do not blame them for .that; but the House has become, I will not say so corrupt, but so peculiar, that everything which the New South Wales section want for New South Wales they get by hook or by crook. I propose to make one last appeal to honorable members. Here is an opportunity offered by the honorable member for West Sydney to abolish the hundred mile limit. The honorable member for Batman and myself are willing to accept that proposal. We want to trust the people. Members on the Fusion side talked with their tongues in their cheeks about trusting the people on the financial question, but I am sincere in desiring to trust the people as to whether the Commonwealth is to be saddled for all time with a capital in a place which is not easy of access, either from the sea or the land, that never will be anything but a little village, and will never grow to such a size that it would finance itself in time to come, when the Federal Territory is nationalized in the true sense. There are men on the Fusion side who do not want that democratic ideal to be tested in Australia. They would not give us an opportunity to prove that the nationalization of land will be beneficial to the people, and they are, therefore, helping by their votes to commit this great crime on Australia. Will the representatives of Sydney for once give Australia a show, and not always confine themselves to interests within the narrow limits of their own capital? If they will not, the people of Australia ought to be allowed to take a hand in the question, and the representatives from other States who are blind to national considerations, - or whose vested interests incline them towards the Sydney view of the matter, ought to be dealt with by the electors in the manner in which they would speedily be dealt with if their constituents recognised the fact that they are dealing with the people's money, and not with their own. </para>

                    <para>- We have listened to one of those characteristic speeches which we are accustomed to hear delivered from the Victorian standpoint, expounded on this occasion by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. He has appealed to us to deal with the question in a truly Federal spirit. It is a strange thing that whenever we are asked by a certain newspaper, in fact, by all the newspapers published in. this city, to deal with matters in a truly national spirit, we find upon examination that their idea of a truly national spirit is a spirit which is thoroughly antagonistic to New South Wales in particular, and to the other States in general. Their idea of the Federal spirit is bounded on the west by Spencer-street railway station, on the east by the Federal Parliament House, and on the . north and south by the two sides of Collins-street. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports extends the boundaries of that narrow area somewhat, in order to include South Melbourne. If there is one State in the Commonwealth which more than another has displayed a truly Federal spirit, it is New South Wales, and in that she has been ably seconded and supported by Queensland and Tasmania, and to some extent by South Australia. </para>

                        <para>- There are some broad national minds in Victoria, but they are the exception to the general rule. That spirit is displayed only by those Victorian members who do not come under the baneful influence of Melbourne press dictation. Certain aspersions have been cast, not only upon New South Wales, but on the site for the Federal territory, which has already been approved by this House and approved for a second time by another place. We have been asked why Sydney should get the benefit of having the Federal Capital in New South Wales. In the first place, I do not know that Sydney will get any benefit from it; but if it does, why should it not? What reasonable ground can be put forward for saying that Sydney should not get any benefit from having the Federal Capital in New South Wales? Is that the truly national spirit of which those honorable members boast, and which they chide us for not showing? If that is the kind of national spirit that burns within their bosoms, it is about the narrowest form of it that could possibly be conceived. I do not know that any special benefit will accrue to Sydney from the location of the Federal Capital at Canberra. The representatives of other States have got everything that they asked for, and more. They have got more than they are entitled to under the Federal Constitution. Their views have been met in the most generous spirit by the Government and Parliament of New South Wales, who have in their generosity exceeded in the area made available what the Commonwealth was entitled under the Constitution to receive. Instead of confining the Federal territory to an area of 100 square miles, an area upwards of 800 square miles has been conceded. There was nothing in the Constitution about providing a Federal port, yet provision has been made to give the Commonwealth land sufficient for a railway down to the sea coast, and a Federal port from which the needs of the Capital could be supplied altogether independently of Sydney. A most unreasonable attitude has been displayed by some honorable members. As to the proposal that the question should be submitted to a referendum of the people, I would remind honorable members that that has already been done. And it is as the result of such a referendum that the provision as to the Federal Capital was put into the Constitution. The original proposal was that Sydney should be the Federal Capital, and it was only as a final concession to the representatives of other States that it was excluded from the area of selection. </para>

                        <para>- At the Conference of Premiers <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner desired that there should be inserted in the Constitution Bill a provision that the Federal Capital should be not less than 200 miles from Sydney. The proposed 200-miles limit was rejected as being too great, whilst it was thought that Moss Vale, which was then being talked about as a desirable location for a Federal city, being only 75 miles from Sydney. was too close, and ultimately as a compromise it was decided to insert in the Constitution Bill the provision that the site of the Capital should not be less than 100 miles from Sydney. That compromise was submitted to the people, and approved by them. All that is now asked is that the compact made with New South Wales shall be honoured. lt has been held in abeyance for nearly ten years. Every device has been resorted to by the Melbourne press and provincial minded politicians of other States to keep the Parliament sitting in Melbourne, . and prevent New South Wales from getting its rights under the Constitution. It was thought originally that the matter would be settled within five years of the establishment of Federation, yet we are still meeting in Melbourne, and, if some honorable members could have their way, we should be now as far as ever from a settlement of this question. As to the oft-repeated misstatements with regard to the water supply available at Canberra - a matter to which reference has again been made by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports - I desire to ask him and those who share his views, erroneous and jaundiced, why they have refrained from reading later reports upon the question by the most competent experts? Why do they take the report of a land surveyor who does not profess to be a water expert - a report which he was not asked to furnish - in preference to one submitted by an expert specially employed, and which gives a totally different result from actual scientific tests and calculations up to date? </para>

                        <para>- Dalgety 's water supply, apart from that obtainable from the Snowy River, is evidently no better than that available to Canberra, and probably not as good - since the Canberra has several rivers to draw, upon, as I will presently show. Honorable members persist in ignoring the fact that it was not proposed  to supply Dalgety with water from the Snowy River, and water supply is not the only thing to consider in connexion with selecting a site for a city. I would also remind them that if it is thought that the water power for electrical purposes within the catchment area of the site now before us, is insufficient, in spite of the assurances of expert engineers, it will be open to us, by means of 75 miles of wire, to draw on the Snowy River for that purpose just as easily for Canberra as for Dalgety. However, it will be unnecessary to do so. I wish now to read a statement by an eminent authority to counteract any wrong impression that may have been created by the statement of the ill informed honorable member for Melbourne Ports as to the alleged inadequacy of the Canberra water supply.

                    <para>A reference to the water supply of Yass-Canberra was made last night by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> A. Sussmilch in a paper entitled " Notes on the physiography of the southern tableland of N.S.W.," which he read before the Royal Society. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sussmilch</inline> admitted a low rainfall on the actual site of the Federal Capital, but maintained that it was not correct to carry the argument" further and expect a low rainfall along the Cotter, Naas, and Gudgenby Rivers, which would be the catchment for the Capital water supply. </para>
                    <para>He explained that the three localities which had been taken as averages for estimating the rainfall were to the east of the Kiandra-Murrumbidgee tableland, and by the time rain-producing clouds had crossed the tableland from the west much of the moisture was lost. The actual catchment area was in this tableland and would consequently catch the clouds before the moisture was lost. </para>

How then is it possible to believe that those who describe the Territory as a waterless desert, or insufficiently supplied with water, are in earnest? Nor are these all the figures.

It was felt that the site of the Capital ought to be left for ths Australian Parliament to choose.

Although it had been' arranged that the Constitution should be accepted1 in New South Wales, on an affirmative majority vote of 50,000, providing that the other States also accepted it, a Bill was passed through the State Legislature raising the minimum to 80,000. After the alteration to which I have referred, the right honorable member for East Sydney, who was at the time Premier of New South Wales, met the other Premiers in Conference, and they agreed to an alteration providing that the Capital should be in that State. The people of the State, or their representatives, were afraid to leave the matter open, because they thought that the people of Australia might, if they had a free choice, select </para>

                        <para>- Every State, including New South Wales, accepted the first draft Constitution, which allowed the Federal Capital to be located anywhere in Australia. I admit that I did not vote for the Bill. I regret that Parliament has its hands tied in this matter. To my mind, with the exception of Lyndhurst, Yass-Canberra is the worst site which we could choose, and I have seen all except the Upper Murray site, which some honorable members say was the best, though it had no chance, because of its nearness to Victoria. Such a consideration should not have been allowed to weigh with honorable members. The Constitution, unfortunately, provides that the Federal Capital must be within New South Wales, but, with that limitation, we should choose the best site available, even though it should be near the Queensland or near the Victorian border. I shall vote for the proposal of the honorable member for West Sydney, to give the people a chance to say whether they will accept the proposed site. Honorable members opposite urge that the people would be led away by the press, but those same honorable members were very anxious that another question should be submitted to the referendum - a question <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> which, not only the press, but State politicians, will have a large influence. Such a question as that cannot be settled on its merits by the people, whereas the selection of a capital site can. </para>

                        <para>- The two questions are quite different. The question of the capital site has 'already been voted on by the people, and it is our place to bring' the matter to a conclusion, without an amendment of the Constitution being necessary. The honorable member for Gippsland has recently taken to looking up the speeches of honorable members - has become a sort of scavenger for his party - and, while he doubtless provides very good " copy," and may serve certain party purposes, I do not think such a course leads to the perfecting of the measures which come before us. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Gippsland, despite his constant castigation of honorable members, was so far recreant to his duty as a member, as to allow the second reading of the Seat of Government Bill, introduced by the last Government, to pass without any demand for a division. If he regarded it as a serious question, why did he not call for a division, when the Bill was introduced by a Government, with which, as he has since shown by his votes, he was very much in sympathy ? After the second reading was passed, the honorable member moved an amendment on clause 2, which would have had the effect of altering the decision previously arrived at on the ballot. He was appealed to by the Prime Minister not to press the amendment, and he allowed it to be negatived on the voices. If the honorable member was particularly anxious, why did he not take an opportunity of testing the feeling of honorable members by calling for divisions on those two occasions? I admit that, on a second amendment, which he moved, he divided the Committee, and was defeated by forty-nine votes to eleven. I do not say that the honorable member was wrong in not dividing the House or the Committee, if he thought the question had been decided, and there is no doubt that the rejection of the second amendment he moved was an indorsement of the decision on the ballot. The question had been properly discussed and fought out. Those in favour of Dalgety advocated that site until they saw that the question had been finally settled ; and I take it that, on the previous occasion, as on this, those who voted for the second reading did not give up their right to endeavour to improve the measure as far as possible in Committee. The position last session is parallel with the position this session ; the question has been properly fought out and a decision arrived at to select Canberra. </para>

                    <para>-- The honorable member for Wimmera, even after an explanation I gave him, has not had the manliness or courage to state what that explanation was. When the second reading of a former Bill was proposed by the Labour Government, in order to carry out the decision of the House that the Capital should be in Yass-Canberra, I wrote out an amendment which afterwards was put to the vote, but while the debate was proceeding, I went to the table to confer with the then Minister of Home Affairs as to whether he would accept my amendment, and he referred me to the Prime Minister. The honorable member for Wide Bay came in at that time, and we were standing on the floor, when he asked me to sit down on the Treasury bench. As the honorable member for Wimmera knows", a private member cannot interject or be taken notice of if he is on the Treasury bench; and it was while I was sitting there that the question was put. I had arranged with the honorable member for Bass to insist on. a division if I were not there, but his was the only voice raised, and mine was silenced. I took the trouble just now, during the call for a quorum, to acquaint him with these facts, but, as I say, he has not had the manliness to place them before honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- I gave the honorable member credit for being as manly and fair a man as there is in the House, and I am sorry that I am mistaken in his character. The first amendment  1  moved was to strike out the words " hereby declared," with a view to inserting " after the grant or acquisition of territory for the Seat of Government within the Yass-Canberra; district shall be." There was a great divergence of legal opinions as to whether we could determine this site. The idea was that until the New South Wales Government had decided to grant us the site in a proper way, the declaration in favour of Yass-Canberra could not take effect. That was purely a matter of legal opinion ; and I allowed the amendment to be negatived on the voices, there being no necessity to force it to a division. But when the other amendment came on, providing for access to the sea and a port at Jervis Bay, I insisted on a division, notwithstanding that I was appealed to, not merely by the members of the Fisher Government, the present Minister of Home Affairs, and others, but also by my then leader, the honorable member for Ballarat. However, I had sufficient determination to insist on a division, and it comes with very ill-grace from the honorable member to suggest that I shirked a division on the second reading. The honorable member has already changed his opinion on the subject, and does not like to be told of the fact. As the right honorable member for East Sydney said the other day, honorable members opposite are doing a lot of thinking ; and, consequently, are becoming inconsistent; and they do not like their inconsistency brought before the public. At any rate, an honorable member, when he refers to' others, ought to be fair. I have never willingly .misquoted an honorable member, and certainly will never do so. It was the essence of unfairness for the honorable member to repeat his statement after I had taken* the trouble to explain how it was that I could not insist on a division. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to make a personal explanation. If the honorable member for Gippsland considers that the reason he has given for not calling for a division on the second reading is satisfactory, I shall leave the matter to himself. But if he had been watching, as he should have been, it seems to me that to get from the Treasury bench to a spot sufficiently out of their radius in time to call for a division, would not have been a difficult matter. </para>

Any honorable member who says that New South Wales has not benefited by the Commonwealth Tariff must know absolutely nothing about the extension of her manufactories and the additional employment which has been given in Sydney alone to thousands of men and women. To say that the purchasing power of a sovereign in Sydney has decreased to  14s.  is absolute fudge and nonsense. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid the honorable member is attempting a joke in an effort to help the honorable member for Lang. The picture which the honorable member for Lang drew of Yass-Canberra is about the biggest fake I have ever heard. The Federal spirit has been spoken of, but I yield to no one in my admiration for the beauty of Sydney, and its surroundings. I never go to Sydney without the greatest expectations of pleasure, and I never leave it without regret. At the same time, I must say that the Sydney men want to dominate Australia. They dare not let the Australian people have a chance tot settle this question by means of the referendum. The agreement arrived at by the right honorable member for East Sydney with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner and the other Premiers in this matter, after a conference in which the vilest huckstering and bartering took place, was never put before the people. The proceedings at that Conference were only equalled in vileness by the recent Premiers' Conference which met in Melbourne, and was ashamed to let the press in to hear what took place. Could anything be more contemptible than that bargaining on the part of the right honorable member for East Sydney, who said, "You must give me the capital in New " South Wales, or I won't join the Federation?" When the history of these times comes to be written, what will be said of the man who huckstered and bargained in that way to get the Capital for his own State ? I cannot recall any Federation where such a vile system was followed. In all my twenty years' experience of political life I never before saw such Tammany tactics as have been pursued in regard to the selection of the Yass-Canberra district so far as ear-wigging members is concerned. I was never so insulted in my life as I have been by continual solicitations and the using of means that were unfair and unjust between member and member, to influence my vote on this subject. However I may differ from the Treasurer on many points, I took his opinion, with that of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> with reference to Dalgety, and I cling to it still. This Parliament has no right in its dying hours to attempt to fix the Yass-Canberra site permanently on the people of Australia. So far as my vote can insure it, the incoming Parliament will be given the right to change what this Parliament does. The present Ministry, which is under the sway of New South Wales, is afraid to place it in the power of the people of Australia, by means of a referendum, to settle the question ; but I hold that no Ministry and no Parliament has the right to fix for all time upon a people either a Federal Capital or a law. When we have the referendum and the initiative, that will give the people the power to make laws independently of any Government, who shall say that the Australian people will not rise in their might and change the site of the Capital if they so desire? I do not wish any honorable member who is going to vote differently from me to think that I wish to retain the Capital in Melbourne. I do not. With the Federal Parliament meeting in my constituency, I rarely have leisure, and my vote would be willingly given to remove it; but I want to see a site selected that will be a place of beauty, where a Capital can be built as no other capital has yet been built. Washington, the capital of the United States of America, is the only Federal city that' approximates in any way to the city that we could build if we had the power; but in the case of Washington the land has, unfortunately, been sold. We, I hope, will never permit a single acre of the Federal territory to be alienated. The enhanced value which a Federal Capital will give to the land will belong to the people, and with the motive power for electricity that the Snowy River could supply for a Capital upon the Dalgety site, who can say what its powers and potentialities would be? Where in any other part of Australia can we find the equal of the electric force that could be obtained at Dalgety to supply light, heat, and motive power? When the honorable member for Lang was painting that faked picture of Yass-Canberra, I asked him if he asserted that the water capabilities of the Yass-Canberra district were equal to those of Dalgety. He was clever enough to try to dodge the question, but when he was forced to face it he had to own that they were not. When the history of this period comes to be written what will be said of the treatment meted out to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> an officer of the New South Wales Government, who advocated Dalgety in no uncertain tones, and, I believe, in terms as complimentary as those used by the right honorable member for Swan? After all, I would rather take the opinion of that right honorable member about a Capital Site than that of any one else who has spoken inside or outside this House. If the right honorable member has changed his mind on the matter, I cannot help it, but while I remain a member of the Federal Parliament, I shall do my best to see that the people have a right to alter the provisions of the Constitution in this regard, for no Constitution should be, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, unalterable. I am afraid it will be said in later days that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> was not treated fairly by the New South Wales Government, and certainly if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> had anything to do with it, I cannot imagine anything fair and just to which he would give his consent if it suited him to do otherwise. The opinion of the people of Australia can be taken, as proposed in the amendment of the honorable member for West Sydney, without any expense other than the printing of the necessary ballot-papers, and when taken it might remove the 100-mile limit which even the huckstering between the Premiers failed' to remove. We do not want to alter the present Constitutional provision that the Capital shall be in New South Wales, but if New South Wales members continue to carry on in the next Parliament the same tactics as certain of them have followed on this question in this Parliament, all I have to say is that Australia will rise one of these fine days in its strength and shake off the old man of' the sea which is now clinging round its neck. We shall not allow our Australia to be continually degraded and dishonoured by these tactics, or perpetually subjected to the terrible infamy, upon the secret history of which the light of day has never yet flashed, perpetrated by a collection of Premiers, and emanating from New South Wales. Such a vile conspiracy ' as that was has never emanated from any other State in the Commonwealth. It will take time, but Australia will one day shake off this old man of the sea, arid say, " Let us start B fresh." I have no desire to wrong New South Wales. On the contrary, I have every desire to give her the full advantage of what she has garnered by the means of which I have spoken so severely. Knowing what has taken place in the past, it ill becomes New South Wales to try to take advantage of an opportunity to force this question through at the end of the last session of a dying Parliament. I say this without any ill-will, for I have been frequently called a defender of New South Wales and of Sydney, and people have afterwards been astonished to learn that I came from Melbourne. But we want a wider view than the Sydney view of this question. We should take not a city or a State view, but a continental view. We ought to make the word "Australia" ring through the world as the epitome of a continent. I know nothing more likely to imprint the brand of parochialism upon us than the action that has been taken on this question, and I regret deeply that the eloquent words of the honorable member who was Postmaster-General in the late Deakin Government were not heeded. He made a brilliant speech in this Chamber, but afterwards ill health overtook him. I hope to see him come back in the next Parliament, refreshed and restored to health, and able to help us, for he, New South Wales man as he was, was not tinged with the parochialism which characterizes certain other honorable members. I do not know one Victorian member who has spoken to-day, except possibly the honorable member for Wimmera - and he has changed his opinions in a way that no man can possibly understand - who wants Melbourne to be made the Federal Capital. The agreement was made, and we desire to honorably observe it. At the same time, we do not wish to plant the Federal Capital on an unsuitable site. The water supply of Canberra is not what the honorable member for Lang so eloquently declared it to be. I hold with him, however, that, taking advantage of the advances of science, it is possible to make water reeking with filth suitable for drinking purposes. But we know that even in connexion with the most scientific arrangements a mistake may occur, and that drinking water so obtained would not be equal to the splendid supply available to Dalgety from the Snowy River. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> W. Cole, of Melbourne, whose Book Arcade, so far as my experience will permit me to say, is unequalled in any other part of the world, has prepared a map of Australia on the palm of the hand with the fingers down and the middle finger pointing towards Victoria and Tasmania. I should prefer to see the Capital established in little Tasmania, with her magnificent water supply, rather than at Yass-Canberra. The question of water supply is all important. No one can tell what may be the outcome of the selection of a site at which unlimited water power is available. If it were possible to sway a vote I should appeal to honorable members to remember what is possible with such a great force of water for electrical purposes as can be obtained at Dalgety. Even if that site consisted only of barren rocks, I should say that with a little further advance in chemistry we might be able to change those rocks into arable and fertile soils. I resent strongly the setting aside of Dalgety as the site of the Federal Capital, and the Tammany ring sort of tactics which brought about that decision. I shall vote for this amendment as a means of entering my protest against the passing of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer does not think that Canberra is the best site, and with all due respect to the honorable member for Cowper, I prefer, on this question, to take the opinion of the right honorable member for Swan. Wc have also had the extraordinary statement by the Minister of Home Affairs, that the people could net cast an intelligent vote on this question. Quite recently he and other honorable members on this side of the House supported a proposal to submit to a referendum of the people a far more complex and important question, than is that now before us. The honorable member for Wimmera has declared his opposition to the proposed referendum, and says that he thinks it his duty in this case to exercise his right as a member of this Parliament. A few days ago he, too, voted to submit to a referendum of the people the question to which I have just referred. He is prepared to trust the people to deal with the greatest question that could be submitted to them, but he would not trust .them to determine the site of the Federal Capital. The Minister of Home Affairs said that this question had been discussed for nine years. </para>

                        <para>- I shall be able to prove my contention, and I shall also endeavour to show that even the present Premier of New South Wales thinks that there has been no undue delay. Having regard to the time occupied in determining the site of the Capitals of the United States and Canada he does not think that the time that has been devoted to this question is excessive. At the very, outset of the steps taken to bring about Federation, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Dibbs made a claim for the establishment of the Federal Capital in Sydney.

                    <para>I am perfectly satisfied that this Convention lias no right to close its proceedings without giving an expression of opinion as to where the capital of the future Commonwealth shall be. I should fail in my duty as a representative of New South Wales if I did not ask the Convention to unanimously record their vote in favour of the amendment. Honorable members made very light of the matter when they heard this notice <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> motion being given, and the honorable member, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Munro,</inline> made the remark, '' We want it in Melbourne," and another honorable member said, " We want it in South Australia," and to  on. There is one place alone which the people of New South Wales will accept as the capital.. If they are to give up all their privileges and a large portion of their liberties which this Bill will take from them, they must, at least, have some regard to their antiquity, and their natural advantages, to the fact of their being centrally situated, and, above all, to the fact that New South Wales is practically the mother of all the other Colonies. I will divide the Convention on the matter. Those members who represent New South Wales will be traitors to their Colony, and the representatives of the other Colonies who vote against me will be ungrateful , to the Colony from which they sprang, and will be neglecting the interests of the whole of the Commonwealth, if they do not give me the full measure of their support on this motion. </para>

You will require a bar to attend there, and I undertake to say that almost for a century to come the leading members of the bar will be found practising their profession in the capital cities of the various Colonies, and for litigants to engage a bar to attend to their cases in some distant so-called federal capital will mean  lo  penalize litigants to an enormous extent before the Federal High Court. </para>

I accept that decision as not brought about, as some other position might have been, by any unfair means, but as a fair and honest expression of the views of the majority.

                        <para>- I have no desire to go beyond the ruling of the Chair. At present I am merely inviting honorable members to compare Sydney and Melbourne for a moment. An amendment of the Constitution is necessary, in my opinion, so that we may have an opportunity of saying which is the best site; and as some disparaging remarks have been made respecting the State I have the honour to represent, I wish to show that Melbourne is equal to Sydney in many respects, and, in other respects, is superior. However, I think I shall be in order in referring to the Dalgety site, seeing that this afternoon the honorable member for Lang referred to Yass-Canberra, and the water supply there. In my opinion, the claims of Dalgety are superior to those of Yass-Canberra; and, in support of that view, I propose to quote from a report submitted by the Commissioners, Messrs. John Kirkpatrick,  chairman,  A. W. Howitt, Henry C. Stanley, and Graham Stewart, on the 4th July,  1903.  In that report it is stated that a medical witness said that the district of </para>

                    <para>It does not follow that because this very fine port (Eden) has, from one cause or another, been neglected, that it will continue to be neglected. When that district is opened by railway communication, to which, in my judgment, it is richly entitled, Eden, which has a very fine harbor, will become the site of a very important maritime city. ... I have that faith in the progress of this country that I have long foreseen that, although retarded by unfavorable circumstances, this result is certain by the very force of growth from without. . . . Twofold Bay has been the victim, if I may so term it, of singular neglect. I do not say whose fault it is. It is very difficult to distinguish ; but, certainly, before many years, Twofold Bay, where the town of Eden is situated..... will become one of the most important places in New South Wales. I have no doubt whatever of that. As far back as 1873 1 advocated the construction of a railway to the port to bring the traffic of Monaro to the bay...... </para>

                    <para>If the Seat of Government were to be' located on the Monaro tableland, and connected by rail with a harbor such as Twofold Bay, the Commonwealth would acquire an invaluable naval base situated nearly halfway between the two State Capitals that offer the greatest temptations to an enemy - Sydney and Melbourne. The eastern States of Australia would acquire a harbor of refuge, or for refitting ships in distress, or for coaling. If the Commonwealth is to have a navy of its own, or even a training ship,. Twofold Bay would be a convenient station, particularly for gunnery practice, and suggests itself as the convenient head-quarters of the Naval Commandant. As the breakwaters would be fortified, the port of Eden could be made practically impregnable. With such a harbor the Commonwealth would have two routes for reaching the various State Capitals - one by sea, the other by land - and for facilitating the collection, mobilization, and despatch of troops, munitions, and equipments. </para>

                        <para>- I propose presently to quote statements made by two honorable gentlemen who visited that site. One of them, although occupying a very high position in the Commonwealth, could yet find time to make a personal inspection, and  1  agree with the conclusion which he formed as the result of his visit. Although I did not visit the site, I visited one of the sites, but the trouble with the motor cars was so great that I did not wish to see any more. </para>

I have condensed my remarks and my quotations as much as possible. I wish, however, to read an opinion regarding Canberra which has been published by the honorable member for Hindmarsh. No one would charge him with bias in this matter, and he visited the district when a member of the last Government, at the request of the Minister of Home Affairs of the day. Would any one charge him with disloyalty to the Government of which he was a member, or to his party, in publishing a statement of opinions which he did not hold? Certainly I am quite prepared to take his views on a matter of this kind. We should be likely to agree pretty well. This is undoubtedly a. fair account of the impressions of his visit - </para>

                        <para>- I have quoted the opinions of experts. I have given the views of an undoubted authority, the right honorable member for Swan. Would any one charge him with writing a statement which did not express his real opinions? He says that Canberra is inferior to Dalgety, so far as water supply is concerned. A few days ago I was charged with not having visited the sites ; but when an honorable member does so, his opinion is not taken. Then there is the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. </para>

                        <para>- Canberra itself secured only one vote. If the site possesses the advantages which some honorable members attribute to it, this is the time to state them, and to show that adverse criticism is not justified. I think the honorable member for North Sydney will agree with me that there is no opinion which he would accept in regard to the selection of the site for a city more readily than that of the right honorable member for Swan. </para>

                        <para>- When the amendment of the honorable member for West Sydney was submitted I accepted it, but I must candidly admit, after looking into the matter carefully, that I was in error in doing so. The honorable member for Batman moved to insert after the word " proclamation " the words " but not until after a referendum of the people of the Commonwealth has been taken as to the most suitable site." On that, the honorable member for West Sydney moved to insert after the word "after" the words "such amendment of the Constitution shall have been presented t.o the people as is necessary to permit of any part of the State of New South Wales being selected, as the most suitable site." The amendment of the honorable member for West Sydney certainly so broadened out the question as to embrace quite a different principle from that affirmed on the second reading ot the Bill. Under the circumstances, I think that the objection of the honorable member for Robertson is quite valid, and that the amendment of the honorable member for West Sydney is not in order. At this stage I may say that it is most difficult, in dealing with a Bill such as this, when an honorable member submits an important amendment, especially at a time when there is excitement in the Committee, to decide at the moment whether the amendment handed in is or is not strictly in order. I admit that the point raised may 'be open to a good deal of debate ; but I am firmly convinced that, in accepting the amendment of the honorable member for West Sydney, I was in error. I am pleased that the honorable member for Robertson has raised the point of order; and I rule that the amendment of the honorable member for West Sydney is out of order. </para>

The amendment of the honorable member for Batman is quite broad enough to allow of all the debate that has taken place to-day, and will not interfere with the right of reply to honorable members who have already spoken. I have ruled the amendment of the honorable member for West Sydney out of order; and the amendment of the honorable member for Batman is now before us. </para>

                        <para>- Then I should like to answer the arguments of other honorable members who have addressed the Committee on this question. The first to reply to me was the Attorney-General. He look a point of order, but the only objection that he could find to my amendment was that of expense. Ten. pounds would cover all the expenditure necessary for the taking of the referendum. If the amendment is carried the Government will be bound to give effect to the decision of the Committee. The honorable member for Dalley, who has spoken on several occasions on this question, also criticised the amendment. He ought to vote for a referendum, seeing that in the first six ballots he voted for Armadale, in the seventh for Lyndhurst, and in the eighth and ninth for Yass-Canberra. If he changes his mind so quickly he "should surely allow the people an opportunity of saying where the Federal Capital should be. He also urged that it would be necessary for every member to visit the sites in order to give an intelligent vote, but in that connexion I am prepared to accept the dictum of the honorable member for Parkes, with whom I do not agree on every question. He said that he had not visited any site, but was prepared to take the opinion of experts. So am I ; and, therefore, the argument of the honorable member for Dalley falls to the ground. </para>

                        <para>- I have stated about twenty times that I have taken as my guide the best authority in Australia - the present Treasurer. The honorable member for Dalley also said that my proposal was put forward by the press. The press of Victoria have not taken a very decided stand on the question. One or two of the leading journals have, but every paper in New South Wales, daily or weekly, with one exception, has been crying out for Yass-Canberra. Nothing is too bad for them to say about Dalgety. The honorable member for Dalley writes -for the press himself, and recently published an article in connexion with my proposal. The honorable member for West Sydney said that  £250,000  would have to be spent in Yass-Canberra. He regarded that as too much, and stated that the best place for the Capital was Sydney. The honorable member for Darling also spoke.  His  only argument against my proposal was that it was not competent for the Government to take a referendum on the question. The honorable member for Wentworth suggested that the reason the daily press of Melbourne wanted the Federal Capital to remain in Melbourne was that it would cost them a great deal to keep a staff at the Federal Capital, but the honorable member knows that the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> are in the same boat, yet they strongly advocate Yass-Canberra. I refuse to believe that the press of Victoria are against the establishment of the Capital in a place of which the whole of the people of Australia approve. If the honorable member for Wentworth cannot find any stronger argument than that, he has a very weak case. I find that if the people of Australia had an opportunity to vote on the question by means of a referendum, they would declare in favour .of a site other than Yass-Canberra. Taking the number of votes recorded at the last election for each member who voted for Dalgety or Yass-Canberra, I find that in Victoria  46,768  votes were cast for Yass-Canberra, and  142,574  for Dalgety. In New South Wales  196,136  were cast for Yass-Canberra, and  20,370  for Dalgety; in Queensland  32,609  for Yass-Canberra, and  39,030  for Dalgety ; in South Australia  12,080  for Yass-Canberra, and  38,000  for Dalgety ; in Tasmania,  16,408  for Yass-Canberra, and  10,040  for Dalgety. Representatives of Western Australia did not cast a vote for Yass-Canberra, but honorable members from that </para>

On the second and third rounds the voting was the same, and thereafter Canberra dropped out of the running. The honorable member for Robertson alone voted for it on that occasion. In the final ballot in this House Yass-Canberra received  39  votes and Dal'gety  33,  or a majority of six in favour of the first-named site. At the previous ballot, however, Dalgety had a majority of  ii  votes. </para><interjection>

The vote that is about to be given will bind future generations. In view of the difference of opinion existing amongst honorable members ; in view of the fact that Dalgety was originally selected, and that after the next general election one-third of the present members will probably no longer have a seat in this Chamber, I think that the people of Australia should have an opportunity to deal with this question. I trust that no one will deny to the people, who are our masters, and whom we represent, an opportunity to say where the future Capital of Australia shall be. </para>

                        <para>- He nearly got dry-blown. Americans admit that they made a mistake in establishing their Federal Capital so close to the Eastern States. The area of the Commonwealth is bigger than the continent of Europe. Metaphorically speaking, one could put Germany, France, Belgium, Holland, Norway and Sweden into New South Wales. It is because I am proud of the greatness of Australia, of its magnificent areas and its widespread influence, that I do not wish to see its Capital established in an undesirable place. The capital of a great continental people should be blessed with a cold climate calculated to nurture great men. The great men of the world - the great inventors and thinkers - have come from cold countries. Look at the great men produced by little Scotland, where the men sit by the fire at night, smoking tobacco and thinking, while their wives, by their sides, are spinning. If honorable members desire to see the effect which a hot climate has on the people, I invite them to go to the Spanish Main, where on Sunday mornings they will see bare-footed men with their trousers rolled up, huge sombreros on their heads, and roosters under their arms, hurrying to the cock pits. The spirit of a hot country is revolutionary. Where you can sleep out without a blanket there is no telling when the Government will be upset. We should have our Capital in a cold country, where we could breed great thinkers and inventors. </para>

                        <para>- The Federal Capital should be in Tasmania. Then we could rejuvenate and recreate the island, banishing the fossils. After my election, there were several deaths there. Honorable members must remember that this is a great question, in which .the whole world takes an interest. This is a subject that they think about in London. When a French expedition went into the heart cf Africa to visit a chief, the first question he asked was, " What do they think of me in Paris?" As a matter of fact, they had never heard of him there. But they have heard of the Australian Capital question. The honorable member for Robertson is a fair-minded, progressive man, who is not hide-bound by party considerations. [ should like him to consider this question. </para>

                    <para>.- As the numbers seem to be up, not much is to be gained by speaking at length ; and, therefore, I shall not try to make a long speech, supposing I could do so. It is some consolation to know that the elections are at hand, and that probably the result will be to upset the Yass-Canberra site as the Dalgety site was upset. I believe that it is only the Sydney people who want the Yass-Canberra site. The rest of the people of New South Wales are indifferent; and the people of the other States are antagonistic. That is shown by the statements of the honorable member for Batman regarding the voting in this Chamber. Under these circumstances, Yass-Canberra will probably have little chance after the elections. If the people think that the matter is likely to be settled soon, they will take a keen interest in it; and even if we do not submit the question to them by way of a referendum, they will express their view's by requiring certain pledges regarding the matter from the candidates for whom they vote. What I would propose in regard to a referendum would be to allow every elector to write down on a voting- paper the name of the place in New South Wales which he thought most suitable. No doubt the Queenslanders would largely vote for Armidale. Others would vote for Tumut or Albury; but I believe that the majority would vote for Dalgety. I recently had a conversation with a New Zealander, who expressed great regret at the abandonment of Dalgety, because he thought that, with a Federal port on the east coast of Australia, giving direct connexion by sea with New Zealand, that country would be the more ready to join an Australasian Federation, which many New Zealanders desire, and which, under the financial pressure, may be brought about. An alternative arrangement to that which I have suggested would be to select certain sites and submit them to the people. In my opinion, the Constitution might very well be amended to permit of a compromise such as they have adopted in South Africa, or to allow the people to say which of the recognised capitals should he made the Capital of the Commonwealth, thus saving the expense of a bush Capital. In South Africa, the people of the Transvaal wished to have the old State capital of Pretoria chosen for the capital of the Federation, whilst the people of Cape Colony insisted that the historical city of Cape Town should be selected. When the people of Natal had given up their claims, only these two cities remained in the list. Most people feel that it is undesirable to establish a Capital where there will be little population. We do not want a Capital such as Washington was when Dickens described it as a place of mud, canals, and desert spaces. </para>

                        <para>- Because it is the capital of the country having a population of over 80,000,000 people. Besides, it is situated on a river, and has a port. In Australia, a capital would not be likely to grow as quickly as Washington did. The pressure of the public opinion of a great metropolis upon a Parliament is salutary. It is a mistake for politicians, or even private persona, to bury themselves where public opinion cannot reach them. In South Africa it was decided that the Parliament should meet at Cape Town, while the Executive capital was fixed at Pretoria ; and we could easily amend our Constitution in a similar direction. At present the Constitution provides that the Seat of Government shall be in New South Wales, but not in Sydney, with the Parliament meeting in Melbourne; and I should like to see an amendment to provide for the Executive capital in Sydney, with Melbourne as the Parliamentary capital. If people had an opportunity of voting whether they would have the Capital in Sydney or in some bush place in New South Wales, they certainly would select Sydney ; and I deeply regret that, the proposals made in the Convention were not accepted. The choice of the Federal Capital could then have extended over the whole of Australia, not excepting Melbourne, Sydney, or Hobart ; and the choice had to be made by the State Governors under the advice of their Ministers, and in case of disagreement, by, I believe, the late Queen. I hope that the honorable member for Batman will secure a third referendum, because I" should like the people to have a greater area qf choice. In view of the difference of opinion in this House, and the undoubted change of front on the part of representatives, particularly in another place, it would be wise to refer the question to the people. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the amendment of the honorable member for Batman. Some months ago I pointed out that the House was so equally divided as between Dalgety and Yass-Canberra that the question was one for further consideration ; and I am of that opinion still. There is nothing to prevent the whole of the sites, which have been proposed from time to time, being placed before the people, and  a  vote taken on the preferential principle. I remember supporting the honorable member for Calare in an amendment intended to give the Lyndhurst site  a  chance. It seems to me strange that the New South Wales Government should show such  a  dislike to Dalgety, Bombala, or any place in that vicinity. Some time ago, when there was a proposal for  a  railway in that part of Australia, we were told that the project would have been entered upon before, but for the fact that it might have assisted the advocates of Dalgety. It is certainly very strange for a Government or Parliament to retard the progress of  a  portion of a State because it might assist in the fixing of the Federal Capital there; however, that only shows what provincialism is capable of. It is very interesting to read the splendid accounts of the Kosciusko district in the <inline font-style="italic">Tourists' Guide</inline> of New South Wales - of the beautiful scenery, the plenitude of fish, and so forth. </para>

                        <para>- I have never seen any of the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Tourists' Guides</inline> recommend Yass-Canberra as  a  health resort. In the establishment of a city, the first consideration is a good water supply. Some years ago, the honorable member for Lang told us that, after all, the water supply was only a minor matter; but to-day he quotes authorities in favour of providing a dam some 200 feet high, on the Yass-Canberra site. I told my, electors that, if I were expected to live in a city below a dam of that dimensions, I had no desire to be their representative - I have no ambition to be washed hurriedly down a stream. In conversation, I have heard of dams placed on little streams on private property leading to a railway accident in New South Wales some years ago; and I would much rather live alongside a stream like the Snowy River, from which a supply is obtained all the year round without any dependence on a large storage. The reports of experts show that a certain quantity of water flows down a river in the course of twelve months; but that .is no guide, because there might be  a  wonderful stream for a week or two or a month, with  a  dry bed for the remainder of the year. </para>

                    <para>.- There is justification for some of the criticism which has been evoked in connexion with certain New South Wales influences. It is very unfortunate that there should have been so much interference with exclusively Federal functions by the present Premier of -New South Wales, not only in connexion with the Federal Capital, but in other matters. </para>

                        <para>- This interference has caused a good deal of ill-feeling, and given honorable members like the honorable member for Batman, an opportunity to bring parochial retaliation to bear against the State of New South Wales. I should very much like, if it were possible, to deal with this as a national question ; but that cannot be done, in view of the fact that the Constitution makes it entirely a parochial matter. All the prating in the world about national ideals and aspirations will not affect the issue in the least. It may be that there are a hundred better sites in Australia than Yass-Canberra, but, according to the Constitution, we are kept within certain limits, and compelled to take the best to be found there. There has been altogether too much bargaining in connexion with Federation. Something has had to be given to one State and another, until I am afraid, some few years hence, the representatives of the people will find themselves shackled in all directions, and unable to give effect to the views which they think the best for Australia. I represent a city constituency ; and I must say that, when the Federal Constitution was before the people, it was held out as an inducement to them to vote for it that the limitation of the choice of the Capital would give the metropolis a tremendous advantage. It was pointed out to waterside workers, for instance, that all the shipping would have to come to Sydney for repairs, and that other artisans would reap great benefits, owing to the fact that Sydney would be for all time the port of the Federal Capital. By these appeals, some enthusiasm was raised, and a number of votes were cast for the Constitution because of the bargain made. I utterly disapprove of such baits being he'd out when negotiations are in progress. for the welding of great States into nationhood. However, we are not now asked to determine the reasons why the Constitution was agreed to in its present form ; we have to take the Constitution, and give effect to it as it is. The people of Victoria knew quite well that this special bait was held out to the people of New South Wales; and I ask why there should be any desire to go back on the bargain? While the Victorian people may criticise the position, they ought to be honest enough to honour their promise. There is no doubt that from Inter-State Free Trade and extended markets, Victoria hoped to gain much in a commercial sense. All the eloquence about national ideals and aspirations is beside the question. It must be admitted that there has been a change of opinion in regard to the sites on the part of some honorable members; but I do not see that another change would make the position any better ; on the contrary, it would accentuate criticism. I have been to Yass-Canberra; and, while I do not say that it is an ideal site, I regard the <inline font-style="italic">canards</inline> of the Victorian press and certain Victorian representatives as totally" unjustified. </para>

                        <para>- It is easy to make funny remarks to induce people to laugh at the site, but the honorable member has never been there and knows nothing about it. A large number of those who have expressed themselves most vehemently on the question are in a similar position. It is quite untrue that Yass-Canberra is hot. It is in the cooler part of New South Wales, and the honorable member for Darwin would not care to camp, out there even at this time of the year. It is evident that those who are proposing a referendum do not take the question seriously. </para>

                        <para>- I believe in the referendum, and in the people deciding all those questions which they are competent to decide, but the selection of a Federal Capital site the people, as a mass, are not competent to decide. What would the people of Victoria as a whole know about the Yass-Canberra site? There is not a member of this Parliament who has read the whole of the reports on the different sites. It would take two or three years to do it. If the question were submitted to a referendum il would simply mean that the big papers would fight for the commercial interests of their capitals. Whatever suited the advertising <inline font-style="italic">clientele</inline> of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> would be advocated bv them, and the people of Victoria, would be influenced not so much because one site was better than another as because one site would give greater advantages than another to the commercial houses of Victoria. The same thing would occur in New South Wales and all the other States. The suggestion to refer the question to the people is not a sensible one. We know from talk in the lobbies that a number of honorable members intend to vote for it for the express purpose of delaying a settlement of the question. They think that while there is life there is hope, and that there might be a possibility of upsetting the choice of Yass-Canberra in the new Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- That is no reason why I should agree to its being done again. The Victorian members are not troubled personally as to where the Capital should he, but they think they will gain .some kudos with the Victorian press, and be assisted at the next election, if they run with their big commercial organs on a matter of this kind, which is not a party question. It is farcical to suggest the submission of Dalgety, Tumut, Albury, Lyndhurst, and Yass-Canberra to a referendum. lt would be a very good thing for the Victorian folk that the Commonwealth Parliament should continue to sit- in Melbourne. Nearly  £250,000  a year is spent in this city by reason of the Parliament meeting here. There are the heads of all the Departments and their huge staffs, the upkeep of both Houses, and a large number of members always living in Victoria, and one cannot blame the Melbourne people for looking after their own interests by trying to retain as much of that expenditure in their midst as possible. I shall not canvass the merits of the different sites, because that has been done time after time, and nothing that can be said now will alter a single vote. The honorable member for Batman spoke for four or five hours, but he knew he was simply putting up a straw man in order to knock him down again, and that all his speech would do would be, perhaps, to gain him a little kudos in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> to-morrow morning. The numbers are up for the Bill, and it is going to be carried. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> in the issue that arrived to-day, points out that part of the compact between certain New South Wales members of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister was that the Free Traders should throw overboard their Free Trade principles, their idea of contributions to the Imperial Navy, and their advocacy of volunteer military training, in favour of the Prime Minister's proposals, while he, on the other hand, should throw overboard his views about the Federal- Capital. Both sides, therefore, have thrown overboard some of the cargo of principles on which they were elected. </para>

                        <para>- After the manipulation of the Western Australian electorates that we saw the other night the right honorable member is all right. I know that in this case the influence of the Ministry is behind the Bill. If to their other sins there was added a failure on the part of the New South Wales members of the Fusion to settle the Federal Capital question, it would be a case of the last straw breaking the camel's back, and they would have no chance of getting back. However, that does not concern me. All I am concerned about is that the question is to be settled. So long as we have a reasonable site, it is in the interests of Australia, seeing that we are confined by the Constitution within certain limits, that the matter should be settled at the earliest moment, so as to enable the Federal Parliament to become housed in a home of its own. I hope that when the Bill is passed the Minister will instruct his Department to take all the necessary preliminary steps - to clear the way - for the erection of buildings to accommodate the Parliament and the Departments, so that when Parliament meets again some months hence such fresh measures may be introduced as will enable the Parliament to speedily take possession of its own home, away from all those parochial influences which are associated with the State capitals. </para>

Those who are against the Yass-Canberra area ought to be prepared to take an honest course, and vote accordingly, and not attempt to press a proposal which has the appearance of honesty, but which, in reality, is only a deception designed to delay the passage of the Bill. </para>

                <para class="block">These words constitute the crux of the clause, and I move their omission in order to give honorable members who voted against Canberra at the ballot taken in this House last year an opportunity to do so again. It will be within the memory of honorable members that on the occasion in question only one vote was cast for Canberra. It secured a chance of selection only by being bracketed with Yass. When the Yass-Canberra district was selected it was not thought that Canberra itself, amongst the multiplicity of sites in that district, had a chance of being selected. The popular belief was that a site in the Yass district, well supplied with water from the Goodradigbee and Gudgenby Rivers would be chosen. Between Yass and Canberra there are many sites that were favorably considered. As I have said, only one honorable member voted for Canberra. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly that is so, and I am of opinion that honorable members would not vote for the selection of Canberra now if they knew anything of the district. It was thought that there might be, somewhere in the Yass-Canberra district, a site which would be suitable for t he Federal Capital ; but the officials lent by the Government of New South Wales to the Commonwealth came to the conclusion after they had gone over the whole ground, and had made an exhaustive inquiry, that, bad as it was, Canberra itself was the best site there. That is the meaning of the present proposal. Many honorable members have admitted, and I make the admission myself, that it was thought good tactics to so group the sites that ultimately the Yass-Canberra district would be chosen, because they knew that the selection of this district would be least agreeable to the national feeling of Australia, being most agreeable to those who wished to benefit Sydney. The majority supporting the Yass-Canberra district was not very large. While we who voted for Dalgety have been charged 'with having done so to postpone indefinitely the settlement of the question, I am satisfied that those who voted for Yass-Canberra felt, from the reports then to hand, that there was no possibility of any site in the district being finally adopted. All these sites had been dealt with before. There is the Lake George site, for instance. We heard of the lake which was to beautify the Federal Capital ; but we know now that there is water in it only after a heavy downpour. The honorable member for Hume, who declared the Lake George site to be the best in the district, had to admit that he had known the lake to be dry on many occasions. </para>

He had elaborate plans for supplying the district with water from the Cotter, the Molonglo, the Goodradigbee, the Paddy, the Murrumbidgee, and other watercourses which have been named, of which the Murrumbidgee alone can be called a river. </para>

                        <para>- It has been suggested that almost every river in Australia can be diverted into Lake George. The honorable member for South Sydney, who was a late convert, tried to show how Lake George could be filled in this way. Of course, it is idle to address those who are representing constituencies in or near Sydney, or round about the Yass-Canberra district. I might as well be asked to vote against Protection. It would be as useless to ask me to vote against Protection as to ask them to vote against the proposed site. I am appealing to those who, like myself, are free to study the interests of the Commonwealth. I ask them if they have considered the scarcity of water on the proposed site. The Minister of Home Affairs is able to make his statements in such a way as not to create spleen ; but I ask the Committee to decide between him and the honorable member for South Sydney, and their own personal knowledge of the proposed Federal area, and the reports of the New South Wales officials regarding its possibilities. The Cotter River itself is really only a creek. Honorable members now have an opportunity to cast a vote in the interests of the people of Australia, who must be considered before the people of Sydney. What a sorry lot the other sites in the Yass-Canberra district must be if Canberra is the best ! I am putting up a fight in the interests of Australia, not to please my constituents, who are hardly affected. They know that Melbourne will not be the Capital. I would not vote for that. 1 do not agree with the honorable member for Corio that the Parliament should meet in Melbourne, while the Seat of Government should be in New South Wales. I wish to keep the compact contained in the Constitution. Any vote that I may give on this question is not likely to affect my chances at the "next election. I ask the Treasurer, who is the first man I heard speak on this question before entering the House, if he does not think that his first choice, Dalgety, is in every way better than Canberra? I ask others who voted for Dalgety whether it is not preferable to Canberra ? Of course, if honorable members care nothing about the interests of Australia, I cannot influence them. Apparently, many of those who were formerly adverse to Canberra have been slobbered over, like the prey of a serpent before it is swallowed, and now feel it useless to struggle, because conditions are against them. If the Canberra site has been considered at all, it has been rejected; and yet honorable members who voted for Dalgety tell me that the "numbers are up," and ask what is the use of fighting the matter further? Do honorable members think that they satisfy their constituents by such an attitude? If the "numbers are up," it is because the Fusion Government and party have nobbled honorable members on this as on other questions. </para>

                        <para>- And they were quite right. Even if the Minister of Home Affairs were a Victorian representative, he would be justified in submitting this Bill, seeing that it comes within his Department. The Labour Government were simply carrying out the behest of the House in endeavouring to arrange for the selection of the best site in the Canberra district. But I point out that it was not then made a party question ; the members of the Labour Government, and of the party, would have been free to take any stand they liked in regard to the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Why not? Did the Deakin Government not do so? If the late Deakin . Government had been unanimous in regard to Dalgety - if the Prime Minister, as has been suggested, had had more backbone - Dalgety would have been the Federal Capital. It was not desired, however, then, that the supporters of the Government should vote on this as a party question; and- I wonder how any Government dare make the selection of the Capital a party matter. The Government are justified in presenting this Bill formally ; but the members of the Cabinet are not justified in supporting it if they do not believe in the selection recommended. We must not forget that this Government is led by a gentleman, who, as Prime Minister, presented Dalgety for acceptance last year. But times have changed ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> the supreme being in Australia, has dictated to the Fusion Government - which he had some hand in bringing into existence - how they shall vote. It is proved conclusively that the only State to be considered is New South Wales. Representatives of Tasmania are bound hand and foot, and. forced to vote, not in the interests of their State, or of Australia, but solely in the interests of New South Wales. Just as they were nobbled for party purposes on the financial agreement, so they have been nobbled on this occasion, and, with the help of New South Wales representatives on this side, will pass this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Grampians is in his element; he has not been forced into his present position, but has helped to force others there. He has never endeavoured to hide his Conservative opinions ; and it matters very little to him what is done in connexion with the Federal Capital, so long as certain political advantages accrue to his party. I compliment the honorable member on the present situation; he and his colleagues " worked it " well, and bided their time. The ultra-Conservatives and the ultra Radicals have both gained what they desired - a division into two parties. I resent, however, the introduction of party considerations into this question. </para>

I can quite understand the honorable gentleman smiling to himself, and saying, " I did that very well, with the assistance of the other Conservatives in the Fusion party." The ratification of this agreement is one of the planks of that party, who will give anything away to gain certain political advantages for the present. My amendment will give honorable members an opportunity of voting, not in the material interests of New South Wales alone, but in the interests of Australia as a whole. </para>

                    <para>. - The verbiage with which the honorable member for Melbourne Ports has surrounded the submission of this amendment boils down to very small dimensions. He concluded by urging the great advantages which would accrue to Sydney by the selection of the Yass-Canberra site ; but the fact that the Commonwealth has been given access to the sea, with a port at Jervis Bay, dispels any idea of that sort. However, if any advantage should go to Sydney, I am one who believes that that city is perfectly entitled to it. </para>

They have now been handed over to the Commonwealth to make use of, and will be, arid ought to be, used for the defence of the port. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister's explanation shows that the area of two square miles is connected with the Federal territory, but that to reach the other parts at the heads, coloured green on the map, it will be necessary to pass through New South Wales territory. All that would have been avoided had the Dalgety site with Twofold Bay attached been granted. This amendment gives an opportunity to test the question whether honorable members will vote for the site that they really believe is the best, or for the one that has been pushed by wire pulling and ear-wigging of a description that I have not before experienced in twenty years of political life - so vile, foul, and disgraceful was it. Yass-Canberra would never have been accepted by the House if strings had not 'been pulled as I never knew them to be pulled before. I was never so insulted before by men who I thought would never have disgraced themselves and degraded their positions in Parliament as they did in the effort to induce members to vote1 for this site. Some of them will not come back to the House, and one in particular, I have in mind, I shall not regret the loss of. Anyhow, he will not be here to use his voice and his vote, on this question. The present position simply means "hat New South Wales, dominated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> wishes to be the dictator of Australia. Everything has been grudgingly given. The Constitution certainly provides that the Capital must not be within  100  miles of Sydney, but how was that brought about? Not by the free will of the Australian citizens, but by trickery, sharp practice, haggling, and bargaining that a coster would be . ashamed to indulge in in a public street. The then Premier of New South Wales, for whose abilities I have a high regard, . and whose genial character I appreciate, used his legal training and acumen to bargain with the other Premiers, until <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, tired of the struggle, gave in, and said, " Oh, well, have the Capital." Then, in a spirit of resentment at having been forced to sell the birthright of every Australian, he insisted that the site should be at least  100  miles from Sydney. I personally would1 prefer the Capital to be in Sydney, if bv any means an equitable way by which the Federal Government could resume the valuable lands of that city could be discovered. Then, if the vote of the majority of the people of Australia was in favour of it, the Capital could be placed in Sydney. Even at the eleventh hour this amendment can be carried if honorable members will honestly vote for the site that they think is the best. Any name could be placed in the blank which would be created in this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- If a blank is created, the Minister will have to accept the decision of the Committee. What did the New South Wales Government care for the Constitution when, with the permission of their then Premier, they broke the law of the land, and seized wire-netting which was in the custody of the Federal Customs authorities? I believe that they have not even paid the expenses of that business up to this day. The people of New South Wales, who are Australians, are not responsible for all these things. They are not permitted to express their opinion on this question, because by the huckstering that took place the whole control of it was put in the hands of a few Premiers. The only parallel to what took place then is to be found in the infamous secret combination which met in Melbourne recently to discuss the financial question. No man knows what took place there, and it is said that the blotting paper was actually burnt lest some one should put it up to the light and try to read it. If Yass alone had been submitted' there would have been no majority for it, and the same is true of Canberra, considered alone. At the ballot Canberra received only one vote, and then the scheme of putting the two sites together was devised to dish those who followed the advice of men like the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> that Dalgety was the best site. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> stood very high in the New South Wales Public Service, but he was pulled to pieces by the faction which is now controlled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> that bombastic, petty little Premierlet who, by a concatenation of circumstances, and by happening to get a kind-hearted Prime Minister in a weak moment to bend down to him, has brought things to this pass. But where will the present State Premiers be in another five years? Not one of the other Premiers who made that huckstering bargain is in power today, and I dare say that in five years time not ore of the present Premiers will be in power. Two of them now are trembling on the edge of defeat. Earlier to-day I compared the New South Wales tendency as exemplified by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> with the old man of the sea of whom Sinbad the Sailor got rid by making him drunk. The Sinbad of the present day is the Commonwealth, and the old man of the sea is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales. We could forgive a great deal to that grand old man, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes, who wanted to pay his Colony the compliment of calling it Australia. I should not have objected to that but I do object to the narrow-minded policy initiated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade.</inline> How grudgingly he gave permission to the Commonwealth to take a little strip of two square miles at the entrance to Jervis Bay ! Was there not trickery in connexion with the photographs of the two sites supplied to this Parliament? Faked photographs were sent down, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> forsooth, would send none showing the Dalgety site and the Snowy River. If ever a man typified the infamous system of win, tie, or wrangle, it is the present Premier of New South Wales. Even when photographs were placed in the lobbies, questions were asked as to who had given permission, and the fair photographs of the Snowy River were put on one side, while a watercourse, which is merely a little trickling stream in the summer, was depicted as a fine roaring torrent. There is no question about the healthiness of the Dalgety country, and no man can measure the potentialities of electric power to be derived from the Snowy River. No scientist can say what electricity is, but it is a power for good when guided by the hand of science. It could be used at Dalgety to run the trams in the Federal Capital, to light the public buildings and the streets, to supply heat for cooking and other purposes, and for motive power generally. That magnificent site, with its splendid water supply, has been passed over in order to play into the hands of a faction. I believe that a previous Act of this Parliament provides that from a certain time the value of the land at the selected site cannot be increased, and that its taxing value under the New South Wales Land Tax Act is then to be taken as the basis on which the Federal Government can purchase it. Can the Minister state what that date is, so far as the Yass-Canberra site is concerned? </para>

                        <para>- That legislation does away with the possibility of advantage being taken of the enhanced values that will attach to land within the district by reason of its selection. It was a wise law to pass, although I am not suggesting that large areas might be controlled by individuals with the object of securing enhanced prices. I have not yet heard why the Government of New South Wales and more particularly the Premier of that State, stand so firmly by this site. No honorable member is better fitted to express an opinion as to the relative merits of the several sites that have been suggested than is the Treasurer. We have heard him in this House speak most strongly in favour of Dalgety, and deprecatingly of Canberra. No one has seen more of Australia than he has, and I would rather take his opinion on this question than that of the best man in the Government of New South Wales to-day.  His  opinion was backed up by that of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> and it seems pitiable that this House at the eleventh hour should be trying to foist this site on the people. If the Bill be passed, I take it that it will be more difficult later on to set aside the selection of Yass-Canberra than it was to remove the name of Dalgety from the Seat of Government Act. Had the Government of the day pushed on with the work of preparing Dalgety for the establishment of the capital, its position would have been stronger than it was. It was the delay of various Governments in taking action that made it possible to set aside the selection of that site. I shall have much pleasure in voting for the amendment. If it is a forlorn hope, we shall go down with our 'fl!ag flying, knowing that having entered our protest at this stage, we shall be justified, if the opportunity offers, in taking up the fight again. During the coming election campaign, I intend to inform my constituents that if in the future experts should report that this is not the best site - and I hold that experts should be appointed from every one of the States, as all are interested in this matter - and that a better site is obtainable, I shall advocate a referendum to settle the question, should the Government of New South Wales oppose any change. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Melbourne Ports and the honorable member for Melbourne have viewed this question, not from a national, but from a parochial standpoint. The whole question was thoroughly threshed out last year when the House selected the Yass-Canberra site, and I thoroughly concurred in the decision then arrived at. I remember at the Mme asking some of the officers of the Railway Department what would be the cost of constructing a line to the border in the event of the Dalgety site being selected, and was informed by them that it would be about  £750.000.  Without such an expenditure an express service could not be supplied owing to the mountainous nature of the country. Then, again, New South Wales would have to construct a branch line at a cost of from  £200,000  to'  £300,000,  so that the two States would incur an expenditure in this way of something like  ,£1,000,000.  Another point which we took into consideration was that the Yass-Canberra district is four hours nearer Perth, Adelaide, and Melbourne, and two hours nearer Sydney and Brisbane, than is- Dalgety. That consideration must weigh with intelligent men, who recognise the value of time. The saving of time so secured is in itself sufficient, in my opinion, to justify the selection that has been made. The two points to which I have referred weighed with me and with many other honorable members who then sat in the Opposition corner, and we decided that in the interests of the Commonwealth it would be well to establish the Capital in the Yass-Canberra district. We were not actuated by any selfish considerations, nor were we canvassed, as has been suggested, by representatives of New South Wales. 1 know, at all events, that I was not, and I do not think that other members of our party were. It was with us a clear, straight-cut issue. We were not influenced in any way, and viewed the whole matter, not from a local, but from a national, stand-point. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member's interjection shows his ignorance of the subject. As to the remarks which have been made regarding the alleged inadequacy of the water supply available in the district, I think it well to quote some figures compiled by one of the leading engineers in the Public Service of New South Wales. He shows that during the month of August last, the flow of the Cotter River amounted to  8,228,000,000  gallons, or an average of  265,140,000  gallons per day. The average consumption of  620,000  inhabitants of Sydney last year was  24,600,000  gallons per day, so that sufficient water flowed down the Cotter River during August last to supply Sydney and suburbs for  333  days. Those figures are a sufficient answer to the allegation that the water supply available for this site is defective. </para>

                        <para>- I think that Dalgety would be a most unsuitable site for the Capital of the Commonwealth. The people, in my opinion, would not approve of its selection. Yass-Canberra is more convenient for the people in the main centres of population in. the various States. I am not speaking without a knowledge of the country. I know it fairly well. Over twenty years have elapsed since I visited Canberra ; but during the last ten or fifteen years I have frequently visited the Goulburn district, and whilst I know that the territory comprises a large area of very poor country - possibly as poor as any in the Commonwealth - I know also that it includes a large area of very fair land. We could not expect New South Wales to make us a gift of 900 square miles of magnificent country, As a matter of fact, the Government of that State have given us ah for which we have asked and a little more. Nine hundred- square miles of territory should be ample for all our requirements. But in addition, we have been granted an area of two square miles on Jervis Bay, which is one of the finest bays in the world. I believe that in it any fleet could anchor with safety. The Government of New South Wales have also promised to construct a railway line from Yass to the border of the Federal territory, and all these considerations have gone a long way towards pacifying the malcontents who did not originally approve of this selection. These considerations should weigh with honorable members. The Constitution provided for a territory of 100 square miles; but we have been given a territory of 900 square miles, and, in addition, complete water rights over another 500 square miles, should the water supply in the proposed territory not be found sufficient, though, as a matter of fact, there are good streams there,, and an ample supply. We have also got water rights over the Snowy River without any restriction. Those who say that there is no water in the territory do not know what they are talking of. </para>

                <para>Mi. HANS IRVINE.- No; with a railway through Gippsland. My authority is the statement of railway officers. It is also -nearer the other capitals. It is right that we should honour the provision in the Constitution which says that the Capital shall be in New South Wales, but not within 100 miles of Sydney. Those who have regard to business honesty are careful to redeem -.their promissory notes, and we should redeem our promise in this matter. The people of New South Wales were opposed to Federation, because they could not get their own way in regard to certain matters; but they accepted the draft Constitution when the provision was inserted in' it fixing the Capital in that State. It is best for the country that we should settle this question now and finally. I consider the proposed site one which, in the national interest, is a suitable one for the Capital, and I hope that the matter will soon be dealt with finally. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to call the attention of the Minister to the fact that the proposed Federal territory on which the Capital will be located will be separated from its port and navy by a strip of New South Wales territory. Experience is the unerring test of all human undertakings, the light by which we should be guided. When the American Civil War started, the army was mobbed in Baltimore, because it had to cross Maryland to get to Washington. Abraham Lincoln had to sneak into the Capital because he would have been murdered in Baltimore. Had not George B. McLellan taken the army suddenly into Maryland, and put the State under martial law, the position would have been very serious, as the Capital was practically hemmed in, with only its outlet to the bay. If New South Wales desired to make trouble, she could do so under the present arrangement. </para>

But a few decades later there was a rebellion in that country which cost thousands of lives, and meant an expenditure of millions of pounds. It is not very long since the Premier of New South Wales broke open a Commonwealth Customs House, and seized wire netting. Had it not been for the patience and diplomacy of our Prime Minister, we might have had a rebellion then, with the Premier of the State, acting as a Bob Tombs and a Jeff Davis, at the head of it. What I suggest is that the Commonwealth should have a roadway 7 miles wide, from the Territory to the Bay, similar to that which  President  Roosevelt obtained from the Government of Panama. This would enable us to have free access to our navy. </para>

I see that we are certain to adopt the Yass-Canberra proposal, though I feel that it would have been better to stick to Dalgety. That was the choice of the Treasurer; but it was the splendid tales of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro which got me to look into the matter. I feel now that Dalgety is a site where we could nurture a great and powerful people. I hope that the Minister will ask the Premier of New South Wales to give us this road of access. </para>

                        <para>.- I tried to catch your eye last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> but you called the Minister of Defence, who closed the debate, and consequently prevented me from making the personal explanation which I intend to make now. I, and a number of others on this side, voted against the naval proposals of the Government yesterday, not because we were opposed to the adoption of a scheme for the naval defence of Australia, but as a protest against the methods which were being adopted to pass the motion before the House. I make this statement with the knowledge that on public platforms men, on occasions, make extreme statements; and it may be taken that, because honorable members voted against the motion, they did not believe in establishing anything in the form of an Australian navy. I think it advisable to make this explanation in my own interests, as well as in the interests of those who took action similar to mine. </para>
