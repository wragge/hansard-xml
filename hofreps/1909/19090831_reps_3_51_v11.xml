                        <para>- When the Coinage Bill was under discussion here, the Treasurer undertook that the word <inline font-style="italic">Imperator</inline> should not appear on the new coins, but, judging by an apparently inspired paragraph in yesterday's press, because the wording was practically the same in both newspapers, it is intended to reconsider the matter. As the Bill was allowed to pass on the faith of the honorable gentleman's promise, does  he propose to depart from the undertaking which he gave without bringing the matter again before honorable members? </para>

                        <para>- I transmitted a request to the Admiralty through the representative of the Commonwealth in London. After consideration, the Commander in Chief replied that, as fifteen vessels had crossed, or were about to cross, the probable track of the <inline font-style="italic">Waratah,</inline> the despatch of war vessels was regarded as unnecessary ; also that at present there were none which could be spared from other duties. As the honorable member has taken a special interest in this question, let me add that a deputation, which waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs this morning urged that this Government should consider the matter, and its representations are under consideration. A week ago, having obtained, through the courtesy of a naval officer here, particulars of the drift of the <inline font-style="italic">Waikato,</inline> a steamer which, ten years since, broke its propeller while off the coast of South Africa, I had the six important points of its course telegraphed to Cape Colony, and have since been informed by the Premier that he has caused them to be published in the press, for the information of all vessels likely to cross the track. </para>

                        <para>- Is the Prime Minister in a position to give the House the terms of the agreement come to at the Imperial Conference regarding the Australian naval unit? Can he say whether it is an extension of the present agreement, or whether the vessels are to be wholly owned and controlled by this Government, subject to subsidiary arrangements with the Imperial navy authorities? I have been unable to discover from the press reports of the remarks of the Prime Minister of the United . Kingdom what arrangement has been come to. </para>

                        <para>- To prevent misapprehension, it would perhaps be best to reserve the statement of particulars in the agreement until we can present them as a coherent whole. I am in a position to say that the proposal which will be submitted in accordance with the recommendations  of  the Conference provides, not for an extension of the present agreement, but for the substitution for the existing squadron  of  a new unit, which, in times of peace, will be wholly under Commonwealth control. This unit will consist of Commonwealth ships, manned, as far as possible, by Australian seamen, with officers and men lent by, or transferred from, the Royal Navy, to make up the full strength. The construction of the three additional destroyers will be undertaken in Australia, if sufficient inducements offer. Our advisers say that the arrival of the third of the three destroyers already ordered, which is to be put together here, will make it possible to determine what Australian ports possess facilities for the construction  of  vessels of this type. The new unit will be entirely Australian, and on a basis quite different from that of the existing squadron. </para>

                        <para>- When the Bill was in Committee two questions arose, which I promised to look into. One was in regard to the style and title of  His  Majesty the King on the obverse side of the coins, and the other with regard to what should appear on the reverse side - whether there should be an outline map of Australia with " Australia " across it, or there should appear the coat of arms of the Commonwealth. I undertook, in regard to the style and title of  His  Majesty, to make inquiries; and I find that, by the Imperial Royal Titles Act of 1901, the King was empowered, with a view to a recognition of the Dominions beyond the seas, to make such additions as he might think fit. On the 4th November' following, a proclamation was issued, copies of which were sent to all the Governments in Australia, adding to the style and titles already in existence the words " and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas," in English. That was how the matter stood when the Coinage Bill was introduced. </para>

On the 6th of this month, the Prime Minister, at my request, asked the Imperial Government, through the Secretary of State for the Colonies, whether there would be any objection to inserting on our coinage, instead of " King and Emperor," the words " King of the Dominions beyond the Seas," or " King of all the Britains." </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is referring to the British coins. A reply has been received from the Secretary of State to the effect that  His  Majesty's Royal style and titles were fixed by proclamation of 4th November, 1901, under the Royal Titles Act 1901, and that inscriptions upon coinage ought to conform to the wording so prescribed, subject to such abbreviations as may reasonably be necessary for numismatic reasons. It is added that -" of the suggestions of your Government, the former - King of Dominions Beyond the Seas - is, in the opinion of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, open to objection as entirely omitting some of the most material parts of the style and title, while the latter - King of all the Britons - has the effect of substituting a national for a territorial designation." The Lords of the Treasury fear that it would be somewhat difficult to formulate any alternative to the abbreviation " King and Emperor," which would, with respect to the English style and title, satisfy the above conditions. The cablegram concludes with these words " presume that in the circumstances of the case, your Ministers will wish to adhere to the inscription ' King and Emperor.' " I may say that the Government propose to do so. In Canada, which is the great Dominion similar to Australia, with a separate silver coinage, and with a Constitution in many respects like ours, the inscription on the coin is "Edward VII., by the Grace of God, King and Emperor," in Latin. The inscription in Cyprus is the same, while in nine other British possessions - British East Africa, British Honduras, Jamaica, Nigeria, Uganda, Ceylon, British Guiana, Hong Kong, and Straits Settlements - the inscription is " Edward VII., King and Emperor," in English. </para>

                        <para>- That is so.I have considered the question of the design on the reverse side of the coin since the debate in this Chamber, and am prepared, unless there is some very valid objection, to substitute for the map of Australia with the word "Australia" across it the coat-of-arms of Australia as was suggested by many honorable members. It seems to me and to the Government, after giving the matter consideration, that that is more in keeping with the custom with regard to inscriptions on coins than would be a map of Australia, which is, perhaps, more suitable for a medal. We therefore propose to have the coat of arms of Australia on the reverse side, and on the obverse to follow the example of Canada ; but to have the inscription in English instead of Latin, and to leave out the words "Dei gratia," which would take up some room, and are used only in a few places. We are influenced in the course which we have decided to take by the cablegram that we received, and that shows that there are difficulties. Reading between the lines the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury really express in it a hope that we will not seek to alter that which is customary in other parts of the British Empire. That being so, and having no objection personally, I have recommended that we should retain what is the custom in Canada and in a great many other parts of the British Empire. </para>

                        <para>- I sincerely regret the Treasurer's action. The cablegram upon which he put so much stress is a very mild one for a Government to found a policy on. The words " King and Emperor " which the right honorable gentleman desires to place on the obverse of the first Commonwealth coinage are not true in fact, whatever they may be in the minds of the Government. The King is not Emperor of the whole of the Dominions. He is King of Great Britain and Emperor of India. To say that he is Emperor of the Commonwealth is to say what is not a fact. </para>

                        <para>- That is the same reply as was previously given by the Treasurer and other Ministers. They said that everybody understood that the King was not Emperor of the Commonwealth. The honorable member for Parkes will surely agree with me that as an intelligent community we ought to express our ideas on our coinage in an intelligible way. Jf the Government are determined to have the word " Emperor " on the Australian coinage they should add the qualification " of India." </para>

                        <para>- That would be better than " Emperor of the Commonwealth." The description "King" alone would be quite understandable, but " King and Emperor " is a travesty of titles and wilfully misleading. The Treasurer has evidently made up his mind to have that inscription on our coins, and apparently is determined to have his way. I desire that I and those who think with me should be afforded an opportunity to put our views of the matter on record, and to test the question of whether the Government have taken the right step or not. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Indi is quite incapable of understanding a subject of this kind, and endeavours to be amusing when he is only rude. I discussed the question at great length before, and the Treasurer resisted my contention as long as he could. I listened carefully to the cablegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, which was read by the Treasurer, and, as I understand it, the Imperial authorities will at once agree to any inscription that we may decide to place upon our coinage. But apparently it is the express wish of the Government that a misdescription shall be placed upon the first coins issued by the Commonwealth. </para>

The chief trouble of the people of Australia will be to get a sufficient number of these coins when they are in circulation. I do not know why the Treasurer desires us to place upon our new coinage the words, "King and Emperor," seeing that he apparently wishes us to include the word " Commonwealth." </para>

                    <para>- I should like to know whether the Treasurer is willing to take the opinion of the Committee upon the question which we have just been discussing? Will he afford us an opportunity of voting upon it? Of course, I am in favour of the amendments, but before the Bill passes from this Chamber, the Committee ought to have been given an opportunity of recording its judgment upon the matter of the inscription to be placed upon the first Commonwealth coinage. </para>

                    <para>. - As the Treasurer has remarked, these amendments are really consequential upon an amendment made by this Committee. When the Bill was previously before this Chamber, the honorable member for Balaclava moved that the words " or nickel " should be inserted in the clause under consideration. I pointed out at the time that as no provision had been made in regard to the fineness of the nickel to be used in the coins it would be necessary to make consequential amendments. These have been made by the Senate, and in the form in which the Bill now appears the provision prescribing the fineness of that metal will be made by proclamation. The words " dimensions, designs, and," have been omitted from the clause because there are no " designs " or " dimensions" mentioned in the schedule. The dimensions and designs of silver, bronze, and nickel coins will, therefore, be settled by proclamation under clause 8. I think that when we come to discuss that clause honorable members will have an opportunity of expressing their views upon the question of the inscription which should be placed upon the proposed new coins. </para>

I think that the amendments of the Senate constitute an improvement on the Bill as it left this Committee. Since then, I have ascertained that the nickel coins issued by the United States are not composed exclusively of nickel. They contain a certain quantity of alloy, and as we propose to issue similar coins, it is necessary that we should agree to amendments somewhat upon the lines of those made by the Senate. </para>

To some extent the design of the coins must determine their dimensions. I assume that the Government desire to obtain the opinion of the Committee upon this question. We ought to have an opportunity of expressing a clear opinion upon the proposition. Even so autocratic a gentleman as the Treasurer is surely not anxious to have this inscription placed upon the coins without affording the Committee an opportunity of expressing its view. </para>

                        <para>- I think that those who took part in the division would understand what the object was. Personally, I do not care whether the word " Emperor" is agreed to or not ; but it is a most improper position for the Government to take up to refuse facilities for the Committee to take a clear vote on the question. So long as a division is taken it is a matter of indifference to me whether I am on the winning or the losing side. </para>

                    <para>.- If the honorable member for Boothby desires to secure a convenient opportunity of taking a vote on the question, a better one can be found than the one which he has suggested. The difficulty of following the course suggested by him is that honorable members who are not now present would not, when they came in to vote, understand the real question underlying the proposition regarding the addition of the letter " s." But I draw the honorable member's attention to the fact that in amendment No. 8 another place has suggested an entirely new sub-clause which is now before this Committee for the first time. It is, therefore, possible to add any words to that sub-clause. I suggest that the honorable member for Boothby might move to add any words he pleases to the sub-clause to enable him to test the proposition which he wishes to make with reference to the King's title. It would then be clear, from the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> what the intention was. I do not think there could be any reasonable objection to such a course. </para>

                <para class="block">The proposed new paragraph refers only to nickel coins, but if my amendment be accepted it can be taken by the Government as an indication of the desire of the Committee, and we can, on this amendment, discuss what design should be adopted. I intend to take advantage of the opportunity to vote only in favour of a recognition in the inscription on the coinage of the actual position of  His  Majesty the King, so far as Australia is concerned. He is not Emperor of Australia. If he were, no one would object to say so on our coin. The title of Emperor is one which Britishers generally do not worship. They prefer the old English title of King. I shall object to the use of the word " Emperor " on our coinage unless the words " of India" are added to it. If we inscribe on our coins " King of Britain, Emperor of India," there can be no objection. </para>

                        <para>- By Imperial legislation the King is "Emperor of India." I should think that no member of the Committee would have any objection to that title being inscribed on our coinage. But to use the inscription " King and Emperor " would be absurd, since it would indicate that the King is Emperor of Australia, which is contrary to the fact. If we adhere to the inscription on British coinage we shall have no difficulty. I ask the Committee to agree to accept my amendment with a view to testing the question as to what should be the titular inscription on our coins. </para>

                <para>Mi. WILKS (Dalley) [4.9].- I do not think the public are very much concerned about the inscription to be placed on our coinage. As one of the representatives of the public, I should be satisfied to have one coinage only for the Empire, if we might secure the profit on the minting of the coins we use in Australia, I personally have no wish that the design of the existing coinage should be altered, and I do not think the people of Australia desire it either. But if we are to adopt a distinct design, and for the first time use the word " Commonwealth " on our coinage, it is certainly absurd that we should attach to it the word " Emperor." The use of those two words would be inconsistent. It is bad enough to speak of " King" and "Commonwealth," but even sticklers for loyalty must agree that it would be absurd to speak of "the King and Emperor of the Commonwealth." Even the term "  His  Majesty." is not in accord with British loyal sentiment. It is an adaption from the time of Louis XI. lt is a. French term. I think it is absurd for honorable members to plead for the use of the word " Emperor " on our coins, in order to show their loyalty. It is on h a few years since the Earl of Beaconsfield, who imagined that he was performing a gracious act, took steps to proclaim our late illustrious  Queen Empress of India. That change in the Royal style, however, was due to no national movement, but simply to the act of a Prime Minister, who was anxious to signalize a political act- of his own. </para>

                    <para>- Exactly ; and the honorable member for Boothby is now asking Australia's House of Commons - that is to say, this House - to approve of an inscription for our coins. Why should we empower a Minister to use the style " King and Emperor " on our coins, merely because he sees that* inscription on other coins? The Treasurer may rest assured that those who take our coins will not bother their heads about the inscription. It would be foolish on our part to sanction the use of the words " King and Emperor." I am quite content with the use of the word "King,"  because His Majesty is King of the Commonwealth. If, however, honorable members would like to use the style " King of all the Britains " I should not object, but I do object to the use of the words " King and Emperor." I think that scarcely a Britisher - cares for the title of Emperor, and that style is only used by His Majesty in relation to India. He is Emperor of India, but King of the British Dominions. It would place the Commonwealth in an absurd position if we adopted the style "King and Emperor." </para>

It was in  1876  that, for reasons pertaining to the East, not the Earl of Beaconsfield, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Disraeli,</inline> desired to clothe her late Majesty with a title which would raise the Queen of England to a higher altitude in the Indian mind. The natives of India are referred to as our Indian fellow subjects, but the proper term to employ would be our " fellow servile subjects," because no man would dare to mount a platform in Australia and say that a man or a woman of this country should not have a vote. In India, however, no person of British blood is entitled to vote.  The Englishman who has the suffrage in England is disfranchised as soon as he lands on the shores of India. </para>

It is possible that there are members of the National Council appointed from the various Presidencies, but there is no franchise similar to that which obtains in the French and Portuguese Indian territories. </para>

                        <para>- Has the honorable member ever attended any of its meetings? If he had, he would laugh at the pettiness of the 'body. He is aware that the Indian in French territory has the right of electing a man to represent him, but that privilege England has not yet given to an Englishman, an Irishman, or a Scotchman in the Empire of India. I resent strongly the use of the word " Emperor " on Australian coins. I know of only one civilized country in this world where the name of "Emperor" is tolerated, and that is Germany. But the German Emperor is King, not Emperor, of Prussia. The Royal Titles Bill was not palatable to the English mind when it was brought in. It will be remembered that at that time the House of Commons was elected on a degraded franchise which was the laughing stock of the civilized world. In  1876  the British franchise was an abomination that would stink in the nostrils of any honest Australian politician. Is there one member of this House who would dare to ask Australia to accept the British franchise of to-day, let alone what it was thirty odd years ago? I ask the attention of honorable members while 1 read a few quotations from G. Barnett Smith's <inline font-style="italic">History of the British Parliament -</inline></para>

                        <para>- The seeds of titles are often sown long before they mature. A sum of money is given to assist perhaps a college or other educational establishment, and, ten years afterwards, a title for the giver follows. There are wheels within wheels, and at times it takes a good deal of grease to keep the machine in motion. I do not say that any honorable member here is now influenced by the desire to obtain honours, but I declare that the title Emperor can never be properly used in connexion with the ruler of the country which has the freest franchise in the world. Is it not an insult to our intelligence to propose the use of that title on our coins? The budding Australian Democracy will look with contempt and loathing on the Ministry which is the means of bringing it about, and, whatever honours may be earned in consequence will not repay the recipients for the disgrace. In the House of Commons, the Liberal party, which was then in Opposition, was strongly opposed to the assumption by  Her  late Majesty of the title of Empress of India. In 1876, the Marquis of Hartington moved that- </para>

                </quote>
                <para>The Treasurer will riot assert that the Marquis of Hartington was not loyal to his Sovereign. The meaning underlying the title " King " is the possession of superior qualities, making the holder a leader of men, such as were the chiefs whom the old German tribesmen . bore on their shields after election. The king is the " cunning " man, that is, in the old sense of the word, the man of much knowledge. As for the term " Emperor," wherever it is used, with one exception, human beings are debased. It is ridiculous that, in this twentieth century, the Government should consider such a title applicable to the ruler of Australia. Ministers could not defend their proposal on any platform. The amendment of the Marquis of Hartington was defeated by 305 votes to 200. On the 3rd April following, when the Royal Titles Bill was in Committee in the House of Lords, the assumption by the Queen of the title Empress of India was objected to. Would any one speak of the House of Lords as disloyal, although that glorious assembly, by a majority of 39 in 1884, declared that it was not absurd for three members to constitute the quorum of a House of six hundred members? The Earl of Shaftesbury moved that the title Empress be objected to, but the amendment was defeated, the "contents" being 137, and the "noncontents " 91. I dare say the whips never had a harder eight hours' work than in getting together that majority. On the 2nd May, 1876, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in reply to the Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> James, said, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> that it had been stated - on the 20th March, 1876 - that it was the intention of the Government to advise that the title of Emperor should not be borne in Great Britain, but should be a title of' a local character, to be confined to India. What right has the. Treasurer, or the Ministry, in the face of these precedents, to try to apply the title to Australia? No Act has been passed by the British Parliament so applying it. Twenty years ago, I was an acknowledged Republican, and, theoretically, ' am so still, though willing to acknowledge the King of England, because of the danger looming in the East. But I am not willing to acknowledge an Emperor. I detest, loathe, and look with contempt upon that title. Why should we have this impertinence thrust upon us? If the Ministry is able, by reason of the support given to it, to have the title of Emperor placed on our coins, I shall denounce it on every platform, and quote what has been said in the House of Commons and the House of Lords on the subject. Let us be content with the profit which the English Government is generously giving to us. I do not think that it wishes to smear its gift with slime. If Great Britain wished us to place the title Emperor on our coins, it would have declared its wish in an Act. God give Ministers sense to change their minds, so that this foolish proposal may not be persisted in ! It may be asked, why should it matter whether the title Emperor or the title King is used? I have never seen, under the English flag, as I have seen on the Continent, a citizen spit on a coin because of the effigy- stamped upon it. I do not wish that to happen in any British country. Yet there are men who feel as strongly as I do, that the title of Emperor should not be used. Should it be adopted, I shall use all my influence to bring about an alteration. Have the Government intimated that they have received instructions from England that the word " Emperor " is to be used? </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. Is the Ministry, which comprises several titled members, proceeding on the principle of " Scratch my back and I'll scratch yours ? " Do they think that the King of England, who displays acute perception and a charming grace in meeting ambassadors and courtiers of other countries', and paving the way for peace, will be pleased if this word appears on our coinage? Will he not rather say that the matter is too contemptible for his notice? Will he look with favour upon the Ministry because they propose to make this inscription, or will he not rather say : ' ' Without any direction from us the Commonwealth are going to use this word." </para>

                        <para>- He may use an even harsher term. I have yet to learn of a powerful newspaper that has heartily supported the use of the word "Emperor" in connexion with our coinage. Who are the Kings of the world? I do not know of one King who is worshipped as a deity, but I know of Emperors who are regarded as something in the nature of a deity. </para>

                        <para>- No Emperor has lived to see his country advance with such rapid strides as Japan has made. Generally, where the title "Emperor" is observed there is injury to the people; but under a limited monarchical system, as in the case of Great Britain, the people are better governed. This is the only Parliament that dominates a whole continent, and is it because of that fact that the Government desire that the word "Emperor" shall appear on our silver coins? I hope that the Treasurer will agree to do away with this absurdity. If he will not do so, then I trust that the Committee will throw it on the dung-hill of oblivion, and leave it there to rot and finally to disappear. If adult suffrage prevailed in Great Britain, the servile population of India would be much better governed than it is. The only country in which I would allow the word " Emperor " to be used is India, where more people starve than' in any other part of the world. The " King of England" is a great title running through the history of the British race, and with its use I am content. I do not suggest that I should have been satisfied with it when it stood for greater power than the King of England possesses today. Since the days when Oliver Cromwell taught the kingly power that it should not try to oppress the people, every King of England has had his power more restricted, and I laugh to scorn the proposal that we should use the word " Emperor '.' on the coinage of the white people of a great continent. </para>

                    <para>.- The question involved is one, not of loyalty or disloyalty, but of fact. I have noticed that the word "Emperor" is not used on British coins except in conjunction with the word " India." To be correct we must either omit from our coinage the words "Emperor of India," or we must use the word "India" in conjunction, with the word " Emperor." I am strongly opposed to the use of the words " King and Emperor," without the correct qualification. It may be said that the question is of no importance, but there is a constitutional principle at stake. </para>

                    <para>-- I feel strongly on this question, and would remind the Committee that when this Bill was before us on a former occasion I first opposed the use of the word " Emperor." As a matter of history, I opposed its use on a previous occasion, and was very much surprised when the Treasurer announced to-day that he proposed that it should appear on the new coinage. When I asked why the Imperial authorities should have denied us the right to place on our coins what words we thought fit to use; he said that, under the Royal Titles Act of 1901 a certain proclamation had been issued adding to His Majesty's previous title the words " and of the British Dominions beyond the seas." I am inclined to think that the right honorable gentleman has read the proclamation carelessly. I find that it reads -  ....... And whereas Our present </para>

                <para>Style and Titles are....... in the </para>
                <para>English tongue, " Edward VII., by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the. Faith, Emperor of India." We have thought fit, by and with the advice of Our Privy Council, to appoint and declare, and We do hereby, by and with the said advice, appoint and declare that henceforth . . . the following addition shall be made to the Style and Titles at present appertaining to the Imperial Crown of the United Kingdom and its dependencies; that is to say ... in the English tongue, after the words " of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland," these words "and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas." </para>
                <para class="block">The title, therefore, reads not " Emperor of India and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas," but  " Edward VII.' by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India." The phrase " and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas " is inserted before the word "King," and "Emperor of India"  strictly  limits the title of Emperor to the Indian Dominions. And this must be so under our Constitution, because "Emperor" is entirely foreign to us, and something we cannot understand. The word "Emperor" is either useless or useful ; if it is useless we do not desire to apply it; and if there is some purpose in it, there is the assumption of an unknown power, which, as I say, is entirely foreign to our Constitution. If the word is intended to be useful, it is full of danger; but the Prime Minister, when </para>
                <para class="block">I first drew attention to the matter, said that "King" stands for Australia and " Emperor " expresses a connexion with and an obligation to the Empire. But does it? The only part of the Empire to which "Emperor." is applied is India, and, therefore, in using the word as applied to Australia, we are deliberately cutting ourselves off from Canada, South Africa and the other self-governing parts of the Empire. The word " Emperor," instead of being inclusive of Empire is exclusive, since it is limited to India. I am sorry that the Government after observing the tone of the Committee- </para>

                        <para>- The use of the word as proposed, instead of meaning loyalty, will mean disloyalty to the rest of the' self-governing colonies where " King " is the only word recognised. If the Treasurer is acting under misconception as to the words " and of the British  Dominions  beyond the Seas" being added at the end of the list of titles, perhaps he will see his way to graciously yield to what is undoubtedly the desire of honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- If the Treasurer had done himself justice, he would have inquired into the circumstances of the creation of the late Queen Victoria, as Empress of India, and have acquainted himself with the fact that there was much indignation and alarm in England at the proposal, there being a feeling that the idea was to apply the title of " Empress" in England as well as in India. The objections were got over by a subterfuge, ' as is shown clearly by a recent criticism by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson.</inline> Dobbs published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> It was there stated that the real reason for conferring the title was that, when certain of the Queen's daughters went over to Germany, they would not take precedence of the daughters of an emperor; and, at any rate, the title of "Empress of India" was conferred only on the distinct promise that it should not be used out of India. If this were purely a Ministerial idea I should say that it was only a display of weakness, but we find that as a result of communications from the Colonial Office the desire apparently is to extend the use of the word "Emperor" from India to all the self-governing dominions, and finally to have it applied to the United Kingdom. In 1901 I protested, as I still protest, against the use by the English sovereign of the word " Emperor " in relation to us. It is applied to us now in proclamations by means of the title " Edward R.I." The King does not attempt to use that addition in England, nor do his advisers permit him to do so, but this is now a serious attempt to apply the title " Emperor " to all the rest of the Empire and finally to England. As far as we can support the forces of freedom we should do so, for once the right to apply the title of "Emperor" as regards us is granted, we shall see a repetition of the advice given by George III. to his own son George - " George, be a king." An Emperor will attempt to justify and live up to the title. There are a lot of people who are now trying to stem the forces of Democracy. Seeing that the House of Lords has lost its old constitutional position as a protection against the increasing tide of Democracy, and that the House of Commons has obtained a supremacy which was not originally intended for it in the Constitution, there is not the slightest doubt that many people are trying, by magazine articles and in other ways, to increase the influence of the Court and Sovereign as a bulwark of property and other forms of Conservatism. Every attempt is, therefore, being made now to magnify the position of the King by statements as to his great influence in foreign affairs, and by allowing him to act as his own Foreign Minister in different directions. All these things represent an attempt to magnify the King's office and take him out of the constitutional position which has been created for him by at least 100 years of precedents. In this attempt to increase the office of the King, certain persons are using first the oversea dominions and afterwards will seek to include the United Kingdom. Even in this apparently small matter we should stand up for our rights, because we are fighting, not merely against the application of a word, but for loyalty to constitutional principles. In grave issues of this sort, words are sometimes taken at their true and fullest meaning. If we once admit the word " Emperor " on our coinage, as we unfortunately get it now in proclamations from the Colonial Office, an attempt will be made by some sovereign on a later occasion to live up to the title and to be an Emperor to us. We do not want an Emperor. We have a Constitution. We know where the King stands, and what he stands for. We are loyal to the idea of King, because we know that he has limitations and duties as well as privileges. But because we too have our rights and duties and responsibilities to the people of Australia, we ought to resist in every way this attempt to use words in a way which is not justified by the Constitution. </para>

We, the people, not subjects at the command of any one, agreed to federate. The people themselves decided to do this, and then a Government of this young Commonwealth, having the control of the representative Chamber, communicate with the British Government and ask them if in their view the word "Emperor" should be put on our first coins. It is a deliberate insult to the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I speak as a layman. I do not think it wise to exclude the word " King" from our coins, but I think that constitutionally we have the right to do <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> if we so desire. I should as strongly object to the omission of the word " King " as I object now to the inclusion of the word " Emperor," because the King is the authority under which our constitutional government is carried on. We have heard from time to time that this great country of Australia may at some future date be made a sacrifice for the benefit of the Empire. I do not believe that Great Britain will ever sacrifice Australia in bartering with other nations for her own protection or safety, but if we admit that we are a people living under the rule of an Emperor, of course it could be claimed that we were absolutely subject to the Emperor's commands. Everybody knows what the Australian people would do if an attempt . ever were made to offer them up as a sacrifice to another nation. The Prime Minister has really attempted to shirk proper consideration being given to this question. In the first place, he declared himself in favour of the inscription </para>

He practically says that he has the authority of the Imperial Government for the view which he holds. This is a young nation, which is destined to become great, and in the future the British Empire will be stronger just in proportion to the independence which is shown by the young nations included in it. Therefore, I trust that we shall not make the initial error of placing upon our proposed new coins an inscription which does not convey an accurate statement of fact and which will not impress the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sorry that this question has been debated at such length, and that the suggestion has been made that I particularly desire the word " Emperor " to appear upon the proposed coinage. I should like to tell the Committee the whole history of this question. When we' were arranging for the issue of the proposed coins, the Imperial Government was asked to suggest what words should be placed on the obverse side of the coins in addition to the King's head, The Mint authorities cabled to say that they suggested the adoption of the words <inline font-style="italic">" Rex et Imperator,"</inline> or, in English, "' King and Emperor." I consulted the Prime Minister, and we thought that ft would be better to adopt the English form. The question whether any objection would be raised to the use of the word " Emperor " did not then arise, because it did not occur to either of us that the meaning could be other than that His Majesty was Emperor of India. We never thought that any one would put the view that it was possible to construe the designation so as to infer that he was Emperor of Australia. We knew very well, of course, that he was not. Another reason for using the word " Emperor " which occurs to me is that, when giving a designation to any person, the rule is to use his highest title, if he has several. If a person be a Knight of the Garter, and also a Knight of some other Order, the higher one is invariably used. It is quite true that when the Bill came before this House objections to the use of the title " Emperor " were made; but I did not take it that the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">House was by any means unanimous, or even that there was a majority against the adoption of that term. Honorable members knew what the title " King and Emperor " meant. No one thought that it meant that  His  Majesty was Emperor of Australia. But being desirous, as I always am - though I may be a little hasty sometimes - to meet the wishes of the House, I said that we would consider the matter. Accordingly, I asked the Prime Minister to telegraph to the Imperial authorities again. He sent a cablegram through the Secretary of State for the Colonies, asking whether there would be any objection to inserting on our coinage, instead of the title "King and Emperor," the words "King of the Dominions beyond the Seas," or " King of all the Britons." The reply that came from the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in response to the Prime Minister's telegram stated "that the inscription on our coins ought to conform to the wording of the Royal Titles Act, with such abbreviations as might reasonably be adopted for numismatic reasons." The reply went onto deal with the suggestion which we made to use the style " King of the Dominions beyond the Seas." In the opinions of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury " that style was open to the objection of entirely omitting reference to some parts of the Empire." The title so suggested omitted all reference to  His  Majesty being King of Great Britain and Ireland. That, I consider, was a very proper criticism. As to the alternative suggestion - that we should use the designation " King of all the Britons," the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury said " that it. would have the effect of substituting a national for a territorial designation." If we had suggested " King of all the Britains," I do not know that that objection would have been raised. They " feared that it would be somewhat difficult to formulate an alternative to the abbreviation formerly suggested," and they went on to say that " they presumed that, under the circumstances of the case, the Ministers of the Commonwealth would wish to adhere to the inscription ' King and Emperor.' " We considered that, as we had made an inquiry and had received that reply, Parliament would be satisfied, and that this Committee would allow the matter to go without further suggestion. I see now, however, that a considerable number of honorable members still adhere to their objection to the use of the word "Emperor," and the only way out of the difficulty would appear to be to make further inquiry. We could express the meaning more briefly in Latin than in English. </para>

                        <para>- In a question of this sort, I consider that unanimity is desirable. It is largely a matter of sentiment, and I do not think that we should force our idea through Committee by virtue of a narrow majority, or even a considerable one. Before, however, I can come to a final determination, I must have a further opportunity of considering the matter. If honorable members will allow the Bill to go through now, they will be in no worse position in regard to the matter than they are at present; and, in the meantime, we will see whether we cannot despatch another cablegram suggesting an inscription in Latin. We might adopt the style"Edwardus <inline font-style="italic">VII., Rex, et ImperatorInd."</inline> That would distinctly state that His Majesty was Emperor of India. </para>

                        <para>- I think we ought to do so. The issue of coinage, including the inscription of the King's titles, is a prerogative. We all know, however, that the Imperial Government are desirous of meeting the wishes of the Legislatures of the Dominions ; and we should not in these matters, which are to a great extent of national importance, act independently and without consulting the Imperial authorities. My advice is that we should get on with the Bill now, and leave the title in abeyance. The inquiries which I propose to make would perhaps take a week. </para>

                    <para>.- I asked the Treasurer, in the course of his remarks, whether he would agree to omit the word " Emperor " or to limit it by a definition. He said that he would make inquiries. 1 do not feel that I am in a position to accept the right honorable gentleman's view. He has merely promised to send a telegram to London. I maintain that the Colonial Office has no power to say what we should put on our own coinage, although the greatest consideration should be given to any advice that they may offer. I shall have to call for a division, because the presumption is that the Treasurer will ' accept the advice that is offered to him. </para>

                    <para>.- As the Leader of the Opposition desires that we should have an entirely distinct and separate Australian coinage, it is, no doubt, consistent with that desire that he should ask that the King's title, as appearing on our coinage, should be different from that which appears on coins minted in other parts of the King's Dominions. As Australia is amongst the King's Dominions Beyond the Seas, it is impossible that the King's title, as regards Australia, should be inscribed in full on our coins. I regard the whole matter as a storm in a teapot. What does it matter whether the title inscribed on our coinage is King " or " King and Emperor " ? </para>

                        <para>- As honorable members opposite are determined at this juncture to test the opinion of the Committee, I suggest that the Treasurer should ask those who are prepared to allow the matter to be settled after negotiation with the Imperial authorities to support the Government, whilst those who have such an objection to consultation with the Imperial authorities, and desire that the matter should be settled before there can be any consultation with them, could record their votes against the motion submitted by the Treasurer. With the information we have at present on the subject, it is quite impossible for any member of the Committee to cast an intelligent vote on one side or the other, but honorable members opposite are anxious to express an opinion beforehand which they think will be contrary to the views of the Imperial authorities. That is only in consonance with the whole trend of their actions during the last five or six years. As keen students of heraldry, they have pressed their other suggestion, that the Australian coat-of-arms rather than the map of Australia, should appear on our coinage. I suggest that the issue to be placed before the Committee should not be that put by the Leader of the Opposition, who may be an infallible authority on heraldry, if not on titles, but should be whether the Committee desire that this matter should be the subject of negotiation with the Imperial authorities, trusting generally that something reasonable will be done. </para>

                        <para>- That is a very extraordinary interpretation to place on my remarks. Honorable members opposite have succeeded in inducing the Treasurer, to consent to change the proposed design of our Australian coinage from the map of Australia to the coat-of-arms of Australia. If we are to change the Imperial design - and I shall not go into the merits of that question now - the map of Australia will, in my humble opinion, be a much better design than would be the coat-of-arms of Australia. Who on earth cares a twopenny dump about coats-of-arms in these days? </para>

                        <para>- We do not all desire it. The Treasurer has listened to the Leader of the Opposition, who is probably more interested in heraldry than are other members of the Committee, but I can assure him that many think that, if it is intended to alter the Imperial design in minting our coinage, no better design than that of the map of Australia could be adopted. It would, on the face of it, indicate the country for which the coinage is made, and would be infinitely preferable to the coat-of-arms of Australia. I hope we shall have no more of this snobbish rubbish about coats-of-arms. Let us show a proper pride in what we all have good cause to be proud of, namely, the country we represent. </para>

                    <para>.- The last remarks made by the Treasurer have extended the area of discussion, and have raised a very serious issue. The right honorable gentleman has stated that, -in his opinion, in dealing with the coinage, which we are distinctly given the power to deal with under the Constitution, we are raising a matter of the King's prerogative, and should not proceed without consultation with the Colonial Office.' It is extraordinary that such a statement should be made by the Treasurer as a responsible Minister of the Crown, We are given full power under section  51  of the Constitution to deal with" the coinage, and the Treasurer should know that even in England the coinage is no longer a matter within the King's prerogative. If there were anything in the Treasurer's statement, it would be about time that we should return to the rule of " the man Rogers," notorious in Victorian political history. What is our position, if we cannot legislate in such a matter without the consent of the Colonial Office ? Believing that honorable members were against him, the Treasurer admitted that the word " Emperor " should not appear in the inscription on our coins. </para>

                        <para>- As I understood the honorable gentleman, when he found that a large minority of the Committee was against the use of the word and that such keen feeling and sentiment had been aroused, although he thought that the word should not be used, and that some Latin word should be used, he did not think that we should alter the inscription without the consent of the Colonial Office. If that is the case, we are getting into a very funny position, and the House had better shut up shop. What is the use of having a Constitution and a Parliament if the Colonial Office is to govern us by instructions? It would be an insult to my constituents to ask them to return 'me if I am only to come here and submit to the direction of the Colonial Office in connexion with Australian affairs. The Governor-General, who is stated to be the representative of the King, should not receive instructions from that office. If other honorable members had taken up the same attitude as  I  did some time ago&gt; we should have no further interference from that quarter. </para>

They could quickly bring the Colonial Office to their bearings by stating that they alone were the advisers of His Excellency. Unless we act promptly when such instructions are received here, it is of no use to call ourselves a Parliament or a responsible body. </para>

                        <para>- I would rather that a division should be taken now than that I should miss the opportunity of voting against the inclusion of these words in the inscription. The King is Emperor of India, but he is not Emperor of England, or Emperor of Scotland, or Emperor of any other part of the British Dominions. If the words " and Emperor '-' signify anything they signify that His Majesty is Emperor of that part of the British Dominions in which the coins are issued. </para>

                        <para>- From my point of view this is a matter of vast importance. The House of Commons occupied many days in discussing, not whether  Her  late Majesty should assume the title " Empress of Great Britain," but whether she should assume the title " Empress of India." The House of Lords thought the matter of so much importance that it, too, discussed the proposal, and carried it by only a narrow majority. Even those who voted in favour of the assumption of the title were opposed to its use in any part of the Dominions other than India. I suggest, in the interests of conciliation, that the business before us should be allowed to proceed; but that the Minister should give us the assurance that he will, to some extent, meet the views of those who feel strongly on this point. He tells us that he has no feeling in the matter himself, and that a number of his supporters are in that position. That is an additional reason why he should try to meet the wishes of those on this side. Another opportunity should be given to discuss the proposal, because it is too important to pass without discussion. The Treasurer may have a majority, though probably a smaller one than he thinks ; but on a question of this kind every effort should be directed towards securing unanimity. </para>

                    <para>.- I keenly regret that the Treasurer, in his anxiety to compass the impossible, by giving more assurance to the honorable member, should give away the whole case.  His  original attitude reflected credit on him as a Minister. He said, " I take the responsibility for what is done, and I think my action the correct one." Unfortunately he has now receded from that position, and proposes to give honorable members an opportunity, after the Bill has passed, to express their dissatisfaction with what is done. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members will then be able to express disapproval of the action of one Minister only by voting against the Government. It would be better if there were a concrete proposal to vote upon. The matter is not of sufficient importance to endanger the position of a Ministry ! Does he believe that the Committee regard this matter as so unimportant that it will not be decided upon its merits ? Do the Opposition think that if the Treasurer succeeds in his proposal there is any method by which they can have their desires known, other than that of defeating the Government on a motion of no confidence, or on a division on a crucial question which will affect their fate? </para>

                    <para>.- The whole matter could be settled in a few minutes if the Treasurer would assume a reasonable frame of mind. Why should he not agree to the use of the words " King and Emperor of India," instead of " King and Emperor"? By agreeing to such an inscription as <inline font-style="italic">" Rex Ind. Imp."</inline> the difficulty would be removed, and no further time would be occupied in dealing with this question. </para>

                    <para>- - I agree with the honorable member for Corio that, if we cannot place on our coinage any words that we think fit, provided that we do not interfere in any way with the British Government, Parliament might as well close down and hand over the government of the Commonwealth to the British Legislature. Such a change would not be very serious, so far as the honorable member for Corio is concerned, because he is in reality willing now to hand over to the State Parliaments the functions of this Legislature. It is strange that the Treasurer will not agree to an inscription which would show exactly what is the King's title in relation to Australia. It is well known that he is not Emperor of the Commonwealth, and most of us recollect the discussion that took place when it was first proposed to confer on Queen Victoria the title of " Empress of India." Our silver coinage will be current only in Australia, and yet we are told that we cannot place on it what words we please. So long as we use no words suggesting disloyalty to the Throne, we ought to be permitted to place on our coinage any inscription we think fit. I believe that the objection has been raised, not by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, but by the Treasurer himself, who has given us recently an evidence of his love of titles, and no doubt wishes to place on our coins something that he thinks will sound and look well. Why should he not agree  to  something purely Australian, since our coins will not circulate outside the Commonwealth? Earlier in the afternoon he appeared to be ready, to agree to the dropping of the word " Emperor," and to stand by his former decision that the title " King of all the Britains" should be used. </para>

                        <para>- The title " King  Df  all the Britains " would be just as effective as the words " King and Emperor," and would have the additional advantage  of  being strictly accurate. This is purely an Australian coinage, and the title should be one that applies to Australia only. We have tried to coax and wheedle the Treasurer to agree to something sensible ; and if he does not do so he and his party must take the responsibility before the people. </para>

                    <para>.- I had hoped that the matter would by this time have been settled; but the Treasurer seems most determined. The honorable gentleman will allow me to quote the word of an older parliamentarian than himself - one who was acknowledged to be one of the most able Premiers we have had in Victoria - namely, the late Duncan Gillies, who said that while any one could explain away a speech to his constituents,, it was very hard to explain away a division. We say that it is our desire to have a division now. I know that when the Government once put their foot down, they can control certain members, who will be compelled to vote against their consciences ; and I, as a member of the Opposition, do not care to place any of the followers of the Government in that position. We certainly ought to have the map of Australia on our coins, so as to imprint on the mind.*, of the untold millions who will follow us the only continent that is really a white one. I should like honorable members to know what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Disraeli</inline> when he introduced the Bill conferring the title of Empress on the late Queen. He had at his back a large Conservative majority ; and yet it appears that, contrary to the usage of Parliament, leave to introduce the measure was not granted without debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Disraeli,</inline> on 18th February, 1876, quoted the following paragraph from the Queen's speech : -  1 am deeply thankful for the uninterrupted health which my dear son, the Prince of Wales, has enjoyed during his journey through India. The hearty affection with which he has been received by my Indian subjects, of all classes and races, assures me that they are happy under my rule, and loyal to my throne. At the time that the direct Government of my Indian Empire was transferred to the Crown, no formal addition was made to the style and titles of the Sovereign. I have, deemed the present a fitting opportunity for supplying this omission, and a Bill upon the subject will be presented to you. </para>

                <para class="block">That paragraph shows clearly that he never dared to intimate a desire to give the Sovereign the title of Emperor over the British race. The division list on a very strong amendment which the Marquis of Harrington subsequently moved includes many names that have become imprinted on the history of English Liberalism; and in face of their example I dare any one to say that a man who objects to the use of the title ' ' Emperor ' ' is disloyal to the Throne of England. I have sworn fealty to the King, and will loyally keep that oath ; but I have never sworn fealty, to an Emperor, nor will I ever demean my lips by doing so. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lowe,</inline> who had once been a resident of Australia, spoke after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Disraeli,</inline> and in the report of his speech appears the following passage : - </para>

                    <para>It is not very abstruse. The notion of the Crown of England being an Imperial Crown, is a very old one, as the 24th and 25th of Henry VIII. will show. At the time he had his quarrel with the Court of Rome he passed two successive Acts declaring the Crown to be an Imperial one. </para>

                <para>I doubt if Henry VIII. would ever have passed those Acts if it had not been for that quarrel. </para>
                <para>That was reiterated when James I. succeeded to the Crown of England and Scotland, and it was again reiterated in the year 1800 at the time of the Union of Great Britain and Ireland. It is, therefore, perfectly well established that the Crown of the United Kingdom of England, Scotland, and Ireland is an Imperial one. </para>
                <para class="block">The Treasurer knows that it is desired to have a vote on this question, and he naturally wants it to be taken at once; but I prefer that the matter should be put clearly first, because the question will not be ended by any division . in this Parliament. It will undoubtedly come forward again. The honorable member for Corio, who was a member of the first Federal Parliament, saw the danger, and to him should be the meed of praise for his foresight, although he little . thought that the danger would come as soon as it did. Can the Treasurer see his way clear to promise that the same inscription will be put on our coins as is put on the English coins, with the map of Australia on the reverse, which, as the honorable member for Wentworth said, would be quite a sufficient index? Surely the right honorable gentleman does not think that England would object to that. If he will agree to that course, the difficulty will be ended. He says now that he will consult his colleagues. That is quite right. He says he will telegraph to England again. That is also right; but then, he says, he will make a statement to the House. The right honorable gentleman is too old a parliamentarian not to know that that will make the position very different, for if we then desired to take action it would be necessary for us to move a motion of want of confidence in the Government. If he cannot agree to my suggestion, I must try to put the matter to him a little more fully. Does he think that Lord Palmerston looked with any favour on this new-fangled title? If he has any doubt on the matter, let me tell him what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lowe</inline> said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Both Governments no doubt - certainly that of Lord Palmerston - very carefully considered the question, and did not think it advisable to add anything to Her Majesty's title. In these matters, precedent goes for a great deal, and I have just brought under the notice of the House two cases in which the title of Emperor might have been, and was not assumed by Sovereigns of this country. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The Treasurer has taken up a position that neither Lord Palmerston nor <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> nor John Bright would take up, and I may later mention perhaps fifty other names great in the history of English Liberalism. The real advantage of the title of King is that the King rules under the law. In other words, it is the law that makes the King, whereas an Emperor is above the law, and a dictator and tyrant if he wishes, so long as he can hold sway. The title of Emperor also indicates that the country has been taken, and is being held, by force. That might by a stretch of imagination be said to apply to India; but it surely cannot pertain to Australia, which was won without the loss of a single drop of white blood. I cannot understand why the Treasurer is so tenacious for the inscription of " King and Emperor." The word " Emperor " comes from the time of Imperial Rome, and surely we should not go to the time of the Roman Emperors, besmirched as it is by infamies, and brightened only here and there by the record of a great. and good Emperor, for a name to put on the coinage of Australia. Our coins will be a greater lesson in geography, if the map of Australia is put on them, than any other that I have heard of ; but if on the other side the words " King and Emperor " appear, every man, woman and child who reads history will feel a distaste and dislike for the latter word. Its inclusion is as ridiculous as was the retention of the title " King of France " by the Kings of Great Britain for over three centuries after the British had been driven out of France. No one can forget the carnage of the second Empire of France. The title of Emperor was assumed then, and was confirmed by the slaughter and bloodshed of the barricades. </para>

                        <para>- The title of "citizen" had to be fought for and won against the powers of Kings and Emperors. The name of "citizen" is honoured in all the white parts of the British Empire; but it cannot be claimed in India, because to be a citizen is to have the right of the franchise, and in India no one has that. India, therefore, falls under the shadow of infamy which is cast in every country where the name of "Emperor" is assumed by the ruler, with only one exception. That exception would not exist if the people had power to prevent it. What became of the Empire of Brazil? It was degraded and polluted by bribery and corruption, and was ultimately swept away. Then there was the Empire of Mexico. How was it ruled? Its ruler was above the law, above right, above reason, and above the Constitution. That is what the title of Emperor implies, whereas a King is always subject to law and to the Constitution. Whenever he breaks the law and arrogates to himself more powers, he becomes a dictator, and ultimately an Emperor. Upon this question I wish to pay my meed of praise to the honorable member for Corio. I must compliment him upon having foreseen this danger. </para>

                    <para>I wish to point out to the House, and also to bring under the notice of the Government themselves, that that commission was signed by King Edward VII., under the title of King and Emperor. I think that the matter of privilege arises with regard to this House, which arose in the British House of Commons when the Royal Titles Bill was before the Legislature. The House of Commons had a very long discussion on that Bill, and it was distinctly promised then that the use of the title of Emperor should be strictly limited to India. As far as  His  Majesty the King is concerned, I am as loyal a British subject as there is. I do not wish to be misunderstood in this matter. I am a good subject of the King. I swore to bear true and faithful allegiance to  His  Majesty. I know a constitutional King, but I know no Emperor. I take it that it is a matter of importance to me, and one affecting the liberty of the citizens of this land, that King Edward VII. should assume in this commission, and that the Governor-General should have been asked to accept in it, the title of King and Emperor. Of course, I know there are some people who do not see that there is anything in this point. </para>

Nothing could add to its force, and it could only lose by being tampered with. Whatever additional titles Her Majesty might be advised to assume, he trusted that Her Majesty's present title to the Crown of the United Kingdom - " Victoria, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain and Ireland, Queen, Defender of the Faith " would remain inviolate. </para>

                    <para>. - I again give the assurance to the Committee that, though I am not prepared to make any promise that the word " Emperor " shall not appear on our coins, I will make further inquiries into the matter. I will consult others, and at a later date make a statement to the House as to the course which we finally determine to adopt - either to retain the words " King and Emperor " or to modify them. Further, I shall do my best, in the event of our determining to retain the word " Emperor," without any limitation, that is, by inserting the word " Ind.", to give honorable members an opportunity of expressing their opinion by a vote. </para>

The words which I shall quote were uttered in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percy</inline> Wyndham on the 9th March, 1876, as reported in the English <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for that year, vol. 227, column 1736. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> said : </para>

If it be true - and it is true - that we govern India without the restraints of a law except such law as we make ourselves - if it be true that we have not been able to give lo India the benefit and blessings of free institutions - I leave it lo the right honorable gentleman, if he thinks fit - to boast that he is about to place that fact solemnly upon' record.

                <para class="block">Lord Hartington was followed into the division lobby bv no fewer than 200 men, representative of the best Liberal thought in England at the time. It is interesting to look over the list of names, which included <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Bright; and it is also remarkable that whereas 80 per cent, of the members who voted with Lord Hartington were again returned to the House of Commons at the next general election, not 50 per cent, of those who voted in the contrary direction were returned. I am glad that the Treasurer at last realizes that there is something in the idea of those who opposed the use of the title of Emperor. I am an Australian, loving my country, and ' I do not want to see the name Emperor used on our coinage. It is a title which I loathe and detest. I cannot conceive that it is possible for the word to be used on Australian coins except in the contingency of this country being conquered and dominated by one of the Eastern races - perhaps China or Japan.- I for one shall never be willing that the escutcheon of Australia shall be soiled and besmirched by the use of a word which means that he who rules is above the law and independent of any Constitution. </para>

                    <para>. - We were told that the Budget now before honorable members was to be the most important ever delivered in this House ; but when we come to criticise it, we find that, apart from the borrowing policy indicated, the Treasurer's financial statement is absolutely commonplace, and as unsatisfying to honorable members as would be mustard without beef to a hungry man. The brightest portions of the Budget are not the Treasurer's own. I allude to the poetry. I was amazed at the way in which the right honorable gentleman sprawled from one poetic gem to another. He reminded me of nothing so much as of an elephant tramping about on a lovely flowerbed, very much to the detriment of the beautiful blooms. What honorable members were thirsting for was not poetry, but information, and I am sorry to say that the information they expected was not forthcoming. </para>

                        <para>- Whatever is done in our caucus can be revealed to the whole world. It is no wonder that, in the language of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> we found that the Premiers' Conference failed utterly. It failed, as the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said, in what it achieved, and in what it left undone. I believe that every member of the Committee agrees with that statement, whether he proposes to vote for the proposals of the Government or not. I think that that statement expresses the general feeling, not only in this House, but throughout the country. I regret very much that any proposal of this or any other Government of the Commonwealth should be discussed by some secret body before being submitted to this House. Surely this is the place in which these great national problems should first be dealt with, especially when they affect questions which We have entire authority to settle, and which we were sent here by the electors to settle. It is, of course, our duty to do justice to the States; but, above all things, we must conserve the interests of the Commonwealth. I maintain that that has not been done by the Government. I should like to ask from whom the Premiers' Conference derived authority ?I can find no authority for it. It seems to me that an attempt has been made to set up a kind of Federal Council to settle questions over which this Parliament, and this Parliament alone, has absolute and unfettered control. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, after the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have tried to coerce Parliament into accepting decisions arrived at by the Premiers' Conference. It was the duty of Ministers in the first place to induce this Parliament to arrive at certain decisions, and then see if the Premiers of the States were willing to accept them. If that course had been fol lowed, I am satisfied that justice would have been done to all interested. The whole object of the various Premiers' Conferences which have been held from time to time has been to coerce the Federal Government. The State Premiers had hoped that they would be able to squeeze something out of weak Federal Ministers which would be to their advantage, regardless of the extent to which the interests of the Commonwealth would suffer. I think  1  shall be able to show how the Commonwealth will suffer under the agreement arrived at with the Premiers of the States. Apparently the State Premiers were anxious that the people of Australia should believe that an eighth Parliament was established in their midst. That this might appear more likely, the Conference was opened by the Governor of the State of Victoria, with all the pomp and ceremony with which a Parliament is usually opened. That was an extraordinary procedure in the case of a body that was without authority from any one. The State Premiers who were members of the Conference had to report to their Parliaments, and the Federal Ministers who attended it had to report to this Parliament, and later the approval of the people must be secured for what has been done. I am very glad that that is so. I direct attention to the fact that no provision is made in the Budget to finance the offer to Great Britain of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> or, the afterthought, its equivalent. We find now that the equivalent is to take the form of a warship of the <inline font-style="italic">Indomitable</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Indefatigable</inline> class, and will cost a large amount of money. From the Budget I find that it is proposed that the amount to be spent on defence shall be£524,629 more than was spent on that Department last year. At first blush that seems satisfactory, but when we come to analyze it we find that it does not amount to very much. The Fisher Government proposed to spend this year 150,000 extra on defence. </para>

                        <para>- I had good reason to boast. The Labour Government would have carried out that pledge as the Labour party have carried out every pledge they have made. I am concerned to know where the present Treasurer is going to find the money, not only to meet the proposed increased expenditure on defence, but for many other things. We find that out of the proposed increased vote for defence,£227,314 is for new works, material, etc., and  £297,315  for services. Then  £163,000  is for the new cadet scheme, leaving an increase of only  £134,211  to improve the efficiency of the Defence Force, irrespective of the works vote. That is not a very large sum for the purpose. I point out that in  1908-9  the Defence vote for works and material  was £161,327  less than was provided for the same purpose in the previous year,  1907-8.  In  1908-9  the most rigid economy was practised. The defence vote was not only retrenched, but cut into the bone, for the last Deakin Government could not find enough money to send the cadets into camp. I am glad to see that the present Government are making fair provision for that purpose, but various other matters are not provided for. A very large expenditure on medical equipment is required. If we intend to have a very large cadet force, then we must provide the necessary medical equipment, and that in my opinion has not been done. The vote for works, etc., this year is only  £33,278  more than the vote was for  1907-8,  so that, after all, the increase is a mere bagatelle. For years the members of the present Government have been going all over the country telling the people how much they intended to do for the defence of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but that is only  £33,278  more than the vote for  1907-8.  Again, take the naval vote ; the increased expenditure amounts to the paltry sum of  £9,293.  That is the great provision which the Government propose to make for the naval defence of this country. But they have not the money to do even that. I do not know where they are going to find the funds; certainly we have not been told. Through their incompetence and stupidity former Governments handed over to the States large sums and seriously crippled two great services, namely, those of the Defence Department and the Post and Telegraph Department. If they had retained one-half of the money which they handed over and which they were entitled' to expend we should not have the complaints about the latter Department which we hear every day of our lives. </para>

Every day we read evidence of what even the most conservative section of the community think of the present Government, and that is not very much, according to the votes cast in one of the most conservative districts of South Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The conduct of the Government resembles that of some honorable members who extended all kinds of sympathy to South Australia, but announced their intention to vote against the proposal. Perhaps that is the kind of sympathy we shall get from some Ministers, although South Australia will not be very much disturbed if they do act in that way. In spite of the fact that some Departments have . pressing needs to be provided for, and that no money is available to carry out works which are admittedly necessary, the only policy that suggested itself to the feeble minds of the Government was a borrowing policy. </para>

                        <para>- No. We have tapped so few of our sources of taxation that it should not be necessary, for many years to come, for the Commonwealth to engage in a borrowing policy, in spite of the great works which are needed. How has the borrowing policy of the Government been received? It has been cursed by their own supporters. So far we have only heard two Government supporters on the Budget, and they denounced the action of the Government, of whom they were ashamed, and said the country must understand that it was actually proposed to borrow money to pay old-age pensions. According to recent cablegrams, it is intended to borrow, I do not know how much, to build, not an Australian Navy, but a section of the British Navy, to be stationed in this part of the world. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, it is; and there is no reason why a small fleet should not be built here out of current revenue. We have sources of taxation which have not yet been tapped, and some of them will have to be tapped in the very near future, if not by this Government, by another. It is no wonder that Ministers have been cursed by supporters for submitting a borrowing policy. It is no wonder either that we find the Joss of the Prime Minister - the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> - cursing him day after day for bringing down that proposal. </para>

                        <para>-About election time, the honorable member thinks it is a verv good Joss. If there is one Joss the Victorians are afraid to offend it is the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and they are very wise, too. Here we have a Government with a shortage of £1,200,000. It went cap in hand, and on bended knee, to the State Premiers, praying them to get it out of the difficulty of having to borrow. It actually accepted the paltry sum of £600,000 to tide it over the interval between now and the approaching election, so that it might tell the constituencies that it is not going to borrow. No doubt if the Government comes back with a majority in the next Parliament, it will have to borrow some millions of pounds, or leave untouched many of the great works which have been projected. No Jewish money lender ever exacted such a heavy interest for his accommodation as the State Premiers ask for the£600,000 which they have promised to this Government. We must hand to the States every year, for all time, 25s. per head of the Customs and Excise revenue. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with the Brisbane proposal presently. The adoption of it would have left the Commonwealth free and unfettered, and would have compelled the States to raise a fair proportion of taxation to carry out their services.. But, under the agreement with the State Premiers the Commonwealth will have to pay to the States, yearly, out of its Customs and Excise revenue, no matter' how that may shrink, 25s. per head of population. I ask the honorable member for Maribyrnong if it is not his desire, and that of all Protectionists, that the revenue from import duties shall shrink because of the increase of production within Australia? The States, however, are free to bring here as many immigrants as they can get to come, no matter how poor they may be. Of course, I shall welcome all for whom we can find work. </para>

Unfortunately, we have paupers in this country already, and the party with which the honorable member is associated is to some extent, responsible for the fact. We are now inducing the States to encourage the influx of immigrants, whether there is or is not room for more, merely with the object of increasing their revenue. </para>

                        <para>- Notwithstanding that fact, the Treasurer asked the States only to contribute £600,000, to render it unnecessary to raise a loan. He might well have asked the three States which, by the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions, we have relieved of a liability of over £1,000,000, to contribute £1,000,000 to this fund. Having regard to our financial position, he would have been quite justified in preferring that request, and in asking the remaining States to contribute a less sum, since, although they had not been paying old-age pensions, their payment would have been forced upon them in the near future. The honorable member for Corangamite desired to know how the revenue of New South Wales would be affected under the agreement with the Premiers. If the Prime Minister is true to his Protectionist pledges, which are of many years' standing, we shall have a Tariff granting higher protection, and with increased protection we must expect a shrinkage of revenue. In 1907-8 the revenue from Customs and Excise amounted to £2 15s. 5¾d. per head of the population. </para>

                        <para>- Under so-called Free Trade. Last year the Customs and Excise returns of that State amounted to £2 13s. 7d. per head of its population. In Victoria, which was regarded as the great Protectionist State, it amounted during the year immediately previous to the establishment of Federation to £1 19s. per head of the population. If the Victorian ideal of Protection is to be adopted by the Commonwealth, our Customs and Excise revenue must fall. </para>

                        <para>- The Tariff in force in Victoria prior to Federation was regarded as a highly protective one. In Queensland for the year immediately prior to Federation the Customs and Excise taxation amounted to £3 6s. 8d. per head ; in South Australia, to £1 14s. 8d. per head ; in Western Australia, to £5 9s. 2d. ; and in Tasmania, to £2 9s.10d. per head of the population. Despite the enormous revenue received under these headings in Western Australia and Queensland during that year, the average for the six States was only £21s. per head. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Statesman' s Year-Book</inline> the Customs taxation of the United Kingdom amounts to only £1 9s. 8d. per head of the population, and that of Canada, where Protection prevails, to £1 19s. 2d. </para>

The figures I have quoted show that in all human probability the Commonwealth revenue from Customs and Excise is likely to shrink to £2, if not less, per head of the population. If the majority of the members of the Fusion have their way, we shall have a Tariff approaching that of New South Wales before Federation, namely, £1 . 5s. 7d. per head, out of which we shall have to pay 25s. per head to the States, leaving 7d. per head for the Commonwealth services. </para>

                        <para>- Here we have one of the most consistent Protectionists in the House declaring that 30s. is too high. If, however, it be no more than £2, the services which are in confusion at the present time will be a thousand times worse confounded, and the Government will be compelled to do what they have denounced up to the present time, namely, impose direct taxation even more heavy than that proposed by the Fisher Government, or they will have to borrow very large sums, and thus burden the taxpayers with an enormous interest bill. There are two other alternatives - the Government will have to drop a good many of the schemes on their programme, or they will have to do what both consistent Protectionists and consistent Free-traders detest, namely, raise the revenue duties; and the latter is a step which I shall do all in my power to prevent the Government taking. Then, at the very least, there will be required 10s. per head for old-age pensions. If the Government are in earnest, and carry out the Act, including invalid pensions - and surely they will have some consideration for invalids - the cost will approach 15s'. per head, but certainly 10s. per head will be required in the near future. After paying 25s. to the States, and 10s. per head for old-age pensions, there will be a revenue of 5s. per head for all the other services and undertakings of the Government. We have before us schemes, some of which are on the business-paper, and some of which have only been talked about.

                        <para>- It will prove a substantial phantom when we have to foot the bill of £2,000,000, to which the Government, as far as they can, have committed the country. , The Postmaster-General admits, as every other Postmaster-General has admitted, that £2,000,000 is required to put his Department in order, and he has made substantial provision for this year. Putting the sum required in the near future at £1,000,000, the Postmaster-General will find that he will have to provide another £1,000,000. or allow the Department to get into even greater confusion. Invalid pensions, at the lowest, will cost ,£250,000, and there is not the slightest doubt that the Treasurer has under-estimated the cost of old-age pensions next year by £250,000. </para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable gentleman will find the cost nearer £2,000,000, unless, as at present, the intention is not to find out the persons entitled to old-age pensions, but how many we can deprive of pensions. During the whole of the discussions on this question, in this and another place, I never heard it once suggested that if a person otherwise qualified had earned ^£52 last year, and was, it may be, not earning 6d. this year, he should have to wait for twelve months before he could receive a pension. That was not the intention of any honorable member, and vet the Government are trying to save £250,000 by starving the poor old people. In regard to taking over the Northern Territory, the very least that ought to have been provided in the Budget, if we are to do anything with the country, was £300,000. The Federal Capital- </para>

We have a Surplus Revenue Act, and it would be the simplest thing to appropriate money for the purpose. I hope we shall not find the Government pursuing the same policy that is being followed in regard to the under-grounding of telegraph and telephone wires - that we shall not see three or four months' work delayed until the Estimates are passed. </para>

                        <para>- If there is any good in the Bill we shall pass it ; if not, it would be a pity to do so. At present it is doing duty in filling up time, and that is about all that it appears to be useful for. Then we have the Inter-State Commission foreshadowed. Is that another sham? It is to undertake such an enormous number of duties that it ought to be set to work at once. The honorable member for Maribyrnong could tell it exactly where it could start work the day after it was appointed in looking into Tariff anomalies, but there is not a shilling in the Budget for that Commission. We are also promised a State Debts Inquiry Commission. Is that to be gone on with? If it is to be a Commission composed, not of members of Parliament, but of experts, as has been stated, its members will have to be paid. Are they to be appointed after the next election? It seems to me that everything is to be left until the next election, and that the Government do not intend to do anything. No money is provided to carry out any of the great works foreshadowed in the Ministerial programme. I have just read a little list amounting to £3,900,000 odd, or nearly , £4,000,000, all unprovided for, and all in connexion with that programme. </para>

                        <para>- It is not sufficient to let the farmers know that there is such a thing in contemplation. What do honorable members think the development of the Northern Territory will cost? There are no roads in the Territory. A very large deficit on the railway, already built and big interest on the £3,000,000 of loan money will have to be provided for, and the Government will not do much there unless they are prepared to spend from £4,000,000 to £5,000,000. That is without spending a penny on the new railway construction, which will assuredly cost another £4,000,600 or £5,000,000. I come now to the Treasurer's railway - the one to the West. That is in front of us. It has been talked of in this House for years, and are we never to do anything with it? I am ready to go on with it, for I have supported and voted for it in the State as well as in this Parliament, but the Treasurer is doing absolutely nothing to help it on. Let him try this side of the House, and we will give him his railway. Then we have postal and telegraph extension for the year following, for which another  £1,000,000  will have to be found. There is also the immigration policy. Is that another sham ? We cannot get immigrants unless we are prepared to spend some money, and I do not think  £50,000  would be too much for that purpose, if we are to people the Northern Territory and other unsettled parts of this great continent, but no such vote appears in the Estimates. The appointment of a High Commissioner is also promised. It is not too much to anticipate that in the near future, if we appoint a High Commissioner, as we should have done long ago,  £20,000  will have to be expended. We shall have next year also old-age pensions to provide for. I have read a little list that covers nearly  £17,000,000,  and yet honorable members on the Ministerial side have not made the slightest attempt to find further revenue. They are giving away the revenue that we have, and are making no effort to put something else in its place. To give  25s.  per head back to the States is absolutely impossible, except with entire stagnation in the progress of Commonwealth undertakings, and yet it is desired to make that arrangement for all time. They cannot do that, but it only shows what the Fusion Government would do if they had the power. Not only do we find Ministers rushing to give away the revenue of the Commonwealth, but the right honorable member for East Sydney, until recently Leader of the Opposition, and now a humble private member of the Fusion party, actually writes to the Premiers' Conference a letter setting out precisely what the Fusion Government must do. The Government must do what the leading members of the Fusion tell them. If they do not, out they go. The moment a protest was made from the Ministerial corner by two pf the humblest members of the party, who do not speak with great authority as a general rule, the Government went away and carried out their behests. The right honorable member for East Sydney put in his letter the following statement - </para>

                    <para>It seems to me that there is, whilst the matter remains open, an increasing danger of an arrangement, which can be determined in a short time, not by conference or compromise, but by the will of the Federal Parliament. </para>

                <para class="block">Who constitutes the danger? I think it is a very nice thing when a private member of this House can write to a member of the Premiers' Conference a letter which he hopes will be brought before the Conference, saying that honorable members of this House are a danger to the States, and not likely to do them justice. I protest against any action of that sort. I am sure if I had written to the Conference a letter, saying what I thought was best for the States and the Commonwealth, it would speedily have been relegated to the waste-paper basket, as the right honorable member's letter ought to have been. I wish to deal now with the scheme put forward at the Brisbane Labour Conference. After the arrangement was come to by Federal Ministers and State Premiers, the Prime Minister stated in an interview that it in some measure approximated to the Labour party's Brisbane Conference proposals. It does not approximate to those proposals in any way. I am sorry that the report which we have here of the Brisbane Labour Conference is such a meagre one. Those who have perused it will know that I was strongly averse even to the proposals carried at that Conference, because I felt that we were not in a position two years before to say what the necessities of the Commonwealth would be. It has turned out to be so. For all that, the Brisbane Conference scheme provides for carrying out the services of the Commonwealth, and leaves  £1,000,000  a year to spare. Does the  25s.  agreement leave us enough? If we use10s. for old-age pensions,  5s.  for defence, and pay  25s.  to the States, we shall not have a single penny to spend upon anything else, with a revenue of  £2  per head. The Brisbane Conference proposals were introduced in the following words: " That this Conference expresses its approval generally of the following scheme." I wish to emphasize the fact that the Conference only approved of the scheme generally, and that what was carried was simply that the scheme should be referred to the organizations for their approval. Unfortunately, that motion does not appear in this report, nor does a motion moved by myself. Paragraph  3  of it states - </para>

                <para class="block">Then provision had to be made for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions throughout the Commonwealth. In addition, a sum of  £1,000,000  had to be set aside with which to meet unforeseen Federal expenditure. I believe that when they attended the Premiers' Conference Ministers thought it would be a very clever move to endeavour to secure the adoption of a scheme which approximated as closely as possible to that agreed to by the Brisbane Labour Conference. But owing to the meagre report of the proceedings of that conference they fell into error. I am prepared to stand bv the proposals of the Brisbane Labour Conference, although I believe that they are inadequate to meet the needs of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. That is where the strength of the Labour party lies. No Labour conference can bind the members of that party for more than three years. Any scheme which it may adopt is subject to alteration whenever the necessities of the Commonwealth demand it. The scheme is an elastic one - just as elastic as the agreement arrived at by the Premiers' Conference is rigid. </para>

                    said that they had to look ahead. It was estimated in Federal circles that£2,000,000 would have to be spent in the Post and Telegraph Department to make it thoroughly efficient. As for the Northern Territory, they would have to meet the interest on £3,000,000 and the large yearly deficit. If that Territory were to be properly developed a considerable amount of money would have to be spent there. It was only a question of time when the Transcontinental railways would have to be built - west and north - whilst lighthouses, beacons, &amp;c., had yet to be taken over by the Commonwealth.

                        <para>- The honorable member should understand that the delegates to that conference met merely for the purpose of framing a platform. It was the first occasion upon which a gathering of that kind determined to embody details in its platform, and I think that in doing so a blunder was committed. The Fusion Government are very careful not to set out details in their platform. If they did so, they would not be allowed to wriggle. But we were not afraid to put our views in black and white. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> who supported the Brisbane Labour Conference scheme, acknowledged that - </para>

                <para class="block">It seems to me that some members of that conference were over-considerate for the States and under-considerate for the Commonwealth, just as was the right honorable member for East Sydney in his letter to the Premiers, in which it seemed that he did not care much about the interests of the Commonwealth so long as the States were all right. I do not see why we should do an injustice to the Commonwealth by being overgenerous to the States. We should do the generous thing by the States, but at the same time remember the need for Commonwealth expansion. In my opinion this Parliament will have to pay the penalty for this policy of overgenerosity when we are compelled to raise taxation in the near future. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> also said - </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Parkes was one of those who prevented a fair discussion on the proposals of the Fisher Government. He was afraid to have our programme fully debated. We not only formulated proposals, but at the earliest possible moment laid our taxation policy before Parliament. There was nothing Micawber-like in that attitude. Oddly enough, our proposals are on the notice-paper to-day ; I do not know why the Government have left them there.I also wish to point out that the Prime Ministry were formerly in favour of a fixed sum being paid to the States. I think that the honorable member for Hume will agree with me when I state that all the old followers of the present Prime Minister were in favor of the fixed sum, and not of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> plan. I know that after the Brisbane Premiers' Conference the Prime Minister declared publicly that he was in favour of a fixed sum. </para>

The Prime Minister is going back upon every proposal he laid before the country. Even within the last few weeks the Prime Minister stated to this House that a five years' settlement was to be made.

                        <para>- I did not say that the Treasurer does a sensible thing even occasionally. We are having first government by fusion, next government by memorandum, and then government by boards and commissions ; for, as I have said, the State debts question is to be relegated to a commission. We are having anything but responsible government. Yet we .were told that the Ministry came into office to restore responsible government. In my belief no arrangement will be satisfactory to this House that does not provide for taking over the State debts. At one time the Treasurer, as well as the Premiers, of the States, were in favour of only having one borrower for Australia, namely the Commonwealth. We had a scheme put forward by the honorable member for Mernda, another by the honorable member for Koo),ong, practically on the same lines ; we had the scheme of the Treasurer, the scheme of the honorable member for Hume, and the scheme of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner. Every one of those schemes favoured the taking over of the State debts by the Commonwealth.  ,1  know that the honorable member for 'Hume holds the same view as he always did, but where does the Treasurer stand in relation to the question? Does he recollect the statement he made in 1906? It was a very, good statement, and one of the few good things that he has done. He then told the country that if the debts of the States were taken over by the Commonwealth, and we were able to re-float their loans at a little over J per cent, below the present rate of interest, by 1952 we should have saved £26,768,273. </para>

If the scheme proposed by the' honorable member for Darwin could have been adversely criticised, we should have found the press from one end of the Commonwealth to the other denouncing it.

                        <para>- The right honorable gentleman will find, if he makes the calculation, that the statement is correct. I say that if we were to effect a saving of £ per cent., or even less, on our loans we should establish a sinking fund of J per cent., and begin in that way to wipe out our indebtedness. The present Government propose to relegate this matter to a Royal Commission We are empowered under the Constitution to take over certain of the debts of the States, and why, in the circumstances, should we appoint a Commission? We now find that the State Governments are hostile to the taking over of the State debts. If that be so, of what use would it be to appoint a Commission to consider the matter? Whatever the finding of the proposed Commission might be, the State Governments would probably continue hostile to the transfer of the State debts to the Commonwealth. </para>

I say that in the interests of the States themselves the Federal Parliament should take over the debts of the States.

                        <para>- They thought at one time that they could drive almost any bargain they pleased. The honorable member for Dalley says that on this occasion they thought they had their last chance, but they should have been given no such chance. They had repudiated and rejected! every generous offer made to them year after year, and could not agree upon any scheme that any member of this Parliament would look at. At the last moment we find several of the Ministers flouting this Parliament, and without telling honorable members what they proposed to do agreeing to tie the hands of the Commonwealth.. </para>

I think that in this matter we ought to do for the State Governments what apparently they do not know how to do themselves. That doe* not .look as if I regarded the States as foreign communities. I always speak with the highest regard for the States, because I know that the electors of the States and of the Commonwealth are the same,' and that an injury to the Commonwealth must be an injury to the States just as an injury to the States, would be an injury to the Commonwealth. We all know how extravagant the State Governments have been in the past. They have borrowed many millions of money, and have squandered a great deal of it. </para>

                        <para>- I take the statement with a grain of salt. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnston</inline> reckoned as we are in the habit of reckoning in dealing with Post Office finance. We have had one Postmaster-General after another telling us that the Post and Telegraph Department has had so much revenue and so much expenditure, but not one of them has taken into account a penny piece for depreciation of departmental buildings all over the country. We are invited to consider what a splendid asset these buildings are, and yet, to my knowledge, since Federation was accomplished, not a single sixpence has been allowed for depreciation of those buildings. The honorable member for Parkes will not say that that is a sound system of finance. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but it should have dealt with that question. The Treasurer had no right to deal with the other financial proposals without including a reference to that question. I have analyzed the Defence proposals of the Government, and have shown what a hollow mockery they are.  1  have shown that practically nothing is provided in order to bring the fighting force of the Commonwealth into a state of efficiency, and that the total amount provided for defence is entirely inadequate. It is a farce to propose to spend only £9,000 extra on naval defence. I have shown that no provision is made in the Budget to meet the Government's commitments to the Imperial Government, and if that is not criticising the Budget, the honorable member does not know what criticism is. It is the most unsatisfactory Budget that I have ever had the misfortune to listen to, and that view was expressed by the honorable member for Robertson and the honorable member for Moreton ; the only two Government supporters who have spoken. They only stated the actual facts. I am very disappointed indeed with the Budget, and I fear very much that, bad as was the muddle out of which the honorable member for Hume had to extricate the Treasurer on a previous occasion, it will be more difficult to extricate the country from the very unsatisfactory position in which it now is. </para>

It will be impossible, I take it, to make an intelligible speech on this part of the Budget alone. It may be said that the Budget consists of two or three sections. One is the section that was delivered some days ago by the Treasurer. Another is the new development in connexion with the arrangement with the Premiers. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. In these circumstances, I do not think it wise to attempt to go into details. So far as the expenditure is concerned, the figures do not approach those which were recommended by some of the Departments on the last occasion I delivered a Budget. The increased expenditure on several items is very small indeed. As to naval policy, the Budget does not provide for the expenditure we may expect to be required shortly ; the provision in that regard is inadequate. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member will find that on the main items, the totals that were debated as against the then Government have not been increased very much. In the case of the Post and Telegraph Department there is no adequate provision made as to the items, or as to. the totals, to meet the claims put in by officers for additional expenditure. Therefore, I think that the Budget quite fails to deal in a comprehensive way with our requirements. As regards the naval expenditure, there was a large sum placed to credit by the late Government for that purpose, and the increase in that item is not really so substantial as it should be. </para>

                        <para>- That. I suppose, will depend entirely on the activity or non-activity of the present Government, but the moment a decision is come to, and an order is sent to Great Britain for supplies of any kind, the money will have to be transmitted. Therefore, it will not be very long before a considerable amount will have to be remitted. In view of the additions and alterations to be made, I think that the Budget should have been amended or withdrawn, so that another could be submitted. The latter would have been the proper com se for the Treasurer to take, and then honorable members would have known what they were doing. </para>

                        <para>- Because the Budget makes inadequate provision, and because a paper which was tabled last Friday, foreshadowed a different method in regard-to which I propose to put a question, not only to the Treasurer, but also to the public, and to the press. When I had the privilege of being Treasurer, I stated one night that I had had prepared an estimate of the probable expenditure required by the Commonwealth up to 1920. I was pressed - by the honorable member for Flinders, I think - to lay the paper upon the table. In order to protect the officers at the Treasury, I said that I could not quite vouch for its accuracy, but it was as near an approximation as could be made by them. I laid the document upon the table; but by some extraordinary coincidence it was not printed. Through the courtesy of one of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> officials, I found what I quoted on that occasion, but I was not able to find the document itself. I think that an important paper like that should have been printed. On page 11265 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> Vol. XLVI., I am reported to have said- </para>

The officers were very chary about making such an estimate on the basis of our present expenditure, because they pointed out that they might be tied down to it, and blamed if it was not accurate. </para>

                        <para>- As nearly as possible. I think that the Government Statistician's figures have been made the basis of the calculation as to the increase of population, which will necessarily involve an increased expenditure. I did not wish to lay the paper on the table without the consent of the officers, because I told them that I should not use it in such a way as to bind them to what, after all, was a mere approximation. This estimate allows for an expenditure of£1, 500,000 in respect of old-age pensions. In the first place, it shows that the amount provided in the Estimates for 1907-8 was£5,967,992. From that sum£580,000 is deducted in respect of the sugar bounty, to be abolished in 1913, leaving a total of£5,387,992. Then it is estimated that there will be an increase of£685,000 in the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department. </para>

                    <para>It is assumed that the increase of that branch of expenditure will be equal to the increase in revenue if the population increases only at the rate experienced since 1901. An increase of £402,988 is also estimated in the Defence expenditure. </para>

Provision is also made for a deficit of £50,000 on the working of the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie railway; £210,000 in respect of the deficit in connexion with the Oodnadatta to Pine Creek railway, and £93,000 in respect of interest and sinking fund on the cost of Port Augusta to Oodnadatta line. Then we come to an estimated expenditure of £450,000 in respect of interest and sinking fund on transferred properties, a further sum of £50,000 for advertising and immigration ; £20,000 for general elections, £24,000 in connexion with the census, and £20,000 for additional pay to members of Parliament. </para>

I rose tm submit that which I have put before honorable members, and I should be glad to have an answer lo it consisting, not of mere assertions, but of detailed figures. There will be some difficulty in reconciling the figures in the statement laid on the table of the House on Friday last with that which I submitted last year. Reference has been made to the debt incurred by the South Australian Government in connexion with the Northern Territory, and to what the Treasurer intends to do in regard to it if the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill be agreed to. If the financial scheme promulgated chiefly by the honorable member for Mernda, and which with, some alterations I adopted; were carried out, that liability would be taken over with the other debts of the States, and no further trouble would arise. It would become a Commonwealth loan. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member must not misrepresent me. I am absolutely opposed to the proposed issue of Treasury bills and to the floating of any loan at the present time for Commonwealth works, and especially to a loan to provide for the payment of old-age pensions. I am not, however, opposed to the Commonwealth taking over the whole of the debts of the States and becoming responsible for them, for I believe that we should be able to convert them on a satisfactory basis. The debt incurred by South Australia in respect of the Northern Territory would form part of that conversion, and until that took place there would be no necessity to pay South Australia more than the interest on it. It would remain as a debit against South Australia, and the interest would be paid by us. I am very strongly in favour of a proper separation of the finances of the States from those of the Commonwealth. By the transfer to the Commonwealth of the loans of the States, including some that have not been enumerated in the Budget, the whole of their finances, as well as those of the Commonwealth, would be placed on a distinct and equitable basis. I did not intend to make a long speech to-night, but rose only to emphasize one or two points which I hope will be appreciated by the people. If my speech does not appear in the newspapers, it will, at all events, be widely circulated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I wish the people to ask themselves before we accept the proposed agreement, how we are going to meet our expenditure in  1920-1? </para>

                        <para>- Then the honorable member has a curious way of displaying his happiness ; for since he has been in opposition he has given me the impression of being the most miserable man taking part in the business of this House. I thought, however, that we might obtain from him a ray of light upon the prospective situation. The honorable member has attempted to forecast what the financial position of the Commonwealth will be ten years hence. How has he gone about his work? He begins on the debit side by calculating every possible liability on a distinctly swollen scale. He has estimated every obligation that he can conceive of the Commonwealth entering, into, and, aggregating all these debts, has arrived at the grand total of  £9,500,000.  The deduction which I expected he was about to make was as to how the Commonwealth would stand, on the assumption that those debits were set against the prospective credits. What justice did the honorable member do to the Commonwealth in calculating our financial position at that date ? He takes on the credit side one item only, namely, the Customs revenue, and he entirely omits the whole of the Post Office revenue as well as the whole of the increase which will take place during the next ten years in that revenue. By looking at the figures he can see that the Post Office revenue has advanced by leaps and bounds - by, in some cases, from  £200,000  to  £300,000  per annum - although he has taken all the expenditure into his debit calculation. </para>

                        <para>- I am taking the honorable member's own figures. He has done his best to swell the debits in his calculations by taking the increase in the Post Office expenditure; and the largest sum he can arrive at, in order to give colour to this <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement of the finances of the Commonwealth in  1920,  is  £9,500,000.  What sort of accountancy is it that takes all the possible debits in a swollen form, and then on the credit side has regard to only one item of revenue? The honorable member has the statement of the Treasurer that in  1920-1  the Commonwealth will have  £5,500,000  over and above what is given to the States if the Conference scheme is carried out. The payments to the States we know at the present time will come to about  £5,500,000,  so that, if the amount which has to be handed to the States, according to the honorable member's calculation, is added to that which the Treasurer has said the Commonwealth will have, it means  £11,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- That makes my calculation the better, because it will mean £10,500,000 instead of £11,000,000. The honorable member has based his calculation on the supposition that all the Commonwealth will have, even in Customs revenue, is £10,500,000. Would he tell this to a parcel of schoolboys? To-day the gross amount is between £11,000,000 and £12,000,000 ; and does the honorable member suppose that with the great increase which will take place in population between 1909 and 1920-1, our revenue from the Customs will not advance many millions? </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to show that the honorable member for Parkes has made a deliberate misrepresentation to the Committee, and that the increase in expenditure has gone on step by step with the increase in revenue from the Post Office. In 1901-2 the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department was £2,383,815 ; in 1902-3 it was £2,568,846 ; in 1903-4 it was £2,697,454; in 1904-5, £2,699,667; 1905-6, £2,784,664; 1906-7, £2,966,100; 1907-8, £3,345&gt;84i; and 1908-9, £3,612,778, while for 1909-10 it is estimated at £3,994,665, or, roughly, £4,000,000. With the increase of revenue that increase of expenditure runs nearly side by side, and the estimate made by the officers is on the same ratio. They have taken the increase of revenue and the increase of expenditure, and so have arrived at the increase that will be required at the end of. 1 920-1. </para>

His  face, not mine, will pale then. The increase of expenditure corresponds almost exactly with the increase of revenue, and at the end of 1920-1 there will be practically no balance of increase of revenue in the Postmaster-General's Department. </para>

                    <para>. - When I rose a few moments ago it was to comment on the fact that the honorable member for Hume had swollen all the debits he could think of in order to make up the sum of £9,500,000. I then took the credits to show that his accountancy was absolutely faulty, because he had taken one item on the credit side at no higher amount for 1920- 1 than it is to-day, and that he had wholly omitted the normal Post Office revenue, as also the increase of that revenue, which, as' I showed, would alone amount to £1,500,000 on the same  ratio as the increase which has taken place from 1 90 1 until now. The honorable member, seeing the dilemma in which my figures put him, kept crying out, " How about the increased expenditure ?" My answer was that it was calculated in the £9,500,000 of debits, and I shall now read from his own paper to prove it. After arriving at the sum of £5,387,000 in building up this edifice of expenditure, he says, " Then it is estimated that there will be an increase of £685,000 in the expenditure of the Postal Department." That amount is taken into his £9,500,000, so that he has already included in the debit side all this predicted increase in the Post Office expenditure, but has not credited the ordinary revenue of the Post Office or the £1,500,000 of increased revenue which I have shown will accrue according to the ratio of increase up to the present time. </para>

                        <para>- It is in print, and I sent one to the Treasurer. We ought really to look into this question more fully. We are asked to give the States a first mortgage on the revenue of the Commonwealth. As a Federalist, with the experience of Canada, the United States, and every other Federal country to guide me, I think this question is most serious ; in fact, I do not believe that honorable members have looked at it from the same stand-point as they would if they were handling their own private property. We are sent here as trustees of the public estate, and we should examine the question thoroughly. The first thing we do is to give to the States an expanding mortgage over the Customs and Excise revenue. </para>

I am afraid that I may be put in a straightjacket, as we are now putting the Commonwealth. I do not want honorable members to think that I am hostile to the Government, for I should like to see everybody get a " show " on the Treasury bench. There is no hog about me on that question. It is proposed to make the States preferential shareholders in the Customs and Excise revenue. </para>

                        <para>- I want the Treasurer to see that we have made a mistake. Any business man knows that if he has a first mortgage on a property, no trustee company will be willing to give him a second loan, no matter what margin of security he may have. I am an Australian - a better Australian, perhaps, than are many who are native-born - because, after intelligently studying other countries of the world, I decided to settle here. Under the agreement arrived at by the Premiers' Conference the Prime Minister proposes to give the States a first mortgage on the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- As a financial man, I wish to address my remarks to another financial man, in the person of the Treasurer. When we take over the State debts and create a sinking fund for their redemption, those debts will form part of the asset which we have to offer bondholders when we go upon the London market for the purpose of borrowing. But if we hand over those assets to the States, and give them a first mortgage upon the Commonwealth revenue to the extent of 25 s. per head of their population, we shall then be called upon to pay them £125,000 every  time that 100,000 women and children, who are not producers in the ordinary sense, land in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise the difference between the honorable member and myself. I am a Protectionist dipped in the dew and dyed in the wool, and I am bound to confess that the greater the measure of protection we accord to our industries, the less will be the revenue which we shall derive through the Customs. Viewed from the stand-point of a revenue tariffist, I admit that women and children are producers. I say without fear of contradiction that if we embody the agreement arrived at by the Premiers' Conference in our Constitution, the bonds of the States will appreciate, whilst the power of the Commonwealth to float loans will depreciate. Every honorable member must recognise that the money market is extremely sensitive. The representatives of financial trusts in New York, Berlin, Paris, Frankfort, and Chicago - indeed, in every city which undertakes foreign exchange and the transaction of credits as between those who possess them and those who require them - are always particular to examine the nature of the security which is offered to them. I unhesitatingly declare that if we give the States a mortgage over our Customs and Excise revenue to the extent of 25s. per head of our population, we shall destroy the ability of the Commonwealth to go upon the markets of the_ world and float loans. In my judgment, the financial question is of greater importance than is any other question. It is more important even than is a land tax. Millions of our people may never own a foot of land, but no individual can pass through this world without handling money. A question of such magnitude ought not to have been discussed by the Premiers' Conference in secrecy. With the assistance of the representatives of the Government that Conference has forged a cast-iron constitutional straight- jacket in which the giant body of this Commonwealth is to be perpetually confined so that the future growth of its vital organs will be rendered impossible, and it will be for ever reduced to the position of a financial cripple on constitutional crutches. As the States increase in population their revenue will simultaneously swell. If Protection is efficacious, the Commonwealth revenue will correspondingly decrease. Every effort put forth by the Commonwealth to expand this continent will be at the expense of its own finances, and will mean for it less prestige, power, and revenue. </para>

                        <para>- I have not made one financial mistake throughout my business life. I have sometimes gone down because I could not get others to see my side of the case; but this time I am " running my own show," and time will prove that I am right.  1  ask honorable members to consider this policy carefully before we enter upon it. There is nothing wrong in admitting a mistake. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Peel, England's greatest finance Minister, made many mistakes, and was not ashamed to acknowledge them. When a person mortgages a property, the effect is to destroy its margin of security value to a certain extent. If the mortgagor goes back to the same mortgagee he maybe able to increase the mortgage at a higher rate of interest, but he certainly will not be able to get a second man tb give him a second mortgage at the original rate of interest. Now what we are entering upon is an ever -expanding mortgage. It expands eternally. Under my scheme, I proposed to give to the States£6,970,000 per annum to start with. It must be seen, therefore, that I am not trying to take revenue from the States. I proposed to give them more than they will receive under the Government scheme in the first instance. I proposed to pay them £6,100,000 for revenue purposes, and to take £870,000 a year for a sinking fund at½ per cent. That, I maintain, was a wise project. Why was it that the present Treasurer was able to keep good the credit of Western Australia? Because with every financial proposal that he laid before British investors he had a sinking fund. As the sinking fund rose, the debt diminished. I am anxious to induce honorable members to see the difference between giving the States 25s. per head, and making that a perpetual charge on the Commonwealth Customs and Excise revenue, and giving them a definite sum per annum. Under my scheme, in sixty-one years three-fourths of the debts would have been wiped off. </para>

                        <para>- I can assure honorable members that the scheme of the Government is, to me, an alarming one. [ am a Protectionist, and I know that the effect of a sound protective Tariff is to decrease revenue from Customs and Excise. Trade, commerce, credit, and confidence go hand in hand. They are, it may be said, one and inseparable. The great function of credit is to secure the transfer of capital from those who possess it to those who require it. If this Parliament is going to put an expanding mortgage - a mortgage expanding with the increase of population, whether that population consists of children or of helpless women, or of feeble old people - on the Customs and Excise revenue of this Commonwealth, it will be injurious to our credit. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want to say that. If I did not look at this matter very seriously, as a successful business man, I would not say a word about it. By putting this expanding mortgage in the Constitution, we shall be destroying a great Commonwealth asset. If we were to go into the money market to float a loan, there is not a financier in Paris, nor a financier true to his trust in London, but would say that -our credit was injured by the fact that 25s. per head of our Customs and Excise revenue was already mortgaged under a bond. The State Governments will be preferential shareholders and those who lend to the Commonwealth must come in later, and, if there is any dividend, take it. I find that Russia has a Customs and Excise revenue of 7s. id. per head. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sorry to further delay honorable members at this late hour, but there is a case which I should like to bring under the notice of the Minister of Defence. I have already exhausted means of redress by application to the Department. I do not blame the officials, because they have done their utmost to deal with the matter. I think that the Minister might very well inquire into a case of extreme hardship. An old man named Charles Anderson joined the Defence Force in 1878. For reasons of economy, he was put off, with a number of others, and subsequently was called in again. Pensions were abolished in Victoria on the 24th December, 1881. He was taken into the service on 1st January, 1883, and continued therein until last year when, by reason of age, he expected to receive a pension, but was informed that he had no claim, because he was not in the employment of the State Government on the 24th December, 1881. The peculiarity of his position is that his discharge shows continuity of service from 1878 until 1887, and it is admitted that he was in the service of the Post and Telegraph Department up to last year. He claims that his discharge was accepted as evidence of continuity of service, but the officials in the Department say that he cannot receive a pension.I know that a difficulty arises from the fact that while the Commonwealth has the right to say whether or not a pension should be paid, the State may object to the payment of it. I ask the Minister to kindly institute an- inquiry, and see if something cannot be done for the man. </para>
