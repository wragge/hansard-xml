            <para>- It would appear from the regulations that old-age pensions are not to be paid under Commonwealth administration except at post-offices. In my electorate are a number of old persons, living 12 miles from a post-office, and it is very difficult for them, by reason of infirmity and other causes, to get to it. Under State administration, the police, when on patrol, were instructed to pay pensions in these and similar cases. Will the Treasurer allow that system to continue? The matter is of great importance, not only to those on whose behalf I have asked the question, but, doubtless, to many others. </para>

          <para>.- One of the most striking features of this debate seems to me to be this, that it has been almost entirely confined to the affairs of the past, and has borne but very slightlyupon the concerns of the future. That might be an appropriate state of things for an old, decaying nation ; but it is not a healthy characteristic in the political affairs of a young nation like Australia. Before I enter upon some rather controversial topics, I wish to say that I saw a great deal to admire in the manner, in which the late Prime Minister, the honorable member for Wide Bay, administered the duties of his high and responsible position ; and I am happy to say that his Ministers generally, with one or two rather&#39; serious acts by way of exception, displayed, as I thought, a degree of efficiency and ability which is deserving of the fullest recognition. I also think that the irritation which has been displayed by my honorable friends has had some basis of justification. It is rather annoying, after giving five or six years of solid support to receive five or six months of unsubstantial support in exchange. But we must remember that our friends opposite are not made of the ordinary political clay. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">They must remember that they represent the highest traditions of political disinterestedness and patriotism; that to them office was an  infliction,  and that they desire nothing more than the opportunity of serving others in great public undertakings. I rather regret, therefore, that my honorable friends have recently shown the ordinary characteristics of ordinary politicians. One of the most serious complaints which have been made from the other side is a fear as to the future of Liberalism in Australia under this new fusion of parties. They point to one or two individuals upon this side of the House as representing a policy of Conservatism, and they profess to be gravely alarmed as to our political future. Considering that the leader of the present Government was looked up to until recently by them as one of the strongest exponents of the most advanced Liberalism in Australia - considering that for six years the honorable and learned Prime Minister was the- guide, counsellor, and friend of the Labour party - surely they should rejoice that this advanced leader in Liberal politics has been reinforced by some honorable gentlemen who at former periods were in a state of more or less antagonism to him. The belief opposite seems to be that the one or two gentlemen who are supposed to be Conservatives will direct the Government. That is a perfectly natural feeling on the part of those who have been accustomed to direct Governments for such a  lengethened  period of time; but I feel that the result will be, not the weakening of Australian Liberalism, but in the direction of strengthening&#34; it. Indeed, I believe it is a mere political trick of the most obvious kind to endeavour to describe any party, either in the Federal or in the State arena, as a Conservative party. There is no such party in Australia. There is no country in the world where the people are less paralyzed by reverence for the past. There is no people in the world who have fewer fears as to the future. If I were compelled to point to a community which represents political progress in its most rapid and fearless guise, I should point to the political community of Australia. Our friends opposite go so far as to accuse honorable members on this side of favouring a policy of starvation. I regret the attempts which are being made to create a class feeling in the politics of Australia. </para>

            <para>- Wherever started, any. such attempt represents, not the highest, but the lowest, form of political controversy. I suppose &#34;there is no one in this House who has to forget more than I have to forget in order to sit where I do. For seven or eight years I had the dubious privilege of sitting upon the other side, but during that long period I am not aware that I filled the air with many lamentations. When my honorable friends profess such horror at sudden withdrawals of  polical  affection. I remember a time when I thought the delightful ardour with which the present Prime Minister regarded me cooled in an altogether too rapid and mysterious fashion. But if I sought for sympathy, for some expression of moral reprobation, I sought it in vain in the direction of my honorable friends. Their political conscience has become suddenly tender. When the Prime Minister reverted to his old love, Labour took the erring head to its bosom in a rapture of perfect reconciliation. The Prime Minister has one great virtue. I do not know in the public life of Australia a man who possesses a more loving and affectionate disposition, but that disposition has, of course, the defect of its qualities, and there is no doubt that the Prime Minister, during the last few years, has been guilty of a series of political attachments equally sudden and equally amorous. But when my honorable friends seek to attack the honorable gentleman - and I think the very able and learned member for West Sydney left nothing to be said in the shape of indignation, invective, or satire- I cannot help remembering that the Prime Minister can advance two pleas which are familiar in the divorce courts of the country. The first plea is one of condonation. When the Prime Minister having suddenly left them for me, suddenly left me to rejoin them, he was received back, as I say, in a spirit of entire forgiveness. That is his plea of condonation. Then he has the further plea of cruelty and desertion. After three years - the second term of three years - of the most devoted and faithful service, the honorable member was driven out of the- political wigwam of the honorable member for Wide Bay into the wilderness, without a word of explanation. At that time, when the Labour party sought to displace the Deakin Administration, some of our friends thought we should go behind the Ministry and save them. But I remembered trie delightful anecdote with which  the Prime Minister recently amused the Labour party, and which bore on the aboriginal method of contracting matrimonial alliances by brute force. I said that in order to bear this beauteous one - I mean the Prime Minister - triumphantly into our camp, we must adopt the free use of the club. The club has been used ; and we rejoice in the new alliance which has been contracted between the gifted leader of the present Administration and the united Liberals of Australia. So far as I am concerned, in saying these things I have said everything I have to say with reference to the past. There is only one basis for any loyal and honest political fusion. At all times it is a strain, and sometimes a great strain ; but there is only one basis on which this fusion can be justified, or on which it can succeed, and that is the basis of forgetting the antagonistic feelings of the past, endeavouring loyally to join forces in advancing the public interest. Personalities soon recede into oblivion, just as personages soon dissolve into dust. There are only two great objects worthy of public ambitions and parliamentary service, and these are to advance, in the best possible way, the interests of good government, and to advance, in the best possible way, sound principles of legislation. I believe that the union which has been arrived at on this side of the House is calculated to promote those great national benefits. For that reason I hope, whilst exercising a spirit of perfect independence, to be able to give the present Government thoroughly loyal and earnest support. I cannot forget that there are in and behind this Government a large number of my own old friends and supporters. When honorable members seek to draw some artificial line of Liberalism, as the honorable member for Gippsland did the other night. I should like to ask them what line of Liberalism divides men like the Prime Minister, the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Minister of External Affairs, from men like the Minister of Defence, the Attorney-General, the Minister of Home Affairs, and the PostmasterGeneral? </para>

            <para>- There is . no real line. Once the fiscal question is set aside there is no substantial line dividing the Liberals whom I have named. When my friends opposite become so impatient as to the sinking of the fiscal question, which has been agreed to in this case, may I remind them that there is no party here which has sunk the fiscal question so persistently and so scientifically as the Labour party of Australia has done. Is it not marvellous that ardent Free Traders like the honorable member for West Sydney, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> the honorable member for Grey, and, once, the honorable member for Wide Bay, should be able to co-operate loyally for so many years with the most rabid Protectionists in the Labour party? If they had not done so the Labour movement would have been impossible; and, surely, they can allow their political opponents the same privilege? </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Coolgardie is another one to whom I might have referred as a sound Free Trader; and surely, if my honorable friends opposite, in the pursuit of high political objects and, great national changes, to which they attach importance, have been able to work amicably together, the same privilege, with the same objects &#39;in view, should be allowed to honorable members on this side of the House. May I be allowed to say that I listened to the speech of the honorable member for Gippsland with great pleasure? It was a speech of real ability, animated, I am sure, by honorable feeling. But may I also suggest to that honorable member that, as in the case of too many gentlemen whose politics have been fashioned in Victoria, the term Liberalism would appear to be defined in his view by the geographicalboundaries of his State? Liberalism is altogether too broad a term, and represents too great a principle, for any such limitation. Liberalism was not invented in Victoria ; Liberalism in Australia is the child of the great Liberalism of the Mother Country, and the child of Liberalism throughout the nations. One of the points about this fusion which recommends it most strongly to me is that, for. the future, the term Liberal in Australian politics will have a broader meaning and a more generous sound - that this consolidation of Liberal forces will, I hope and believe, work effectively in our future political life. May I say, in all sincerity, that, in my deliberate view, aided as it is by a considerable degree of political experience, that if there is one party which&#39; should not lament this new development it is the Labour party of Australia? </para>

            <para>- That is the party which for so many years occupied a position in this Parliament altogether unworthy of its strength&#39; and its ability, and, if it has a future, equally unworthy of its future. Surely my friends opposite will feel a greater degree of satisfaction in standing together shoulder to shoulder with a leader of their own choosing. Whether we regard the matter from that point of view or from another, we are now on the threshold of a stage of Australian politics which will reflect greater credit on all parties. To show how awkward the honorable member for Gippslands definition of Liberalism is, I may point out that if there is any one principle to which he devotes his undoubted abilities, it is the principle of Protection. If the honorable member went to reside in the Mother Country, who are the men with whom he would find himself associated in the political struggles there? He would have to join the Tories of England. This reflection upon some of us is equally a reflection upon honorable members of the Labour party who hold similar fiscal views. The fact is that Protection, which may be in the estimation of many patriotic men - and in the estimation of most nations it1 is - a patriotic policy, is not one that can ever mark the line between one set of advanced political thinkers and another. It has never done so. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member who excites my greatest admiration, is the honorable member for Hume. Great men like Gladstone could evolve from a position in which they were the hope of the Tories into another in which they became the hope of the Radicals of England. In the course of a long, active, fearless, and honorable public life, they could work conscientiously from one extreme to the other, without any suspicion of insincerity or of mercenary motive. That very distinguished public man, who is now, &#34;unfortunately, shattered in health - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Chamberlain - described an evolution in a precisely opposite direction. He began as one of the most advanced Radicals in England and ended as a trusted Conservative leader. That was an evolution in an opposite direction, yet who would endeavour to cast discredit upon either of those dis tinguished men, because, in the course of a useful and intense public life, their views altered? But the one great statesman of the world, against whom no such reproach can be levelled, is the honorable member for Hume. If his own version of his political career be the correct one, he began as a fossil, and a fossil he remains. I know the honorable member too well, however, not to be aware that that does not justly describe his public career, and I trust that, notwithstanding the strength of the antagonism that prevailed between us for many years, there is no element of personal bitterness in our fight. </para>

There is another matter in regard to which he has performed a striking, and, I think, meritorious, evolution. I am not impugning the sincerity of his conversion ; I merely say that he is a far more healthy political transformation than he imagines himself to be. The question of giving equality of electoral power was before the New South Wales Parliament, and the strongest opponent of the proposals of the Government of the day was the honorable member for Hume.

But when he was Secretary for Public Works in New South Wales, and Minister for Railways, prior to the appointment of Railways Commissioners, a railway association was established. The question whether there should be such an association within the Public Service was keenly debated, and the honorable gentleman, when challenged upon his attitude, was careful to explain that the only terms on which he would recognise a railway association were that its members must not deal with rates of pay or hours of labour. </para>

Another subject upon which he is now emphatic is the right of poor workers to protection from their employers. But when, on the 2nd September, 1890, there was a discussion in the New South Wales Parliament as to whether a sailor or his relatives should be allowed to recover at law if injury or death were caused to him by reason of the unseaworthiness of the ship he was on, the question arose whether recovery should be possible if he had not given notice before he went on the voyage that the ship was unseaworthy - a thing which an ordinary sailor could not be expected to do. But this is what the honorable member thought on the subject. He said that the unfortunate sailor - </para>

            <para>- The honorable member had not then arrived at his present state of evolution. The words which I have read were uttered on the 2nd September, 1890, and are to be found in the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports of that date, page 3376. I do not, like the honorable member, make vague charges, imputing all sorts of misconduct to others, without giving any authority. Perhaps the most remarkable proof of the honorable member&#39;s - I shall not say insincerity, but evolution - is this : When the great Federal movement came on, he was one of the leading Protectionists in New South Wales. Yet he joined in a fiscal truce. To do what? To come under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, who was then fighting the battle of Federation ! </para>

            <para>-  I remember now that the honorable member shifted <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton. He performed a very dubious manoeuvre. Instead of acting as the loyal supporter of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, who was his leader, he suddenly established a room of his own, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> was invited to walk downstairs, while he walked upstairs. We are told now that the honorable member, before he was able to displace me from the Premiership in New South Wales, gave solemn assurances to the Labour party of the day as to the obedient service he would render if they would be good enough to vote him into power. </para>

            <para>- I know that he was not; but he afterwards became a member, and made a public statement in the Assembly a few days ago. Other people besides members of Parliament sometimes know things. If the honorable member for Barrier, who was at the time a prominent member of the Labour party in New South Wales, will say that there was no sort of understanding of any kind with the honorable member for Hume before the party determined to put him in power, it will be enough for me. </para>

            <para>- The line I then took- and for a very good Liberal reason - was this : I considered that the hours of employment in all shops &#34;should be strictly regulated and limited. But I did not want to play into the hands of the big shopkeepers of Sydney by closing the little suburban shops. None knows better than the honorable member for Newcastle that there was a great dispute as to whether all shops should be closed at a fixed hour, or whether there should be such a reform in the hours of labour as would enable the man whose wife, perhaps, attended to a shop whose trade was done mostly in the evening, to keep it open a little longer. All the big shopkeepers of Sydney went for the proposal of the honorable member for Hume, because it crushed out the small shops in the suburbs. I mention that to show that there was room for legitimate difference of opinion in the matter. Now I wish to refer to the honorable member&#39;s greatest exploit. That was in reference to Federation. The honorable member joined this great fight and this fiscal truce to enable the battle to be won for Federation by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, but he was opposing Federation all the time himself. </para>

            <para>- Of course, and I opposed it at one stage for three. The honorable member was a leading champion of the anti-Bill agination, and then calmly walked into office, where he remained for six years afterwards, as a loyal child of Federation. No one objects to that. I simply point to it as a case of patriotic evolution. I come now to a recent point. The honorable member produced the other night a long list of what he said were anomalies in the Customs Tariff that must be immediately rectified. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member tries hard not to be vulgar, but he never succeeds. He was fearfully in earnest about the Tariff when&#39; I led a Coalition Government. The Tariff was the burning question of the day, and various Christmas dinners were said to be in jeopardy. But within a short time afterwards there was a project for a Government consisting of some remnants of the honorable member&#39;s friends, and I think a majority of the Labour party. It came to nothing, but there was a. project of that sort. Where would the honorable member&#39;s list of higher duties have been in a Government which included the honorable member for West Sydney, the honorable member for Coolgardie, the honorable member for Barrier, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce?</inline></para>

            <para>- The Labour Protectionists were to be at liberty to carry out their views to the fullest extent, but I&#39; do not suppose that my honorable friends opposite want to make out that the Free Traders of the Labour party are fiscal atheists. Surely they do not say that the Free Trade members of that party are mere political shams, who, under cover of a profession of one principle, would treacherously bring about the triumph of another? I would not say that about any member of the Labour party. I am happy, to say that I have always been able to give the members of the Labour party, personally, every credit for their independence and public spirit. I have never had any personal quarrel with any of them. </para>

            <para>- I do not know the names of these places, but the honorable member certainly advocated several sites in his electorate. He voted for Albury as the only site for the Capital of Australia, although for weeks before, and for weeks after, he was striving for Tumut. That is a double-faced sort of evolution to which I did not think the honorable member would commit himself. Notoriously, he was asking the House to adopt one site, and when Albury was put forward on the first ballot, one of the first votes, if not the only one for it, was that of the honorable member himself. Yet he had no more idea of standing up for Albury than he has of going to heaven. It is&#39; only fair to say that, in referring to the honorable member&#39;s changes of public opinion, I am simply placing him on the same pedestal as one of the greatest men of recent years - William Ewart Gladstone. It is not necessarily a reflection on a public man to say that his views have changed. I believe that on more occasions than one my own views have changed. I wish now to glance briefly at one or two of the leading matters before us. The two great Departments with which the Federation was intrusted apart from the Customs, were those of Post and Telegraphs and Defence. In the administration of those two Departments the Federal authority has proved an abject failure. I do not want to put the blame on to this shoulder or on that. But, looking back over the past seven years, I say that if there is one fact more apparent in the public eye than another, it is that the Federal Parliament and Government have been absolutely incapable of placing the Post and Telegraph Department upon a sound basis. Now that we have a solid, powerful party on this side, now that the Prime Minister has the honour of leading <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> large a number of men, all of whom, I believe, he will find loyally following him - with the independence which we naturally possess as members of a Liberal party - now that he has the power, now that he is surrounded by the colleagues whom I see before me, I devoutly trust that that Department will be the subject of one or two reforms. In the first place, the service must be made efficient. In the second place, the revenue must be made sufficient, and in making the revenue sufficient, those who use the tele- phones most should pay the most. The one reform that is wanted to make the telephone service efficient, and to put it upon a proper financial basis, is that those people who use telephones to such an enormous extent in their business affairs, should be required to pay a proportionate amount for the services rendered. There is another principle, in harmony with the one I have just put forward, which ought to be kept in view. In adjusting the burdens of that Department, a sharp discrimination should be exercised in favour of settlers in remote districts. The pioneer class of Australia, who are out in the bush, cut off from the comforts of great centres of population, I would treat with the utmost liberality. I pass away from that subject to the subject of Defence. I think we shall all agree, without endeavouring to locate the blame for the unfortunate position, that the Department of Defence is another which has remained in a state of absolute inefficiency. When I spoke, a few months ago, looking upon serious danger to Australia as an affair of, perhaps, ten years hence, I was ignorant of the startling developments which have since come to light with reference to, if not the greatest power, certainly the greatest military power in the world. I confess now, in the light of knowledge which has come to me, that I cannot put off for ten years, the grave dangers to Australia to which I referred. I feel that they are more pressing than I thought they were, and I give the honorable member for West Sydney every credit for seeing much further ahead than I, or most of us, did, The honorable member for years has had upon the business-paper a notice of motion which I still think may be, perhaps, going too far ; but in the light of the facts as we know them to-day, I cheerfully acknowledge that the honorable member took a course for which he deserves public thanks. He deserves every credit for remarks which he made, but which I, at the time, thought to be entirely overstrained. The fact is that the question of defence can no longer be treated theoretically ; but has become one of immediate and practical importance. I am, glad that an Imperial Defence Conference is to be held. Some of us who are not military or naval experts, can only learn as other laymen do, and the more we learn of the question the more clearly do we see that Imperial defence is just as much an Australian question as Australian defence is an Imperial question. The true dangers do not lie in these remote seas; the decisive battle will not be fought here, but near the very heart of the Empire. The first thing we have to remember is that the fate of the British Empire will be decided in a few hours, many thousands of miles away, by means of terrible engines of war, which cannot be manufactured at a moment&#39;s notice. We have to face this fact, and I congratulate the Minister of Defence upon being, I believe, the first in Australia to express himself in favour of holding a Conference. It is the simple truth, I think, that the Minister of Defence, at a time when he had no idea of the fate in store for him. made an earnest plea for the holding of an Imperial Defence Conference. But there is one lesson- we do not need to go to an Imperial Conference to learn. There are one or two simple principles by which we can test questions of military administration. Nearly the whole merit of the administration of our Defence Department has consisted in the number of valuable minutes written by Ministers. We have the most beautiful schemes and magnificent projects on paper, but they never materialize. But we have to remember that if we are really going in for the business of war, and preparations for war, we must have something beyond mere skeleton schemes of defence. Our regiments of infantry and artillery must not be without the best of weapons and proper equipment, or even without reserve weapons and equipment, in readiness for the wicked waste of war if that calamity should befall us. Anything less will never mean defence, and can result only in disaster. Overlapping the Commonwealth and State domains, are several great questions. There are the questions of finance, the industrial powers of the States and the Commonwealth, and immigration. May I take the liberty of saying that I suppose there is not a more earnest believer in immigration ; but I have watched with very great dislike a process of exaggerated statement which has amounted to positive deception. I do not desire to see people lured to Australia on false pretences; I do not desire to see the lowest methods of commercial advertising applied to the great affairs of this country. I feel that this great national necessity is in serious danger of being discredited by the questionable methods which are being employed in some quarters. I am glad to see that the Minister of Defence has taken up in real earnest the question of physical culture, which lies much nearer than some of us think to the heart of the problem of the defence of this land. But there is a still higher form of enterprise, either of State or Federal concern, and that .consists in the development of the mental resources of Australia. When shall we realize in the actual affairs of government that the greatest factor in the future of this Continent, is not to be found in our mineral wealth, the richness of our soil, or the size of our territory? The real wealth of Australia lies more within the mental powers of the people than in any other sphere, and I should like to see some sort of change which would have the result that there could not be superior ta.lent in the most obscure and distant home in the bush which State enterprise could not reach, whose path it would not smooth. The greatest task of all in the building of this nation is the task of developing to their highest pitch the intellectual possibilities of the people. In regard to the Northern Territory, I desire to repeat the statements I have made on previous occasions. I have looked very carefully at the provisions of the agreement, and I am quite prepared to repay to South Australia every penny that the Northern Territory has cost her. But I absolutely decline to fetter the Commonwealth in this transaction with any scheme of railway policy. That introduces an element into the transaction which, so far as I can at present see, will meet with the strongest opposition from me. </para>

            <para>- Any Federal argument in favour of any aspect of the agreement will receive the utmost consideration at my hands ; I am simply guarding myself against this agreement being made use of for the purpose of effecting some internal purposes of State railway service. If there is any Federal justification for the railway I shall say no more, because then the work might be absolutely necessary. It is right,- I think, to intrude for a. moment on what may be considered within the domain of State politics. Honorable members opposite have in their platform a very strong plank, which may be brought into service in a revenue producing shape, but the avowed intent of which is to carry out the work of breaking up the big estates of Australia. I do not think the Commonwealth has the constitutional power to do this; but, although a member of the Federal Parliament, I feel I am entitled to say, in the most public way, that those large landed estates must either be taxed out of existence or resumed out of existence. Without any reflection on the owners, many of whom have done a great deal to build up the industrial progress of Australia, I consider that the time has come when these estates must be transformed into holdings suitable for the purposes of single families. I do not favour the taxing process, and I shall give one or two reasons why. In the first place, as coming from us, for what is really the supreme purpose, I think the taxation is beyond our powers. </para>

            <para>- We have the power of taxation - I do not question that for a moment. We have the power of direct taxation, which includes the taxing of land just as much as it does the taxing of incomes. The only point I make is that the breaking up of large estates is a matter for the political evolution of the States themselves - that it is not a fiscal question, but a land question, and should be taken up by the States. But I would say that those in the States who do not take up this question in a serious light, do not deserve for a moment to hold the power. My objection to the exercise of the taxing power is, first, that, for the object of breaking up estates, it is beyond our province, and, secondly, that it is altogether too slow and unsatisfactory a process. The next question is that of the policy of resumption ; and I entirely believe in that policy. But I have no hesitation in saying that, as it is being now carried out, it is a. weak and foolish policy. In the first place, it is altogether too slow ; in the second place, it will allow the evil to grow again; and, in the third place, it sets up the values of lands which have not been resumed, as against the State itself. </para>

            <para>- I desire to show my honorable friends opposite that my methods are absolutely diverse from theirs. I am at one with them in recognising the gravity of the evil, and in recognising that it is a curse which should be removed from the national prospects of Australia. I wish to say that my proposal, if I had the opportunity to submit one,  would follow roughly these lines : In the first place, the policy of resuming one estate after another is singularly weak and inconclusive, for the reasons I have mentioned. Most of these estates have been built up against the policy of the law - many of them have become large estates by a manipulation of the declared land policy of the country. It is easy for me, not being in State politics, to say these things, but I take the full responsibility for my utterances. I should like to see an Act passed in the States declaring the existence of these large estates to be contrary to public policy - declaring that every one of them will be gradually resumed, and that if the owners will not voluntarily subdivide, so as to unlock those estates for the benefit of Australians, and of people coming to this country, the States will themselves unlock the lands. I desire to leave to the owners the alternative of dealing with the lands in their own way. </para>

            <para>- I&#39; hope the honorable member will forgive me if I have wounded his feelings. But to return to the land question, what, may I ask, is at the root of the evil? What has been the main animating feature of land owning and the aggregation of large estates? At the heart of that aggregation is the magnificent opportunity that it offers to reap wealth out of the national energies and the national development. I think that in any Bill such as that I haw mentioned there should be a clause providing that the value of the land to be gradually resumed shall in no case exceed the value at the time of the passing of the Act. That would take the heart out of the practice of holding on to the land, and for the future, at all events, we should have none of the increment derived from the employment of the energies and wealth of the State going into the hands of those who possess that which is the main factor of all human wealth and national prosperity. I wish now to refer to charges that have been made by the Opposition against honorable members on this side, implying that the forces of the new fusion will be used for the purpose of aggrandizing the wealthier classes of the community. </para>

How intensely indignant members of the Labour party are when a quotation from Marx, Bebel, or some other eminent Socialist, is said to represent their views. My honorable friends have often just reason to complain of the use that is made of such writings. </para>

            <para>- On the contrary, I have always taken the opposite view. I have always endeavoured to keep the fight against Socialism free from any injustice of that kind, because I know that there are views expressed by leading Continental Socialists that are entirely repugnant to the beliefs and policy of the Labour party of Australia. It is equally unfair to brand a whole party with the fact that some particular member of. that party happens to be this or that. Just as we have in this great Liberal party some who lag too far behind, so my honorable friends of the Labour party have among them some who go too fast. What do the Socialists say of the Labour party? Do they not denounce its members as facing-both-ways - as contemptible shams, pretending to believe in Socialism, but not having the pluck to declare themselves? My honorable friends had better look nearer home; they will find supporting them at election time a number of anarchists. Yet who would dream of branding the Labour party as anarchists because a few anarchists support them as against us? It would be grossly unfair to do so, and it is equally unfair to attack any other great party on similar grounds. It is a mean way of trying to carry on a political fight. </para>

            <para>- We have not the easy way of manufacturing a political conscience that honorable members opposite have. They are the creatures of a political Litany enforced by Athanasian penalties. The planks of a large platform are read out to them one by one, and they are asked to take their choice. They are told : &#34; If you accept every one of these planks, just as we have put them to you, your calling and election is sure ; but if you will not accept all these planks, if you will not accept them as the voice of your political conscience and your political judgment, you must be everlastingly damned.&#34; That is the position of the Labour party. Their policy and their brains are found for them : their conscience is found for them, and if they stray a single hair&#39;s breadth off one of those planks they fall into the sea of political perdition. </para>

I am sometimes described as the friend of the capitalist, and of the employers - mv enemies have always so described me in the political arena - but at the last general election, I had not a vehicle working for me until about 2 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, when some one sent along a couple. </para>

            <para>- But they did not send them. Unfortunately the children of mammon supplied motors for the opposition candidate. After all, the sooner we recognise fairly and manfully what is the real line of cleavage between honorable members opposite, and those on this side of the House, the better. The real line of cleavage is the line between those who believe in development by private enterprise as against those who .believe in development, in the industrial world, by State monopolies. That is the line of cleavage. There are, on this side of the House, men who are just as genuine in their love of Australia - just as keen in their instincts of humanity - as is any honorable member opposite. But a broad line divides us. The question that separates us is, whether the development of Australia on lines of private enterprise is the right method of development, or whether the industrial development of Australia along lines of </para>

        <para class="block">State control, is the proper one. There is a broad principle involved, and it is upon that the battle must te fought. I was suspected of some sort of disposition to run counter to the fusion ; but there is no man in Australia who ought to be. prouder of the fusion than  I  should be, since  I  laid its foundation in the battle that I fought before the electors three years ago. It was then that I called for an alliance between Free Traders and Protectionists, sinking the fiscal issue, in order to fight what, in my opinion, was the greatest battle of all : the battle of those who believe in the development of Australia by private enterprise as against those who believe in development by State monopoly. Whilst there are wrongs to be redressed, I believe in using to the utmost the power of Parliament to redress them; whilst there are abuses which ought to be suppressed, I believe in the right and power of Parliament to suppress them. But if honorable members study the genius of the human race, in its last analysis,  I  think they will find that the evolution will be, not towards more and more State interference, but towards less and less. I can imagine a time of elevation and expansion in human destiny, in which, of all artificial contrivances, that of the State will least promote the genuine happiness and welfare of mankind. I wish, in conclusion, to offer a few remarks that I hope will be considered by honorable members on all sides of the House, and I think they will allow me to presume so far as -to make the suggestion I propose to make. Whilst I can quite understand the resentment shown by members of the Labour party on the occurrence recently of what to them were startling changes, I hope that that personal aspect of the fight has passed away. Since we are on the threshold of the greatest battle ever fought in Australian history, we might well be content to fight that battle outside when the proper time comes. In the meantime, we might all for once recognise the interests of the great masses of the Australian community, and in the few months that are left to us this session endeavour along lines of broad patriotism - not dealing with questions that arouse keen party conflict - to do something for the benefit of the whole community in connexion with questions of pressing urgency and importance. </para>

            <para>-  The right honorable member went back to the years  1885  and  1887,  and accused me of then being a Free Trader, and of making statements that showed that I was a Free Trader. As a matter of fact, however, he did not quote one statement made by rr.e to the effect that I was in favour of Free Trade. He quoted remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Dibbs or <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Patrick</inline> Jennings, but he did not quote mine.  I  was in two Ministries before the fiscal question arose. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Patrick</inline> Jennings proposed duties of  5  per cent., it was the second occasion that duties of that kind were proposed in New South Wales. I think some such duties were proposed years before, but of this I am not sure. I was a Minister, but not Treasurer, in the Government of the day. The honorable member has not proved that I was ever a Free Trader. I never was a Free Trader after the fiscal question was raised. </para>

That was my action in regard to a new question, about which  I  had then little knowledge. The right honorable member misrepresented me. He spoke of the proposal to impose duties of 5 per cent, as a Free Trade proposal. He forgot to say that, later on, the Dibbs Government imposed duties of  10  and  15  per cent. , which were regarded as Protectionist, and that ever since I have been in the van of the Protectionist cause. He stated that I voted against a Bill to prevent rotten ships from going to sea. </para>

            <para>-  The right honorable member said that I voted to compel seamen to give notice, before going to sea, that their vessels were rotten. The provision for which I voted required sailors who knew that their ships were rotten to give notice of the fact before going to sea. If a man did not know that his ship was rotten, how could he give notice? In  1897,  following on the right honorable member&#39;s five years&#39; term: of office, I passed the most stringent Act to prevent rotten ships from being sent to sea.  I  did that without his assistance. One or two rotten ships may since have been purchased, to be sent to sea and sunk, but in the year before the Act was passed no fewer than eight such vessels had been sent, out from Newcastle and lost. The right honorable gentleman referred to the Early Closing Act, in connexion with the passing of which he fought me night after night.  I should not have passed that Act had it not been for the assistance of the Labour party of New South Wales. </para>

          <para>.- I I have never felt more disappointed at anything which has taken place under Federation than at what has taken place here during the last few weeks. During the five and a half years I have occupied a seat in the House, I have been disappointed at the small amount of business which has been transacted. Why? Because of the system of party politics we have; the excess to which party politics are pushed, and the frequent introduction of New South Wales politics into our deliberations. I recognise that it is very difficult for any one to follow the honorable member for East Sydney. He always attracts a good house by reason of the humor he introduces into his speeches and the ability he displays in many things, especially in quoting from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> extracts which suit his particular point, and leaving out those things which do not, misrepresenting, by that method, statements which have been made. I feel at somewhat of a disadvantage knowing that the entertainment for the day has come to an end, and that the audience is getting rather tired of listening to debate upon the present position of public business. If the Commonwealth is to achieve the progress and prosperity which should distinguish a young country, the House will have to exclude from its deliberations personalities and State politics. And just as we are not expected to refer to another place in connexion with the Parliament, so I consider that it would be a very good thing if we were prohibited from dealing here with State politics and the history of Australia. </para>

            <para>- I do not desire any interjections from the honorable member, because I know his ability at putting speakers off the thread of their arguments. He is a very old politician, and very skilful in the art of interjecting and defending his own party. It is not for me to say who introduced State politics and historical allusions into this debate. I know that a lot of blame is attached to the Labour party for &#34; stone-walling.&#34; I know that, for mere party purposes, the Labour party is accused of obstruction by certain newspapers. When I sat on a Ministerial bench for four days and four nights, without being able to go to my home, who was obstructing the business of the Commonwealth? Many members of this Ministry were then obstructing the present Prime Minister. Ifhe at that time was right, how is it that the then Opposition have gone over to his side? Is it because they have been attracted by the fruits of office or power, by the loaves and fishes? Or was the party I was. then supporting wrong? If we are to conduct the affairs of the Commonwealth with business method the sooner we get rid of many of our present practices the better. A short time ago the honorable member for Ballarat was sitting on the Opposition bench, and when the Fisher Government brought down a GovernorGeneral&#39;s speech of thirty-two clauses, he said that it was only intended for the shop window, that it contained many clauses which could not be dealt with during this session. But the other evening he laid upon the table of the House a memorandum containing thirty-four proposals. If the speech was intended for the shop window, was not his own memorandum also intended for the shop window, rather than for practical purposes? It only shows how some men change their view with their position in the House. When a man is sitting on the Opposition bench he will say anything and everything against the actions, the motives, and the policy of the Administration, but as soon as he gets a place on the Treasury bench he will bring forward a policy containing a number of similar items, as the Prime Minister has done in his memorandum. </para>

            <para>- It is the curse of party politics, and until the people awake to a sense of their responsibility, and to the amount of taxation which is put upon them by reason of party politics, the system will be continued. Unfortunately, we have to sit on one side of the House or the other, because there is no middle position. I may be accused of sitting on a rail or doing something of that sort, but it does not matter to me. I believe that every honorable member should accept the responsibility of his own action, and should not be bound hand and foot to one side or the other. A short time ago the honorable member for East Sydney twitted the honorable member for Hume with being a Free Trader, because his leader was a Free Trader. Are we to understand that every honorable member who sits on the Government side to-day is a Protectionist because the leader of that side is a Protectionist ? It is most peculiar to hear these taunts flung at different honorable members, because their leader happens to advocate one thing or the other. If we desire to do our business in an expeditious way, so that we may be able to return to our homes from time to time and ascertain the wants of our constituents, we shall have to get rid of a number of these long tedious speeches. In travelling about the country a short time ago the Prime Minister said that the oldage pensions were in danger, as there was not enough money with which to pay them. Yet before he was in office a week or two, and notwithstanding the fact that Parliament was to meet in about a fortnight, he transmitted a cablegram promising a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> or its equivalent to the people of England, thereby showing that according to his view there was plenty of money at the disposal of the Commonwealth. What is the position? Although the Government have made that offer to the Old Country, we find that our volunteers have not enough rifles to use, that ammunition is very scarce, the inference being that we have not enough money available even for defending Australia as it ought to be defended. </para>

            <para>- Cadets could not go to the encampment because we had not sufficient funds for the purpose, while we could offer  .&#163;2,000,000  to the Old Country. It had not asked for the gift, which was not really needed. Unfortunately, I cannot say much regarding the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department whilst I am a member of the Postal Commission. I propose to deal with a few matters which concern my district, and if I should appear to be parochial, it is simply owing to the fact that I do not wish to deal with the larger and wider question of administration and management at the present time. In my district there is one post-office which shows a profit of  &#163;400.  The town wishes to connect with another town across the river, and only six miles away, by means of a postal service, at a cost of eight or ten, or perhaps fifteen, pounds a year. But the people cannot obtain that connexion because of the starvation system which obtains. In other country districts the school teachers have offered to take charge of papers and letters for the parents of the children, but the  Deputy  PostmasterGeneral has gone on the huckstering principle of offering to give the whole of the revenue received to the postmistresses for looking after the service. That, I contend, is a very peculiar attitude for the Government to take up. It was not adopted in connexion with the construction of the telephone from Melbourne to Sydney. I was very pleased to hear the honorable&#39; member for East Sydney speak as he did in reference to the accommodation&#39; of outlying districts. When a service is required in Melbourne or Sydney, no question is asked as to whether it will pay. Throughout Queensland there are hundreds of places where the services are not paying, although those places are quite entitled to have them ; yet we in Tasmania cannot get a service costing  &#163;10  or  &#163;15,  because there is no money available, although we are supposed to be able to afford to give  &#163;2,000,000  to the Old Country to buy a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> I have often mentioned the subject of wireless telegraphy. Some two years ago the Government put on the Estimates  &#163;10,000  for the establishment of wireless telegraphy stations in Australia, but last year the money was struck off. I asked the then Postmaster-General, the honorable member for Maribyrnong, if it was simply a political placard, or whether he meant business. He said there was no political placard in his Department; but it appearsnow that there was in that instance. Every one who has read what has taken place in the world recently knows the advantage of wireless telegraphy to Australia for shipping purposes. There lie between Victoria and Tasmania King Island and Flinders Island, which have no communication with the mainland. Yet nothing is being done to provide it for them. They have, or are supposed to. have, a mail service once in three weeks, but they have no cable or wireless telegraphy, and if a storm arises they can hold no communication with the mainland for weeks, as I have known to happen in the past. If there is a wreck there, they have no means of notifying the people on the mainland of what has happened. I say, therefore, that the Government were not justified in giving away  &#163;2,000,000  when a small service of that kind cannot be provided for the people. Wireless telegraphy has already saved many lives in peril upon the ocean, and is capable of saving many more. We have had an intimation that the Union Steam-ship Company are quite willing to establish wireless telegraphy on the whole of their large fleet as soon as stations are established on the land. Of course, it is of no use on the ships unless there is an installation on the land to communicate with. I trust that at an early date the Commonwealth will establish a wireless telegraphy service for the safety of the people as well as for the benefit of those who live in isolated positions. When I entered the House, I thought that we should deal in a business-like way with questions like that of uniform postage stamps, but recently-, when in Queensland, I, bought a few more stamps than I required, and theyare in my pocket-book still, for they are of no use to me in any other State. A commercial traveller, when in any particular State, must buy only the exact number of stamps that he requires, or make a loss on them. What an absurdity that is in a country which is supposed to be federated ! We know that it is on account of the bookkeeping system which is at present in vogue, but surely the States are not so narrowminded that they will not accept one another&#39;s stamps? This is one of those things that irritate and annoy the public, whereas it would only be a small item for the States to agree upon. A penny stamp should be recognised as a penny stamp all over Australia, no matter what State it is issued in. There are several anomalies with regard to the  Tasmanian postal service which should be rectified. In Victoria, the postage on circulars is one halfpenny, but in Tasmania it is one penny, and if a business man in Tasmania wishes to send out 2,000 or 3,000 circulars, he can have the whole of them sent to Melbourne, and posted here at a reduced rate, and then sent to Tasmania. That State does the whole work of distributing them, and gets nothing for it. The Tasmanian business man saves one half-penny on every circular he sends out, but he gives the revenue to Victoria, and the work to his own State. It may be said that that sort of thing would not be patriotic, but every business man likes to do things as expeditiously and cheaply as possible, and under present conditions there is every inducement to Tasmanian merchants to have their printing and posting done in Victoria. This great injustice to Tasmania has been brought before various PostmastersGeneral. No remedy has been applied, and yet we call ourselves a federated community. If we are to prosper, to look upon one another as brothers, with the motto &#34; One destiny, one flag, and one people,&#34; we should do away with the bookkeeping system, which causes a large amount of expense in checking the business of one State against another, when we are all supposed to be members of one firm. The people of Victoria would never think of checking whether goods were to be sent to Bendigo, Ballarat, or Ararat. The goods come here, the duty is paid to the Customs,&#39; and divided. When we federated, the bookkeeping system should never have been introduced. It was claimed that it would be useful in showing how things would work. That purpose has been achieved, and now we are spending a lot of money every year to produce a check which is only sufficiently correct to prove that the whole system is of no benefit. We should work in a Federal spirit if we are to have a federated Australia. With regard to the question of the State and Commonwealth finances, I have heard a great deal about State and Commonwealth rights, but, after all, the money belongs to the people, whether it is spent by the Commonwealth or by the States. We are all one, and we cannot be sepa- rated. It is only a question of coming to some arrangement. I cannot see the benefit of having Conferences. The State Premiers should meet first, and agree as to what they want. Then this Parliament, not our Government, should decide what they are prepared to concede to the States. Those two conditions being satisfied, it would be for the Premiers and the Prime Minister to negotiate, and to come to final terms. That is how any business concern would deal with the matter. If one man is dealing with six others, those six first agree as to what they regard as a fair bargain to make, the other man then meets them, and they talk the matter over in a business-like way. If there is a difference of a few pounds, they compromise, and the business is transacted. What is the use of the Prime Minister meeting six State Premiers if the latter have not first made up their minds what they require? All the Conferences that will be held, and ,all the talk that will take place can never remedy the trouble, until the Premiers first meet and decide what they require, and then deal with the Commonwealth in a reasonable and proper manner. There is sufficient wisdom amongst the Premiers, with the assistance of the Prime Minister, to do what is right in the interests of all. We hear a great deal about buildings belonging to the Commonwealth, and others belonging to the States, but they all belong to the people of Australia. It is just as if a man had money in both pockets, and had to pay an account out of one or the other. The appointment of a High Commissioner has been spoken of for years, but nothing has been done. I thought the matter would have been dealt with a long while ago, but long delay has been caused, because one party wanted to send one man, and another party wanted to send another man, and, consequently, the question of this, the most important appointment of all, has been neglected. Many of those who at present occupy the Treasury bench opposed the names of certain men that have been suggested for the position. The establishment of an agricultural bureau is one of the steps which I advocated before I came into this House, and I thought that it would have been accomplished before now. Its establishment is calculated to be of immense value to the people, but while honorable members representing different parties have been fighting each other, the business of Australia has been laid on one side, and nothing has been done in this matter.

We have passed a quarantine law, and we are told that quarantine is now in the hands of the Federation ; but if one desires to take a prize beast from Victoria to Tasmania, he will find that the animal must undergo four months&#39; quarantine in the latter State. It may be half -starved or neglected at the quarantine station while there. When I was a member of the State Parliament, I tried to deal with this question of quarantine. There are a few individuals in charge of the administration of quarantine legislation in the various States who seem to me to put every obstacle they can in the way of the free exchange of animals of all descriptions between the States. At one time in Tasmania, six months&#39; quarantine was enforced, but in the State Parliament, we managed to reduce the term to four months. I thought that under the operation of a Federal Act, a sensible course would be followed, but I find that four months quarantine is still enforced in Tasmania, in the case of animals transferred from the other States. I think that if animals, after undergoing examination, were kept here for a month or two months, and then put onboard ship with a clean certificate, it should be sufficient merely that they should be re-examined on arrival in Tasmania. But I find that the provisions of the old State Act are still being enforced. This applies to animals of every description. We now find that the authorities in some of the </para>

        <para class="block">States are prohibiting the importation of potatoes from Tasmania. We have a Federal Quarantine Act, but all power in these matters appears still to be in the hands of the State authorities. If business men had the control of quarantine in Australia, I am quitesure that they would not permit the present obstacles to the transfer of stock from one State to another to continue. In reference to the present position of political parties, I should like to say that as a Protectionist and a supporter of the last Deakin Ministry, I felt that we occupied a position of power, while we could rely upon the assistance of the Labour party. When the Labour party withdrew their support, the present Prime Minister stated on the floor of this Chamber that he was prepared to support that party so long as they were prepared to carry out his policy. But as soon as we got into recess, the honorable gentleman, and others, commenced to break away from that promise. The Prime Minister has now joined with the party that was then in Opposition, and which, he said, was comprised of the wreckage of a number of other parties. I do not approve of calling any party names in this House. Every honorable member has a perfect right to sit on whichever side of. the House he pleases, to adopt what policy he thinks fit, and to change his opinions, if he thinks it wise to do so. These are matters for himself and his constituents, and are no business of mine. At the same time, as one who regards himself as a Liberal, I feel that the present Ministry and their supporters are not entitled to call themselves the Liberals of Australia. The Government are comprised of many members who can never be called Liberals, and who, I think, would not feel justified in claiming that title for themselves, though I admit that the Prime Minister, and some of those with him, were entitled to be so called. While the Labour Government were in power, the present Prime Minister and the members of his party were in a position, as the centre party supporting theLabour  Administration,  to control the legislation of this Parliament. The Labour Government could not have passed a single Act without the support of the true Liberal party. Even if the Labour Government had introduced extreme measures - and I have not seen any of their extreme measures - about which so much has been said, they could not have passed them without the assistance of the Liberal party, and, therefore, from the </para>
        <para class="block">Liberal point of view, the interests of the country were perfectly safe. That cannot be said now, when the Prime Minister and some of his followers have joined forces with those who used to be in opposition to them. I do not often take notice of what appears in the newspapers, nor am I influenced by what they say. But an article appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Agc</inline> of the 14th of May last puts the position as it then existed so  clearly  that I cannot do better than make a short quotation from it. After referring to various difficulties, and the danger to the seats of certain honorable members, the article continues - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Still, when all these allowances are made, and even when such considerations are emphasized, they do not suffice to excuse the Liberal party permitting itself to be absorbed in a combination of Conservatism and anti-Socialists, where it must become a back number, without power, without influence, and only a disappointed spectator of the drift of high purposes. In this time of stress and strain, when all kinds of influences are beings employed to submerge the Liberal party and its leader, it is the duty of that party more than ever to stand firm in its integrity. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I agree entirely with that statement of the position. I ask why this great change? We were told by the Prime Minister that it was because the seats of certain honorable members of the Liberal party were being endangered by the action of the Labour party in the constituencies. In my opinion, it will be a  sorry  day for Australia when we are to consider the security of our seats in this House rather than what is right to be done in the interests of the country. I have never considered the security of my seat. I remember that I have been sent here by the electors to do what I consider best in the interests of Tasmania and of the Commonwealth as a whole. I will use what wisdom I have to that end. But I will never support a policy merely in order to save my seat. I should have an utter contempt for any member of this House if it could be said of him that he supported a certain course in politics for any reason of that description. We should always consider the good of Australia, rather than any of our own individual interests. With reference to the fusion that has taken place, I would remark that the word is a peculiar one in politics. One night the electric lights went out in my house. I was told that the cause was that the wires had fused. I wonder whether the Liberal light has gone out now that the Liberals have fused with another party. We have heard many interpretations as to what the fusion means. The honorable member for Lang gave us an interpretation that was altogether different from what I was told when I was asked to enter the Fusion party. The meeting at which the matter was explained to me. was a private one, and I am not one of those who would state publicly what was done at a private meeting. But, at all events, I can say that the version given by the honorable member for Lang was totally different from that given to me on the occasion to which I refer. The question of defence is one of the most important that could be brought under the attention of Parliament. I referred to it on the last occasion when I . spoke as demanding to be dealt with in a firm, strong manner. But under our party system, of Government as soon as one Minister gets used to his office he has to make room for another one. Not so long ago the honorable member for Richmond was Minister of Defence. He was succeeded by a senator. Now the honorable member for Parramatta holds the office. The present Minister has, on previous occasions, stated definitely that he is opposed to the policy brought forward by the Prime Minister and also by the Labour Government. He has stated on several occasions that he is opposed to compulsory training. I do not know whether he intends to adapt himself to the altered circumstances, and to support the principle that he has denounced, but which is now so popular. The Prime Minister stated to the press some time ago that the Minister who has gone to England has been sent there to represent the Government. What the views of the Government may be on this important question I do not know. If the Government representative expresses his own opinions, as explained here and elsewhere in Australia, I doubt whether he can at the same time represent the views of the Prime Minister, and he certainly cannot represent those of Australia. I am glad that it was on the recommendation of the Fisher Government that the Imperial Conference was called. In view of the fact that the Imperial Government invited Australian representatives to be sent, it is to be regretted that the subject was not dealt with apart from party politics. We read in the press, when the present Government came into office that it was their intention to send the honorable member for Richmond to London in company with the honorable member for </para>
        <para class="block">Brisbane. If, however, the Government had wished the question to be dealt with apart from party considerations, they would have done a just and righT thing had they sent Home the ex-Minister of Defence in company with a member of the Cabinet. The fact that they sent a Minister unaccompanied showed conclusively that the Government are working the defence question on party lines. That is not as it should be. No matter whether a man be a. Liberal or a Conservative, a Free Trader, or a Protectionist, defence should be considered as a purely national question. The same consideration applies to Australia&#39;s relations with the Empire. There is one thing in connexion with the administration of the Fisher Government of which I did not approve. I allude to the expenditure pf  &#163;250,000  which was set aside by Parliament on the understanding that it should not be spent until we met again. The expenditure of that money without consulting Parliament was not a right thing to do. In my opinion, if ships are to be built in Australia, the sooner we begin the better. If we had sent to the Old Country and had brought out some men to teach our own people to build the ships that we require, instead of sending men Home to learn ship-building, we should have followed a wiser course. The men who have gone Home will not be able to learn the whole business of ship-building within the time they will be kent there. If we had imported three or four good men from England, they would have been able to leach our own people far more effectively. </para>

            <para>- Many of the members of the Government have changed their political opinions so often, that I should not be surprised at anything they did. If I thought that it was intended to give us the policy of the old Deakin Government, I should be inclined to support the Ministry  to  a very great extent. As far as they bring forward such measures as were submitted by the former Deakin Government I, shall support them. But I cannot have complete confidence in a Government that is composed of men holding so many beliefs. I thought at one time that I might be able to sit behind the Government, but when after a three weeks&#39; adjournment the Prime Minister sent Home an offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> knowing the financial position of Australia, I felt that I could not have any confidence in a Government that did such a thing. The Prime Minister should not have sought to put so great a burden upon the people of Australia as to pledge them to the extent of  .&#163;2,000,000.  For years we have been scraping up every penny to give to the States, knowing their necessities and the difficulty they had in making both ends meet. We have returned to the States several million pounds more than we need have returned, for the same reason. Yet we find the Prime Minister offering to give away  &#163;2,000,000  without consulting Parliament. How is this state of things brought about? It occurred simply because a few newspapers started an agitation. It was commenced in Sydney and Melbourne. The Premiers of these two great States were not very warm on the subject. In fact, they were opposed to the project. But, of course, the newspapers began to lay on the whip. A few people in the States then began to agitate, but, excepting in Victoria and New South Wales, the Premiers threw cold water on the project. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray,</inline> however, came forward and said that, if the Commonwealth, or the Labour Government, did not make an offer, they would make one themselves. As soon, however, as there was a change of Government, we saw the reason for the hurried motion which was brought on the other day. When we were in recess, the new Government, knowing that we must meet in less than a fortnight, offered a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> or its equivalent, thus placing a heavy burden on the people, though, in some of the smaller States especially, taxation had been stretched to the utmost. Before a Government give away money in this way, Parliament ought to be consulted. </para>

            <para>- I hope the honorable member has made as much sacrifice for the defence of his country as I have. I have been connected with the Defence Forces for over thirty years, and only the other day passed in class firing, so as to be better able to take my part in the defence of the Empire. Some years ago, the Minister of Defence said that he did not like the Reid-McLean Ministry because it contained too many Protectionists; and I may say that I do not like the present Ministry because it contains too many Free Traders, and men who continually blocked legislation which was introduced by the Deakin Government, and which I considered to be for the benefit of the community. I do not expect any good Liberal legislation from the Government, though I hope I may be disappointed, and, if so, any legislation of the kind will have my support. I cannot understand why, in a House of this kind, so many lawyers should be included in the Ministry to the exclusion of business men. There are seven lawyers in the present Government. </para>

            <para>- The honorable mem ber knows, as other lawyers know, that, if a man asks a question of his legal adviser, he is promptly charged 6s. 8d. - that is the extent of the lawyer&#39;s business view. Had some of the legal members of the Ministry been left out, and others like the honorable member for North Sydney, the honorable member for Mernda, or the honorable member for Denison included, I might have felt inclined to give the Government more support. But business men are thrust aside ; and the results are not satisfactory. I have nothing to say against the Minister of Home Affairs, either as a lawyer or as a member of this House, but what does he know, of public buildings and the other works undertaken by the works branch of his Department? When the honorable member for North Sydney was Minister of Home Affairs, he wished to do away with the present cumbersome method of carrying out public works through the Department of Home Affairs; and that would, in my opinion, have been a good step. This is called the Deakin Government, but I do not so regard it. The Government are practically a unicorn team, represented by the Prime Minister, with the right honorable member for Swan, and the honorable member for Parramatta on either side, and that being so, the Prime Minister cannot be regarded as leading the party or the Government in any shape or form. What do we find ? That a departure has been made from all well-recognised traditions in connexion with the system of responsible government. Hitherto, the invariable practice has been for  His Excellency  the Governor-General, upon the defeat of the Ministry of the day, to send for the Leader of the Opposition to form a new Administration, and for that individual to select his own Ministers. But no less than three men had a voice in the selection of the Ministers constituting the present Government. </para>

            <para>- It was another form of the caucus. This circumstance, I think, points to the fact that honorable members are coming to favour the system of elective Ministries. Had the Prime Minister enjoyed a free hand in the selection of his colleagues, I take it that he would not have overlooked the claims of so many of his old friends. But he was bound by the right honorable member for Swan and the honorable member for Parramatta to choose so many Ministers from each party to the fusion. As a result, we have the present Ministry. I venture to say that, if Ministers were asked to commit to writing the planks of their platform, the only plank upon which they would be agreed would be one antagonistic to the Labour party. If  they  are in agreement upon other planks, a- great change of front must have come over certain honorable members since they occupied seats upon this side of the Chamber. I should like to know where my Protectionist friends opposite would be if the Prime Minister were suddenly taken ill whilst Tariff revision was under consideration, and if the Minister of Defence was called upon to act as leader of the Government. Instead of selecting his old friends and supporters as Ministerial colleagues, the Prime Minister was compelled to include in his Cabinet many honorable members who had endeavoured to block his efforts to enact useful legislation. If they had had their way we certainly should not have upon the statute-book to-da.y many of the most useful measures passed by this Parliament. I maintain that, if we are to have party government in Australia, the Ministry should consist of a party with one policy, and not, as it does now, of political fragments. Seeing that the Government have decided to impose a tax upon the people of Australia for all time in connexion with the proposal to present a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to the Mother Country, I cannot say that I have any confidence in them. But if they bring forward measures of which I approve, I shall vote for those measures. There are many other subjects which I might discuss at length. Whatever we, as legislators, may dp, I believe that Australia will prosper. I do not&#39; know whether I shall be here next year, and I do not very much care. I am satisfied that, if the people could only witness the way in which business is transacted in this Chamber, if they could only realize how precious time is wasted, they would certainly not appoint us as directors of their affairs. When I entered this House, I- was imbued with the idea that honorable members were really the directors of the affairs of Australia, and that it was their bounden duty to manage those affairs as they would the business of a large company. If we did that, if we acted as reasonable individuals and avoided all personal abuse of each other, I am convinced that we should do much to shorten debate and to expedite the transaction of public business. We are now laying the foundation of the Australia of the future, &#34;and I trust that those who have had more education and more  opportunities  for improving their position than I have had will throw their hearts into their legislative work, so that the result of our labours may redound to our own credit and to that of the Commonwealth. I trust that the remarks which I have made will not give offence to  anybody.  I regret having had to speak as I have done, but I believe that we should exercise the gifts with which God has endowed us to the advancement of the material welfare of this country, so that its future may be bright and prosperous. I trust that our efforts will be directed to this end, that we shall be imbued with a determination to do what is right for the people as a whole, and that class domination and class misrepresentation will find no place in this House. </para>

          <para>. - I am sorry that after delivering his little lecture to both sides of the House the right honorable member for East Sydney should have absented himself from the chamber. In the course of his remarks he stated that the Ministry were being criticised because one or two of them were Conservatives. Upon previous occasions I have heard honorable members upon this side of the chamber numbered according to their fiscal beliefs, which they had held some time previously, and not according to the votes they had given on the Tariff. Now, if we reckon Conservatives by the number of Conservative votes which they have cast, I make bold to say that we shall find a majority of Conservatives amongst honorable members opposite, and not one or two, as was alleged by the right honorable member for East Sydney. That gentleman also inquired whether the Labour party thought they, the Conservatives, were going to direct the Government as the Labour  party used to do? Has he not been assured by the  Prime  Minister time and again  that  the Labour party  have  never attempted io dictate to him in any way? In making that statement I do not forget that there is one measure which would not have been upon the statute-book to-day had it not been for the Labour party - I refer to the Old-age Pensions Act. The right honorable member for East Sydney further said that it was assumed that Literalism had been weakened by the fusion which had taken place. I do not know whether Liberalism has been weakened, but I do know  that  Conservatism has been strength ened, and that every Conservative, both in this House and in  the  Senate, is supporting the present Ministry. The honorable member went on to say that he was sorry that members of the late Ministry were lamenting their defeat. I have only to say that I have indulged in no lamentation, and that, so far as I am aware, the other members of the late Government have done very little. Surely the honorable member would not judge of our actions by what is written of them in the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> I remember when the right honorable member denounced that journal in this House, and surely he is not going to believe what it writes of the Labour party to-day ! It is more bitterly opposed to us than ever it was to him. And so with the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> It may be said that at the present time there is practically only one morning newspaper published in Melbourne, since the one is merely an echo of the other. It suits their political purpose to declare that the Labour party are squealing because they were turned out of office, and they  have  repeated their misrepresentations of us so often that they really begin now to  believe  them. We have been told that after the Honorable member for Ballarat applied the political stiletto to the ReidMcLean Administration we were glad to support him once more as Prime Minister. Honorable members know that when sitting in the Ministerial corner I did not hesitate to explain that I supported the Deakin  Government,  not because of any great love for them, but because I, and our party generally, had a greater dislike for the then Opposition. </para>

            <para>- I admit th&#39;at we had no objection to some members of the Deakin Ministry, but I did not hesitate to criticise that Ministry just as freely as did any honorable member of the then Opposition. Although the honorable member for East Sydney intimated that, he did not intend to deal with the past - that he would deal only with the future - you must have observed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that in a speech extending over fully an hour and a Half he devoted only five minutes to a review of the future policy of the Ministry, the remainder of his address being directed to a recital of the political history of New South Wales, &#34;and to a consideration of the question of whether or not the honorable member for Hume is more radical in his views to-day than he was some twenty-five years ago. Apparently the strongest accusation he could make against the honorable member was that some twenty-five years ago he was a Free Trader, whereas he is now a Protectionist. That statement, no doubt, was heard with horror by the Prime Minister. The honorable member also said that the honorable member for Hume had brought forward a list of Tariff anomalies. Every one knows that as soon as we had passed the&#34; Tariff Bill, and long before the Labour Ministry came into existence, the honorable . member for Hume stated that he intended to go through the Tariff and to prepare a list of anomalies, with a view to their rectification. Such a statement, I dare say, may be found in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but, even if it cannot, honorable members will have no difficulty in finding in the newspapers reports of interviews, with press representatives, in which he expressed -his intention of adopting that course. It will be learned with interest by those who are organizing an alleged Liberal League in Victoria that, according to the right honorable member for East Sydney, the Coalition have sunk the fiscal issue. and that they claim that in that respect they are only following the lead of the Labour party. I would reply to the honorable member that we have never sunk the fiscal issue. There is a broad distinction between giving to every member of a party freedom to vote as he pleases on the fiscal issue and a determination by a party, as a whole, that the fiscal issue shall be. sunk. We1 have in this House twenty-six members of the Labour party, and, judging by their votes on the last Tariff, not more than six of that number are Free Traders. There are in this_ House at least twenty members of the Labour party who are free to. support the opposite fiscal policy. </para>

            <para>- We are not elected as fiscalists, but as Labour men, and the newspapers take care to let that fact be known. The Treasurer is aware that the Labour Conference at which our platform is drawn up consists of delegates elected by the votes of all who care to join any of our Labour organizations. Honorable members of the Labour party are not free to insert a fiscal plank in the programme after it has been drawn up by the Conference, and they would not be free to withdraw such a plank from it. The Treasurer, however, is free to insert in his programme any plank that he pleases, and later on to run away from it. </para>

            <para>- No, I am not bound to half the extent that the honorable member is. I shall not say that the Government and their supporters have swallowed their principles, foi some of them have never had any principles 1o swallow; but it is not unreasonable to say that they are prepared to drop any plank in their programme when it suits them to do so, and to pick it up again when they think it expedient. I have no doubt that at the next general election the people of Victoria will be told, if the Coalition Government are still in existence - which is very doubtful - that great prominence will be given by them to the second plank in the programme which the Prime Minister put forward at the Melbourne Town Hall meeting. I refer to the plank of effective Protection - a plank which the Ministry has dropped. </para>

            <para>- We have not effective Protection, and the Government and their supporters will learn at the next election that we have not ; the people do not shave the honorable member&#39;s view. Only yesterday a deputation waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs to urge that a higher duty &#39;should be placed on a certain item, and when I had the honour to hold that office I also received a deputation which desired to bring under my notice certain anomalies in the Tariff. Notwithstanding that the present Ministry have had nothing to say in this House in regard to the question of effective Protection, I have no doubt that they and their supporters will give prominence to it in Victoria, although that will not be done in New South Wales. Those who mount the stump in support of the Government party in this State will tell us that they believe in the policy of effective Protection ; but does any one imagine that honorable members sitting behind the Government and representing the Free Trade constituencies in New South Wales will make the same statement in that State? We know that they will not. Unlike the Government, the Labour party have one platform for all Australia. </para>

            <para>- Then she ought to make him a strong one, because he is a heavy individual, physically. The right honorable member for East Sydney said that the fiscal question is being sunk by the Ministerialists. Does he mean that nothing is to be done to rectify Tariff anomalies? Honorable gentlemen opposite make no reply. It is said that they have sunk the Tariff in imitation of the Labour party&#39;s action in regard to the fiscal issue. We did not sink- the fiscal issue, though we announced ourselves as Labour men first of all. The fact that I was a Labour man was stated on all my bills and cards. </para>

            <para>- If Ministerialists were made responsible for the opinions of their leader, some of them would be in a difficult position. The right honorable member for East Sydney taunted the honorable member for Hume with having declared that three voters in a city constituency should not have more political power than two in a country constituency. </para>

            <para>- At any rate, we have not gone back. As a matter of fact, the Victorian representatives, with whom the right honorable member for East Sydney is now sitting, all took an attitude similar to that of the honorable member for Hume. When an Electoral Bill was before this House a few years ago, all the Victorian representatives, except myself, wished to give country constituencies a larger representation than city constituencies. Personally, I could not see that it was fair to give 14,000 men in a country constituency the same representation as 42,000 in my constituency. I agree with what the right honorable member said about the deception of intending immigrants, and I hope that the Ministry will put facts fairly before those whom they are trying to attract to this country. People should not be brought here under false pretences. They should know exactly how things stand before they leave  their  own country. He also gave credit to the Minister of Defence for advancing physical culture among the cadets. But it was the Minister&#39;s predecessor who convened a conference to consider the possibility of having a medical inspection of the State schools, while the honorable member for Hindmarsh moved a motion in favour of teaching the cadets physical culture, and I, by asking questions, two or three years ago, got the Prime Minister to promise to refer the matter to a Premiers&#39; Conference. Therefore, the inception of the idea lies, not with the present Minister, but with his predecessor, and with the others I have mentioned. </para>

            <para>- Perhaps he wished to hedge a bit, because he does not know how to suit the company in which he may find himself in the future. He said that the resumption of land at present in operation in the various States was a weak and foolish system. I certainly agree with him, that the aggregation of large estates is a curse. He put me in mind of what the Prime Minister aptly termed the dressing of a shop window. He was dressing his shop window, but in front of the window there was this placard - &#34; This shop is closed for stock-taking and repairs.&#34; He can dress a shop window with his particular proposals, but he has no power to carry them into effect. He is no more than any other honorable member who sits in the Ministerial corner or on this side. &#39;All that he can do is to vote for or against particular proposals which are brought forward. It is all very well for him to ask what will be done on the land question, but he has no more power to exercise than has any other honorable member. He can only use his voice and vote. </para>

            <para>- The people have weighed the right honorable gentleman and found him wanting. At the last general election his political stock was taken, and He was passed out as a back number in politics. He returned to the House with a diminished following, and now the three parties in opposition to the Labour party have joined together. Whether that conjunction will prove beneficial or otherwise remains to be seen. The right honorable member said that it is not fair to quote the honorable member for Fawkner as being the  president  of the Employers&#39; Federation, or to call this an Employers&#39; Federation Ministry. Apparently the Employers&#39; Federation want to make it one, if we are to judge by their reports. We are not judging them by our reports. I acknowledge that honorable members on the other side do not find anything like that from any of our supporters. If I call this Ministry an Employers&#39; Federation Ministry, it will only be because that body has furnished the proof that it is. I have not taken the proof from anybody else. They have stated that if Socialists are quoted against us, we resent it. It is well-known that the official Socialist party in Victoria, and, I believe, in other States, have always been most bitter in denunciation of the Labour party. At the last State election here they opposed the representatives of the Labour party, but a great number of them have, I believe, seen the error of their ways, and that, of course, is a good thing. I certainly hoped that there would be a unifying of our forces, as well as a unifying of those who are opposed to everything regarded as progressive. We are asked today by the press- What is the use of continuing this debate? That is equivalent to a statement that honorable members have no right to speak to their constituents, or to place their position before the House. I offer no apology for any speech I may make. I have as much right as any other honorable member to speak, and I shall do so whenever I desire. The position of the Ministry should, I think, be challenged. Whether they win or lose, we shall know the exact position of every honorable member who is supporting them. Government supporters will not be able to say, at an election, as a number of them would otherwise do - &#34; If the Ministry had been challenged, We would have voted against them.&#34; The position of the Ministry is, I admit, a peculiar one. </para>

One newspaper to-day is an echo; of the other. It has been said that some Ministers are more pleasant since they crossed the floor, that instead of scowling they are smiling. Some Ministers never smiled before they reached the Treasury bench. It puts me in mind of the well known verse - </para>

        <para class="block">The Minister of Defence is smiling because he has swallowed the Libera&#93; party; the Treasurer is smiling because he also has done some swallowing. I admit that the Postmaster-General does not appear to have swallowed anything, except that which, perhaps, has disagreed with him. The Minister of Home Affairs is just the same as he was previously. Outside the House we have never been doubtful as to the Prime Minister&#39;s attitude to the Labour party. I hold in my hand a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">British Australasian</inline> for 23rdMay, 1907, which contains a report of what is known as his &#34;deep-water&#34; speech. As it is not a cabled account, as it cannot be said to have been faked by any newspaper here, as it was published in London when the Prime Minister was there, I propose to put on record what the Prime Minister did say of the Labour party, and afterwards show how mistaken he was in his statements regarding the number of Labour members in the State Parliaments. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister was fooling either the people in the Old Country or the Labour party here. He could not possibly be true to both at once. Either he meant this, or he did not. If the report was cabled out inadvertently, perhaps we did not get the proper strength of the position. Therefore, I propose, in justice to the honorable and learned gentleman, to put on record the report which appeared in the British newspaper. </para>

After all, he did not think that sentiment counted for very much in this matter! Capital was selfish, and would go where it could get the best terms. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline>in reply, said that there was no need for him to point out that, besides the central Government, every State in Australia had its own Government, exercising absolutely independent authority over its citizens and its own undertakings. Among those undertakings, as it happened, came the whole body of municipal and private enterprises, the land, and the railways, and all the great industrial associations connected with them. The central Government had limited powers of control over the whole Continent; but, before dealing with the Commonwealth aspect of the situation, he would refer to the chief or most persistent cause of alarm to. investors - namely, what was called the rise and growth of the&#39; Labour party.- That party had its initiation in Australia at a time of reaction. There had been a great financial expansion, and bankers, in order to find investments for the large amount of money at their command, had encouraged enterprises which would not stand close scrutiny. Then alarm spread, and investors, who have lent money on short terms .to bankers, who had been foolish enough to lend it on long terms, called it in, and a crisis followed. The Labour party had its time of growth and maturity, but at present it was in very deep water as a party. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline>then reviewed at considerable length the position of the Labour party in the several States.

            <para>- That is a very fair rate of increase In Queensland, where the Prime Minister said that the party would not count in the new Parliament about to be elected, they are in a very strong position, despite all those who have left them. In Tasmania, where the honorable gentleman said the Labour party had never counted, it has two-fifths of the whole of the representation in the Lower House, more than either of the other parties by itself, and very little less than the two together. In Western Australia the party is stronger than ever. That was the speech which the Prime Minister made &#39;as a prophet. When he was away from the party he said it did not count, and that outside the Federal arena we were put in our places. Only a few months <inline font-style="italic">ago</inline> he described the different parties that&#39; sit opposite, with the exception* of the party of ten that he has taken over, as the wreckage of the Black Labour party,, of the Free Importing party, of the antiSocialist party, and the Individualist party. But there is now the wreckage of another party washed up with the flotsam and jetsam on the other side of the House - the wreckage of his own party - and hetook them there. I do not blame him for doing so, for it is quite right that all the wrecks should be together. We have been, told that the fusion was brought about in order to dish the Labour party, and that it would last, at any rate, over the next election; but as any Senate candidates returned at the next election will hold their seats for six years, the fusion must last for six years. That means that honorable members opposite have  agreed  to sink the Tariff for at least that time. Some honorable members may say &#34; so much the better,&#34; but they will not be able to fool the people into the belief that the arrangement is to last only three years. That being the case, Protectionists, if they intend to support the present) Ministry, must know that there can be no dealing with the Tariff in any way for the next six years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> admitted yesterday that there was no hope of dealing with it. Is there a combined party opposite, and if so, what are the objects for which it has come together? </para>

Yet he has combined with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook&#39;s</inline> party, which advocates Free </para>
          <para class="block">Trade, and State Rights, is opposed to military training, and represents &#34; property.&#34; To make the coalition more unnatural, it has been arranged to defeat a party which has taken over all the prominent planks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin&#39;s</inline> own programme. The terms of the coalition are that the Cookites approve <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin&#39;s</inline> programme, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> makes no attempt to carry it out; but, of course, the real purpose of the coalition is to get into office. One cannot help thinking that, however desirable and estimable that consummation, the means will prove unpalatable to the Australian people. Some of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin&#39;s</inline> own friends have already broken from him with cries of &#34; Judas,&#34; and the transaction does look rather unpleasant. It is all the less pleasant because for many years there has been an astonishing reality and sincerity about Australian politics. Without producing any very distinguished political personality, Australia has been singularly fruitful of political ideas and political experiments, and the whole world would be the poorer if that fertility, which is the consequence of sincerity, were checked. </para>

        <para>That is the opinion of a newspaper which, at the present time, has more influence in politics in Great Britain than any other newspaper published there. I admit that it does not count out here, but I submit that its summing up of the position is absolutely accurate. It is clear that the Cookites have adopted the Deakinites&#39; platform so long as they are given adefinite assurance that no attempt will be made to carry it out. </para>

            <para>- The Postmaster-General will have an opportunity, a little later, to carry it out. One of the objections to the Labour party hitherto has been that we hold caucuses. I admit that the objection is not frequently urged to-day, because other parties have recently been so busy holding caucuses themselves. Objection also has been taken to the Labour party&#39;s pledge, and in this connexion I should like to say that I have with me a copy of a letter, to which I referred in speaking on the adjournment of the debate on the Address-in-Reply. I refer to the letter which was sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> F. G. Hodges by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Hume Cook, the member for Bourke, as &#34;Government Secretary.&#34; </para>

            <para>- I propose to deal with this letter in my own way, and I shall not be drawn aside unless it suits me. I should like to know who were intrusted with the selection of candidates under the conditions referred to in the letter I have read. In the Labour party, any person who has, for three months, been a financial member of a Labour league, or whose union is affiliated with the Political Labour Council, and who is an elector for a particular district, can take part in the selection of a parliamentary or municipal candidate for that district. But what are we to say of a party in which two or three, or, at most, perhaps, eight or nine, make the selection of candidates, especially in view of the fact that some of the selectors are in no way representatives of the State for which they act ? </para>

            <para>- The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> published the letter, but made a slight mistake, which I hope will be corrected. The portion of it stating that a candidate who was not selected would have to withdraw was not inserted. I trust that that error will be corrected, to show the tactics of the Ministerialists. Now the honorable member for Batman sent along a deputation asking for his selection. He will admit that the deputation came from him. This was before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> had been appointed to the High Court Bench. The deputation told the Secretary to the Cabinet that they intended to run a candidate in opposition to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins.</inline> The Secretary to the Cabinet stated that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline>  was not on the High Court Bench before the election took place the Government would support him. I wish I had been present the other day when the honorable member for Corio said that the Labour party endeavoured to undermine the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins.</inline> The position was this. The procedure of our party in the State of Victoria is, that when the branches of the Labour organization in an electorate have convened a meeting, to &#39; arrange for the selection of candidates, they call for nominations for the purpose of making a choice. Intending candidates are notified in the press. Every one knows about it. Probably, honorable members saw that I had to nominate a week or two ago for the purposes of the next election. Everything is done in the open. In the electorate of Batman the leagues at Fitzroy and Collingwood, and, I believe, also a part of Northcote, and part of East Melbourne, were represented at the meeting. The Fitzroy section was strongest about not running anybody in opposition to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins.</inline> But the Collingwood league, led by the honorable member for Batman at that time, said that they would run a candidate against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> in any case. A meeting was held, and the Central Executive advised that the matter be held over as the election would not be held for two months. </para>

              <para>- Honorable members appear to be possessed with the idea that they can correct by interjection what they deem to be. errors in the speech of an honorable member who is addressing the Chair. It is utterly out of order for that course to be adopted. The proper time to correct a misapprehension is when the honorable member has completed his speech.

During the course of his speech the honorable member said that he had carefully perused the official report of the Political Labour Conference, held at Brisbane last July, and, that being so, he was doubtless aware, although the House was not, that the resolution carried in regard to the question of patents was not correctly printed in the list of resolutions appended to the report. In his anxiety to endeavour to &#34;&#39;besmirch the Labour party, however, he availed himself of a typographical error, and did not give the Conference credit for carrying the resolution that it did.

              <para>- I do not think that such a proposal would, if adopted, do any material injury to inventors. It would certainly be advantageous from the point of view of the workers, and I should like to know whether the Ministry propose to provide in the Bill to amend the Patents Act that letters patent granted in the Commonwealth shall not hold good after a certain number of years, unless the article to which they relate is manufactured in Australia. Does the honorable member for Corio believe that a man should obtain a patent in Australia in respect of an invention, secure the local market for all time, and at the same time make no attempt to manufacture in the Commonwealth the article to which it relates ? </para>

              <para>- The resolution applies only to those who produce something useful, and I do not know that the lawyers  produce anything except trouble. Any one can see at a glance what was the object of the Conference in passing the resolution. We are told that the chief objection that honorable members opposite have to the Labour party is that the members of it have to go to outside bodies for their instruction ; that they are not allowed to vote on any question without receiving directions from outside. That is an absolutely incorrect assertion. I have been a member of this Parliament from its inception, and have never been told by any branch, league, union, or executive - or by a member of any such body - that I should vote in a certain direction. But what is the position of the present Ministry? What action was taken in framing their programme, and more particularly in regard to that portion of it relating to the new Protection? When the Ministry was in process of formation, Messrs. Joshua, Hogg, Beale, and Farleigh, according to a press statement which has never been contradicted, conferred with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence, and the Treasurer, and at the close of the Conference <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua</inline> informed representatives of the press that they had been able to fix up things very nicely, and yet these men complain that the Labour party is amenable to outside influences&#39;! If, when the Fisher Ministry was in process of formation, delegates from the Political Labour Executive of New South Wales had visited Melbourne for the purpose of directing what the Ministerial programme should be, what would honorable members opposite have said? If the Trades Hall Council of Melbourne, or of any of the other State capitals, had carried resolutions declaring that1 we should embody certain proposals in our programme, &#39;there would have been at once an outcry that we were amenable to outside influences. Nevertheless, we are told that members of the present Ministry consulted with outsiders in regard to their new Protection policy. They had a conference with employers, but the employes were not consulted. Are the workers entitled to no consideration? Would the honorable member for Maribyrnong, whom- I am sorry not to see in his place, consult the licensed victuallers as to how far an amending Licensing Act should go? Of course not. He would know that they would not be prepared to go very far. Yet this Ministry is prepared to consult the employers as to how far the new Protection legislation should go. As another instance of its readiness to consult outside bodies, let me quote from the progress report of the executive committee of the council of the Victorian Employers&#39; Federation, which met on Monday last.

            <para>The report noted the success achieved by the deputation from the Employers&#39; Federation to the Postmaster-General, protesting against the extreme telephone charges imposed by the Labour Government, and which resulted in the appointment of two expert accountants to go into the financial side of the question, while, for the present, subscribers remain under the old terms and conditions. </para>
            <para class="block">The Employers&#39; Federation virtually says that, ab its dictation, the Ministry has abandoned the rates of the Fisher Government, and gone back to the old terms. Then, in regard to the action of the banks in charge ing id each for the cashing of postal notes, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 8th inst., the Postmaster-General, after listening to the secretary to the associated banks - said the explanation given showed the subject in a  new  light altogether. He did not, in view of the representations now made, intend to take any further action, unless the Chamber of Commerce or some other traders&#39; association made further complaint. </para>
            <para class="block">Ministers have said, incorrectly, that the Labour party is amenable to outside influence, whereas, as a matter of fact, they themselves are continually running after the Employers&#39; Federation, Chambers of Commerce and kindred institutions to get! their advice. The right honorable member for East Sydney declared that some arrangement must shortly be made regarding the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. What does the Ministry intend to do about that? It is going to&#39; consult the Premiers on the I 6th August, and then bring forward its policy. It has; no financial scheme of it&#39;s own, but must&#39; go, cap in hand, to the Premiers, to learn what they think should be done. In regard to its general policy, the Government&#39; no doubt intend to follow the lead of the press. At a meeting of the Victorian Employers&#39; Federation, held on the 26th May- - I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the followingday - it was resolved to adopt the following resolution of a conference of delegates fromthe Chamber of Manufactures and the Employers&#39; Federation - </para>
            <para>That this Conference is not averse to an amendment, if such be necessary, of the Constitution to provide that all the States  shall  have Wages Boards, such Boards to be in the first instance established &#39; by the States themselves; and that failing such establishment, and&#34; only after due and sufficient notice shall have been given, the Commonwealth shall have power to appoint such Wages Boards and to execute their awards. </para>
            <para class="block">I thought that the amendment of the Constitution was a question for thewhole people, not for the employers only ! Apparently the employers must be asked whether Parliament may move in the matter. </para>

              <para>- They are doing more than that. One of the first resolutions carried in this Parliament, eight years ago, asked the Governments of the States to give us power to enact industrial legislation. That resolution was come to unanimously, but none of the States has acted on it. Are we to adopt the views of the Employers&#39; Federation, and wait until all the States take action, allowing the slowest of them to keep back the more progressive ? The boot trade is one in respect to which new Protection might well be made operative. The making of boots is an industry in all the States, though the large factories are chiefly in Victoria and New South Wales. In three of the States wages have been fixed by awards of Wages Boards or the Arbitration Court. The rate fixed in Victoria is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 8s. per week for the worker of average skill, and the Judge of the New South Wales Arbitration Court, in awarding the same rate to similar workers in his State, said - </para>

          <para>Then follow particulars of rates. Judge Heydon declared that if he had had the power to fix wages for all Australia he would have allowed a minimum wage of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 14s. per week to the bootmakers. Subsequently the matter was dealt with in Queensland by a Wages Board, which fixed the weekly wage at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2,</inline> instead of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 8s. In New South Wales the Judge, having access to confidential documents and the profit and loss accounts of the various firms, said thathe would award a weekly wage of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 14s. if Victoria would bring her weekly wage up to that point; and whenever she does the rate in New South Wales will rise automatically. </para>

              <para>- They are being deprived of at least 8s. a week compared with the bootmakers of New South Wales and Victoria. This is a strong case to show the need for uniform industrial legislation. Does it cost less to live in Queensland than in Victoria or New South Wales ? . Is it any better to live in the former State than in either of the other two States? At any rate, there is not a difference of 20 per cent. in the cost of living. The boot operators in Victoria and New South Wales have no right to be receiving 20 per cent. more than their brethren in Queensland. I have not a copy of the award of the Western Australian or South Australian Court. I know that there is not an Arbitration Court or Wages Board in Tasmania. According to to-day&#39;s newspaper, the Australian Boot Trade Federation have written to the various manufacturers in New South Wales, Victoria, and the other States, but not a single manufacturer in New South Wales or Victoria has agreed to meet the representatives of the men, in order to fix a rate for all Australia. All this is staring us in the face, yet we are asked to allow the determination of these questions to be left with the States. We are asked to allow the boot operatives of Queensland to suffer a loss of 8s. a week, and not to put out a hand to help them. This is one of the cases which demonstrate that this Parliament should have the power to intervene. To my mind, it proves that there is immediate need for an alteration of the Constitution to empower a Judge of the Federal Arbitration Court to fix rates of wages throughout Australia, instead of having different rates prevailing in the various States. </para>

              <para>- Probably the honorable member is not acquainted with the operation of a Wages Board. That beautiful Act which was passed at the instance of the honorable member for Flinders provided that seven members of a Wages Board had to be on one side before an award, could be obtained. That Act has been amended, like most of the measures which he introduced, and that provision was wiped out. It also provided for an Appeal Court, which has not been wiped out. If Tasmania fixed a wage of 36s. a week or less, would it not be an incentive to every manufacturer to go to that State? The&#39; only thing which would stop manufacturers from taking that course would be a strong trade union. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member is right. Honorable members on the other side will not consider the interests of the employed. There is another phase of this question which even the employers in New South Wales have complained of, and that is the great disproportion of boy labour employed in the trade in Victoria. According to the Act passed at the instance of the honorable member for Flinders, and amendments thereof, manufacturers are allowed to have an unlimited number of boys in their factories. That state of things could not be prevented, even by an Inter-State Commission. </para>

              <para>- How are we to get uniform conditions unless we have one body operating over the whole area? The Employers&#39; Federation are prepared to allow sufficient time to the States to act before it is willing that the Inter- State. Commission should be empowered to take any action in the matter. Let me quote a few figures here to show the employment of boys in . the boot trade in this State. According to the report of the Chief Inspector of Factories for 1903, 988 boys and 1,998 men were employed. By 1907, those boys should have grown into men, and there should have been a fair increase in the number of men employed ; but&#39; the increase was only 79, the total number of men in the trade being  2,077.  If one-half of the boys who were employed in 1903 were taught properly, and have remained in the trade, an equal number of the men employed in that year has been pushed out. According to the last report of the Chief Inspector, which was issued about this time last year,  t.,379  boys were employed, showing an increase of .391, as against an increase of only 79 in the adult males. Is it proposed to trust to the Inter-State Commission to alter that state of things? </para>

I think that one reason in favour of altering the Constitution so as to empower the Federal Arbitration Court to deal with industrial conditions was the judgment given in the Broken Hill case, as it affected the smelters at Port Pirie. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins said that it was quite enough1 for a man to work six days a week. When I learned the Ten Commandments, sir, there was one to this effect : &#34;Six days shalt thou labour,&#34; but the directors of Broken Hill companies say that that commandment is wrong, and that their men should labour seven days a week, or 365 days a year. What do honorable members on the other side propose to do about that ? Do they propose to leave it to the Inter-State Commission? </para>

              <para>- Perhaps the Commandments are not up to date enough for the people who support the Ministry, and it may be that they will propose to strike out the word &#34;six&#34; and insert the .word &#34;seven.&#34; What would have been said if a trade union had fought in the Law Courts to break one of the Commandments? A few remarks would have been made by the press on the subject, but I have not heard a word from honorable members opposite with regard to the action of the Broken Hill Proprietary directors in fighting the men upon that question. We have been asked why the Deakin party have joined the fusion, and one reason given is that their seats were being attacked by the Labour party. Some of them think that that is a good and sufficient reason for breaking away from their pledges.

            <para>One of the most exquisite of political contradictions is when an advocate of Party Government denounces the system of party pledges. Yet that is what we are treated to in the organ which holds a brief for Party Government. Apropos of the Labour pledge, we are told that that pledge &#34; undermines the foundations of Parliamentary institutions.&#34; The reason given for this absurd statement is that every man ought to enter Parliament with an open mind on every question, to parley and argue, and finally give his vote wherever he may see the greatest weight of logic. Needless to say, we hold no brief for the Labour party, or its pledge, or anything concerning it. But everybody is interested in wishing that even the most petrified Conservative should hold rational views at least about his own party. The idea that any party pledge, however rigid, can  undermine the foundations of Parliamentary institutions &#34; is founded . on absolute ignorance of what Parliament is. The party pledge, so far from being a subversion of Parliament, has been for a couple of centuries the very basis of it. Every party has a pledge - the pledge to support its own programme. And it goes, of course, quite without saying that when a candidate&#39; is elected on a given pledge, he is no more free to break that pledge in Parliament than is a man free to break his promise of marriage. </para>

          <para class="block">Those are the views of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on pledges such as those honorable members no doubt gave to their constituents. They plead that when the Labour party were supporting them they did not oppose the members of the Labour party, but take my own case. Have they not always opposed &#39;me? I did not ask for immunity from Ministerial opposition, nor did &#34; I get it. The <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> of 15th December, 1903, just before the general election, published a list of those for whom it desired that the electors should vote. I do not know whether the Deakin Government, at that time, had any party pledge, or whether their supporters had to sign an undertaking to withdraw their candidature if not selected. At the top of the &#39;list the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Electors who desire to uphold Protection and&#34; support the Preferential Trade policy of theDeakin Government, and who are opposed to&#39; Socialism, should vote thus. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">And for Yarra they advised the electors tovote for my opponent, as they had every right to do. I had supported the Barton.. and afterwards the Deakin, Government for two and a half years, but did I squeal ?&#39; I did not say a word. </para>

              <para>- According to their lineof argument I should have joined their opponents. Their paper opposed me for all it was worth. I remember preparing adiagram at the time showing the amount of space which the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> had given to my speeches during the campaign, and theamount it gave to those of my opponent. Mine looked like a little &#39;black spot on a white piece of paper, whilethe other resembled a Collingwood footballer&#39;s guernsey, black and white all the way down. That paper gave columns to my opponent, and practically nothing to me. I was returned, and&#34; for three years, with the exception of thetime the Watson Government was formed, and the few months that the Reid-McLean </para>

At any rate, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said they did, for, in a leading article on the 10th December, two days before the election, it announced, &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vale</inline> runs as a Ministerial candidate.&#34; It had been advising the people how to vote in the Yarra electorate. I did not squeal, although they opposed me, but I came back and supported that party until last November. </para>

              <para>- He was a member of the Labour party at the time when there was no pledge exacted. The honorable member for Maribyrnong, I know, attended a conference at the Trades Hall with the object of breaking down the Labour pledge. The Trades Hall people today know better what should be done. They have insisted upon pledges, and so have led to the formation of a stronger Labour party, not only in Victoria, but in every State of the Commonwealth. I have said&#39; that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> more nearly represents the Liberal party than does the Protectionist Association, and that is proved by the fact that at the last elections, if a candidate, selected by the Protectionist Association and the Ministry of the day was not also selected by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> he was defeated at the polls. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roberts</inline> was selected by the Ministerial party to. contest Balaclava.&#39; I suppose that he was a pledged man, in accordance with &#34;the conditions contained in the -letter which I read this afternoon. He lost his deposit because the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> selected some one else. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miller</inline> was the selected Ministerial candidate for Fawkner, but he was not selected by the <inline font-style="italic">Agc,</inline> and he lost his deposit. The Ministerial party ran three men for the Senate, Messrs. Atkins, Styles, and Ramsay. Two of those candidates were not on the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> ticket, and they had absolutely no chance. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atkins,</inline> by a close shave, saved his deposit, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Styles,</inline> who was on the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> ticket as well as on the Ministerial ticket, finished 15,000 vote* behind our second man, although we had no daily newspaper barracking for us. We have been told that the Labour party are vote-splitters, but I remind honorable members that we gave the present honorable member for Gippsland a clear run against the last representative of that constituency. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> won the seat. We gave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nicholls</inline> a clear run for Flinders, against the present member for that con:stituency. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nicholls</inline> -lost the seat, although the honorable member for Maribyrnong, r believe, went down to Drouin to speak for him. We did not interfere between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Palmer</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy</inline> and the Conservative candidate won. Again, honorable members know that the present member for Corio was delighted to learn that we were prepared to give him a clear run against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay.</inline> We did not split the votes in that constituency. If we had been prepared to split the votes in those constituencies neither the present member for Gippsland nor the present member for Corio would be in this Parliament. Personally, I prefer the present member for &#39;Corio to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay,</inline> because he is not so hard a man to fight. It was my intention to go into other matters at length, but I will, in the circumstances, omit some. I must, however, briefly refer to the question of a land tax, and to some other subjects. We were told by the right honorable member for East Sydney this afternoon that some system would have to be adopted to enable people to settle on the land. I have before me a copy of a letter - it has been mentioned before in this House - written by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ritchie,</inline> of Hamilton, asking for &#163;1,000 to be subscribed for the purpose of opposing the honorable member for Wannon. We learn from a subsequent letter that <inline font-style="italic">&#163;joo</inline> has been handed in. Now, if there is one district in Australia where there is a necessity for a land tax, it is the Victorian Western District. </para>

              <para>- I do not mind telling the honorable member privately, but the reason has nothing to do with the Labour movement whatever. I think that most honorable members know that. The honorable member for Hunter was not in the first Federal Parliament, but probably he is aware that the only members who have left our party have been <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ronald,</inline> formerly member for Southern Melbourne ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dawson,</inline> formerly a senator from Queensland; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barrett,</inline> formerly a Victorian senator. Are these the &#34; strong men &#34; that the honorable member for Hunter referred to? </para>

              <para>- As a rule he goes out of politics. He does if we have any say in the matter. I venture to say that if honorable members opposite could deal with the four members who formerly sat with them, but who are now in Opposition, they would do so at the next election. In that respect, they are in precisely the same position as we are. I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> congratulating the miners on deciding not to take political action last year. But since then a new ballot of the miners has been taken. The Postmaster-General will no doubt be glad to know that last year there was a majority of 600 Bendigo miners against political affiliation. This year there is a majority in Bendigo of nearly 100 in favour of that course. In Chewton and Rutherglen, as the honorable member for Indi will be interested to learn, a majority of 100 against political action has been turned into a majority of over 100 in favour. At St. Arnaud, the honorable member for Grampians will, perhaps, be pleased to learn, the miners have turned a majority of twentythree against political affiliation into a majority of twenty in favour. In Ararat, which is also in the constituency of Grampians, there was last year a majority of forty-four against political affiliation. This year there is a majority of seventeen in favour of that course. </para>

              <para>- I have not got them. But, as you know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the Torrens electorate at the last State election returned five Labour members. It returns five Labour members to-day. The newly elected member is a Labour man. Further, it has to be remembered that a by-election is sometimes harder to win than is a seat at a general election. I am also informed that at the last general election the Labour party in Torrens had the assistance of the great Liberal newspaper of Adelaide. At the recent election, that organ was against us. But our party in South Australia have been able to do what we have always done in Victoria. We have increased pur  strength, not because of any support which &#39;the newspapers have given to us, but in spite of most bitter and unscrupulous opposition. Does any person dream that there would have been a fusion in Federal politics if our party had remained at the strength which it possessed in the first Parliament, when we had only sixteen seats out of seventy-five? The reason for the fusion is the remarkable growth of the Labour party. Out of the sixteen Labour members who sat in the first Federal Parliament, fifteen are here to-day. There were fifty-nine other members in the first Parliament. Where are they now? Thirty-four of them have gone. Some have died, some have left Parliament for other reasons ; but if we are to believe the honorable member for Wentworth, when a man leaves Parliament, he does it because he wants to leave his party. The fact that stands out is that we have increased our strength from sixteen to twenty-seven. In the Senate, we have a proportionately greater strength, and we hope to be still stronger after the next election. There is a Liberal organization at work in Victoria. I have before me a clipping from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper in relation to it. As the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is a supporter of the Liberal party, it must be inferred that the gentleman who made the statement which I shall quote, at North Fitzroy, on the 28th of last month, represented the views of the Liberal party. The  chairman  of the meeting was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> O&#39;Neill, and he made the remark that - </para>

I have here the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> of last week, which contains a record of the whole of the divisions taken in this House in connexion with the piano duties. If honorable members remember, there was a proposal for a fixed duty, and an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, and the fixed dutywas abandoned, leaving a duty of 40 per cent. The honorable member for Lang moved to reduce that duty, and his motion was defeated by one vote. Was it by a vote of &#187; a present Ministerialist that the motion was defeated ? Twenty-nine of the present Ministerial party voted or paired for a reduction of the duty, and only fourteen of them voted against the motion, whereas eighteen members of the Labour party voted against the motion, and only six for it ; in other words, the Labour party were three to one against any reduction, whilst the present Ministerialists were two  to one in favour of a reduction. The honorable member for Dalley moved that the duty be 30 per cent. in the general Tariff and 25 per cent. in the preferential Tariff, and this was agreed to on the voices. When the schedule went to the Senate, what did the Labour members there do? </para>

              <para>- Let the right honorable member ask the Prime Minister. I say that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> submitted his motion in favour of old-age pensions, it was not the intention of any other honorable member to take similar action. How was the money with which to pay those pensions provided? By means of the Surplus Revenue Act. How many honorable members opposite voted in favour of that measure? Why, thirty of them voted against it. Would the aged poor of Australia to-day be receiving at least 000,000 a year more than they previously received if honorable members opposite had had their way? </para>

              <para>- I say that if the Surplus Revenue Bill had not been passed, sufficient funds would not be available with which to finance old-age pensions. The only person who is entitled to credit for his action in that connexion is the honorable member for Wide Bay, the Leader of the Labour party. To him is due the entire credit for having shown the way in which old-age pensions could be paid at least eighteen months prior to the expiration of the Braddon section. The honorable member for Flinders voted against the Surplus Revenue Bill. </para>

But instead, they voted against the measure which was necessary to provide the money with which to pay those pensions - an infinitely worse action. I can respect an open  enemy,  but I cannot respect honorable members who voted against the Surplus Revenue Bill for the purpose of killing the old-age pensions scheme, and who had not the courage to stand up and publicly avow their intention. </para>

This afternoon the right honorable member for East Sydney declared it was not his intention to deal with the past, but, as a matter of fact, practically the whole of his remarks were devoted to the past. In my opinion, the well-being of the inhabitants of Australia was better safeguarded by the late Ministry than it is by the present Government. I do not think we can look to honorable members opposite for any system of land legislation which is  likely  to promote settlement. </para>

              <para>- Yes, let us leave it to the States, with their Upper Houses. Some honorable members affect to believe that the present Ministry will give them new Protection. As a matter of fact, every opponent of the Factories Act is to be found upon the other side of the Chamber. Why does the Employers&#39; Federation subscribe to the principle of Wages Boards? Simply because it believes that those Boards represent the lesser of two evils. I believe that the only way in which we can obtain an effective system of new Protection is to be obtained by an amendment of the Constitution. The newspapers of this city are constantly exhorting us to get on with the business of the country. But when the Prime Minister proposed a three-weeks&#39; adjournment of the House, and the Opposition suggested that an adjournment for two weeks would be ample, the press supported the plea of the Government that a fortnight would not be too long to enable them to prepare their measures. Yet, if any member of the Labour party now dares to express his opinions, he is accused of blocking business. We have been told that this motion will be defeated by a certain number of votes.

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hodges</inline> applied to be Selected as the Government candidate for Mernda. In reply to his application, I gave him a dose of the political medicine which the Labour party administers to its candidates, by asking him if he were willing to stand down if not selected. He did not reply to my letter, but, apparently, as the result of it, withdrew his candidature for Mernda, and a little later came out in his true colours as the Labour candidate for Kooyong. We have it on the authority of the honorable member for Yarra that no person can become a Labour candidate unless he has been twelve months a member of some organization affiliated with the Political Labour Council. </para>

              <para>- That is a part of the matter to which the honorable member referred. However, my point is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hodges,</inline> when seeking to be selected as a Government candidate, must have been a member of the Labour party, as shown by the fact that he subsequently became the Labour candidate for Kooyong, a neighbouring constituency, and that he was endeavouring under false pretences to obtain the nomination of the Government for the constituency of Mernda. In such circumstances, it is my duty to expose the sort of Tammany tactics which these gentlemen apparently adopt in order to secure, election to this Chamber as Liberals, only to desert the Liberal party at a later stage, and to join forces with the Labour party, to which they always belonged. It was done in another case. </para>

          <para class="block">The honorable member has produced tonight a Labour platform card with my name written across it, and he has sought to tie me down to that as a pledge signed by me. As a member of the Central Executive of 1 he Political Labour League, the honorable member knows full well that my selection as a candidate of the Labour party would not be indorsed unless I signed its pledge, and the municipal pledge I did not at any time sign. I come now to misrepresentation No. 3. The honorable member produced to-night a letter which was written in 1902, but which was misdated j 903. It was written at a time when I was in no way connected with the Labour party, but the honorable member has repeated to-night a speech which he rehearsed a few weeks ago at a meeting held in the Collingwood Town Hall - a speech made, not in the interests of the country, but with the object of downing me. And this is the attitude which the honorable member adopts towards one who was at one time the  chairman  of his election committee, and was selected to move a resolution in favour of his candidature at all his large meetings. I was the  chairman  of the honorable member&#39;s election committee when I was one of the representatives of a ward in the Collingwood City Council. That council, by the way, is the most democratic in .Victoria, and yet there is not a pledged Labour man in it. The Labour party have an opportunity at the forthcoming municipal election to endeavour to secure the return of five candidates, but they have decided only to challenge my reelection, and to allow all the other retiring councillors a walk-over. In connexion with that municipal election, the honorable member for Yarra will have an opportunity to air his eloquence on the public platform. </para>

It is true that the honorable member for Hume once suggested that I should approach the AttorneyGeneral in the Labour Administration - the honorable member for West Sydney - and the Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> with a view of securing the withdrawal of the Labour candidate selected to oppose me. I told the honorable member, however, that I would not do anything of the kind, and I did not. The honorable member for Hindmarsh inferred that I endeavoured to secure immunity from opposition on the part of a party that stoned me at the last election ; that broke up nearly every meeting that I held, that howled down the Prime Minister, who spoke at one of mv meetings, and covered up, after midnight, every notice that I had had posted. Is it reasonable for the honorable member for Hindmarsh to accuse me of trying to re-join a party that played such tricks on me? At the last general election, I was opposed by a Labour candidate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Solly,</inline> who resigned from the State Parliament in order to fight me. The result of the election was that I secured 7,098 votes as against 6,617, polled by the Labour candidate, 330 secured by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Painter,</inline> who stood on the same platform as I did, and 151 polled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vernon.</inline> In other words, I defeated the selected Labour candidate by 481 votes. At a Labour Conference held on the 17th March last, for the purpose of selecting a candidate to run in opposition to me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd,</inline> a member of the Collingwood branch of the Labour League, suggested that I should not be opposed, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miller,</inline> ex-President of the Trades Hall Council, suggested to the Conference that steps should be taken to expel him from the Labour movement for having dared to make such a proposition. The honorable member for Yarra saw fit to accuse those on this side of the chamber of having broken their pledges. I have not broken one of mine, though I should have had to do so had I supported the Fisher Government. I was returned after the strongest fight against a Labour candidate which any Victorian representative had to make. The Ministry of the day determined, on the 27th November, 1906, to support me, but the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> selected me only on 12th December, the day of the election.

            <para>Here, in Broken Hill, efforts are likely to be made to introduce the fiscal herring into Laborism. So far as individual expressions of opinion are concerned, and as long as they are confined to mere opinions, we have no right to object. If a  Laborist  believes conscientiously in Protection, the Labour platform in no way prohibits him from doing so. Nor does it stop him from giving utterance to his ideas as often as he pleases or wherever he pleases. If, again, a*  Laborist  has foreign trade beliefs there is no reason why he should be afraid to enunciate those beliefs. The Labour platform does not say that he should &#62;&#62;ot be a foreign trader. </para>

That shows that protection has increased employment in New South Wales as well as in other States. The late Prime Minister, the honorable member for Wide Bay, recently challenged the honorable member for Maribyrnong to produce a record of any vote which &#39;he had given for free trade. I produce the record to show that the honorable member for Wide Bay voted for Free Trade, when he and other Labour members, and the House generally, knew that a certain class of machinery was being made in Australia. I refer to rock drills. Those who voted for Free Trade on that item included the honorable members for Calare, Kalgoorlie, Coolgardie, Maranoa, </para>

Those who paired in favour of Free Trade included the honorable member for Wide Bay, the honorable member for Perth, and the honorable member for West Sydney, also Labour members. Every one of them on that occasion voted or paired for Free Trade, with the result) that a number of men have been thrown out of employment. That was one case. </para>

              <para>- The question was &#34; That the item be free,&#34; and it was carried on the casting vote of the  Chairman  of Committees, the honorable member for Kennedy, who is also a Labour member. Those honorable members, who claimed to be in favour of new Protection, shorter hours, and higher wages, were prepared to tell the miners of Bendigo, Broken Hill, and Western Australia that their sons could go down into the deep mines and work for their living; that they would allow the importers to flood the markets, and throw the young men of those places out of employment, and that, instead of being engineers the miners&#39; sons could be miners for all they cared. On the night that division was taken, I stated that not a single miner had asked for the duty to be taken- off rock drills, but the importers were represented here, and won the day. Honorable members who were sent here to represent the- workers thought of the importers first and voted Free Trade on that item. I come now to the question of wire netting. I had the honour and privilege of receiving a letter signed by  200  workmen of Lysaght&#39;s wire netting works in Sydney, thanking me for the efforts I&#39; had made on their behalf. When in Sydney, I was informed by -the manager of that firm that not a single Labour member had ever visited the factory or made inquiries. The duty was taken off by misrepresentations, and not one of the Labour members went to the factory or knew anything about the works or the wages that were being paid there. I went to the factory to obtain information to refute the statement, made by the honorable member for Calare and others, that the men in Lysaght&#39;s wire netting works were not being paid a sufficient wage. I now produce the firm&#39;s wage list, which is open to the inspection of any honorable member. It shows that at the time some of the men were earning  &#163;3 10s.,  and others  &#163;3  per week. But what can we expect when the honorable member for </para>

That honorable member expressed the opinion that the men who were toiling outside should be thrown out of work by this Parliament granting a bonus to wire netting made in Pentridge. The honorable member knew at the time that these men were going to be thrown out of employment, but he said that the prisoners at Pentridge should get a bonus for making wire netting.

          <para>It was not the State of Victoria, but the representative of the workers, from the democratic constituency* of Yarra, that sought here to champio&#39;n prison-made goods in competition with the products of free labour. Yet the honorable gentleman will shortly be telling the workers in my district to vote against me because I was against the workers. I say that, if I stood here as the champion of prison-made goods, I should expect at the next election to reap my reward, and I should get . it outside, and not inside, of this Chamber. I want to say that 120 men were thrown out of employment at Lysaght&#39;s wire netting works, as a result of the remission of the duty. When the honorable member for Hume introduced the Tariff, the duty he got carried was the means of reducing the price of wire netting from .&#163;36 to ,&#163;31. To-day there is no Protection in that industry, and I am given to understand that, as a consequence, the farmers have to pay more for their wire netting than they otherwise would have to pay. What did the Fisher Administration propose to dc with respect to the question, of new Protection, on which the honorable member for Yarra spoke so strongly?&#34; New Protection could have waited for the next three years, so far as they were concerned. Their only* desire was to get to the country. Yet they told the workers, &#34;You can only get the benefits of the new Protection from us.&#34; I venture to say, without the least fear of successful&#39; contradiction, that the last Administration were anxious to secure a dissolution and go to the country. They knew that, if they did secure it, there could be no new Protection carried, because there could, in that event, have been no immediate amendment of the Constitution. If honorable members require any proof of that, they have only to read the speech of the late Prime Minister1 in November last. When making his Ministerial statement, he told the House that there was no hurry about the new Protection, because a Bill had to be framed and passed six months before a general election. Amongst other things, he said that honorable members were not desirous of going to the country, and as he had no wish to irritate them it was net his intention to bring on such a measure at that time. The workers are told that honorable  members on this side are against the new Protection and Factories legislation. We can thank the late proprietor of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. David</inline> Syme, and the present Prime Minister, for Protection in Australia. By whom have proposals in support of the new Protection been put forward in this Chamber ? Has it been by members of the Labour party? No. The first to submit such a proposal was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, when member for the constituency which I now have the honour to represent; the next was1 the honorable member for Maribyrnong - neither of these gentlemen was a Labour member - and the third was myself. All were members of the Liberal party. I Had the honour of submitting a motion in this Chamber, soon after my return, that, in order that the workers should receive equal Protection with the factory owners, this Parliament should ask the various States to give it power to deal with the question of new Protection. I venture to say that, so long as the present Prime Minister is at the head of the Commonwealth Government the workers will have to expect the same benefits at his hands as they have received in the past. No one can gainsay the fact that there is no man in this House, or outside of it, who has worked harder in the interests of the workers, and none who has championed the cause of Factories legislation, in season and out of season, more effectively than the present Prime &#34;Minister, the honorable member for Ballarat. We are asked to believe that the honorable members for West Sydney, Barrier, and Kalgoorlie are in favour of the new Protection. In the States of New South Wales and Victoria there are  7,000  women employed in the shirt-making industry. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> propose to read some evidence which I have taken from a report presented to the House of Commons last year in connexion with this industry. I shall quote briefly the evidence given by a couple of employed in that industry in the Old Country, in order to compare the conditions there with those which prevail in the same industry in Australia. This is the evidence given by one woman - </para>

The honorable member for Yarra took credit to his party on account of old-age pensions.

              <para>- What did the Labour party do in connexion with invalid pensions? Did they propose to pay them ? Did they make any reference to the subject? While the honorable member for Kalgoorlie was sitting in the Ministerial corner last session, he chided the late Administration with having proposed invalid pensions merely as a placard. He represented that it was simply a matter of make-believe. The Labour party were in power six months and could at any time, by proclamation, have commenced to pay invalid pensions. But they made no attempt to do so. No provision was made for paying them. The present &#39;Leader of the Opposition, in his Gympie speech, simply made a passing reference to the subject. He said in effect, &#34; I regret to say we are not able to pay invalid pensions yet.&#34; Not one single word was contained in the GovernorGeneral&#39;s speech respecting invalid pensions. If the Labour party were in earnest on the subject, why did they not make provision fortheold men and women who are invalids, whoshouldhave been receiving these pensions to-day? It surprises me to find  that though  the Labour party was in power for six months they did notthink that this matter wasof sufficient importance to receiverecognition. At thesame time theyhad&#163;7 50,000in the Treasury upon which they could operate at once. Surely the first dutyof the Labour Ministry was to have started the payment of these pensions : by Proclamation. </para>

              <para>- I havenot , thehonourto occupy a seat on the Ministerial bench at thepresent moment, and therefore I donot know. But whenhonorable members opposite talk about old-age pensions I am entitled to ask why the late Prime Minister did not take the responsibility of saying at Gympie, &#34; Ibelieve that invalids should receive pensions, and am prepared to commence the payment of them on the 1st July.&#39;&#39; But no! He simply regretted that his Government couldnotdoit. What was the trouble? Was there no money available? Was the ex-Prime Minister afraid of the difficulty of financing old-age and invalid pensions? Yet thehonorable member forYarra takes credit tohisparty inconnexionwith this matter. As a matter offact hisparty simplybrushed it aside. Instead, the late Cabinet said, &#34;We are going tobuild a bush capital.&#34; That was their Firstplank. They wanted to secure the supportof theFree Tradepress in NewSouth Wales. On that question the late Government weresolid. The Federal Capital was to be a Ministerial project. </para>

Everyone of those ex-Ministers who voted against the proposalpreviously were preparedto furtherthe Yass-Canberra project. Why?

              <para>- That is what wassaid by, the newspaper which the honorable member forHumedescribesas the best in Australia; andthe same publication expressed the opinion that the members of the Labour Administration backslided more quickly on theirprinciplesthan even <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Bent, and that it was nogreat loss to the country when they left  office.  I desire now tosay straight out that I am dead against immigration. I  amin  favour, in the first place, offindingwork for our ownpeople, and, secondly, of spending themoneynow devoted to immigration in saving a large number of lives which are now lost to the community. During thelast seven yeans  67,000  children in Australiahave died under the age of twelve months, and, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Dunbar</inline> Hooper, who was appointed by aprevious Administration as a representative of the Commonwealth at a Conference in Brussels, some  3,000  of these lives could be saved every year. It as our duty,instead of spending&#163;20,000 in bringing immigrants here under misrepresentation, to devote the money to saving thoselives, and also in combating the scourgeofconsumption,which, in thesame period, has been responsible for24,000 deaths. It is estimated that the presence of this diseasecosts theCommonwealth something like&#163; 100,000 per annum ; and I ampleased to say that the ex-Prime Ministerhas, on more than one occasion, referred to the necessity for some steps being taken in this connexion. I shall on all occasions freely vote money if the opportunity offers, for theprevention of these great annual losses.I now desire to draw attention to the vote which, on 10th November last, displaced theDeakinAdministr ation. No Governmentwas ever,I think, displaced ina briefer speech, for the words of thehonorable member for WideBay on thatoccasion numbered only ninety-two. No one knows why the DeakinGovernment were removed -nota wordon the point hasbeen said by the  ex-Prime  Minister orany of his followers. </para>

The Labour party said to the Deakin Government : &#39; &#39; Here are your Estimates; do you propose to increase the salaries of all the higher officials? If you do not take your Estimates back. you shall not remain on the Treasury benches.&#34; But did the Fisher Government re-model the Estimates? As a matter of fact, not a single figure &#39;or line was altered - not a single salary was reduced. All the officials in the higher ranks were given increases, while the men in the lower ranks received no recognition. And how did the Fisher Government carry on the business of the country? As soon as they got into recess they went from one end of Australia to the other denouncing the men who supported them. Their first act was to conciliate political leagues in the various constituencies ; and we had the announcement that, if the Government were turned out of office, honorable members would be sent to their masters - the electors - at the earliest possible moment. </para>

              <para>- That was not the fault of the Government, and, in my opinion, only the members of the Ministry desired to appeal to the country, the rank and file of the Labour party having no desire in that .direction. Then I am accused of having broken my pledges, and been called upon to resign. The honorable member for Yarra produces a card, and says to me, &#34;Resign now.&#34; . They want my seat. But let me tell the honorable member foi Yarra that whether I resign my position or not, the Labour party cannot secure my seat. They had the chance of a lifetime at the last elections, and they &#34; missed the bus.&#34; I was elected to this Parliament upon a definite pledge, and a definite programme, to represent the great mass of workers in my constituency. When I shrink from doing my duty, when I cease to represent the men and women who sent me here, I shall cease to enjoy their confidence. But up to the present time I am quite willing to place my record in this House against that of &#34; any of the twenty-six pledged members of the Labour party. I am prepared to rely upon my record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and I venture to say that there is not. one man in the Labour party who has done more for the workers than I have. I do not stand here as the representative of the &#34;foreign trader or of sweated labour or of prison-made goods. I am here to advocate equal opportunities for every man and woman in the community. I believe that the policy which the Prime Minister has placed before us will receive the indorsement of the people of Australia. When honorable members opposite are prepared to occupy eight or nine hours in delivering speeches for the purpose of blocking progressive legislation, I would ask them whether their action is calculated to provide employment for the workless amongst us. Not a bit of it. Their only concern is to raise a bogy by declaring, &#34; Look what the supporters of the present Ministry have done to us. They have turned us out of office.&#34; Why do they not accept their defeat like men ? Why did they go to the Collingwood Town Hall, and exclaim, &#34; Look at your representative who has broken his pledges. We did not expect to gain office?&#34; But they got there, and it took a team of bullocks to drag them from the Treasury bench. </para>

              <para>- It will take fifty men like the honorable member to terminate my political career. What did the Labour partydo in Collingwood at the last election? They had a supper prepared, and engaged a brass band to play &#34; See the conquering hero comes,&#34; for &#34; Fighting Bob.&#34; But when the poll was announced, &#34; Fighting Bob &#34; was found to be 500 votes behind me. That gentleman then said : &#34; Well, if I cannot beat you at the polls I am prepared to fight you. Will you take your coat off?&#34; When he could not defeat me at the polls he challenged me to fight. </para>

              <para>- I kept out of his way. Later on, what did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Solly</inline> say upon the public platform? He said: &#34;This is a mere bagatelle so far as I am concerned. It is a matter of indifference to me that I have been defeated.&#34; But he added : &#34; I am in a position to keep my wife, and that is more than the successful candidate can do.&#34; When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Solly</inline> could not get even in any other way he uttered that cowardly insinuation. Those honorable members who talk so much about representing labour, merely represent them- selves. I have no apology to offer for my votes, I ami proud of them. &#39; I said on 4th December last that I was opposed to fiscal atheists, and the Labour party Free Traders, and I have since said that I am opposed to any party that is not prepared to find work for pur workless. I was opposed to the representatives in the late Administration who were foreign traders, and who had not the courage to proclaim the Invalid sections of the Old-age. Pensions Act at the earliest opportunity. I am opposed to those honorable members who do not think that the invalids of Australia should receive some recognition. When the members of the Labour party were prepared to sink their principles for the sake of gaining office, I, as a true Democrat, and representing the workers, ceased to support them any longer. </para>

            <para>. - I do not intend to. allow such an epoch in the history of this Parliament as the fusing of two old parties to pass without offering a comment or two. I shall, however, &#39; endeavour to avoid the Billingsgate in which some honorable members have indulged, although I admit that each  speaker  has been provoked to say things of a recriminatory nature - a circumstance that is quite understandable. With regard to the fusion of political parties which has taken place in this Parliament, I have nothing to say against those honorable members who thought it was necessary for them to sink their party pledges for the good of the country. Doubtless that was the view entertained by most of them; if not, their action is open to other imputations. My contention is that when a party considers it necessary, as a party, to sink its principles - when it thinks it desirable to coalesce with another party - it should at least seek the sanction of the people for what it proposes to do. If its members do not seek that sanction, they are open to the imputation of being self-seekers, or of having taken action merely to serve their own purpose. I make no such imputation against the- Government and their supporters, but I say that they are open to such a charge. My conception of Democracy is that when a representative of the people thinks fit to sink his principles it is only fair to Democracy that he should go before the people, and ask their sanction for what he has done. In this connexion the Government and their supporters should think well of the writer who has said that consistency is the doctrine of-  fools. They should inscribe that dictum on their banners, and it ought certainly to give - their some consolation. I have heard it whis pered that honorable members opposite do not care to go to the country at the present juncture, because they consider that the people are not in a fit frame of mind to receive an appeal from them. Possibly that view is entertained by some honorable members opposite. If it is, they evidently assume that something has occurred to stimulate action on the part of the people in a direction which would prove disadvantageous to the fusion. If that be so, they are not ignoring the fickleness of public opinion - assuming that it exists - they are simply putting off the evil day, hoping, no doubt, that when, in the ordinary course of events, they have to go to the country public opinion regarding the fusion will have changed. We have been charged with only pretending to desire to go to the people. &#39; Personally, I should be delighted to do so, because, if the policy on which I was elected is not to be carried into effect by this Parliament, I have no desire to be a member of it. Our allegiance to the late Deakin Government has been described as &#34; similar to that of the Liberal party to the present Ministry. There is, however,  a  very material difference between a fusion and an alliance, such as ours was. As I understand the fusion, it means the sinking of the .individual opinions of both parties and a. blending of them into the. form of a compromise, such as we are supposed to have in the manifesto issued by the Ministry. That was not the attitude that we adopted in regard to the Deakin Administration. We simply allied ourselves with them, on the distinct understanding that, whilst their course of action met with our approval they should have our support, and that as soon as it ceased to do so, our support would be withdrawn. No such arrangement has been made by honorable members opposite. They were divided, not only on the fiscal question, but on matters of even greater importance. It has been said to-night by several honorable members that the division of opinion existing among the two parties to the Coalition with regard to the fiscal question is no more to be condemned than is ours. There is, however, a distinct difference .between the position of the Labour party and that of honorable members opposite. The honorable member for East Sydney sought to show that there was  very little difference between the treatment of the fiscal question by the present fusion and the attitude of the Labour party in regard to it. As a matter of <inline font-style="italic">fact,</inline> however, the members ofour party have not agreed to, sink the fiscal issue; we have simply agreed that the members of the party shall be free <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> vote as they please in regard to it. The honorable member for Swan asked tonight why we did not. include the fiscal question in our platform. We have not done so for the obvious reason, that we are not agreed upon it. We include in our platform only those planks on which we are in absolute agreement. We have agreed to differ on the fiscal question, but the fusion have agreed to sink it, and, in. so, far as they have undertaken to do so, they have proved unfaithful to the trust reposed in them by the people. Although, most honorable members opposite may consider that they were justified, in the best interests of Australia in sinking their principles, I repeat that, having determined to do so, they should have gone to, the public, their masters, and have sought their indorsement. To refrain from doing so at the present juncture, lest public opinion should be against them, is worse thancowardly. They fear the fickleness of public opinion, yet do not hestitate to endeavour to take advantage of it, believing that public opinion in regard to their action will have changed, and that they will come off better at the polls later on. Some of those participating in the fusion have declared that it was brought about because our party declined to refrain from opposing the Deakin party at the next general election. It has been said again, and again bymembers of our partyand it cannot be repeated too,often-that we have no power to control outside organizationsin the selection of candidates for Parliament. We have no more power over theminthat respect than they have over us. Our agreement with them is in black and white,and is drawn up before we enter this House. Before a Labour candidate goes before the public he has indorsed his party&#39;s policy,and, knows exactly where he is. There is no occasion, to call in any one to advise us. Our partyis, not conducted on. such loose lines. The people are in a much better position when they are represented by a party the members of which ate. bound to a definite platform, which is submittedin blackand white to the electors, than they are when they arerepresented by men who are not so pledged. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Having pledged ourselves to a definite platform, we are free from our so-called masters. When that platform is altered we participate in the work of amending it, and if we do not indorse the alteration we have no right to submit ourselves as candidates supporting the policy of the Labour party. It will thus be. clearly seen that we are not controlled by outside influences, and that there is not the slightest necessity for such control.It is purely optional for honorable members of the Labour party to consider or to refuse to consider, any outside Influence that may be brought to bear upon them. I do not know of any outside influence being exercised upon us, and I should decline to be so influenced. It would be a distinct interference with the liberty of the subject if any combination in Parliament, dictated to any combination outside as to the candidates to be run at an election. Any half-dozen citizens may run a candidate. If they make a foolish, choice, the general public will put them right. If the honorable member for Ballarat has not in the view of the public merited blame, he will be kept in public life, even though a section may run a candidate against him. It is a very weak argument in support of the fusion to say that the Labour party intends to oppose the. Liberal party at the elections. If the Liberals are the strong, men they are supposed to be, they need not fear opposition. In any case, they should take the, stand that they advocate a certain policy, and will, if keptin Parliament, carry it out, taking their chances of opposition at the elections.If the. public do not want my policy, I do not want to represent them in Parliament. That is. my attitude. No fusion would have any attraction forme under a threat of opposition. As to the organization of the Labour- party, I claim that it is &#34; broad based upon the people&#39;s will.&#34; It is more broadly based than that of any other party in politics. The rank and file of the community, those whom the conditions of society affect more vitally than any other class, the men without inheritance, have drafted our policy in their own interests, and therefore in the interests of the nation. The programme of the Labour party is the programme of those who are the backbone of the nation. Others may join with us, but it is the people at large whom we represent. Our organization properly claims the attention and merits the support bestowed on it. The automatic functioning  of Democracy is its great feature. It corrects its own errors, and provides the only effective way of securing society against class domination of any sort. No matter what section may draft a policy, that policy cannot stand without the indorsement of the whole community. For honorable members opposite to talk about sectional influence and class domination is ridiculous. We cannot dominate without the sanction of the public. Parliament drafts policies, but the public must indorse them. The members of the Labour party are the servants of the public, and subject to the will of the people to the same extent as other members. I have a word or two to say upon the programme which the Government has placed before the House. New Protection is not to receive the liberal treatment at the hands of Ministers which it would have received from the Fisher Government. For one thing, it is not proposed to consider the consumer. There is no mention of him. All that is proposed is to take cognizance of the working community. But as the workers are consumers too, it is essential, in any scheme of new Protection, to protect the consumer as well as to protect the worker, and the employer. No definite measures are promised. In fact, the Government seems disposed to transfer its obligations arid trust to a Board which will be beyond the control of Parliament. I am prepared to admit that it would be advisable to place those controlling a nationalized industry outside the pale of immediate politics. But when, not the running of a special industry but the supervising of all industries, in other words the seeing that all play fair, is the matter in hand, the Government cannot afford to transfer its obligations. The Parliament directly representing the people should be the supreme factor in seeing that the affairs of the commercial and industrial world are conducted as they should be. We cannot afford to intrust the interests of the community to a Board vested with supreme powers. I am a keen believer in the new Protection. Were I otherwise, I should be unworthy of my position. I agree with an old writer who calls&#39; that nation the wealthiest which nourishes the greatest number of human beings. No doubt honorable members opposite are as desirous as I am of the welfare of the community, but we differ as to the way in which it can best be attained. The fact that some of our politicians have a long past has given rise to many of the speeches which we Have heard during the debate. It has made me pleased that my political past is short, but I hope that when it comes to be as long as theirs, it Will not afford food for such discussion and recrimination; Political parties in this House differ largely <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> to methods. The Labour party is of opinion that in the interests of the individual, andso that the greatest number of human beings may be benefited and properly nourished, monopolies should be nationalized. The right honorable member for East Sydney, on the other handy thinks that we should devote all our energy to encouraging and stimulating individualism. We agree that until the individualism becomes oppressive, it is well to let it alone. Butonce it does become oppressive, we hold that we must nationalize. Do I understand that the Government are now agreeable to an adjournment ofthe debate? </para>
