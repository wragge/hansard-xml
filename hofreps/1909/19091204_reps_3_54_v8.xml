                        <para>In their innermost thoughts the proprietors cannot regard it as a childish scheme, for last week one of the leading members of their association approached our manager, under manager, and  weighman,  and told them that if they worked the colliery for the miners they would be blackballed by members of the vend throughout the Newcastle and Maitland districts. But if they resigned, the vend would stick to them, and the result was that the manager resigned after he had delayed the starting of the pit as long as he could. And now the under manager and  weighman  have also resigned. </para>

Can he say what is the difference between such an action, and that of a. general, at the head of an invading army, commandeering all provisions for his commissariat? </para>

With his usual ability, he has put rather a poser to me. <inline font-style="italic">T</inline> prefer not to answer the question at present, as it involves matters with which  I  cannot now deal ; and also because there may be involved a question of State, rather than of Federal, sphere. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether his attention has been called to a paragraph published in the South Australian <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> of  19th  November last,' giving portion of the narrative; of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> G. Sawyer, one of the passengers on the missing steamer <inline font-style="italic">Waratah,</inline> who left her at Durban. That narrative contains some startling statements, and I ask the Prime Minister whether, in the course of the inquiries which I understand he has initiated, he will cause this letter to be brought under the notice of the South African authorities with a view of obtaining evidence from the gentleman in question, as well as from other passengers who may have left the steamer with him? </para>

                        <para>- It has been urged for some time -not only in this House, but throughout the Commonwealth, that it is a menace to Australia to have unoccupied that vast tract of country known as the Northern Territory, which comprises one-sixth of the whole of the continent. During the last week we have had before us a measure committing the Commonwealth to a proposal to float a loan of£3,500,000. for the purposes of naval defence, and the argument used to show the urgency of that Bill was that at any moment the enemy might be at our door. I should not have submitted this motion but for something that has occurred in another place. Knowing the feeling of the people of South Australia, I am confident that the agreement drafted by the late Premier of South Australia and the present Prime Minister, if altered as proposed by another place, will be unacceptable to South Australia. It will mean that our northern doorway will be left open, and that the vacant Territory will continue to be a menace to Australia. I take it that the agreement, signed by the Prime Minister and the late Premier of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price,</inline> was as solemn, sacred, and binding as the financial agreement recently entered into with the States ; and it is with reluctance that I have to refer to the votes given by Ministers and Ministerial supporters. It is not necessary for me to refer to the stringent measures resorted to by the Government in order to secure the passing of the Bill relating to the financial agreement, as contrasted with the treatment accorded to the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill. Notwithstanding all that has been said about the menace which is presented by this huge empty space in the north, and of the great obligation that rests on the Commonwealth, only three Ministers voted in favour of the Bill; and I should be remiss in my duty, as a representative of South Australia, if I allowed this opportunity to pass without impressing on the House the gravity of the position. </para>

                            <para>- Are we to believe that all the talk about the heroism of South Australia in guarding the Northern Territory is so much lip service? What would have been the position had South. Australia chosen to part with this Territory to a chartered company ? The great bulk of some of the most valuable lands would have been bartered away and alienated. Through the Agent-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Playford,</inline> the South Australian Government received an offer of £10,000,000 from a syndicate for certain concessions, but that offer was refused, because it was accompanied with a condition that the syndicate should be permitted to employ any class of labour they might require. The South Australian Government regarded such a condition as a serious menace to the policy of a White Australia ; and so they continued to carry the burden. For nine years, practically from the first Commonwealth Parliament, no lands have been parted with except on a simple annual permit, the public utterances of responsible men being taken as an earnest of the intention of the Central Government to assume the control of the Territory. Had the South Australian Government been prepared to give a better tenure, they could have parted with thousands of miles of country on remunerative terms ; but this, as I have said, they have always refused to do. Is it conceivable that behind the Ministry in the Senate there are only two men, beyond the representatives of South Australia, who believe that an obligation rests on the Commonwealth? No one has done more than the Minister of External Affairs to further the passage of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, and I believe that the Prime Minister is in. earnest on the question ; but what can we say of the other Ministers? </para>

                            <para>- I regret very much that I am not able to refer to these matters in the strong language that the circumstances demand. Has South Australia been fooled ? If there was such a division of opinion amongst the followers of the Government, the honest course would have been to at once acquaint the South Australian Government with the fact. South. Australia has done everything possible to carry out the White Australia policy ; and they have been led to believe that, not only on one side, but on all sides of both the Commonwealth Houses of Parliament, there was an earnest desire to take over the Territory under the agreement. I candidly confess that  the development of one-sixth, of the whole of the Continent is too great a problem for South Australia. If the State has to continue to face the position alone, I see no alternative except for its Government to take the responsibility of allowing a syndicate to undertake the work of development. Does the Commonwealth Government desire to see this Territory parted with on the land-grant system? Is it desired that those developing the Territory shall be untrammelled by any labour conditions ? It is my decided opinion, and one that I should hold whether or not I was a representative of South Australia, that, whether it be done to-day, tomorrow, or twenty years hence, the Commonwealth must eventually take over this Territory; and the question is whether it would not be better to take it over at once, when there are  344,000,000  acres of Crown lands. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard that argument before. We hear great tribute paid to South Australia for what it has done for the Northern Territory, but, when it comes to a matter of cash, there is a different tune. One would think that the compensation it is proposed to give to South Australia was for nothing </para>

                            <para>- I regret to say that it has been made a question of bargain and1 sale, although I was under the impression that we were dealing with a great national issue. We have pledged the Commonwealth to a loan of  ^3,500,000,  on the plea that the enemy is almost at our door. Does that same plea not apply with equal force to the taking over of the Northern Territory? Is it conceivable that, in the opinion of the Commonwealth Parliament, it is the duty of one State to keep the Northern Territory free from the invader? One branch of the Parliament has admitted the obligations of the Commonwealth, but the other branch has dealt with the matter in a huckstering, bargaining spirit, in which there is no trace of national sentiment. The measure has not yet reached its final stage; and I sincerely hope that still another effort will be made before we go into recess to bring the Northern Territory under the control of the Commonwealth. I assure the House that I have not moved this motion with any intention of wasting time. I have done so because I realize keenly the seriousness of the position, and I again urge the House to do everything in its power to bring about some definite result before the session closes, in order that we may complete one of the grandest national undertakings in which the Commonwealth has vet been engaged. </para>

                        <para>. - The question which has been raised, so far as the Standing Orders permit, by the honorable member "for Grey is of so momentous a character that, despite the hour of the session and the pressure of business, one cannot object to the honorable member's action in taking this opportunity to express his feelings. I can' only add that if there be a member in this Chamber more disappointed with the result than 1 am myself,' he must be extremely disappointed indeed. It is not only a disappointment, but a surprise, for within an hour or two of the division referred to, I was confidently assured, by those who ought to know, that there was a majority - very small, but still a majority - in favour of the agreement. I do not wish to allude to members' relationships to this measure, except to say that the agreement was framed with the approbation of a previous Government, and, in the circumstances of the formation of this Government, was not included in the platform upon which the Cabinet was based. But honorable members will have seen from what- has occurred in this House that there has been a great disposition on the part of new members of the Government to meet the views of their present colleagues, and uphold the agreement. There are one or two exceptions in the party, but they happened to be of members who had committed themselves previously by speech, by writing, and by argument in the strongest manner against the proposal, before they were associated with this Government or this party. I would have been asking more than could be fairly expected from them that they should absolutely reverse their attitude. But I know of cases in which the antagonism had not been so expressed, but in which, out of a desire to recognise the national sentiment, personal views in the matter wer e put aside both in this House and in the other. I 'am free to admit that I used whatever personal influence I possess in both Chambers in support of an agreement which I believe to be in the best interests of Australia. I  altogether decline to accept the present  verdict  as in any respect final. I do not regard the agreement as disposed of. I do not regard it as rejected. I am satisfied that some, at least, of those who are at present opposed to it have voted against it on what might be termed minor grounds. Certain conditions in the agreement do not meet with their approbation, and I shall feel it my duty to endeavour to ascertain more clearly --what their views regarding those conditions are. We know that they are limited to the question of  railways, and shall, therefore, be able to discover in what particular respect they think the agreement ought to be amended. Last night, after recovering from the first shock of surprise and disappointment, I at once communicated with my colleague in charge of the measure in the other Chamber, in order that no step might be taken that would present any obstacle to this course. When we have ascertained a little more definitely the precise objections to the conditions, we may see whether it be not possible to still take the measure a step further in that Chamber, in such a way as to meet the approval of this Chamber. Even if we cannot obtain a complete settlement this session, we may reach a position from which we can resume negotiations with the Government of South Australia to ascertain how far they would be willing either to meet the objections or dispose of them bv counter suggestions. I" agree with every word uttered by the honorable member for Grey as to the importance to Australia as a whole of the acquisition of this " disputed Territory." Nothing that has been done ought to be allowed to operate as a bar, or, unless absolutely unavoidable, even as a hindrance, to that settlement. I do not, even at this time of the session, abandon all hope of a more modified proposal, instead of a rejection, elsewhere. But in any and every event I propose to proceed with the matter without further delay, and, whatever may be the verdict there, to endeavour to arrive at some understanding with the Government of South Australia, if possible, before the programme of this Government is submitted to the country. Thus, if the question be not settled in these Chambers before Parliament rises- - and that would appear to be an almost 'impossible task at present - we may be able to put forward a proposal which Australia as a whole can deal with, as part of the Ministerial policy- That would mean the re-opening of negotiations, with a view to the acquisition of the  Northern Territory by the Commonwealth, in the interests of the whole of its people, early in the next Parliament. </para>

                        <para>.- I am positively astounded at the Prime Minister's remarks, which would lead a stranger to believe that an exceptional effort had been put forward by the Ministry to secure the acceptance of the agreement in both Houses. I very much regret that the Prime Minister has to go. It is characteristic of the attitude of the Ministry on most subjects. A Minister, after making certain statements, and often after making an attack, will almost immediately have private or other business to attend to, and seldom, if ever, remain to listen to a reply, or to discuss the subject more fully with members holding opposite views. </para>

We were told by the Prime Minister that only an hour before a certain division was taken in another place, he was assured that the  acceptance of the agreement was probable. I am justified, as one of the representatives of the State most directly concerned, in asking him. in the name of all that is truthful, who gave him that assurance, particularly when we know that a paid Government official was himself in most active opposition to the Bill, and, more than any other man in either Chamber, was the one who ought to have known precisely what the result of the division was likely to be. </para>

The Prime Minister stated that everything was done in this House by the Ministry to secure the acceptance of the agreement. He must be suffering from some indisposition that has prevented him from speaking in his usual manner, for with the notable exception of the Minister of External Affairs, to whom I am grateful, no disposition was shown by any Minister in this House- </para>

                            <para>- The whipping, if any, was done by the honorable member for Grey, but for the greater part of the time, in marked contrast to the energy which he displayed in connexion with the other measure to which I have referred, the Government Whip was absent from the chamber - a peculiar thing for him, and therefore the more noticeable. We are informed that certain members of the Ministry and certain Ministerialists refrained from voting for the agreement because they had previously written and spoken against it. If that is to be an argument, I ask why those who wrote and spoke against what is known as the Financial Agreement were not permitted to. vote in accordance with their expressed views. There were honorable members opposite who not only spoke against the agreement before it came under consideration here, but even in this chamber argued emphatically against it. Yet the influence of the Ministry and of the Ministerial Whip were brought so heavily to bear on them that their writings, speeches, and previous votes were ignored, and they voted for the agreement. We had an indication from the Prime Minister that the previous alleged modification in the agreement we are now considering would have been acceptable to him. , At any rate, there was an intimation to that effect to be read into his speech. But, so far as I understand the attitude of the people of South Australia, there can be no modification of the agreement. They are giving away everything in a true Federal spirit, in the belief that the Territory should be governed and controlled bv the Commonwealth. </para>

I compliment the honorable member for Grey upon his intense earnestness in this matter, and for the good taste which he displayed in putting his case before the House. I am bound to say, as a matter of common honesty, that the allegations of insincerity which have been made concerning the Prime Minister are without foundation, and I do not think that want of sincerity will be even suggested so 'far as the Attorney-General is concerned. I know  that from the beginning to the end, both of them, and also the Minister in charge of the Bill, have done splendid work, and their conduct leaves nothing to be desired. At all times they showed earnestness, and a readiness to assist in every way possible. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is idle to talk about what happened in this Chamber regarding the measure, because, however secured, there was a handsome majority for the acceptance of the Northern Territory. I cannot speak of what occurred in another place. So far as South Australia, one of the contracting parties, is concerned, time is the essence of the contract. It has been stated by several honorable members that development has not continued in the Northern Territory. It has been  arrested for the last nine years in order that South Australia might hand over the Territory to the Commonwealth with as few acres alienated as possible. For years past, the South Australian Government has refused to alienate an acre by pastoral lease, the pastoral interests there having been conducted for some years on annual permits. Those who know anything about business must admit that there cannot be satisfactory development under such conditions. During recent years, in all parts of Australia, the pastoral industry has had a fillip such as it never received before in the history of this country, but in the Northern Territory the advantage of that has been lost. Right up to the moment of Federation, South Australia refused even to consider tempting offers for the transfer of the Territory, or of any portion of it, desiring to keep its population white, I hope, almost against hope, that, as the Prime Minister suggested, there is still a possibility of the acceptance of the agreement in these dying hours of the present Parliament, I hope that the expectation of the Prime Minister is not without foundation, and for this reason : Any alternative will drive South Australia - and it is the biggest certainty in the world - into the hands of land-grant syndicates. The attitude of this Parliament to-day, which future Parliaments will bitterly regret, leaves no other policy open to South Australia than the land-grant policy. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that no further attempt in this direction will be successful. Without discussing whether the Government is culpable, or whether Ministers have worked their hardest to secure the . acceptance of the agreement, I wish to express my personal appreciation of the way in which the Minister of External Affairs has worked in the matter, and to state that, in my view, the honorable member for Grey was quite justified in saying that the Prime Minister has been sincere in what he has done regarding it. It is extremely unfortunate that, in the Senate, the Government was unable to bring to the support of one of the most important measures that has come before the Parliament, and one to which the Prime Minister was pledged, a single member of its following who is not a South Australian representative. No member of the Fusion party, other than the two Ministers in the Senate, and the representatives of South Australia, voted for the agreement. It is 'extremely unfortunate, too, that the party now in power should ta.ke such a narrow view of national questions, and that this matter should have. had to be brought forward at this time. I believe that the opportunity for acquiring the Territory has now gone. I hope that it may not prove so, but I am afraid that it is so. Should there be a possibility of securing a change in the vote, I hope, of course, that it will be done. </para>

                        <para>. - The Prime Minister so fittingly voiced my opinions on this subject that <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> did not intend to speak on the motion. I am disappointed at what has occurred, because I have expressed more than once my feeling that it is absolutely necessary, for national reasons, that Australia should have complete possession of the Northern Terri tory. South Australia has done good work there in the past, but the burden has become too great for her. We have considered the question, not from her standpoint, but from the national stand-point. I rise to speak now, however, because a previous speaker implied, and almost directly stated, that the Attorney-General's efforts on behalf of the Bill were not very strong. </para>

                        (Brisbane- Honorary Minister) [12.0]. - I do not intend to discuss the merits of the Bill, which really form the subject-matter of this motion. I have been told that if there is any honorable member who ought to remain silent on this question, it is myself. I am inclined to think that I have, perhaps, made a mistake in remaining silent as long as I have done. It may be news to the honorable member who made the observation to which I refer that, on the public platforms of Queensland, as well as in this House a.nd through the press, I have ventilated 'my strong opposition to the conditions of the agreement for the transfer of the Territory. I did so prior to becoming a. member of the present Government, and, by abstaining from voting on the Bill, I have not only earned a considerable measure of adverse criticism at the hands of those who support the Bill, and who claim that I ought to have voted with the rest of my colleagues for it ; but I have been abused in the press of my own State for having gone back upon my previously expressed opinions. The honorable member, who criticised the Prime Minister in no unmeasured terms, and condemned hint for having left the chamber, although he was compelled to do so to attend to public business, had no sooner concluded his diatribe that he too retired, and probably with much less reason.

                        - That may be so. The honorable member was apparently inclined to blame me for having refrained from voting with the rest of the Government. Let me tell him that I am not built that way. I am not prepared to change my views, or to vote in direct opposition to them, merely because I happen to be in office. The fact that I have accepted a position, humble as it may be, in the Cabinet, will not cause me to depart from my previously expressed opinions. If it is contended by honorable members opposite that on becoming a member of the Government I should have changed my principles, I can only say that my view of political morality is not theirs.

                        I agree with the honorable member ; but the honorable member for Boothby, who has been a member of a Ministry, knows that it is sometimes difficult for a Minister to vote against his colleagues on a Government measure. In abstaining from voting, I went as far as the opponents of the Bill could expect me to go. I would again remind those supporting the Bill that in doing so I earned considerable adverse criticism on the part of the public press of Queensland, the allegation being that in refraining from voting I abandoned my principles, and I am glad to have had this opportunity to break a silence which I think I have maintained toolong.

                        <para>.- It seems like old times to hear the Honorary Minister endeavouring to explain away an awkward position in . which he finds himself. The honorable gentleman is one of the strongest opponents of the Northern Territory agreement of whom I know. Some time ago he contributed to the press a series of able articles, in which he objected, not so much to the taking over of the Territory, as to the terms on which it was proposed to take it over. He now puts before us a new code of Cabinet ethics, declaring that the fact that he is a member of the Government will not bind him to support any Government proposal contrary to views that he has previously expressed. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. When an honorable member feels that he cannot possibly support a proposal made by a Government of which he is a member, he ought to retire from it. The honorable gentleman seems to have laid down a rather peculiar course of procedure for Cabinet Ministers. As a matter of fact, I, like the Honorary Minister, am opposed to the conditions of the agreement. The articles which he wrote on the subject were certainly excellent. In them he had nothing to say with regard to the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth; he objected merely to the conditions sought to be imposed. That is exactly my position. The only other point to which I desire to refer is the apparent insincerity of the Government with regard to the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill. On their invitation we devoted to its discussion several weeks which might well have been made available for the consideration of other important legislation, and it would appear that whilst the Government were pretending to be anxious to carry the measure, they availed themselves of every opportunity to bring about its defeat. A member of the Government in this House abstained from voting for the Bill, whilst the Government Whip in another place did all that he could to bring about its defeat. It is extraordinary to find a Government pretending that it is necessary that a Bill should1 be carried, whilst their Whip in another place does all in his power to secure its- rejection. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not wish to discuss the action taken by the Honorary Minister in regard to  the  Bill, save to say that many precedents may " be quoted in support of his action in refraining from voting; although I do" not know of any case where  a  Minister  has  voted, as suggested by the honorable member for Kennedy, in opposition to the rest of his colleagues ora a Government question. I regret the stand-and-deliver attitude that has been adopted by representatives of South Australia in reference to this matter. The honorable member for Boothby has told us that if we do  not  accept the agreement we shall obtain  no  other; and that no modification of it will be allowed by the Government of South Australia. The honorable member for Wakefield also put a pistol to our heads, declaring that if we do not take the agreement as submitted to this House a land-grant railway will be run through the Territory. </para>

                            <para>- So far as the position of the Northern Territory is concerned. I do  not  think  that the  votes  taken here  and in another place will prejudice this question to any great extent, and I am glad to think that negotiations may be reopened. Those who support the measure ought to give those of a different opinion credit for an equal interest with themselves in the welfare of this great Commonwealth. The House is, I think, practically unanimous in the opinion that the Territory should be taken over on reasonable terms, because at present it is certainly a menace to Australia. The argument as to a possible invasion does not, I confess, appeal to me, because I cannot conceive that an invader would land in that part of Australia. On the other hand, however, as I have said, there is always danger in leaving a vast territory of this kind unoccupied, and we all agree that, given, a fair agreement, the Territory ought to be taken over. </para>

The question of the immediate construction of the line is also one that ought to be decided. In spite of the pessimistic view put forward by the representatives of South Australia, I hope that during the recess the Prime Minister may be able to obtain such an amendment of the agreement as will make it acceptable to all parties, and thus, at an early date, solve this very serious question in the interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- The Government Whip asked me specially to vote for the Bill, although he knew I was ready to vote against the second reading, and was really disappointed that I had not that opportunity. To my knowledge, and also to the knowledge of the honorable member for Wakefield, the Prime Minister did everything he could to induce honorable members to accept the Bill, and but for his personal influence and the influence of the Government Whip, the Bill would not have achieved the success it did ; indeed, I feel certain that if the division had been taken at an earlier stage of the session it would have met with a different fate. A good deal of the chagrin and venom exhibited by the honorable member for Adelaide is due to his knowledge that he has done less than any other of the South Australian representatives to further the passage of the Bill, though I believe the honorable member did vote for it, and to that extent his constituents are to be congratulated. I desire now to refer to the indefensible attitude, from a constitutional point of view, of the honorable member for Brisbane. He is a member of the Government, but he has told us that he is going to keep to his own opinions, and that if the Cabinet disagree with him he has a right to vote against his colleagues. </para>

                        <para>It is a consequence of this corporate character of the Ministry that the opinion of the majority should bind the minority. The Ministry is one body, and can have but one voice. On questions with which the Ministry, as such, does not undertake to deal, unanimity is needless. But on every Ministerial question, on every matter relating to the Executive Government, and on every Bill which the Government considers important for the business of administration, all members of the Government must act as one man. </para>

                            <para>- I do not care who made it ; the matter has nothing to do with us, and we are not to be threatened in that way. If South Australia likes to build a railway on the land-grant principle, it has nothing to do with, the other States. I believe that when the South Australian Government are informed of the views of the members of this Parliament, they will be only too glad to get rid of the Territory without the incubus of the railway. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member waits until I am Treasurer, he will see me fix it up in no time. The honorable member himself, if he were Treasurer, could finance it. This is a great national work, and the foundation of a national railway. The people of Australia owe the little State of South Australia a great debt of gratitude for having kept the Territory, with a few exceptions, white. It would have been very easy for South Australia to have had by now a couple of million Asiatics living there. They could have offered a syndicate the right to build the railway to Port Darwin, with millions of acres of land on which to settle Asiatics. </para>

                            <para>- It could have been done when I was a member of the South Australian Parliament. Very few of us knew anything about the White Australian idea at that time ; in fact, I think I would have voted for such a proposal. I was not a Labour man then, but a private syndicator. The South Australian Government at that time had the numbers in the House, and could have handed the Territory over to a syndicate on those terms if they had wanted to. There were great syndicates after it, and they could easily have been given the right to bring in a mighty Asiatic population, which would have flocked down into the streets of Melbourne and Sydney, and done as the coloured people of the South are doing now in the Northern States - making slaves of their white women. That is the state of things which we might have had in Australia to-day if the South Australian Parliament had acted as I indicate, and I would have voted, although in ignorance, to bring it about. I have had my eyes opened since. In fact, I have had an experience like that of Saul of Tarsus. I am sorry that the Government did not go up into the Senate and flog the members there- </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree with you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker;</inline> it was only an inadvertance. I appeal to the House to do justice to South Australia. If we are going on with the slipshod method of finance that is now being adopted it will make no difference if we incur a liability of  £3,000,000  or£4,000,000 more on behalf of South Australia. At the same time we do owe it to South Australia to carry out the agreement. I am the only member from Tasmania in this chamber who has voted for it. It is of no benefit to my constituents, except as a national work, but as such it appeals to me as an Australian, who owes a paramount allegiance to the Commonwealth, and a subordinate allegiance to the State of Tasmania. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with the Minister that many of the Senate's amendments are of a trivial character, so that it scarcely matters whether they are adopted or not. This amendment, however, seems to admit of the appointment as officers of persons who have not served in the ranks, though, of course, there is the qualification " except as far as may be found possible." </para>

The intention is that persons shall not be eligible for appointment as officers until they have served for a period in the ranks, to acquire the experience which is deemed necessary. This prevision, however, will give us a free hand for two years. After that it will be impossible to appoint officers except from among those who have served in the ranks. </para>

                    <para>.- The provision will enable the administration for two years to appoint as officers of the Citizen Forces persons who have not served in the ranks. As the Bill left this Chamber, it required all appointments of officers to be made from those who had served in the ranks. I believe that there is a sufficient number of experienced men in the ranks who will be able to qualify for all appointments necessary within the next two years, and the appointment of any others should, as far as possible, be avoided. </para>

                        <para>. -  It seems to me that the other Chamber has made amendments which are entirely superfluous. These provisos merely increase the bulk of the Bill, and necessitate the formulation of regulations, without making any material alteration in the law. At the present time, regulations are hurled at us. almost every week, so that we scarcely, know what rules we are working under. The effect of the Senate's proposal is to give those who re-engage for a second period a little more independence than those who are undergoing the first period of training, whereas, in my opinion, they should be on precisely the same footing. To give this privilege is liable to breed dissatisfaction and discontent among the recruits. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me that the amendment weakens the provision in the Bill. A Minister who has regard to the defences of the country may provide adequately for the training of the Cadets, but one holding the views which the present Minister held some years ago might make no provision for drills at all. I think that the amendment goes further than is intended. I have not the technical knowledge of the honorable member for Adelaide, but, in my opinion, this is a proposal to weaken a fundamental principle. </para>

                    <para>.- I have grave doubts as to whether the Committee will be doing right in accepting this amendment. I understand that it was inserted  in  another place at the instigation of the Government, and, if accepted, it  Hill  leave the whole of the training of Junior Cadets to. be determined by the Minister of the day, If I understood the feeling of the Committee when we passed this clause originally it was that the drill of Junior Cadets should be defined by Parliament, and not left to the whim of the Minister. Some military authorities might advise him that the drill should be lenient, and others that it should be of a strenuous character. But the chief difficulty in the way of accepting this amendment is that in the event of a Ministry happening to want funds badly, it would make it possible for him by a stroke of the pen to decide that the Junior Cadets should receive no training, and thus save , £30,000 or . £40,000 a year. There is no doubt that the financial situation in the immediate future will be such that Ministers will be grasping greedily at every penny j but if the Committee does not share my view, I can only say that in entering this protest I have done my duty. </para>

                    <para>. - This, with the succeeding amendment made by the Senate, will mean prohibition in camp, but the continuance of the barrack canteen as at present. The two amendments were made on the motion of my predecessor in office, who argued very strongly that they were in the interests of temperance. The amendment before us tightens up our proposals so far as training and camps go, but, taken with the next amendment, it will leave the ordinary canteen in barracks, as at present. I venture to say that, altogether, this is an even better provision than we passed, so far as the general question of temperance is concerned. Honorable members may take my word that the canteens in barracks are managed in the most stringent way. I have had the fullest investigation made, and there is really very little drinking carried on. The liquors are confined to ales and wine, no spirits of any kind being permitted. Since we prohibit drink entirely in camp while training is proceeding, it seems to me we might very well accept the clause as sent down. </para>

I believe that, subsequently, a dozen bottles of lemonade were sent for, but in the meantime the boys drank beer not knowing that it was beer. </para>

                    <para>.- I have read the debates in another place, and it is a striking fact that Rechabites and leading teetotallers there take an opposite position from that of some of my fellow members and myself. The Minister of Defence, whose temperance principles no one will impugn, holds that the canteen, as at present conducted, is conducive to temperance rather than to intemperance, but I entirely and absolutely disagree with him. The honorable gentleman, however, of course, has a perfect right to his opinion, and I do not impugn his honesty of purpose for a moment. I point out, however, that this is the second or third' time this proposal has been presented to the Senate, and refused, so that it would seem hopeless to expect that Chamber to adopt it. </para>

                <para>Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane- Honorary Minister)  [2.41].  - T.was not in Australia when this Bill was previously before this Chamber, and I should like to take the present opportunity to relate a personal experience, which may be of value to the Committee. Some time ago, before I was a member of this House, there was considerable discussion in the press, and, I think, also in Parliament, as to the desirability or otherwise of totally prohibiting intoxicating liquors in camp. I forget exactly what orders were issued, but, at any rate, after it had been decided to do away with the "wet" canteen, as it is called, in camp, the order was revoked. However, when I happened to be in command of a camp shortly afterwards, at which there were  1,000  or  1,200  men, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> thought I would try the experiment of prohibition. It was optional with me, as the commanding officer, to have a canteen or not, as I thought best ; and, with my staff officer, I arranged that no liquor should be obtainable in camp. On the first night of the camp I found that a large number of the men had gone out, and that some of them had been found at hotels up to four miles away. </para>

I fail to see that it is not desirable to have the truth of the matter, even though it may not conform with the views of some honorable members, i desire to relate my personal experience in an attempt to carry into effect what is now proposed. I sent out patrols, and went out myself, and found men going through the bush to hotels, one of which was about a mile and a-half away, and the other about four miles. My experiment was tried in the interests of temperance, and I believe it was unique, as being the. first.

                    Perhaps the honorable member will allow me to be. the judge of when I shall speak, and what I shall say. On the second night, the experience was the same, in an aggravated form. Although I had been for nearly forty years attending camps,
                    <inline font-style="italic">I</inline>
                    do not think I had ever seen more drunkenness than I did on those two nights; and, in support of temperance principles, I was forced to telegraph to Brisbane for hogsheads of beer with which to open a canteen. From, that time there was no more drunkenness in camp, because the beer was sold under supervision, and no man 'who was in the slightest degree intoxicated could obtain it.

                    <para>.- The argument of the honorable member for Brisbane boiled down is that hotels should be opened up all over the place and beer made available wherever possible, because in that way there would be less drunkenness. When this proposal left the House all canteens were to be closed, whether in barracks or camps. Another place now proposes that the canteens shall still continue, and that this provision shall apply only to boys undergoing compulsory training. Less than six weeks ago this Chamber decided without a division to close all canteens, but it seems to be impossible to carry that in another place. The Minister is to be congratulated on the effort he has made, but I regret that it is not possible to close the whole of the canteens in connexion with naval and military forces. </para>

                    <para>.-I did not intend to speak on the question until I heard the extraordinary speech of the Honorary Minister. Why are the Government going to prevent the sale of intoxicating liquors in juvenile camps if the argument of the Honorary Minister, that the restriction will lead to drunkenness, is a sound one? According to him, canteens ought to be established at every street corner. All the facts, however, are plainly against that argument. If some men did go from the particular camp mentioned by the Honorary Minister and obtain drink, they were not nearly so numerous as those who would have taken it in the camp if there had been a canteen there. The Minister of Defence acted quite rightly in accepting the amendment when it was first moved in this Chamber, but if it is impossible to get all that we want I am prepared to take what we can get, so long as it is understood that no liquor will be available in the canteen for adults when the juveniles or cadets are in the camp. If liquor is available for the adults, what happened recently at the military tattoo at the Exhibition Building, Melbourne, will happen again. The liquor was not taken there for the cadets, but they got it. If cadets and adults are out together and liquor is available in the camp for adults the juveniles will obtain it by some means or other. We are proposing to take boys compulsorily from their homes, and many of them have never been in such places before, or had the temptation placed in their way. We shall be studying the welfare of these young Australians if we keep liquor away from them as much as possible. Some say that beer is good for the constitution. I have never tasted it, but I have a very fine constitution, and I am satisfied that total abstinence is best. I know hundreds of men who would be better to-day if they had never taken intoxicating liquor. </para>

I am pleased that the Ministry will accept the amendment, because those who know the history of this legislation will know that this is about the fourth time that we have tried to get a provision in this direction through the Senate. I am afraid that if it goes back to the Senate there will be a possibility of losing the great advantage already gained by the Bill. The exclusion of young men under twenty is one of the best things that we can possibly have, and is such an advance that I hope those who want to go further will not, by asking for everything, imperil it. </para>

                        <para>- One also has an opportunity of observing the dire effects of abstinence in certain cases. A very wrong idea is prevalent with regard to liquor, especially amongst out temperance friends. There is no doubt of the evil effects of spirituous liquor taken in excess, but to prevent the soldier, whether citizen or regular, from having any liquor at all, nearly always leads, and is bound to lead, to excess in another direction. That is to say, he will get liquor even if he has to travel a considerable distance for it, so long as the ordinary hotels are open, as the honorable member for Brisbane mentioned. I have seen camps where there were no canteens, and every hotel within a reasonable distance always did a thriving trade. The men would stop there much longer, because there was no hope of getting liquor when they returned to camp, than they would have done had the canteen been open in the ordinary way. My idea is that it would be much preferable for the Government to prohibit the sale of spirituous liquors in connexion with the Military Forces, except on a medical certificate, but to allow light beer to any extent that the men are willing to pay for. </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection to light wines, but light beer should certainly be allowed for any man or youth who has been marching about all day in the hot sun, with dust in his throat all the time. He needs something in the way of a drink, but the ordinary teetotal drink is just about as rotten a proposition as it is possible to imagine. Even teetotallers have confessed to me that their great trouble was to find a drink that would satisfy them.I have tried some teetotal beverages, but I cannot say that they have attracted me. The cause of temperance would be materially served by the sale of light beer and, possibly, light wines in canteens. The authorities could insist upon it being sufficiently light to be practically non-intoxicating; but to close the canteens altogether is to apply a cure which is worse than the disease. </para>

                        <para>- That is a matter of assumption. What is the best work in the world? I shall not argue the question of what teetotalism has or has not done, but I dare say even the honorable member who interjects would be the better for a little wholesome beer if he would take it in moderation. My view is that the canteens should be open for the supply of light beer to the soldiers, whether youths or adults. In either case, it could do them no harm, and it would certainly prevent them obtaining worse liquor away from the camp. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not propose to deliver a temperance lecture to the Committee, but I wish to reply to the honorable member for South Sydney. He is probably quite right in the statement that teetotal drinks, if partaken of as a regular beverage, would be even worse than alcohol. I do not propose to give my personal experiences, but for many years I hare not drunk alcohol, and have had some knowledge of camp life. These encampments are not arranged for the social entertainment of those who take part in them ; they are designed to inure youths and adults to service conditions, under which canteens do not exist. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Colonel</inline> Cameron, and other senators who have had actual experience of warfare and military training, strongly advocated the abolition of canteens at encampments. Apart from moral considerations, it must be apparent to those who have had experience of the ways of the world that the habit of drinking intoxicating liquor is generally acquired by process of imitation. Youths like to imitate their elders, and, as their carrying capacity is not so great, many of them drink to excess. After a heavy day's work, the younger men in an encampment often fly to alcohol, and, not being accustomed to its consumption, become undisciplined, and give their officers at night more trouble than they had all day. In the interests of discipline, and' of those appointed for the instruction of the troops in the methods of warfare, it is advisable to keep liquor out of encampments. My own habits are temperate, and I agree with those who contend that the average man of resolution will not allow himself to drink to excess; but I would not dictate to others what they shall do, any more than I would allow them to dictate to me. At the same time, as military encampments are arranged to give those who take part in them solid training, we should make provision for preventing the taking of liquor there. </para>

                    <para>.- As I understand, the position is this : We have agreed to an amendment of the Senate prohibiting persons in camp from, having intoxicating or spirituous liquors in their possession, and are now considering a proposal to prevent the selling of intoxicating drink in military barracks during training. I ask what can we lose by sending this question back to the Senate? It cannot negative what both Chambers have now agreed to. The taking of drink to military camps of training is prohibited. </para>

                    <para>.- I  certainly do not wish to make political capital out of this matter. I possess sufficient independence not to care how my acts may be judged outside as long as they have the authority of my own conscience. I am not here to pole before the electors because a general election is near at hand j 1 am not here to kneel or bow to the Rechabite or any other party. I believe that if I do in this House what I conceive to be right  I  shall have the respect of all parties, regardless of what their principles may be.  I  cannot understand the attitude of a man like thd "honorable member for 'Barrier, who speaks with his tongue in his cheek, and who, during the consideration of a serious matter of this kind, indulges in a ribald joke about the designation of the electorate represented by the honorable member for Maribyrnong, while at the same time pretending to uphold grand and sacred principles for the reformation of the people. I do not object to listen to the honorable member when he is sincere, but  I  am inclined to agree with, the Minister of Defence, that he is thinking more of politics than anything else. I have had a good  deal to do with men, and have discussed with both privates and officers the question of canteens. From what I have seen, and have learned, I am satisfied that we shall make a very great mistake if we do not accept this amendment. I regretted very much the insertion in the Bill of the original clause, believing it to be too drastic, and I am glad now to have an opportunity tq support such an amendment as this. Having seen a lot of the suffering that results from excess in alcohol, I regret as much as any man that some method cannot be devised of sweeping all alcohol off the face of the earth. But it seems to me that we must be temperate ourselves, and that those who believe in the total abolition of liquor can hardly be said to be temperate in their ideas. </para>

                        <para>- It is, of course,  a  matter of opinion. I believe in the rule of the majority, and I trust that a majority of the Committee will support this amend- , ment. When the Papua Bill was before us, an argument was advanced that  I  should like to put forward now. It was said then that if we applied the principle of prohibition there, the result would be illicit selling, and that a large quantity of cheap, inferior liquor would be secretly in-, traduced and sold in the Territory. It was consequently decided that the liquor trade there might - be licensed and carried on under proper restrictions, and I see no reason why the same course should not be pursued in this connexion. It has been the custom for ages to permit canteens in barracks, where they are under the control of responsible officers. An officer in command has only to enter a canteen and give am order, and not a man there dare swallow the liquor that remains in his glass. Under such control I do not think that canteens in barracks can be abused, but I have seen liquor supplied in camp canteens to civilians not in training, but visiting. That should be specially guarded against, and I hope that the Minister will bring to bear stringent .measures to provide that civilians shall not be supplied with liquor, more especially on Sundays, in camp. </para>

                        <para>- The sale of liquor under regulations in camps is more likely to conduce to temperance than would the abolition of the system. If it were abolished" altogether, illicit selling would go on. Bad' liquor would be supplied on the outskirts, of camps, and some men, if they could not obtain a drink in camp, might travel a considerable distance to obtain one. If the men are able to obtain liquor in camp under certain restrictions at a moderate price, I think that the system will be more- conducive to temperance than otherwise. I shall therefore support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause is not limited to men who are compelled to attend training; but extends to militiamen who are really volunteers; and, in my opinion, a very serious alteration of principle is involved. I remember the case of a grocer's assistant who, on Easter Saturday, one of the busiest days of the year, vent, without his employer's consent, into camp as a militiaman, and therefore greatly interfered with his work, and, under this clause his employer will have no say in the matter. I take it that there is a great distinction between the position of a man in the compulsory service, and a man who volunteers to become a militiaman. Of course, I do not think that an employer should object more than is absolutely necessary to his employes attending camp ; but it is easy to conceive that there will be great inconvenience to all businesses if militiamen have to attend the Kitchener camps from the  10th  to the  17th.  Another case of which I know is that of the employes in a large biscuit factory, where there are five militiamen on whom depends the work of a great number of other men. If this amendment be agreed to, the employers, although the men are volunteers, will be compelled to permit them to leave their employment for days together, and the employes will not be averse, seeing that they will be paid  8s.  a day. Another case, still, is that of a man who hitherto has been permitted to leave camp on the Sunday because he had to light up some brick kilns on which the employment of about  110  men depended. I quite agree with strengthening the clause so far as those under compulsory service are concerned ; but I think we ought to have some consideration for the employer in the case of militiamen who, as we know, are obliged to take all their camp training at once, instead of, as in the case of the compulsory men, being able to spread it over the year. I may as well mention another instance, in which it is absolutely necessary that a member of the militia force should be at the disposal of his employer in order to water horses for about twenty-five carters. I do not know whether the arguments I am presenting were used in another place, but the officials of a Department do not always consider the convenience of employers and others. Who submitted this amendment in the Senate? </para>

                        <para>- I think the clause will prove a serious interference with the business of the country, and may have the effect of causing employers to refuse to employ members of the militia. As this service is voluntary, the course proposed will eventually injure the movement. This would be a most unfortunate result ; but I can say that, although I take a great  interest in the militia movement, I should have to consider my position if I found that the whole of my clerks were called away for eight days at a time. </para>

                        <para>- Victoria is one. We are simply playing at soldiering unless we can get these men into an eight-days' continuous camp. While that may be inconvenient - and I do not deny all that the honorable member has said - it is unavoidable in the interests of the effective defence of Australia. I have nothing more to say, except to express my fear that if this inconvenience is not borne by both men and masters, it simply means that some provision even more drastic will assuredly be imposed. </para>

                    <para>.- The Committee is indebted to the honorable member for Corio for bringing the matter forward, and I am rather disappointed that the Minister, in his reply, was so unsympathetic towards the honorable member's object. I think the honorable member is thoroughly in earnest in his desire to make the Bill effective, and the Forces as efficient as possible. He has instanced some cases, and I know of others. There are many factories where there are employed in certain departments experts whose attendance is absolutely necessary. Other men cannot be substituted temporarily for them, and without their attendance the whole of the factory may be stopped. </para>

Otherwise, great, and perfectly needless, damage might be done, not to the owner of the factory, but, in many cases, to hundreds of men through factories being closed down. I am sure the Minister and the Government do not intend anything of that kind, and I shall be glad if they can -satisfy me that there are means to prevent it. I quite approve of the necessity of a firm hand to compel all parties to fall in with the scheme; but there should be some safety-valve by which <inline font-style="italic">bonâ fide</inline> cases of hardship and inconvenience can be dealt with. </para>

                    <para>. - As one who has consistently supported the principle of universal training, I think that, until it has absolutely become the law of the country, and adjustments are made between employers and employés, we  should not impose a restriction such as that to which the honorable member for Corio has very properly drawn attention. It would probably have the effect of reducing the number who might go into the voluntary arms of the service, and it ought to be made clear that the Minister has the power, under certain conditions and in certain circumstances, to release those called upon to attend drill. If that power is not given, I am afraid it will operate very strongly against an increase of the Militia and place many employers in a great difficulty. The provision should be modified as the honorable member for Corio suggests, in order that the Minister may give the necessary release in specific circumstances of difficulty, without recourse to the machinery of red-tape. I have in my mind one business undertaking where, if three of the men employed were compelled to be absent at the same time, a large industry would be absolutely dislocated and the suffering would fall upon the whole of those engaged in it. </para>

                    <para>.- I take an entirely different view from the honorable member for Kooyong. When administering the Postal and Home Affairs Departments, I was appealed to quite a number of times to use my influence with employers to allow their men to go to drill, and I discovered an amount of selfishness that was simply abominable. </para>

                    <para>. - We must take into consideration the interests of the men, and the speech of the honorable member for Maribyrnong raises the question whether they will be employed if the employer is liable to all the pains and penalties proposed. Such cases as those mentioned by the honorable member may occur in Melbourne, but I have not heard of them occurring anywhere else. I think the majority of employers recognise the responsibility and necessity of defence, and are willing to let their men go. I have a few working for me, and have always let them go to camp for a fortnight, and paid them for the time, because I recognised that they were going there for the good of the country. Every employer ought to realize his responsibility in that direction. At the same time, there are some employers who might penalize their men, and we ought to study the men in that connexion. I hope that the Bill, when passed, will' be administered with common sense, and that the people of Australia will realize that defence  is  necessary. I do not belong to the fighting class myself, but I believe we should defend Australia, and it is only by the employer  and  the employé working together for the good of the country that we shall have a true defence. If, however, one fights against the other, both will suffer. </para>

It seems to me that it would be fair, under such circumstances, to charge a fee where there is exemption. At any rate, the exemption should be under such conditions as may be prescribed. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister cannot make regulations overriding the Act. When persons are brought to Court for not subjecting themselves to training, they will declare that they are exempt under this provision, alleging that the doctrines of their religion, which they can support by citing two or three verses from the New Testament, forbid them to bear arms. They will thus injure men of real convictions. I shall not push my objection, but as the Bill has to be returned to the Senate, I think that this provision might well be amended. </para>

If it is found that the exigencies of the service require some such persons to bear arms, they must do so. But as far as possible we shall exempt them, allotting them to non-combatant duties. </para>

                    <para>The measure requires more consideration than the time at our disposal really permits us to give to it ; but I shall endeavour to draw the attention of honorable members to its main points, in the hope that it may be passed through its various stages to-day. In 1903 we passed a Patents Bill, based, to a large extent, on the English Act of 1902, making certain improvements in the legislation of the States, and, amongst other things, reducing the fees chargeable from about £91 to £13, exclusive of the cost of drawings, or, with that cost, from about £120 to . £20, the lowest charges in any place where patent laws exist, with the exception of Belgium. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. The revenue from the Department which administers the law of patents, trade marks, copyright and designs for the year 1909-10 is estimated at £18,270, and the expenditure at £20,973,' showing a loss of about £2,703, or, taking into account the amount returnable to the States, £4,273. The Senate has reduced the fee for sealing from £5 to £3. and have increased the fee for renewal from £5 to£12. As a renewal does not come in until seven years after the sealing of the patent, the Commonwealth does not reap the benefit for some time. The 1st June, 191 1, is the first date on which renewal fees will be payable to the Commonwealth for its own purposes. I might emphasize the matter by informing honorable members that of the total fees received between 1st June, 1904, when the Act became operative, and the 30th June,. 1909, amounting to £23,851, £23,017 was in respect of renewals, and was all paid to the States. The effect of these figures is, that there is a loss on the working of the Department. I have given the annual loss at present as £2,703, leaving out the figures relating to the States. It is impossible to say what will be the position a few years hence. Until the fees for renewals have begun to come in, we cannot really ascertain, since the present is an experimental period, how the Department will pay. I think in the circumstances it was a mistake for the Senate to reduce the fee. </para>

Papua is to be brought within the scope of our Patents Act, and the result is that incidental provisions have to be made to meet that extension. They will be found in clause  3.  There is in clause  4  a provision in relation to costs. The Commissioner has power to award, but no power to enforce, the collection of costs. Under this Bill we are giving him that power. Causes 6,  7,  and  8  are purely formal. </para>

                            <para>-  Clause  9  makes an amendment in the existing provisions as regards additional patents. The old provision was that where improvements in a patent were being made an additional patent had to be taken out. We have brought that into line with the principle of the English Act, and have abolished the fee. There is provision also for the restoration of lapsed patents, and some further provisions in clauses  13  and  14.  The two clauses of chief importance are those dealing with the working of patents or compulsory licences. In  1903  we made provision for the compulsory licence. The provisions existing under the English Act of  1883,  with improvements incorporated in the English Act of  1902,  were adopted by us, but they are not very efficacious, and we have endeavoured to improve them by bringing them into line with the last English Act. Under the Bill as it stands, they are not sufficient, because a man who applies for a compulsory licence has to fight from the start out of his own pocket. He has to face a heavy handicap in respect of the costs which the proceedings entail, and is met throughout the course of the application for a compulsory licence with many obstacles in the way of proof. We have endeavoured to minimize those, but at the same time my personal conviction is that to do what we wish as regards compulsory licences, the provisions of this Bill are not sufficient. </para>

                            <para>-  The compulsory licence provisions under the Bill as it stands are not sufficient. We propose, therefore, to introduce the principle which is embodied in the legislation of almost all countries with regard to the compulsory working of patents. I have given this matter a great deal of attention; since the Bill came from the Senate, and have prepared an amendment of the clause dealing with it which, I think, will be an improvement. It is not a slavish following of the English provision. It amounts to this : That if after a time it is found on petition being lodged that the manufacture in the Commonwealth is inadequate, and when the petition comes on for hearing, it is proved that the patent is being manufactured mainly or exclusively outside the Commonwealth, then, unless the patentee gives satisfactory reasons why he does not manufacture in Australia, an order is to be made to come into operation either at once or at a future date. The reason why it is not proposed that the order shall not necessarily come into operation at once is that we desire to give the patentee an opportunity to comply with the provisions under which the patent is granted; or, in other words, adopting the language of the Statute of Monopolies, to insure that he will introduce a new manufacture into the realm. If a man obtains a particular monopoly he must discharge his obligation in regard to it here. If within the date named in the order he does adequately manufacture according to our local demands, and in accordance with our progressive development, then the order will not be made. If he does not, and can show satisfactory reasons why he should have a little more time within which to carry out his obligation, he may be granted an extension not exceeding twelve months. If after that time he does not comply with the provisions of the Bill, the order will be made, and other people can manufacture the patent without being liable to an action for infringement: If after a time other people do not manufacture, and the patentee proceeds to do so in the Commonwealth then here is a <inline font-style="italic">locuspenitentiæ</inline> created. The patentee is allowed to go on manufacturing with protection and the order is cancelled. That I think is a very reasonable solution of the difficulty. I have listened to operatives, employers, people from England, and others, and, acting as a sort of Committee on the suggestions made, I recommend as a solution of the problem the new clause that I propose to move. Having regard to the circumstances, I am sure that the House  will not think me discourteous if I refrain from speaking at any greater length. I shall be glad, however, to supply any information that may be desired. </para>

                            <para>- I am not satisfied with the reasons that have been given for making the change. The Bill, as originally introduced, proposed that the Commissioner should hear appeals in the first instance, subject, of course, to appeal to a higher Court. I see no objection to the conditions laid down in the clause in reference to the manufacture of patents in Australia; but the proposal to vest the powers in the Supreme Court or the High Court will only place greater difficulties than now exist in the way of inventors. An appeal to the higher courts is a very expensive luxury, and will completely shut out the poor man. As I understand it, the whole policy of this patent law is the simplification and cheapening of the processes by which a patent can be obtained. </para>

                            <para>- But the proposal removes the power from the Commissioner, and compels those interested to have recourse to the ordinary expensive legal machinery. No doubt those who have large vested interests will find such a provision convenient.; but we must not forget that there is a large number of people of small means who will never be able to afford the money necessary to protect their interests before the higher tribunals. In my opinion, the power ought to be left with the Commissioner, always,  of course, subject to appeal. The original proposal was very much more in the interests of the manufacturing community generally ; and I can see no justification for the drastic alteration suggested. </para>

                        <para>.- Apparently the principle of the proposed amendment has been accepted, and the only question is whether the power shall be given to the Supreme Court and the High Court. Personally, I am in favour of the cheaper and more expeditious method. I should like to ask the Attorney-General whether representations have been made from England in this matter. I have seen several references in the English newspapers to the fact that the Chambers of Commerce at Home have requested the Colonial Office to direct the Governor-General to see that amendments are made in this measure, relieving English patentees from the necessity of manufacturing in Australia. If there have been such representations, and they have influenced the change of front, I think the Committee should know the facts. However, from whatever direction the pressure, if any, has been exerted, the effect is the same. </para>

                        <para>. - I urge that the Commissioner should have power to settle all these questions, though, of course, if two millionaires desire to go to law let them have their appeal. Inventors, however, are generally poor men; and I have in my possession now a list of constituents of mine who have perfected little inventions, but who are not able to get patents; and if these men have to go to a Supreme Court or the High Court, their case is hopeless. One advantage of the United States law is that, although there are  90,000,000  people there, the poorest can get his patent, though whether he can defend it when he gets it is another matter. There are lots of cases in which wealthy men or corporations steal patents, and, having made millions out of them, leave the owners to fight the matter in the Courts. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barker,</inline> who invented the endless chain pump, although he got a decision in his favour in the New York Court, and in the United States District Court, was defeated in the Ohio Court; and he never made a penny, simply because he could not appeal to the United States Supreme Court. As a matter of fact, it was not Westinghouse who invented the brake, but  a  man called O'Brien, and all the profit went to the former simply because O'Brien could not afford to fight his cause in the Courts. The honorable member for Corio is an able lawyer, anxious for business in the Courts, but he is prepared to adopt the cheaper method, which I and others favour. I can only say that, personally, if I had to fight a big law case over  a  patent, I should let the patent go. </para>

                            <para>- I should gladly do so if I thought there was any matter of substance at the bottom of it. I have had no recommendation sent to me from any official quarter as to what should be done, but I did read in the English papers, and in some of the debates of the House of Commons, rather complacent suggestions made by chambers of manufactures, and some representatives apparently in sympathy with them throughout the United Kingdom, that we should forsooth allow reciprocity before they had established it by Act of Parliament in connexion with the working provisions of their Act. This would simply mean that our market would be flooded. I know what I am speaking of, and have discussed the matter, in my Department. I have seen only one man from England, and he, I believe, is connected with the Board of Trade. No official recommendations were made, but he was out here representing, I understand, large commercial concerns in some matters. </para>

If the people in England want reciprocity, let them put it on their statute-book there, and we will consider it, but at present it would simply cause a flooding of our markets with patented imports without a corresponding benefit to us in those of the United Kingdom. The reason an appeal is allowed direct to the High Court is that there may be only one hearing of a matter which may disclose the whole of a man's business in relation to a patent. </para>

After a hearing before the Commissioner lasting, perhaps, for two months, and bringing in the whole question of production abroad, the reasons why production is greater abroad, and the reasons why local consumption is not adequate there is certain to be an appeal to a  Judge  of the Supreme Court or the High Court, and the whole thing is gone over again.

                            <para>- When you are granting a patent you are granting simply a dead instrument which gives no idea of the volume of trade. A' man gets his monopoly, and up to then mav have produced nothing but a model. There are no disclosures to the public, because specifications are protected up to a certain point. But when you come to deal with an application for revocation, it is not a Question of the plan upon which production mav take place, but a question of the total operations of a man's business here and abroad. I  know  that that has led in England in some cases to very extensive inquiries, and it struck me that the sense of the Committee would be far better met by providing that in matters of such great importance application may be made direct to the Court. </para>

                            <para>- We have not slavishly followed the English model, but have endeavoured to improve the clauses. In order to save expense, I also put in this clause a provision that, where a case for allowing manufacture without liability to p" action for infringement has not been made out, but a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case has been made out for a compulsory licence, the Court may offer the remedy of a compulsory licence, instead of sending the man back again to make another application and commence <inline font-style="italic">de novo.</inline> That provision is not made in the English Act or elsewhere. The Court is the body to deal with it, and not the Commissioner. The matter first goes before the Commissioner to see if there is a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case to send  on,  but the Commissioner does not adjudicate. I have acted throughout with a view to economize expense, and therefore with the same motive as is actuating those honorable members who have been criticising these provisions. My wish is to get matters of great importance decided at once by the final tribunal. In England, under this novel provision, I believe there have been in the majority of cases appeals to the Courts. In the leading' case of Hatschek's patent, there was an appeal from the Comptroller, who, from the volume of business, is a more important official even than our Commissioner, and in fact almost a judicial personage. There have been appeals from him in many cases,, and his decision, in some, has been reversed. That sort of thing completely upsets people, and causes an immense amount of expense, and therefore I think that on the whole the provision which I have made is the better and cheaper one. </para>

                        <para>.- The Attorney-General has not touched upon another point. In the original clause as passed by the Senate, the term of four years after the date of the patent appeared, as it does in this new clause, but it provided for working " not less than one year after the commencement of this Act," whereas the Attorney-General proposes " not less than two years." Will that not allow a possibility of delay for six years ? </para>

I do not agree that certain cases must be sent direct to the High Court, simply because there is likely to be an appeal to the High Court in any case. This provision may mean a saving in some big cases, but will cause large expense in many instances where the matter could be dealt with bv the Commissioner without appeal.

                        <para>.- I have circulated a new clause which bears on the matter. I understand that the object of the honorable member for Calare is to simplify the proceedings, and give every one who has got a patent a chance. I should like to see no appeal allowed to the High Court against the Commissioner's decision. My experience of the High Court is that it may be very high in justice, and very high in law, but it is also very high in costs. I spent, three afternoons there recently at a cost of <inline font-style="italic">£200,</inline> and my barrister told me that if I had gone on with my case, which he said that nothing could prevent me from winning, it would have cost me £1,500. My vote in this House will always be given to stop appeals to the High Court where we have a competent officer appointed bv this Parliament to decide cases. I shall vote for the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- The effect of the amendment as suggested by the Attorney-General would be that either of the parties could compel the other to go to the High Court. It would be better to make it compulsory that the application should go to the Commissioner first. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose to ask the Committee to negative this and the succeeding clause for reasons which I have given. The Senate proposes to reduce the sealing fee from £5 to £3 and to increase the renewal fee from£5 to £12. It is impossible to make any estimate as to how this will work out on which we can place reliance, but I believe that it would mean a loss in revenue of over £2,000 a year. </para>

Can the Attorney-General see his way to accept a provision which would rectify matters so far as they are concerned ? I understand that a large number of persons are in this unfortunate position. I should like to see justice done to them. Their only fault is that they have not seen to the official registration of their patents according to law. I move - </para>

                        <para>- The particular kind of property is immaterial ; whether it is a patent or anything else, is of no .concern. We are dealing in the Bill only with the conditions under which patents may be granted, but the honorable member's proposal goes further. A man has a piece of property, and by his contract of service has to do a certain thing. That comes under the State law. I am not quite certain on the point, but if we agreed to such a provision as this we ought to make it reciprocal. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and it is wise to encourage them. We should obtain far more of that co-operation upon which society should be based, if employers recognised that a man, who has devised something which his pocket will not enable him to carry out, ought to be considered. If the honorable member will not press his proposed new clause, I will promise him to look into the matter, and determine whether on the merits something should not be done bv means of a specific Bill. </para>

In the United States of America the most humble man in a factory, if he shows any capacity to improve the machinery employed therein, has a room set apart for his use, and is given the assistance of others. Within a week very often he is running the business. In England such a man would be dismissed as dangerous. </para>

                        <para>- I know a man named Mann who was dismissed from a factory in England because he showed some ability. The manufacturer thought that there was danger of his competing against him. He went to the United States, and is now a partner in a big firm in Patterson, New Jersey. Years ago the proprietor of a large factory in England used to manufacture clothing for export to Australia. His Colonial agents wrote to him again and again urging him to make the trousers which he supplied, a little longer. As these representations were disregarded, the agent went Home, and told the manufacturer that the trouble was that Austratralians were about an inch taller than the average Englishman. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The reply of the manufacturer was, " The factory has been in existence for 200 years, and we have always cut our trousers the same length. We cannot make them any longer, but go back and endeavour to shorten the Australians." It is that sort of thing that is causing England to-day to be at the tail of the great economic and industrial race. In the United States and Germany, factory employes are encouraged to improve the machinery where they are employed, and that is why England today is running only third. It is a pity that the Government are not prepared to accept such a progressive and democratic proposition as this. </para>

                    <para>.- I am glad to have the assurance of the Attorney-General that this matter will be looked into. I have heard many complaints on the part of employes of the Railway Department of New South Wales in regard to this very question. I am speaking subject to correction, but I understand that all inventions on the part of employés have to be offered to the Department before they are patented, so that the Department may avail itself of them if it chooses to do so, and make any grant that it thinks adequate. I have heard of cases where the Department has granted £10 to an employé in respect of an invention that has saved it hundreds of pounds. The question is of great importance to the employés of the Railway Department of New South Wales, and I am sure that the Attorney-General will take action if he finds that something can be done. </para>

                <para class="block">Department of New South Wales. I know the case of a man employed in the New South Wales Railway Department who completed an invention which was the means of saving a large sum of money. He was taken off his regular work to supervise the installation ; but he was not allowed to claim any benefit ; and, when he went back to his regular work, his only reward was a reduction of 6d. a day in his pay. The worst feature was that the invention was practically claimed by his superior officers; and it was only years afterwards, when a Minister came into power who knew something of the matter, that justice was done. The Railway Department discourages inventions, with the result that employes, instead of taking out patents within the Commonwealth, go to America. We have been unable to induce the Commissioners to altar their policy; and I think that this is a matter to which the Attorney-General, who, I am sure, desires to encourage Australian invention, might turn his attention with a view to future legislation. </para>

                    <para>.- I have some personal knowledge of the ways of officials in the Railway and other Departments ; and the way in which the ingenious employes have been treated for many years is a standing disgrace. If, by any means, some of the superior officers, through whom all communications pass, obtain any knowledge of an invention they patent it, with the result that there are now many men who have made valuable discoveries, but who are simply waiting until they have saved enough to enable them to take out the patent elsewhere. I do not know whether I understand the honorable member far Corio, but I gathered from his interjection that, in his opinion, an employer has the right to the fruit of an employé's brain. I know that there are some of the employing class who have that idea; but I fancy we are too civilized now not to admit that, beyond engaging to do certain work, the employé is under no obligation. I know of several intelligent, smart men who are guarding secrets of their own, with a view to exploiting them to their own advantage in the future, simply because they receive no encouragement from the Railway, Department. </para>

                        <para>.- I am sure that we all owe some thanks to the officers of the House after sittings so long and arduous. I ask the Prime Minister whether he cannot give ten minutes to a motion setting forth the good work that has been done by the women voters in Australia, so that it may be sent Home as an example to those in the Old Land, and as an incentive to abolish the present barbaric franchise there. I feel sure that if the Prime Minister were to submit such a motion, it would be passed in a few minutes, with the assent of every member of the House. It is simply a record of the splendid work done in our community by the women voters; and I am sure that it could not fail to have a most desirable effect in Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>. - In reply to the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, I propose on Monday to take the Estimates; and, if time permit, the Bills of Exchange Bill, Officers Compensation Bill, and the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, roughly in the order in which they stand. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> will, of course, reply to the question of the honorable member for Lang. As to the suggestion of the honorable member for Melbourne, I may say that a similar request should be made in another place ; I am perfectly prepared to read most of the proposed motion as a statement which I believe to be true. The Leader for the Government in another place will take like action. For my own part; I cordially subscribe to the statement that -  this House testifies to the facts that after sixteen years' experience of Woman Suffrage in various parts of Australasia and nine years' experience in the Commonwealth, the reform has justified the hopes of its supporters. </para>
