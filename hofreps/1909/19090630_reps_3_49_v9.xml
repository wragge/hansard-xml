                    <para>.- Yesterday, while I was absent from the Chamber, having been called away shortly after the delivery of my speech, a certain statement was made regarding me, to which I take exception, and about which I wish to make a personal explanation. The honorable member for Adelaide is reported in to-day's <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> as having said of me that I would still be with the Federal Labour Party if it had put me into the Fisher Administration. Now, it is well known to many members of the party that I was not a candidate for a position in the Ministry, and stated so to every member of it who spoke to me on the subject. It is true that I allowed my name to remain on the list of candidates, but that was simply because I was approached on the morning of the election, and asked by two members of the party to do so. I had at the time made up my mind to retire from the party, one of mv reasons being - since the honorable member for Adelaide seems to wish to know them - that I find the Labour movement being made a cat's-paw by certain political adventurers, of whom the honorable member for Adelaide is regarded as a fair type by many members of his own party. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that we should have an explanation from the Treasurer as to certain items in the Bill upon which information is required. Although honorable members appear to think that only£100,000 is being asked for as an advance for the Treasurer, I would point out that he is really asking for£1  20,000,  because he is asking for  £20,000  to recoup the revenue. The sum of  £20,000  has been spent in connexion with various votes, and we are asked to repay this amount. Hitherto the rule has been to give the Treasurer a yearly advance of  £200,000.  I do not know that that sum has ever been exceeded. We are now being asked to vote, not the proportion of that sum which the period of two months bears to a whole year, but more than half the whole amount. We are entitled to some explanation of this request for £120,000. We should be told what the  £20,000  has been expended upon, and where the money was taken from. </para>

If. we shall be permitted in Committee to cover the whole range of the Bill, I shall be satisfied, but I am inclined to think that when we go into Committee we shall not be permitted to do more than discuss the particular item immediately before the Chair. It was for that reason that I rose to direct attention to the abnormal sum for which the Treasurer is asking in respect of his Advance Account. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that the. proposed vote of£1  20,000  in respect of the Treasurer's Advance is an enormous sum to intrust to a Minister, without having from him a statement as to the way in which it is to be applied. . It is a blind bandicoot method of finance. In other words, it suggests what used to prevail in New York, when everything was conducted on the " blind dog " system: While we have the greatest confidence in the Treasurer, it seems to me that as this House controls the public purse it should have from him a statement as to how this amount is to be expended before it is granted. </para>

                    <para>.- Yesterday afternoon I questioned the Treasurer as to the intention of the Government with regard to the date of the first payment of old-age pensions under the Federal system, and I do not think I shall be out of order in inquiring at this stage whether they intend to depart from the position they have taken up that the first payment cannot be made until the 29th July. After I spoke yesterday afternoon it was pointed out by a number of honorable members that even a. refusal to pay old-age pensions until fourteen days after the proclamation would entail serious hardship on many of the aged poor. The Treasurer, however, endeavoured to throw the responsibility on to the shoulders of others and adopted a most objectionable method of seeking to justify his position. He did not say whether the Government intended to try to make the first payment on the 14th July next, or to persist in their original intention to withhold it in five, out of the six States, until 29th July. He said that a great many papers had had to be prepared and circulated in connexion with the introduction of the new system, but did not definitely state whether or not the first payment could be made on 14th July. If it can be made then, it ought to be made. The Act has been passed for nearly twelve months, so that there has been ample time to carry out the preliminary work, </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that they would have made the first payment on 14th July. Those who have been fighting in this Parliament for the last five or six years for the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions have fully appreciated the unfortunate position of our aged poor, and certainly thought that, at the latest, the first payment would be made in the middle of next month. The Treasurer admitted yesterday that, on taking office, he simply allowed things to go on as he found them, and he gave no satisfactory reason why the first payment should not be made on the 14th of next month. I appeal to him to make every possible effort to relieve the sufferings of the aged poor by making the first payment on that date. </para>

                        <para>- Now is the time to raise it. One is not necessarily opposed to a Government when one declares that the Budget ought to be delivered before any grants are made by Parliament. We have been fighting for this for years. The Treasurer has had three weeks in which to make himself familiar with the necessities of the Commonwealth. If the Government have a policy - and we are told that they have had many Cabinet meetings - I should like the Treasurer to state why that question has not been discussed so that he could give the necessary information to Parliament before Supply is granted. A very large sum of money, presumably one-sixth of the whole of the requirements of the Commonwealth for the year, is asked for. If the Government can base their calculation upon last year's expenditure they should make a statement to satisfy Parliament that it is necessary to make these payments at once. I do not know why the Treasurer has not delivered his Budget, so that we might have had before us a full statement of the payments that are to be made, and so that the policy of the Government might be fully discussed. In that way there  would be a saving of time, and this money, if it is necessary, might be granted without undue debate. I presume the Treasurer will have something to say upon the large item of ^100,000 under the head of the Treasurer's Advance Account. Presumably that is one-sixth. If so, the total sum for the year for that purpose is to be £600,000. k Surely some statement ought to to be made upon that item before it is passed. </para>

                        <para>- I gave a good deal - all that I had to give. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has tried to make capital out of the fact that in the inauguration of old-age pensions a new departure is to be made all over Australia by making the first payment on the 29th July, instead of on the 15th, except in the case of Victoria.  where the fortnightly system is already in force. I have not altered the arrangement which was made before I took, office, and which I understood was the best that could be made. I am assured bv the Treasury officers1 that every effort will be made, but that it will take them all their time to, be ready to pay pensions on the 29th, except in Victoria, where they will pay on the 15th. I understood that the arrangement made by the previous Government was satisfactory. I am informed, although I have not seen the statement, that the Leader of the Opposition, when Treasurer, informed the press that it was impossible to do more than what he approved of, and what is now being carried out. No one ; would accuse the honorable member of not being anxious to expedite the matter. In fact, there is a consensus of opinion that there should be no delay in carrying out what is required by the law j and I must repudiate the suggestion that there is any desire to withhold -money from the old-age pensioners any longer than is absolutely necessary. The only difference will be that they will get two fortnights' payments on the 29th, and thereafter receive their pensions every fortnight. The Victorian people will receive theirs fortnightly from the start, but in New South Wales the pensions are now paid monthly., and I believe that is the case in Queensland, so that there will be no hardship on the people there, while the people of Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania, who have not received pensions before, will not, I suppose, be very much upset at having to wait until the 29th for the first payment, and receiv-ing then double the fortnightly amount. I am assured by the Department that the arrangement approved by the honorable member for Wide Bay, when Treasurer, was the best that could be made. I have not sought to upset it, and every one is working hard to carry it out. </para>

                        <para>- The criticism of the honorable member for Robertson would be very good if our system were on the lines that he suggests, but I am sure that he will not expect the present Government to alter the existing system, within a month. The system in force here is to  meet ordinarily towards the end of June, and the financial year ends on the 30th of that month. It is, therefore, impossible, unless we present Estimates without a knowledge of the revenue and expenditure for the previous year, to have them on the table when Parliament meets. </para>

                        <para>- Only the Estimates of the year just expiring were before the Department when I was preparing this Bill. We base our estimate for temporary Supply upon the vote given last year, and upon the expenditure, as far as we know it, up to the date when the Supply Bill is presented. Of course, if the financial year ended in April, and we met in June, six weeks or so after the end of the financial year, it would be possible to have the Estimates on the table when Supply was asked for, but even) then we should have to ask for Supply just the same. </para>

                    <para>. - I have a vivid recollection of passing items in Supply Bills last year, when, as a matter of fact, the money had all been spent. Half-a-dozen times the right honorable member for Swan took exception to such a method of procedure ; and the honorable member for Hume, who was Treasurer at the time, told us that it was some of the former gentleman's own accounts which had entailed the expenditure. The Bill before us teems with contingencies, reminding n:e very forcibly of a contractor's -extras after everything has been enumerated. At the end of the Bill there is a contingency vote of £i 20,000 ; and I should like to know whether that may be regarded as the finish of all contingencies. I may be a little suspicious ; but I want to be assured that the £100,000 down in the Bill under this heading is not to be used as a first instalment towards the cost of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline> From the experience I have gained here, it is evident that it is possible for the Treasurer to spend money in almost any direction, and then come and be indemnified by the House. Is any of the £[100,000 to be spent towards the purchase of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought ?</inline></para>

                    <para>.- Under cover of this Supply Bill various suggestions have been made to the Government, and I should like to add one in connexion with the payment of old-age pensions. Honorable members have expressed a de. sire that the pensions shall be paid fortnightly ; and I presume we are agreed that these payments should be prompt. In this connexion I desire to call the attention not '  only  of the Treasurer,' but of the Minister of Home Affairs, to the fact that, while it may be easy to pass a Bill providing for fortnightly payments, it is quite another matter to have the money conveyed fortnightly to the unfortunate recipients. The method of payment is, to my mind, suggestive of danger. In the first place, the services of post-office officials are availed of, although we know that, at the present time, they are simply overweighted with extraneous duties, especially in the metropolitan and larger centres. </para>

                        <para>- I happen to know that this extraneous work is used as an excuse for not carrying out the ordinary postal duties ; and yet we. find that, say, in Sydney and Parramatta, the post-office organization is to be availed of, although the payment of the pensions under such circumstances must congest the departmental business. The average pensioners are old and infirm, and, not being smart commercial people, they are very cautious and slow in the signing of documents ; and, if there are  two payments  in each month in the more populous centres, we shall find the ordinary business of the post-office retarded. While I appreciate the idea of fortnightly payments, I must point out the difficulties which the Minister of Home Affairs, particularly, will have to provide for in the shape of additional accommodation. If, in the Sydney or Parramatta centres, there are 500 or 600 pensioners, the payment of a very small proportion of them might be sufficient to cause a congestion of business. The 'same sum has not to be paid to each ; and the official, like a bank official, will have to exercise extra precaution until he has become familiar with the recipients. These, of course, are matters which can give rise to no party feeling ; and I merely mention them in order to show that, if proper facilities are not provided, fortnightly payments cannot be carried out. Within a month from now there will be hundreds of complaints from different parts of Australia, alleging that the payments cannot be made. Why heap this extra work on the postal officials? It has come to my knowledge that, throughout the Commonwealth, they are now clamouring to have extraneous duties, such as the conduct of electioneering business, removed from their shoulders, and it is impossible for them to do' extra work. Responsible officers in the Department, such as would be chosen for the administration of the Pensions Act, have already too much, to do. I think that the Government will speedily find that the provision already made is insufficient, and I hope that it will make further provision for the payment of pensions under a proper and efficient system. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not agree with the honorable member for Robertson that a Budget statement should precede the introduction of a Supply Bill of this nature ; but there is an objection to the Bill which is worthy of some consideration. The Government asks fc r Supply for two months, and Parliament, by granting the request, will dispossess itself of the power to enforce the delivery of the Budget within that time. It will be wholly for the Minister to' say when the Budget shall be delivered. The delivery of the Budget is of concern, not merely to this Parliament, but also to the Parliaments of the States, which are now in session, and desirous of learning their financial positions. It is impossible for them to give consideration to the financial question until they have received from the Treasurer certain information which is generally  made public for the first time in his Budget speech. Therefore, to defer for two months the delivery of the Budget will seriously inconvenience the States as well as the Commonwealth. It is for that reason that, last night, I voted for an amendment which, had it been agreed to, would have reduced our grant from two to one month's Supply. Those who supported the amendment were contending that Parliament should retain control in respect to the delivery of the Budget. The Government, however, secured a majority for its proposal, and the Bill has been introduced. In my opinion, the House has unwisely given away its control of the Budget for too long a period. With regard to the payment of old-age pensions, the matters raised by the honorable member for Dalley deserve the earnest consideration of the Treasurer, who will be wise if he deals with them straight away. The officials of the Post Office, particularly in the large centres of population, already complain of the large amount of work they have to do. They say that it is only by working overtime that they can cope with the postal work alone. In these centres the work created by the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act will be particularly heavy, and the postal officials will find it practically impossible to perform it. Therefore extra provision .must be made. The honorable member for Dalley has also drawn attention to the want of proper accommodation in the post-offices for the paying of pensions. A large number of post-offices were built many years ago, and the increase of population has made their accommodation too small, even for the present convenience of the officials, and the public, for which they transact, postal and telegraphic business. Many post-offices are often congested with business at the present time, and will require to be greatly enlarged if the paying of pensions is to be "done within their walls. Regarding the payment of these pensions semi-monthly, I " would point out that it has recently been represented to me that in country districts it would often be more convenient for pensioners to be paid monthly instead of semimonthly, because many of them live at considerable distances from the places where the payments are made, and it is difficult for them to travel to those places. A number of them would, I understand, like the present system of paying monthly to continue. I suggest that the pensions should be payable semi-monthly, which would convenience pensioners in the cities, and, perhaps, the larger part of the country pensioners, allowing applicants who wish to be paid monthly to make a request to that effect. In my opinion, elasticity in the administration of the Act will meet a large number of very deserving cases. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with the last two speakers that the postal officials have not sufficient time to administer the Old-age Pensions Act. Neither do I think that the administration can be successfully carried on by the clerks of petty sessions. In the large centres, these officers, in New South Wales at any rate, have many duties to perform. Sometimes they have courts to attend each day, and they also act as Crown lands agents, and in other capacities. They have not time to give personal attention to the payment of old-age pensions. I have heard that, in one case, one of these officers had to keep pensioners, who had travelled miles to see him, waiting from some time in the morning until 5 o'clock in the afternoon before he could give them his attention. Applicants and pensioners have to be given information, and, in many cases, instructed how to fill in their forms, and otherwise comply with the Act. All this takes time, and the work is too much to add to the duties of officers who have already a 'great deal to do. Some clerks of petty sessions are constantly travelling, being in a different town each day of the week. _ They, of course, could not attend to the payment of old-age pensions. Therefore the administration of the Act is likely to break down unless other provision is made for it. I hope that the Treasurer will give consideration to these difficulties, and endeavour to make better provision than now seems likely to be made. I have no desire to increase the expense of administration, but it is necessary to make some alteration. </para>

                        <para>- I was going to mention that. The State Government specially rented a building in Parramatta, and pensions were paid at the Bank of New South Wales. That bank's public chamber is at least as large as the public portion of the local post-office, but it was found impossible to accommodate there the ordinary customers of the bank and old-age pensioners as well, and therefore a building next door had to be rented to provide a special chamber for the payment of pensions. I have seen that chamber so crowded during the early days of a month that many applicants were being forced to wait outside. The ordinary business of the Post Office is sufficient to keep it busy. The latest proposal on the part of the Department of Home Affairs is that a small room at the rear of the building should be utilized for paying the old-age pensions. In order to reach it, the pensioners will have to pass along a lane which is the only means of access for those carrying mail matter into the Post Office, and I venture to say that, when the first payment is made, there will be a hopeless congestion. Parramatta is the centre of a big district. Pensioners living in Granville, Seven Hills, Baulkham' Hills, Toongabbie, and places on the southern and western lines, and at Auburn and Rookwood on the suburban line, will have to go to Parramatta to receive their pensions, and the congestion must be accentuated by the arrangement for the payment of the pensions fortnightly instead of monthly. Grave complaint has also been made as to the impossibility of receiving prompt attention at the hands of the clerks of petty sessions in the various centres. In some towns in New South Wales the clerk of petty sessions is a very hard-worked individual. In Parramatta, he discharges not only the duties of clerk of petty sessions, but of Crown lands agent, registrar of. births, marriages, and deaths, registrar of the small debts court, registrar of the District Court, and of State electoral officer. I do not know how many other offices, he fills.  His  office is not open to the public before 10 a.m., and as the Court opens at that hour, it is often impossible for applicants for old-age pensions to secure his attention until the Court adjourns at 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. Such a state of affairs would naturally be inconvenient to the youngest and strongest in our midst, and, having regard to the age and infirmity of applicants for old-age pensions, we must recognise that, instead of their being subjected to inconvenience, they should receive special consideration, in order that the obtaining of pensions may be made as easy as possible for them. For that reason, I hold that the Treasurer and the Minister of Home Affairs might well give more attention to this matter, and more especially to the position in large centres. I regret that the Government have seen fit to dispense with the old-age pensions office in Parramatta, and feel sure that they will find it necessary to bake it over. As it is, they have allowed the State to retain possession of one of the finest officers under the control of the Old-age Pensions Department in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- That would apply to several other districts in Australia. If new officers are to be appointed and specially detailed in connexion with this work the expense will be considerable. I am not going to say that what the honorable member suggests may not be necessary in the case of Parramatta as well as some other towns, since I have not inquired fully into the matter. I certainly think that the criticism offered by the honorable member for Dalley as to the way in which the work of postal officials will be tied up is quite legitimate. But I fail to see how the difficulty is to be overcome. In South Australia, at all events, prior to Federation, police officers used to represent the Government in many matters, such as the collection of statistics, the compilation of rolls, -and other duties such as I gather from the remarks of the honorable member for Bowden are now discharged by Clerks of Courts in New South Wales. The police of South Australia used to be Poo Bahs of the State. With the establishment of Federation and the transfer of many State Departments to the Commonwealth, however, the postal officials became the Poo Bahs and the policeman is now the Lord High Everything Else. Commonwealth postal officers have, however, to attend to electoral, savings bank, and old-age pensions work, and as our functions increase they will have still more work to do. We shall have to recognise sooner or later that either the postal staff must be largely increased to enable this work to be coped with, or we shall have to appoint separate officers to do the outside work that has been placed upon their shoulders. It is unfair to charge the Postmaster-General!s Department with the increased expenditure rendered necessary to enable it to cope with the extraneous work that has been placed upon its staff. That fact is often overlooked. We hear honorable members criticise the increased cost of the Department under Federation, but it is not recognised that much of the work formerly done by State officials in other Departments is now discharged by postal officers. If we are to pile these extra duties on them, we must be prepared to increase their numbers, or else we must relieve them of some of these extra duties and appoint special officers to attend to them. </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable member will find that in many cases it has not been arranged. I presume that he has in mind what has been done in regard to the principal centres of population. The difficulties to which reference has been made, however, arise chiefly in connexion with comparatively small post offices in charge of one officer, who is the sole representative of the Commonwealth in the district, and has also to attend to savings bank and other work on behalf of the State. My point is that we must be prepared to pay for this extra, work. There has been some criticism of the statement of the Treasurer as to the date when the Budget will be delivered. It seems to . me that the difficulty that always arises in this connexion is due to the fact that we have fixed upon an arbitrary date for the closing of. the financial year, which does not fit in with, our parliamentary arrangements. The  30th  June has no special virtue. Why should we not say that the financial year should close on  31st  March. Parliament seldom meets before May. </para>

                        <para>- If the right honorable gentleman, is going to wait until we meet in the Federal Capital before he brings about any reform he will only realize the expectations of the people of Australia generally in regard to the progressive character of the present Administration. Is there any reason why he should not disappoint them and make an alteration now in regard to the date on which the financial year shall close? If  31st  March were fixed upon, the Government would be able when Parliament met in May to bring down their policy statement, with a complete knowledge of the financial arrangements necessary for the ensuing twelve months. The existing arrangements worked very well when the State Parliaments used to meet on the  1st  September and close two or three months later, but since the Commonwealth Parliament meets about May, and continues in session until December, I am certain that the pressure would be considerably reduced if the financial year closed on  31st  March. Is there any objection to the adoption of such a course ? I am sure -it would facilitate the work of Parliament and result in an. all-round saving. </para>

                        <para>- Is it not an indication that the Budget should be delivered at the earliest possible moment? The right honor able member last night took exception to my statement that he .should have no difficulty in arranging to deliver the Budget statement before the end of July. I still hold that view. There was never a time when the finances of the Commonwealth were better understood than they are now. The scrupulous economy necessarily exercised by the Treasurer of the day has caused expenditure to be kept down, and there should be no difficulty in submitting the Budget at an early date. Apart altogether from the desirableness or otherwise of granting two months' Supply, the Treasurer must recognise that it is his duty to the Parliament and to the country to submit the Budget at the earliest possible moment. Some honorable members have displayed remarkable anxiety in regard to the payment of old-age pensions, although not long since they declared that it was impossible for the federal Parliament to grant them. We are delighted to know that they will be paid as from 1st July. The late Administration had made arrangements to pay them at the earliest possible moment, in the middle of the month, if possible, and, if that was not possible in all the States, in as many of the States as possible. That was the understanding before I left office, and all our efforts were being made in that direction. Although under the Act authority is given to appoint a 'Commissioner and  Deputy  Commissioner of old-age pensions at a salary of ^1,000 for the former, and a considerable sum for the latter, the late Government, and myself, as Treasurer, administering the Act, thought it advisable not to make fresh appointments to those positions. We appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allen,</inline> the Secretary to the Treasury, as Commissioner, and by that means saved <inline font-style="italic">£800</inline> a year. We also saved a considerable sum by appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Collins, the Accountant of the Treasury, as  Deputy  Commissioner. By that act the Government saved, not only a considerable sum of money, but also a great deal of time, and obviated a great deal of inconvenience. Whatever other appointments we might have made, I believe there would have been confusion, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allen</inline> had had considerable experience of the Victorian system, and was able to apply, it to the service of the Commonwealth, and so the old-age pensions system has been inaugurated 'with an exceedingly, small amount of friction, considering the difficulties to be faced, and the great area to be covered. A material alteration was also made regarding applications for pensions. The idea in the Act was that pensions should not be* paid until the applications had been approved by the Commissioner himself. It was felt by the late Government that it would be much better to make the questions put to applicants more stringent than usual, and to enable the Commissioner to pay on the authority of the magistrate. That arrangement effects a great saving of time, and? avoids inconvenience, because with, the declaration of the magistrate that the form is in order, and that the applicant is entitled to a pension, the Commonwealth can at once pay. That arrangement is a great improvement on what was previously proposed. I wish to ask the Treasurer whether, on the broad principle of this Bill, he may not be doing something that he will regret, in asking for two months' Supply. If the Government intend to introduce financial reforms, are they not committing themselves to pay all services for two months, even if they are out of date, or are to be .reformed out of existence? I imagine from what the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and other Ministers have said, that they intend to bring about great reforms in the Departments, and also to revolutionize the defence of the Commonwealth. I do not know whether that is to be done in one, two, or three months, or in as many years. </para>

The Treasurer has asked the honorable member for Boothby to defer his question in regard to the sewering of Parliament House until we reach the Department of Home Affairs ; but I am afraid that, if we do so, we shall be told that the item has already been passed.

I have just been informed by the  Speaker  that the State Government of Victoria carried out the sewerage works in this building, and that the Commonwealth pays 4 per cent, on the cost. I find that last year the vote for Contingencies under the heading House of Representatives amounted to £1,530, and honorable members are now asked to vote £250, or one-sixth. The items are set forth in the Estimates for the year which is now expiring. </para>

                    <para>. -I  see that we are again asked to vote an appropriation for advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. This question was threshed out at the end of last session, whejn a large proportion of the members of the present Government were adverse to the passing of any vote for the purpose. What does the vote mean ? It means that the people of Great Britain, Europe, and elsewhere, are being hoodwinked by the Commonwealth Government. We all know the great resources of Australia; but, what is the use of telling a man that there is plenty of food in a restaurant if he is unable to enter the restaurant in order to obtain it? About£2,000 has been spent in filling the newspapers of Great Britain with lies, and telling the workers that, if they come out to Australia - whether they be ironworkers, carpenters, or other mechanics - they can obtain regular work at an increased wage. We hold out hopes to them of improving their position, while, at the same time, we know that almost every one who has been induced to come here has had a contrary experience. Under this vote, we have had beautiful pictures of the agricultural products of Australia advertised in newspapers abroad. I may be told that the party to which I belong carried out a precisely similar policy ; but it must , not be forgotten that my party; followed a common-sense method, proposing, as it did, to make arrangements by which immigrants could obtain possession of the resources of the Commonwealth. The present Government, supported bv men who, we are told, have a " vested interest " in the country, are said to be doing all they possibly can to throw open Australia to the people of Europe : they advertise the fact that any agricultural product can be grown here. However, we find that if farmers from the Old Country come here, their experience is that looking for suitable land is like looking for a needle in a bundle of hay.I ask the Treasurer, or the Minister of External Affairs, whether he can point to any part of Australia, within reasonable distance of a market, where intending immigrants could start farming at a reasonable rate? 'The question has been discussed time and again in. the House; and yet we go on fooling the people still further. Do Ministers intend to open up the resources of the country before inducing people to come here, or are they going to follow the old plan, of bringing immigrants to particular metropolitan centres, with the inevitable result of reducing the wages rate? I know that, considering the majority behind the Government, it is a matter of impossibility </para>

                        <para>- I am pleased that the Prime Minister has now come into the chamber, because I have a vivid recollection that, during the latter part of last session, he stated that he had endeavoured  to get the Premiers of the States to make the resources of the country available to immigrants. No member has done more in that direction ; but he has admitted that the State Premiers would not assist him. He was willing, as Prime Minister of the Common wealth, to spend money in advertising the resources of Australia, but the only outcome of what was done was that certain persons were brought here by means of false promises. I ask him, therefore, if it would not be futile to continue this work? If he were to tell me that it is the intention of the Government to introduce, in the near future, a land tax for the purpose of breaking up the large estates, and making land available for settlement, I should at once sit down ; but as he has recently charged the Labour party with supporting what he calls extreme legislation, I have not much hope that he will do that. Yet be knows that it is cruel in the extreme to invite immigrants from Europe to take advantage of our resources when those resources are not available to them. It was the reverse of pleasurable to me last session tq read in newspapers which were favorable to an immigration policy admissions to the effect that we could get thousands of immigrants more than we have land for. Does the Prime Minister, in view of the impossibility of getting the State Premiers to help in making land available, intend to introduce a Federal Bill which will open up our resources to immigrants? As a very minor light, I hardly expect to receive a reply from him. But I believe that, bad as he is, he has certain good intentions, and that if his position in the present Administration were strong enough, he would make some proposal of that kind. Since our past advertising has brought here boilermakers, engineers, stonemasons, and workers in the iron trades, of whom only a few could obtain remunerative employment, is it not high time to stop spending money until we have made proper provision for those whom we seek to attract? </para>

                </interjection><para>Mr.MATHEWS.- Yes; and Victoria was offering large areas on easy terms of selection. But members of Parliament, the newspaper writers, and the man in the street, all know that it is worse than a crime to ask immigrants to come to this State to take up land now. Even the Conservative press admits this. That great journal, the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which has now the honorable member for Parramatta under its thumb, admits it. The honorable member used to charge me with being under the thumb of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> but that was not so. That newspaper has never supported me, and never will. It is said that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is becoming a supplement to the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> I do not say that that is true, though there is certainly a tendency in that direction. But, much as we may condemn its dirty methods in criticising politicians, we must admit its greatness. It has pointed out to the people of Victoria, and to the members of this Parliament, that it is criminal to bring persons here for whom there is no land. The Sydney daily newspapers have made the same admission. There is, of course, land which is not in occupation, but it is such as no man could earn a living upon, or so far from, markets that it would be cruel to ask those who do not understand our climate and conditions to take it up. As an Australian, I take an interest in these problems. I know that, unless the agricultural areas of Victoria are opened up, the cities will suffer. But I believe that there are little angels sitting above, and lesser angels below, who will look after the interests of those in the agricultural districts. My principal reason for speaking on this subject is that I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that the exhibition in the Old World of pictures showing the productiveness of this country, its great buildings, and its vast foundries, will bring here men for whom there will be no employment. Already immigrants have come to electorates like mine, and that of the honorable member for Dalley, who have made the competition of the artisans there keener. Their coming has reduced the quantity of work available, and, in the near future, must bring about a reduction of wages, too. I do not wish to see those whom I represent injured in this way. The exhibition of pictures, and the glowing advertisements of agents, will attract to Australia persons who naturally wish to improve their condition, and who think that, as this is a new country, its resources must be as described. Had the legislation which the Fisher Government wished to introduce  been passed, the country would be what it is being described ; but those necessary reforms have yet to be put into operation. I know of three families who immigrated to New South Wales, and thai came to Victoria, finally returning to the Old Country, some by the steamer in which they came out, and some by the next one. Apart altogether from the cruelty of inducing people to come to Australia by means of false advertisements,, we ought in the interests of the Commonwealth itself to put an end to a system that cannot redound to our credit. After we have prepared our house we should invite people to come and occupy it. If we do that, we shall do well. I should like this item to be rejected, but I suppose that the free majority behind the Government will carry it. I trust that the Ministry will take precautions to prevent a recurrence of the cruel experience of people who have come to our shores in the circumstances I have indicated, and that they will see that men already in Australia are not robbed of the little employment offering by reason of people being attracted to Australia by false advertisements inserted in newspapers in the Old World. </para></speech>

                    <para>.- I cannot agree with the honorable member who has just resumed his seat, and who, I think, completely overlooked the fact that every man who comes to this country offers in himself a market for the produce of those already here. If we wish to maintain the White Australia about which the Labour part\, are always clamouring  on the platform, we must do what we can to populate the Commonwealth with people of our own race, and so save it from aggression on the part of the people of overcrowded Eastern countries. I am1 glad that we have <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> power a Government that will probably exercise a close scrutiny over the manner in which amounts are expended in connexion with this advertising account. I have in mind a certain bargain that was made by the Government that has just retired from office, a bargain which  1  hope will not be imitated by Governments to come. IT" there be any possibility of such a bargain being repeated, it will be necessary to institute a Committee of Public Accounts, such as exists in connexion with the House of Commons. That Committee is of a non-party character, and possesses power to examine accounts, scrutinize all papers, call for witnesses and examine every contract entered into by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I have objected to bargains entered into by Governments controlled by the Labour party, and I arn going to object now to a bargain entered into by the late Labour Government. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports said that an outrage was done to the workers already in Australia by distributing in England false advertisements as to the prosperity of Australia which induced immigrants to come here before land or occupation was provided for them. </para>

I wish to know for what the extra£50 was really paid. The ex-Minister of External Affairs is now in the Chamber. Unfortunately, when this bargain was first published he was in Papua. Perhaps he will tell us why the late Government paid the proprietor of the <inline font-style="italic">Clarion</inline> £50 over and above the face value of the 7,000 copies which they purchased from him. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member claims, because of that vote, that he is absolved from all responsibility for his actions as a Minister. It is an easy way to avoid answering the question ! The confidence that my honorable friends have in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bedford's</inline> capacity is not shaken bv the wonderful good which the circulation of his paper abroad is likely to do in bringing about foreign immigration to Australia, for I understand that they have since nominated him for a Labour seat in order that he may denounce the labour project which, as editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Clarion,</inline> he was so anxious to promote. </para>

                        <para>- He is nominated for ballot. I confess that some of these Labour methods of recognising the signal "worth" of their supporters do not commend themselves to my judgment. The statements that have been made this afternoon by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports would come more gracefully from a member of a party that was consistently trying to keep out immigration from Australia. Such a policy, I think is suicidal, but if my honorable friends wish to talk ordinary clap-trap as to the way in which immigrants must interfere with those already in the country, I say that their own Government ought to have -kept clear of any such contract as that to which I have referred. </para>

                    <para>.- I am astounded at the attempt made by the honorable member for Wentworth to attack a man of the calibre of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Randolph</inline> Bedford. Certainly, the honorable member admitted that he had not read the article in the issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Clarion,</inline> purchased by the late Government. Had he done so, it would have improved any brains that he may possess. Even with the power of the purse behind him, the honorable member will never occupy the position that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bedford</inline> will hold, not only in the hearts of the people of Australia, but in the literary world wherever the English language is spoken. I did not know that the late Government had purchased a certain number of copies of the <inline font-style="italic">Clarion,</inline> but if, after perusing the article, they saw fit to enter into the contract referred to, I think they did well. I have read the article, and do not hesitate to say that never before has an attempt been made to enable such a publication to be read by people of many nations. It was translated into several European languages, with the result that when we have a chance of unlocking  the lands of Australia, many desirable immigrants will be attracted to our shores. I remember the statement made by the present Prime Minister some time ago, that it was our duty first of all to find land for the people already here, and then, and only then, for any white men who might choose to come here. No one will deny that the State land laws are infamous. The honorable member for Adelaide will bear out my statement that recently there were no fewer than 1,000 applications for 127 allotments a little outside of Adelaide, and that hundreds of people had to be turned awa)' disappointed. The honorable member for Wentworth dishonoured himself and his education when he attacked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Randolph</inline> Bedford as he did. He says that that gentleman endeavoured to stand as a Liberal. How could he do so when he was a Labour man ? </para>

                        <para>- That is a petty quibble, which is unworthy of the honorable member.  .1  am sorry to have to say that, because I love the honorable member for the good work that we have done' shoulder to shoulder. I notice that under the Department of External Affairs, Administrative Division, the contingencies total  £488  more than the salaries. I always have a suspicion about contingencies ; and I would like to see the items put as clearly as they would be in the balance-sheet of any financial institution. Under " Executive Coun cil," the contingencies are only ,£30, as compared with £135 for salaries; but for the Offices of the Commonwealth in London, the contingencies are again larger than the salaries. That brings me to the proposed vote of £2,000 for advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. I indorse every remark made by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, although the honorable member who preceded me criticised his statements. ' It is well known that men have gone from here to the Old Country painting such pictures of the conditions in Australia that the only word that can fitly describe them is "liar.'''- Men are induced to come here, and find they cannot get land. I indorse the sentiment previously uttered by the Prime Minister, that we must make the land available first for our own people, and then, when they are settled, open our arms in wide welcome to any member of the white race who will come here. Mir. Randolph Bedford is well known, not only here, but in Great Britain, as a litterateur. He has published three books there, and has written a play called " White Australia," which I a'dvise the honorable member for Went worth to see. The one note pervading that play is "The land for the people." In the Northern Territory, the vile system of land tenure that we have copied from Great Britain is in full force. In fact, throughout Australia, one cannot take a journey by any railway without* seeing large tracts of unused land. The Commonwealth or the States, or the municipalities, as representing the people, should have the right to resume land at the value which the owner would put upon it, provided that he is willing to pay rates and taxes based upon that valuation. That would prevent him from robbing the community, as it has too frequently been robbed in the past. If the Government will introduce a land tax which will permit the land to be given to the people, they will have the support, not only of their own followers,* but also of this party, for that is a plank in our platform. I shall gladly give my vote for such a measure, if the Government have the courage to introduce it. If, however, they think that they are only going to mark time on that question, honorable members in this Chamber,' and the people outside, will not permit them. I care little who are on the Treasury bench, so long as they bring in good measures ; and if the present Government will introduce measures that </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members should not take the honorable member for Wentworth seriously. He seldom takes things seriously himself ; and in this matter he has followed the old game of drawing a red herring across the track, in order to divert attention from an important matter in which he knows that honorable members on this side take a serious interest. It is evident that the Government are continuing to expand £1,000 u month, or £12,000 a year, on advertising, and it is about time we knew what sort of advertisements they are issuing. I have had a great deal of evidence that the money is being spent in such a way as really to degrade Australia, in the eyes of the people of the Old World. Nothing madder could be imagined than for the Parliament of the Commonwealth to spend money to do an injury to the country whose interests it is supposed to look after. Through being connected with a very large organization, which has its membership principally in country districts, and which covers the whole of Australia, I have special opportunities of knowing the effect of the advertisements on those who are brought to Australia by their agency. The slate of the labour market is a serious matter to that organization, and we have opportunities and machinery for collecting information that no Commonwealth Department possesses, or has attempted to provide. There are many hundreds, and even thousands of people, brought to Australia by the lying advertisements that have been circulated. The worst offender is the New South Wales Government, but Queensland is about as bad, and apparently the Commonwealth has been helping. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable  member  must have great faith in me if he thinks I can extract any information from the Minister. The whole House has failed so far to get any information out of the Government, except a small explanation of the item of " Contingencies." It has been pointed out before that the term is very misleading, and some change ought to be made in the method at present followed by the Departments. We cannot draw from the Minister a statement of what the Government propose to do with regard to advertising the Commonwealth. The present Prime Minister, when he was in different company, put forward a policy which we could not complain of. He said' that openings on the land ought first to be provided, but he is in new company now. He is in the company of those who support what has been taking place, particularly in New South Wales. The whole thing is most degrading. Thousands of people are being brought to Australia, and those who have any chance of doing so get away back again at once, and tell the truth to the people of the Old World, while those who have to stay here write to their friends at Home and warn them not to come to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, they are men whom the money of the people of Australia has been spent in helping to bring out. The foreign consuls in Sydney dare not speak out publicly ; but I know that men who cannot speak a .word of English have been induced to come to New South Wales, and have gone to the consuls begging to be sent back to their own country again, as they were unable to get any work. It is a mean, cruel, and outrageous thing to bring such mer. here, and no man with a heart would be a party to it. It could only be done by men like <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur,</inline> who poses as  president  of the Australian Immigration League, and has published advertisements all over the Continent in the languages of the various European countries which lead the people to suppose that he is  president  of a republic. Those advertisements induce men to come here, and they think that they are sure to find plenty of work when they arrive. There is also evidence in the city of Sydney that girls who have been brought out as domestics have been driven to ruin, and on to the streets of Sydney. The Government have spent money to help to bring that about. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur</inline> is somewhere in England now. He was notorious in Australia as the man who cared nothing for the truth. Of course there is a great game behind it all. Not long ago, in a case in the Police Court at Orange, evidence was given that a man who was brought out as an immigrant had received for his work the magnificent wage of 2s. a week. The honorable member for Wentworth, in his characteristic ignorance of what he is talking about, says that every immigrant will be an additional consumer, and so create a market. What sort of a market does a man present who earns 2s. a week? This man, I may say, had a very liberal employer, because, after five weeks, the wage was raised voluntarily to five shillings. He found out, however, that others in the district were getting i os. a week, and he sued his employer for that amount ; but the employer engaged a lawyer, and the man " went down," because of his agreement to take 2s. There is a bureau in Sydney which brings out misled domestic servants, whose references are held until they promise to go to some mistress at Potts Point, who starves her servants, and so forth, and for whom no Australian girl would work. We have the admission that in the case of New South Wales, poor men are purposely selected because they will not be "too particular" when they land here. The Government of New South Wales, composed as it is of the same crowd as that supporting the Commonwealth Government, are spending £25,000 a year in this direction, and that is quite enough to kill the prospects of the country. No doubt we shall have to honour the -contracts for advertisements, but the Government ha.ve control of the contents, and it would be infinitely wiser to advertise warning people against the misleading statements of the States' authorities. In New South Wales more immigrants have been brought in than it has been possible to absorb, and many have gone to New Zealand or elsewhere. One person told me that in nine miles he met thirty immigrants on tramp, who could not find any work to do, and these men have been living on the hospitality of residents in the country districts. What sort of a market is a. man. who has to beg his bread? It is denied that artisans are brought out, but we all know well that such is the case, and the worst offender is New South Wales, with Queensland as good second fiddle. I have in my possession a letter from Queensland, which shows that I am now stating the exact facts. It is all very well for those who are living comfortably, like the honorable member for Wentworth- </para>

                        <para>- I trust that, like the Treasurer himself, I have some human sympathy, and I protest against the misleading of people who, in consequence of their disappointment, must denounce Australia, and warn their friends not to come to a country in which the lands are all monopolized. The fault lies in the disgracefully bad management of the land laws, and I hear no suggestion by the Government by way of remedy. At the proper time, I shall show that the Government have dropped the old plank of the Liberal  party,  which provides for a White Australia, and that they do not propose to touch the land by means of taxation. Before we pass this item, we ought to know exactly what is proposed to be done. I have investigated this matter, and I am anxious to see Australia filled with a white race, but it is no use bringing men out here to starvation and degradation, and thus doing a direct injury to the country. The Fisher Government definitely stated that they were not going to spend any of this money, and, of course, I do not know- what they did do, <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> because they had no time in which to prove  themselves. The complaint about circulating a very excellent production is somewhat extraordinary from one who believes in expending money in advertising Australia, and supposing the cost was £50 more than the proper and usual charge - which I do not suppose it would be - the complaint only shows a lack of sincerity. It would  be  far better to save this£12,000, and utilize it in the development of the Northern Territory when we get control of it. It is known that numbers of the best people will come here, under proper circumstances, though, as I have already indicated, many have gone away, some to New Zealand, and other parts of the world, in the first ship they could get. The proposed expenditure is an absolute waste of money. </para>

                        <para>- The advertising is only doing harm, because we all know that Victoria has not room for its own people. In fact, it would appear that there is room only for sheep, and the mismanagement suggests that the government of the country is by sheep's heads. Victoria is not doing so much in the way of misleading advertisements as are New South Wales and Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- Ministers are not allowed to explain. Either their explanations will not bear examination, or they have none to give. In Queensland, under the immigration system, men and women have been brought out who can get neither work nor land, and are dependent on the well-known hospitality of the residents. In this respect, however, as I said before, New South Wales is the worst offender,' and we ought to know what the plans of the Government are in this connexion. </para>

                        <para>- The action taken by the States is bad enough, and we ought not to follow their example. In any case, we ought to be honest, and not mislead the people abroad. When an immigrant comes to New South Wales, he is sent to work on shares, and this is known to represent one of the grossest forms of sweating. There is not the slightest chance of their obtaining Land, because there are hundreds of applicants for each block; and on the share system, with the keen competition, the percentage of profit is very low. The late Government were removed from office because they proposed to tax the land - because the big land monopolists would not permit a graduated land tax to be imposed. However that may be. the Government have control of the statements made in advertisements in various parts of the Old World, and, with some wise legislation on the part of the States, I am sure that Australia could absorb millions. Queensland and Western Australia have done more in the work of immigration than any of the other States, but the fact remains that people are now coming here who cannot find employment. That, of course is a very serious matter for Australia, and we ought to have some statement from the Government as to whether the expenditure in advertising is to be continued. I have no hesitation in saying that some of the advertisements I have seen are absolutely false. A few years ago an immigration bureau in London on behalf of Victoria did some advertising, and, on investigating the matter, I found that it was published that 500 carpenters were wanted at Alexandra, whereas there were not 500 people in the whole district. That is the sort of silly statement that is made by the State authorities. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing I could say would induce the Treasurer to alter the Bill. It has been proved that statements have been made, regarding New South Wales conditions, which  were  known to be false. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur,</inline> the head of the Immigration League there, admitted that he had made statements which he knew to be wrong. That was so notorious that it is  not  necessary to prove it. Of course, the Common wealth is not responsible for that. I instanced what the States have done only because of the mischief that has occurred. We should not be a party to increasing it. I do not say that the Commonwealth Government has published misleading advertisements.

                        <para>- It was responsible for permitting what was done, and hiding behind a private man. Some of our money might well be spent in warning the public against untruthful advertisements such as have been published. We are not responsible for what the States have done, but we are responsible for what the Commonwealth does. I do not say that our advertisements have done the harm which the State agitation has caused. Of course, some of those who have come here have found positions, but it is, nevertheless, cruel to induce immigration for which we have not sufficient room. We ought to welcome men to Australia as comrades, not as competitors, and we shall be able to do so if, by wise legislation, we make opportunities for ten times as many as are now coming here. I do not object to expenditure to assist immigration, but I object to advertising which is misleading as to our conditions. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members who have spoken on this question complain, first, that the resources of Australia are being advertised, and, secondly, that what is being done is ineffective. Last session we heard something about the purchase of a certain number of copies of the <inline font-style="italic">Clarion,</inline> because they contained illustrative and descriptive matter setting forth the resources of the Commonwealth.  1  did not see the publication, but I understand that the work was well done.

                        <para>- In that case, the honorable member authorized the purchase either to encourage or to discourage immigration. Similarly the last Deakin Government subsidized the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> proprietary for certain articles, ostensibly written by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr., Renard,</inline> but actually by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fox,</inline> who, less open than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Randolph</inline> Bedford, had substituted for his own name a French translation of it. All I have to say about the proposed vote is that it. is altogether too small to be effective, if the intention is to direct a  strong  current of immigration to Australia. Of course, if the money is to be voted merely to subsidize smart journalists, the sooner we know it the better. An annual expenditure of ,£1.2,000, however, is not enough to do what it costs Canada ^£200, 000 to do. </para>

                        <para>- We have been told that the information regarding our resources which has been prepared for advertising purposes is to be translated into many languages. I do not recognise the need for that. I do not wish the country to be flooded with Dagos, or the inhabitants of the Levant and other countries, from which destitute persons are continually pouring into Great Britain. It may be narrow-minded, but, as I am of British descent, I wish our population to be mainly a British population. The honorable member for Darling and those who have taken part in this debate, are doing more to advertise the resources of Australia than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bedford</inline> could do. If copies of the official report were distributed throughout Great Britain, with the announcement that Australia, with a population of only  5,000,000,  pays 700 legislators - some better, but most worse, than ourselves - salaries ranging from £600 to £300 per annum, and maintains six Governors and a Governor-General, with their establishments, those who read the statement would say that, if it can do that without going bankrupt it must be a glorious land. </para>

                        <para>- If we are to attract population to our shores, we must endeavour to do so in a wholesale manner, and not trifle with the subject in such a way' as to lose £12,000 per annum. All that we need to do is to tell the people of the Old World the exact truth concerning Australia. I do not desire that Australia should be made a special preserve for any one. The question that is of the greatest importance in this connexion is what is the best class of immigrants for the Commonwealth to encourage. At the present time, more than half the population of Australia is to be found in our capital cities. That being so, the people that we should wish to attract are those Who will utilize the land. We do not desire to bring here more artisans and mechanics to flood our already congested cities. It should rather be our object to bring about the introduction of farmers and farm labourers with a little capital. A farm labourer in Great Britain may not have sufficient funds to acquire a farm there, but if he possesses ,£300 or £^400, he should be able to do something for himself here when properly assisted bv legislation. It should be our object to endeavour to attract farm labourers possessing a little capital, so that they will be able to tide over the time during which they are making themselves familiar with Australian conditions and Australian methods. Until they had so educated themselves, they could not hope to succeed even on the best land that we could offer them. This vote hinges on a question of policy, and the Commonwealth Parliament must soon determine what that policy is to be. If the States will not unlock their lands, then we must cease to encourage immigration, and to expend money in that direction. The problem of defence, and of keeping Australia white must also await State action in opening up the land. If the States are not prepared to unlock their lands - if they do not impose a system of taxation that will tend to closer settlement, and cause land to be thrown into use - the Commonwealth must do so. We cannot escape from that position. It is the desire of the Labour party to at once impose taxation with that object in view. I hold that we should first give the States the opportunity to take this action, and that if they fail to do so, the Commonwealth Parliament must step in. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is not such a child in politics as to believe that by spending £12,000 per annum, we shall largely increase our population within two years. The honorable member for Melbourne. Ports correctly described the position in his electorate when he declared that work could not be found for all the iron workers available there. The position is the same in New South Wales. The engineering trade and the iron workers generally in the electorate which I represent do not desire that artisans from Scotland or Belfast shall be introduced to compete with them, and they do not expect me to agree to votes for that purpose. Australia., in the matter of population, is very like an envelope. So far, although it is a vast and most fertile territory, only the gummed edges have been touched by the people. We have the luck to be in the brightest spot on God's earth, and it would be a short-sighted policy to endeavour to limit it to a population of only 5,000,000. During the advocacy of Federation some twelve or fourteen years ago, the present Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton used to declare that within forty years of the establishment of the Commonwealth we should have a population of 50,000,000 or 60,000,000. The fact remains that since Federation - or, rather, during the last nine or ten years - our population, after deducting the excess of births over deaths, has remained stationary. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has touched upon a question with which  I  do not wish to deal at this stage, although it is one that will not long be spoken of with bated breath. We shall soon have to take it up and deal with it. Fortunately for ourselves, the white races of the rest of the world are all in the same position. The coloured races, however, are not indulging in the evil practice suggested by the honorable member for Darwin, and, consequently, are rapidly getting ahead of us. May I say, in conclusion, that  I  see no utility in voting £12,000 in this way, merely that some of it may be given to a journalistic friend.  I  do not care how able he is, or how he spells his name; if that is the only object in view, the sooner we close this account the better. If, on the other hand, it is designed to attract immigrants, then we must see that the truth is told concerning Australia, and that an effort is made to encourage agriculturists and agricultural labourers to come here, rather than to bring to this country large numbers of industrials whom we cannot absorb. </para>

                        <para>- When the honorable member for Darling was making statements that are common property with us, and within the knowledge of all electors, the honorable member for Flinders, with that ability common to the legal profession, believing that he had the honorable member at a disadvantage in not having the proof at hand, sought to press him for it, and continued to press, and, at the same time, to deliberately charge him with making ridiculously inaccurate statements that could not be substantiated. I venture to suggest that there is never a stage in the proceedings of the House when honorable members do riot make statements in support of which it would be difficult for them to produce official proof, if required so to do at that particular moment. Well do I remember even the Prime Minister, who is now the honorable member for Flinders' leader, being completely nonplussed only a few days ago, when similarly asked to provide proof of an assertion that he was then making, and having to regret that he had left the information at home. The honorable member knows full well that that experience is liable to happen to any and every member. It is possible that even the honorable member for Flinders, despite all the care and precision which characterize most of his utterances in the Chamber, may at some moment find himself without the necessary proof to substantiate a statement that he may utter. It was distinctly unkind and uncalled for for the honorable member to press for data when he believed that they were not to hand. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry to have to class the right honorable member amongst those who always put off till to-morrow what they ought to do to-day. Although he claims to be an expert in the matter of finance, he is putting off for a period of five years the settlement of a question that he said yesterday was prominent, urgent, and indispensable to the success of this session. Yet with a calmness that almost beggars description, the right honorable gentleman has decided to put off the fatal day for no less than five years. I rose merely with the desire to furnish the honorable member for Flinders with the proof that he so eagerly sought a few moments ago when he thought it was not available. The Ministry and their supporters, or the majority of them in the House, are desirous of securing immigrants at any cost, and their leading supporters outside the House have placed it on record that they require immigrants, not for patriotic reasons or for filling up the country, but as a business investment for themselves. I need only quote the remarksof <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur</inline> as published in the press on the 25th February last. That gentleman, with some degree of eloquence, pleaded with the Chamber of Commerce in Adelaide - one of those chambers which now control the actions of the present Ministry - to assist him in his immigration proposals. Although he referred to the necessity for filling up the waste spaces, it was not until he put it to the Chamber of Commerce as what he termed a sound business advertisement, that they listened with patience, or were able to raise even a feeble cheer. He was reported to have used these words - </para>

                </continue>
                <para>He put it to them as a sound business advertisement, apart from the higher plane of patriotism. </para>
                <para>Some ten or twelve inches of space were occupied with his remarks upon the patriotic aspect of inducing immigrants to come here. They failed, but his concluding words - " I put it to you as a sound business advertisement " - brought forth the necessary approval. On that aspect of the case, I have only to look back a few months to the time when a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morgan</inline> visited Australia in the interests of the manufacturers of England and of their type here. He put before the public this statement :  - </para>
                <para>The manufacturer, in order to develop his industry, must not only have a sufficiency of labour, but an absolute surplus. </para>
                <para>I venture to suggest that the reason why the Ministry and some of their supporters in the House, and most of their leading supporters outside, are so eagerly asking that public funds shall be spent to induce immigrants to come here, is not so much that they fear, as was asserted by the honorable member for Wentworth, any Asiatic invasion, but that they desire a surplus of labour as a sound business advertisement for their own particular pockets. Every honorable member knows what a surplus of labour will mean, with twenty or thirty, or perhaps even a hundred men knocking at the one door for the one situation. The employing section will be different from what we have known them, in the past if they do not immediately take full advantage of that surplus labour, and inform those who are then employed that their wages must come down, and their hours of labour increase, or they can go out and make room for some of the surplus, they in return becoming a portion of the surplus knocking hopelessly at the door of the employer. We do riot want to be reduced here to the straits in which the military authorities in England found themselves but a few years ago when men were wanted to defend the country, and it became necessary to reduce the standard of chest measurement and height before they could get even in some instances pigmies to carry the rifles. </para>

                            addressed that particular Chamber of Commerce in unusually flowery language upon the patriotic aspect of the immigration movement, and apparently did not arouse the admiration of his friends. So he concluded with these words - there can be no question about what he meant -

Let me quote a few words as an indication of the attitude of the gentlemen who were behind the fusion negotiations which resulted in the formation of the present Ministry, and who are asking, in unmistakable terms, that public funds should be liberally expended to induce immigrants to come to Australia. I quote the Honorable E. E. Smith, who, I believe, is a Victorian, from the official report of the last grand Inter-State Conference of the Employers Union, held in April, 1905. He began by saying that he would allow common sense to cure the political difficulties then existing. I ask honorable members to note the word " obvious " in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith's</inline> speech, although he did not explain what he meant by it. He said - </para>

Queensland, although there were regulations to confine them to certain work and to the tropical areas, they were to be found pretty freely in the southern portions, and  I  believe that, in spite of those laws and regulations, a Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland was wont to employ a kanaka, although the kanakas were supposed to be kept to the cane-fields.

The second question has reference to the alleged responsibility for the advertisements appearing in papers throughout the United Kingdom ; so that we have proof that misleading statements were being circulated. </para>

                    <para>Even when Queensland offered cheap farms in London, there was only one applicant. As  regards  land settlement for home (Victorian) consumption, you can be as pessimistic and as indignant as you please. The blacker the better, though don't get too much on the line, " What is the use of inviting the immigrants here when we have nothing to offer them." That would chop off subscriptions. Anyhow, don't do anything to frighten off immigrants, because competition for them is so keen in Europe, and even if conditions change for the better in Victoria you might find that it was of no avail, as you have given the place a bad reputation. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member asked for proofs that advertisements appeared asking for thousands of miners when no miners were required, and also proof that misleading advertisements were being inserted in the British press respecting immigrants. In reply, I have read a statement by the leader of the Immigration League to the effect that thousands of miners were required, apart altogether from the remarkable letter I have quoted ; and the honorable member for Flinders, in what is, perhaps, a characteristic manner, declares that no proof is given. Will the honorable member inform me of the nature of the proof he requires, when I may be able, not at the present moment, but in the course of a few hours, or days, to produce it, showing that things were done which he. now tacitly admits were unfair. The honorable member took advantage of a few impromptu remarks of the honorable member for Darling, who had not at his command the necessary data for the statement he had made. </para>

                    <para>There is a great demand at present, and will be for some time to come, for miners of all kinds, and pick and shovel men, in New South Wales. There has been such an expansion in the coal trade that hundreds of miners are needed at the various collieries on the North and South coasts. There the wages are from 8s. per day upwards, men sometimes making 12s. or 15s. per day. But all other kinds of mining need men also. </para>
                    <para>Two thousand miners are required at Broken Hill, several hundreds at the Cobar copper mines, at from us. to 22s. a day, and small mines all over the country, whether they be copper or -gold or tin, are advertising for men. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That letter substantiates the statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur</inline> and those acting with him are responsible for having published misleading and incorrect advertisements in the press of the United Kingdom, and corroborates what was said by the honorable member for darling. To my mind, it is the evidence for which the honorable member for Flinders pertinently asked a few moments ago. When the letter was being written, miners were being dismissed at Broken Hill .and Cobar, and throughout New South Wales hundreds of unemployed of all classes would have been glad to take any work at the most meagre, remuneration. The letter shows the methods which have been adopted by that section of the community which is supporting the Ministry, on whose behalf the honorable member for Flinders ventured the interjection that the statements of the honorable member for Darling were absurd and ridiculous. It seems to me that there may have been ar&gt; understanding between the Broken Hill Proprietary and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur,</inline> and that, thinking that there might be trouble with its men in the course of twelve or eighteen months, it persuaded him to get his league to use public funds in the endeavour to attract to the State 2,000 miners, whose arrival would assist to secure a reduction of wages at Broken Hill. No doubt, those responsible regret that these things have come to light. It is not to their advantage that the trickery in which they, have indulged should be exposed to the public gaze. It may not be satisfactory to the Ministry, or to the members of the three or four parties which have fused to support it, to have it known that their friends have published incorrect information in the United Kingdom, and suppressed the truth to mislead intending immigrants. I regret that these methods have been adopted, and that men of the stamp of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> Smith are prepared to import labour as they import machinery. It shows how low their estimate of humanity is. Perhaps that estimate is in keeping with- the opinion which many other supporters of the Government hold, without the courage to give expression to it. It is well, however, that the facts should be brought prominently before the public, in order that it may know what is being done by the section which has brought about the fusion, and whose mouthpiece, the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> says to-day that all behind, the Ministry must support it, no matter what it introduces, good, bad, or indifferent. It may be that the honorable member for Flinders will assert that no proof has been adduced of the existence of the reprehensible methods which have been referred to. I have heard it stated hundreds of times in courts of law- </para>

                        <para>- I am surprised that the honorable member, possessing a legal training, should say that. Manifestly, one side is always in the wrong, and makes statements which it cannot substantiate. No doubt, he has been on that side occasionally, though, of course, it is no personal reflection on him to say so. On many occasions I have known Judges to rebuke those who have appeared before them, for making statements which they could not substantiate, and a good deal must take place before a Judge will rebuke " gent, one." If the honorable member denies that proof has been adduce.! in support of the statements which have been made, let him indicate what he requires to convince him., first, that misleading statements have been published in the press of the United Kingdom, and, secondly, that the persons most -prominently supporting immigration are knowingly, deliberately, and wickedly attempting to deceive the public, pressing this, as they have pressed other Governments, to spend the public funds in attracting immigrants for whom, in their private correspondence, they acknowledge there is no work available. My honorable friend must admit that the statement of the honorable member for Darling is correct - that 2,000 miners were advertised for at a time when the mining companies of Australia were dismissing men. As I have been drawn into the debate, may I be permitted to say a few words in regard to immigration generally. As a member of the Labour party, I am anxious that Australia shall be peopled, because I have a great dread lest the country should pass under the government of any but .our own race. There is that possibility at present. The man who owns 60,000 or 70,000 acres of the finest soil in Victoria could do nothing to prevent it. He may run some thousands of sheep on his land, but they would only provide food for the invaders who might desire to dispossess us. I recognise the value of our institutions, and prefer them to those of other countries, and I know that to preserve them it is necessary to people the Continent with a strong, virile, white race. Yet I deprecate all attempts to decoy to Australia artisans, labourers, and others for whom we have no employment. I shall assist, to the best of my ability, the truthful advertising of our resources, so that our wonderful productions and possibilities may be made known, in the hope of attracting here immigrants of whom, as citizens, we may in the future be proud. But I am not in favour of spending money on advertising intended to hide black spots, and to paint everything the colour of the rose. While such deception may not directly injure us, though reflecting upon our reputation, it certainly injures those whom it misleads. We. have had serious attempts to mislead them in the past, and presumably the desire of some persons in Australia is to continue that form of deception for a purpose they dare not make public. </para>

                        <para>-The Immigration League, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur</inline> is  president,  has been subsidized by the Government. At page 928 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> honorable members will find a reply made by the Treasurer to a question put to him in July, 1907, in which he said that the league had been subsidized by ^150 of Federal money. I am given to understand by gentlemen residing in New South Wales that the league is liberally subsidized by the New South Wales Government. The. Minister of External Affairs will therefore recognise that it is so prominent that it can command subsidies both from the National Parliament and a State Parliament, and that to the extent to which the Government have subsidized they have authorized. To the extent to which they subsidize they recognise the official character of this league, and must be in part responsible for the utterances of its officials. The Minister of External Affairs is to some extent responsible for the utterances of his colleague, although I noted with some degree of pleasure that the Postmaster-General was' reprimanded for having made a statement respecting loan moneys. Nevertheless, to some extent every Minister is responsible for the utterances of his colleagues, and when the  president  - the Prime Minister - speaks he commits the whole Administration. Upon this occasion we have not an impromptu utterance made at a public meeting, but the calm, cold, deliberate writing of the  president  of the league, containing statements of the most reprehensible and knowingly incorrect character. I am, therefore, justified in calling prominent attention to it ; in expressing the hope that we shall, as far as possible, counteract it, and that we shall take all honorable and proper means to bring before the white people of other countries our resources, possibilities, and free institutions, so that, apart from deceptive advertisements, they may come to these shores if they so desire. They will be welcomed in exactly . the proportion in which we can absorb them. I use the word " absorb" in the sense of giving or finding them employment that will allow them -I shall not be excessive - to live in frugal comfort, and keep those dependent upon them in precisely the same condition. That is not too severe a qualification to impose when we are asked to expend public funds in this way. </para>

That honorable members supporting the Government are in favour of immigration is evident, and we have only to read His Excellency the Governor-General's speech to find that the Fisher Government were as keenly alive as we are to the necessity for adopting some system.

                        <para>- No, indefinitely ; because they say, in effect, they are opposed to immigration until certain steps have been taken in regard to the land. They favour a Federal land tax; whilst we, on this side of the House, are opposed to it. Although many honorable members of the Opposition have expressed a desire that immigration shall be encouraged, we find that as soon as a definite proposal is submitted, they, and those for whom they stand as sponsors iu this House, are opposed to it. Let me quote from a resolution carried by the Newcastle Labour Council. </para>

                <para>Mr.PALMER. - The interjection that the Newcastle Labour Council were quite right in warning off intending immigrants serves only to emphasize my point that honorable members opposite are in reality opposed to immigration, although they admit that it is necessary if we are to keep Australia white. The question hinges upon the necessity of a Federal land tax, in order to make the lands of Australia available for immigrants. I desire to present some statistics showing, first of all, the land available in Victoria, and, secondly, the lands available in Australia generally. I propose, in the first instance, to quote from a speech made in another place on Friday la st by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> I am sorry that I have not been able to obtain the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof, but, according to a press report - </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that honorable members opposite are looking with covetous eyes at those who have been able to acquire properties worth holding. There are  1,262  estates under the Victorian land tax, and the average of each assessment in the year  1900  was  6,479  acres. In  1905  the average was reduced to  5,577  acres. In  1906  it was still further reduced to  5,338  acres; and in  1907,  to  5,198  acres. These are the latest figures, and they prove that in seven years the areas of the large landed estates in Victoria have been reduced by one-fifth. That is an important fact, entirely controverting the baseless assertion that no part of the large estates pf Victoria is available for settlement. There is another important statistical fact, and that is that about one-half of the area of Victorian estates over  10,000  acres in extent, consists of Crown land. There are in the large estates in Victoria,  9.545,000  acres, and half of these are Crown lands. Those figures indicate the extent of land controlled by the State of Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- I shall come to that question at a later stage. Of the land in Victoria available for occupation there are  14,541  acres of first-class,  114,000  acres of second-class,  2,079,000  acres of third-class land, and  3,325,000  acres of pastoral land. There are also  6,517,000  acres of mallee land. These figures are from the <inline font-style="italic">Victorian Year-Book.</inline> Some time -ago several honorable members who were then sitting with the Fisher Government on this side stated that no lands were available for the people in Australia. The honorable member for Fremantle thereupon wired to the Premier of Western Australia as to the lands available in that State, and received this reply - </para>

                <para>That speaks volumes for the amount of land which is available, and to which the State authorities desire to attract settlement. From the Queensland parliamentary papers I find that in that State there is a process of selection going on, and that enormous areas are available. The land not alienated in Queensland totals  145,000,000  acres. The area selected in  1906  was  708,000  acres, and by new-comers  276,000  acres. There was open for selection at the beginning of  1906 15,782,000  acres. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to place before honorable members some facts as to the total area of land in Australia. There appears to be an entire misapprehension as to the extent and scope of our country and its value from a settlement point of view. Honorable members opposite are so intent on looking with covetous eyes on those who have already acquired estates that they have no attention to bestow on the large areas of unoccupied land which are just as attractive now as the areas nearer to the shore were in the earlier history of Australia. In the Commonwealth there are  1,903,000,000  acres. I shall deduct the area below a  10-inch  rainfall, although in some parts where there is less than a  10-  inch rainfall there are men occupying leaseholds with profit to themselves and advantage to the community. The area below an average of  10-inch  rainfall is  600,000,000  acres. Above a  10-inch  and up to a  145-inch  rainfall the area is  1,303,000,000  acres. The area leased out of this - and this is the point which exercised the mind of the honorable member for Riverina just now - is  774,000,000  acres. The area alienated or in process of alienation is  126,000,000  acres, making a total of  900,000,000  occupied either by lease, alienation, or partial alienation. The unoccupied country therefore totals  403,000,000  acres. Of the total area of the Commonwealth only  one acre in fifteen has been alienated, while of the total area above a 10-inch rainfall one acre in ten has been alienated. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that honorable members opposite have great hopes of being able subsequently to settle a thriving community even in the Northern Territory. While we have all these lands available, and every State is enacting laws to throw open areas as they are required for settlement, it is altogether a wrong policy to say " We will obstruct immigration as much as possible until you have given us a land tax in order that we may dispossess the men  who  have acquired land, who have held it since the early days, and who have paid for it." I present these figures, satisfied to know that, whilst honorable members opposite decry immigration until certain results have been accomplished, when the fact has been placed before the people that for our own protection we must have more population, the people will be with us, and say " Go ahead, work hand in hand with the States in encouraging immigration. Do not take up a position of antagonism. If you are going to wait for a Federal land tax you will have to wait at least some years before you can make a start." For reasons of defence it is essential that an early start should be made. I quite agree with the statement in the Governor-General's speech that : - </para>

                        <para>- I am quite prepared to deal with it now or then. It is our bounden duty to assist to defend the commerce of this great Empire, as well as to protect our own shores, and the only way we can defend our commerce is to assist the British Navy. I have placed these facts regarding land available for settlement before the Committee, because I feel impelled to view the question -from the larger stand-point of Empire. If we are to develop Australia, to make it a worthy descendant of our great Empire, we must set to work without loss of time to introduce the right type of people, who will take up our large vacant areas. I am prepared to admit that there are thousands of acres at present not available for settlers, because the land is situated too far back; but there are thousands and thousands of acres which are in the range of practical occupation, which, if occupied, would mean wealth to the community, increased labour for the labourers, and a vast step in the direction of the progressive development of the Commonwealth. I trust that we shall not hear from honorable gentlemen opposite any further expressions of determination to resist the immigration of the right type of people ; but that they will seek to induce the States to carry out this important work, and thus make the lands of mutual advantage to those who are here now, and those whom we hope will come. </para>

I understand that the honorable member obtained his information from a letter written in one of the Sydney newspapers by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hurley.</inline> But that letter was, so far as I understand, written under a misapprehension.

                        <para>- The honorable . member ought to know, seeing that the newspaper circulates very largely in his district. All honorable members who have seen the particular issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Clarion,</inline> and to whom I have spoken, have expressed the greatest admiration of it j and I am surprised that the honorable member for Wentworth should object to any article setting forth the resources of Australia, considering the view he takes on the question of attracting immigrants. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is not quite accurate. The whole business of advertising does not merely consist in attracting immigrants. Another object is to develop the trade of Australia, and to that end, to advertise the resources of the country, in the hope of developing our trade with foreign countries as well as with Britain, however anxious we may be for British preference. Another idea is to attract tourists to Australia ; and most of the advertisements have been written with the object of directing attention all over the world to Australia as a legitimate field for business enterprise. As a matter of fact, we do not need to do a great deal of advertising for the purpose' of attracting immigrants. As the present Prime Minister knows, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers, in a most exhaustive report on the subject, claims that there is not the smallest difficulty in getting immigrants; but that, on the other hand, the agents are overwhelmed with applications. If the present Minister of External Affairs chooses to look up the files in his office, he will find that what I have stated is a fact. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sydney</inline> Kidman has also said that there would be no difficulty at all in inducing thousands to come here, if they were certain of employment when they arrived. My own opinion is that we have no need to advertise in order to get immigrants by the thousand, and possibly by the million. </para>

The whole question is, what sort of arrangements do we make at this end in order to insure that the immigrant gets work, and that there is an opening presented for the development of his ability on the land, or elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>- I shall simply say that the Fisher Government definitely laid it down that, as a matter of extreme urgency, there should be progressive taxation of land values, in order that there might be subdivision of the large estates, and extensive areas thrown open to settlement, thus offering inducements to immigrants in large numbers. This proposal meant practical settlement and practical defence. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member knows that he will not interrupt the course of my argument and cause me to admit that the whole of the Labour party's policy lies in a progressive land tax. I will say, however, that, so far as immigration and defence, as arising from the settling of the waste areas is concerned, the key is a progressive land tax. Lands must be unlocked bv some means or other. If the honorable member can suggest a  more  effective means than a progressive land tax, I shall be happy to assist him in bringing it into operation. This is not my opinion, or that of the Labour party only.

                    <para>If  immigrants are to be placed on the land systematically and in numbers without prejudice to the land requirements of our people, it is not to be disputed that the provision of settlement land on easy terms will have to proceed at a much more rapid pace than is the case now. This applies, not in one State, but in all - at least, in the more settled States. As to this State, we are not unmindful of what the Government is doing in the matter of resumptions. Speaking at Guyra on Wednesday night, the Minister for Lands said he was " determined to face the problem (of making land available), and he looked forward hopefully to the time when the men would not be moving about the country looking for land without the Government pursuing them  to  take up the available areas." We hope this good time is nearer than it appears to be. But we doubt if the policy of State resumption alone will bring it about. The active co-operation of landowners themselves might enable the Government to do so, and, perhaps, the neglect of owners to see matters in this light mav prove to be strengthening the hands of those who are only waiting the chance to apply the goad of a graduated land tax. </para>

                        <para>- Let us not cloud the issue. Some honorable members have to-night taken up the position that unlimited areas of land are available throughout Australia, and even in Victoria and New South Wales, and. that we ought to pursue a systematic immigration policy to encourage settlement upon them. If the States would impose progressive land taxation, it would be better to allow them to do so, and to leave the whole business of immigration to them. But is the progress of Australia, to be delayed indefinitely while the Legislative Councils of the States refuse to sanction such taxation ? </para>

                        <para>- The interjection adds strength to my argument. In the State where a majority is prepared to support progressive taxation, the Council is persistent in opposing the 'will of the representatives of the people. It is idle to think that we shall get a progressive land taxation from the State Parliaments within a reasonable period when the people of the most democratic State cannot get it from its Parliament. Let me now read what the Minister of Defence has said on the land question. </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable member knows that, as a matter of fact, it was very good business for Australia. I have here a long extract from an Australian newspaper, in which, under the heading of "A Policy to be Avoided," reference is made to the difficulties that Canada has experienced owing to the lack of a proper selection of immigrants, and a proper supervision of them on arrival. If we were dealing fully with the question of immigration, I should read the article, because it describes very vividly the state of affairs which some men from Australia and New Zealand found prevailing in Canada as the result of the alleged careless immigration methods adopted by the Canadian Government. Those men have since returned to Australia. Those who bring under the notice of the authorities - whether in this House, at meetings of Trades and Labour Councils, of the Employers' Federation, or of other bodies - that in some cases no attempt is made to find land for immigrants when they arrive here, and that no genuine assistance is extended to them, with the result that they are stranded and left destitute, do a service to the country. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves if we employ State funds to bring immigrants to Australia, and fail to look after them when they arrive here. I have sheaves of letters regarding cases where that has not been done in various States. </para>

                        <para>- In the meantime great harm is done to Australia by men being stranded here. They are led to believe that there will be any amount of work for them, and then they write to their friends at Home, telling them not to come out, and describing the conditions prevailing in Australia, in the belief that they are typical of the whole of Australia, whereas they are not. Those who point out that these conditions sometimes prevail, and bring such cases under the notice of the authorities, are called members of the "stinking fish" party. They are accused of decrying Australia, but it is because they love Australia, and want to better it, and do not want these statements to be made about it, or do not want such statements to be true, that they take action. . The men who really belong to the "stinking fish" party are those who constantly cry out that there are any amount of opportunities for anybody to get full work at full wages in Australia, and that there is plenty of land available for all who choose to come and occupy it. Under present circumstances, those assertions are not true. Immigrants who come here, believing that they are true, write to their friends in the Old Country describing their experiences, and so considerable damage is done to Australia. A sane policy in this matter is to make sure to do everything that lies in our power to throw open land at prices at which settlers will be able to make a " do " of it. Within the last three or four years a dairy farmer from Denmark, with eleven children, came to Melbourne with the intention of taking up land for dairying in Victoria. He applied for every Government block that was thrown? open, but he was allotted no land whatever. Finally the family took up land in the district of the honorable member for Corangamite, being assisted by another Dane, who was a local resident. That family paid, as naturally would be the case in the circumstances, being under great pressure, a very much bigger price than they ought to have paid for the land, considering the use - dairy farming - to which they wished to put it. The result is that to-day the whole of those eleven children are working in factories in and around the city of Melbourne. That is because they could not get land at a reasonable price. The father was a practical dairy farmer in Denmark, and really knew his business. He assures me that he could make much more off the land at present prices in Denmark than he could make in Victoria at the prices which  he would have to pay here. I do not say that that case is typical of the whole of the land values of Victoria, but if that kind of thing is at all frequent we can easily understand the damage that will be done to a settled policy of immigration. </para>

                        <para>- The South Australian system of a Land Board, which personally interviews each applicant, and investigates his circumstances, is infinitely preferable. The ballot system is a gamble. Under it the man who is the least likely to be successful has as much chance of getting land as the man who is most likely to succeed. We must make land available at such cheap rates that those who come raw from the Old Country will be able to make a "do" of it. </para>

                        <para>- Of course. Honorable members who say that in Queensland and Western Australia unlimited areas of virgin land covered with scrub are available, should remember that that is one of the factors of the situation. The men brought out to Australia are not, as a rule, most suitable for pioneering work of that kind. That is one of the reasons why we advocate a progressive land tax. We believe that the lands nearer settlement ought to be cut up, because they could be utilized much more readily by immigrants than could the outside country, which must be pioneered by Australians. </para>

The question is not affected in the slightest by whether a man holds poor or rich land. Under a progressive land tax a man will get rid of as much land, whether it is his best or his worst, as will reduce his taxation to an amount that he can afford to pay. It does "not follow that he will get rid of his poor land. He may get rid of his better land, but in any case if he does sell his poorer land, he must sell more of it than he would of his richer land, in order to bring down the total value of his holding to a reasonable figure. </para>

The whole question is the value of the land held. If a man holds such an amount of unimproved land as to bring him under the progressive land tax, to that extent he cannot get money out of his lands, and, therefore, he must get rid of them, in order to make an income. </para>

                        <para>- Confiscation is a point which, I am afraid, the  Chairman  would rule me out of order in discussing. When it comes to a question of confiscation, we are faced with the alternative of repurchasing the land. That is confiscation by artificially increasing the values, and making it more difficult for people to obtain land ; it is an inflation' of values by State aid, and a gift of the added value to the persons who hold the land. In my opinion, the State has no right to go into any enterprise of that kind, because it really means confiscation, just as much as does a progressive land tax, which, I  admit, takes from the few for the benefit of the many. </para>

                        <para>- Then it will be the States, and not the Commonwealth, which imposed the taxation. We are now talking of a Federal progressive land tax; and I must say that I have never heard of any such tax as is. in the pound, even if the value of the estate were ^1,000,000. One reason for my having been a strong advocate all my life, practically, of progressive land taxation, was found during a visit I paid, in company with the  Speaker  of  this Chamber; to an area of land in South Australia, which had been settled for forty years, or longer. This area was about 60 miles north of Adelaide, and there, a few years- ago, was a township and a large number of prosperous farmers, who cultivated from 200 to 500, or, perhaps, 1,000 acres. When you pass through that country now, you find ruined houses where before there were homesteads ; in fact, the whole district is one big sheep farm, though the land is some of the finest cereal country in all Australia. A big land-owner, who had a squatterage  in proximity to the township, bought farm after farm, when bad times came, and the holders were crippled, as, fortunately, they have not been of recent years, but as they may be again ; and the same thing has gone on in many places in South Australia, and, to a large extent, in other parts of the Commonwealth. The Government of South Australia are doing all they can to survey land as rapidly as possible, so as to induce settlement; but, under present conditions, the people have to go from 200 to 400 miles inland, where, possibly, the rainfall is insufficient, and where they have to meet all the difficulties of pioneering work. At the same time, a few men  are allowed by the law to add farm after farm to their holdings, just as we have found amongst the crofters in Scotland; and while I do not say that the means adopted by these land-owners are unlawful or unfair - because they gave a fair price for the land - I take exception to the effect of such a proceeding on Australia. Instead of having thousands of settlers on some of the best lands in Australia, we are confronted with sheep farms. </para>

                        <para>- Order ! I point out that if the honorable member proceeds on this line of argument the discussion will take a very' wide field. It has already taken a  wider ' range than it should ; but last year, when I tried to curtail the dis- , cussion, honorable members opposed me, and told me I must give a broader interpretation to the Standing Orders. I am giving a broad interpretation now ; but if I allow the honorable member to proceed, some other honorable member may interject foreign matter, and there will be no end to the discussion. </para>

However, I have no desire to take up more time of the Committee, and shall content myself with pointing out that those who are really serious in trying to bring about an increase of population will have to take the advice of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> which I read at the beginning of my speech, and look very closely into the necessity of providing lands sufficient to employ the energy of thousands, and not of mere hundreds, as is the case to-day. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Boothby has delivered a very interesting address; but throughout he has not said that his party is in favour of the nationalization of monopolies. The Labour party regard land as the greatest monopoly, and are in favour of taxing it, with an exemption of £5,000 in value. But this is only in order to get the law enacted; and later they will doubtless come down on the smaller estates below the exemption value, and nationalize them. The honorable member tried very hard, but without success, to explain away an interjection made from, this side of the House; and there is no doubt that the object of the taxation is to burst up estates. The honorable member endeavoured to get away from the fact that the first estates to be burst up would be the poor holdings that are not productive. Consequently, the first estates to be crushed will be those beyond the Goyder line of rainfall in South Australia, and those within the line will be the last. </para>

                        <para>- It is in the desert country, beyond the Goyder line; and all the private land there will fall into the market, seeing that its economic value will not enable the holders to pay the tax. Of course, this is an easy way in which to carry out the confiscation policy of the Labour party. Honorable members run away with the notion that there are rich lands which will at once be forced on to the market, and that the only persons affected , will be the nominal owners. I point out that when we go out into these districts, we find a church, a smithy, and perhaps a bank. In numerous townships throughout Australia you will find these edifices. </para>

                        <para>- There may be public houses there, too. The banking institutions of Australia have not established branches throughout the country merely for the fun of doing so. There is a demand everywhere for capital. Those who have put millions into the banks require outlets for their investment, and the banks employ the- cream of commercial men to manage their business, and to loan out their money to the holders of land. The result of the bursting up of large estates would be that many would be surrendered to the Crown, and the banks would lose the money invested in them. Members of the Labour party rejoice in the fact that the banks would be hit. But in hitting a bank you hit the poor. In the list of the proprietors of any bank you will find the names of parsons, widows, and orphans. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members shall not laugh me out of court. Let me refresh their memory a little. Who were those who suffered most by reason of the financial crash in the early nineties? Then you saw the parson, who had put his few savings into a bank or building society,  the widow, and the fatherless child, reduced to penury. It is the most provident in the community who have invested their money in the shares of banks and kindred institutions. The investments are often small in themselves, though in the aggregate of vast proportions. Should the large landed estates be confiscated, these persons would be ruined; but the policy of the Labour party is to burst up the large estates. </para>

                <para class="block">To those who do not think, it says, " The tax will not hurt you, because every estate worth less than £5,000 will be exempt from taxation." Having burst up and confiscated the large estates, the party will say, " We are in favour of the nationalization of monopolies." A day or two ago there was tabled in the other House a motion for the introduction of a Bill for the nationalization of land and all monopolies. That disposes of the £5,000 exemption. The scheme of the party will never accomplish what is aimed at. The honorable member for Boothby has shown that the people of South Australia, the most democratic community in the Commonwealth, have refused to agree to progressive land taxation. </para>

                        <para>- Can it be said that those who pay  7s.  or  10s.  a week rent are persons of great affluence? South Australia has always had one man one vote. The State enjoyed that franchise long before the Labour party existed, although the members of the party are continually taking credit for this and other reforms. But the Parliament of the State has not imposed progressive land taxation, not because the Upper House represents only men of property, but because the needy wage-earners will not vote for it. They are honest. They do not desire to confiscate the property of other deserving persons. The reason why the Labour party will never be able to carry such taxation in Australia is that the proposal is unjust, and amounts to robbery. I decline to believe that the working community is a community of robbers. </para>

                        <para>- When they reached Australia they had to acquire a knowledge of its climate and conditions, which differ greatly from those of Europe. Then . they took up land, learned how to put it to the best advantage, and became the present moneyed class. It is the hardy men of enterprise and grit who have made Australia what it is. The wealthy did not come out here; our wealth was created by the men of intellect, of strong will, and firm muscle. These men have made the country worth  £1,000,000,000.  It is not merely the wage-earners who have built up the country's prosperity. That is due to the efforts of the men of intellect, of genius, and of invention, as well as to the workers. Each has done his part. Why should these men be robbed of what they have earned? Honorable members talk about unearned increment; it is those who have amassed wealth in the cities who ought to be taxed. It is they who enjoy the unearned increment created by the enterprise of the thousands in the country, who have opened up our lands and made us a commercial nation. Those in the city have grown rich, but, under the Labour party's proposal, they will go free. </para>

                        <para>- I have forced an admission from the honorable member. There would not be an exemption under the proposal of the Labour party, because it stands for the nationalization of monopolies, and holds that the ownership of lands is a monopoly, and the greatest of sins. The policy of the Labour party is a policy of humbug, an appeal to the prejudices df the masses, and to the small farmers whose holdings are not worth £[5,000. South Australia has given an excellent example. She has a very small exemption. </para>

                <para class="block">The greatest land reformers have always regarded it as fatal to prosperity. The Labour party is bound to fail, because it appeals to the prejudices of the masses, who are supposed not to know what is meant by it, and because it makes a class appeal to the poor against the rich. The surprise is that spirited and high-principled men can be found willing to ally themselves with a party possessing such a policy. The proposal before us is the voting of money to be spent in encouraging immigration to Australia. We should do our best to induce people to come here. We need population. One leans upon another, and if the country prospers all must prosper. Those who come here will create additional wealth, and the extension of our commerce will benefit every member of the community, and every institution in it. It is matter for regret that the Government proposes to spend so little in inducing immigration. I hope that at no distant period a very large sum will be placed upon the Estimates to attract a continuous and large inflow of population.

                        <para>- I shall have something to say about that. It will be seen from the quotation I have made that the honorable member for ~ South Sydney was in favour of immigration, although he would not commit himself any more than we, who claim to be in favour of it, would to the details of the scheme that might be put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur.</inline> The honorable member for Adelaide stated this afternoon that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur</inline> had induced people to come here from other lands by telling them that Western Australia was a land of sunshine, and that miners were needed in New South Wales. I do not know that there is much cause for complaint in regard to such a statement. Miners may or may not be out of employment, but whether they are or are npt, that is no reason why we should not encourage suitable immigrants to come to Australia. Then, again, no one can say that the statement that Western Australia is a land of sunshine is incorrect. The same remark may be applied to all parts of Australia. The honorable member, in referring to a speech made by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> Smith at an Inter-State Conference, said that that gentleman declared that we must have population; that we were importing machinery ; that we must have labour ; and, I think, that " it must be white and black." I then made an interjection which caused the honorable member to think that I favour black labour. Let me say that I have always voted for the policy of a White Australia, and am still in favour of it.' Under the high Tariff now in force, new machinery may be imported for the establishment of industries, and it may be necessary to introduce skilled labour in connexion with that machinery. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> probably had that in mind when he said that we must have labour, because the introduction of skilled labour is sometimes absolutely necessary in establishing new industries. I know of a new industry in Sydney in connexion with which skilled labour had to be imported. The statement has been made during the debate that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur</inline> advised the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce that it was good business and a patriotic movement to advertise for immigrants. It would be unreasonable to disagree with that statement. We cannot do better than advertise Australia and encourage people to come here. To say that those who come here are unable to find employment is not to state the case fairly. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that a dozen men could be found who have come here only to be disappointed. I have made inquiries, however, at the New South Wales Intelligence Bureau, which encourages immigration, and know 'that every intended immigrant to New South Wales must first be approved by the Agent-General, and that very careful supervision is exercised. I have frequently rung up the Department to inquire if there were any men awaiting employment, and have almost as frequently been told that none were available. The honorable member for Darling said that girls coming to Australia were badly treated, but I have been told by the head of the Intelligence Department in Sydney that they find employment almost immediately after their arrival. I have not yet heard of a new arrival being stranded in Sydney, or unable to find employment. I have employed some immigrants, and know that it takes them some time to become accustomed to Australian conditions. They are excellent men, and are just as anxious to secure high wages as is any Australian. Indeed. I think, that they are induced by statements made on board ship on the way out to entertain an exaggerated idea as to what are the standard wages in this country. I do not think that any one can point to a case where a man- who, on arrival here had enough money to sustain him for a week, was prepared to work for less than the current rates of .wages. Immigration ought to be encouraged by the Labour party. They will lose nothing, even in the matter of their party organization, by doing so, since newcomers are just as keenly alive to labour interests as are any Australian -workers, I, hope that the Government Will continue to .advertise our resources with a view of attracting suitable immigrants. </para>

                    O'MALLEY (Darwin) speech made by the honorable member for Robertson, who seems to hold that the original pre-emptors of Australian soil created this Continent. One would gather from his remarks that the Almighty had" nothing to do with its creation, and that it owes its existence to the boodlers of this country. He seems to forget that Australia has borrowed £250,000,000, and that that immense sum has been expended on railways, 'bridges, roads, and other works,  as well as upon public buildings, that have tended to create an unearned increment in' the property of those who first took up the soil pf Australia. And yet the honorable member says that it means confiscation to exempt £5,000 of unimproved land values. I do not think he understands the question. If he did, he would recognise that the present system of taxing improvements is equivalent to highway robbery. The moment a man spends vast sums of money on improvements - the moment he gets his property into a high state of productivity - a valuer comes along, and up goes the assessment of his property for taxation purposes. On the other hand, the man next door, who keeps his property in such a state that it is fit only for dog kennels or pigsties, is exempt from taxation. Is the honorable member for Robertson aware that a man may have- £5,000 of unimproved land values, and' still have £20,000 worth of improvements on which no taxation would be imposed under our scheme?

                        <para>- I am glad to have that assurance. But what guarantee- have we that the Minister, now that he has the army behind him, may not take possession of all the property of all the boodleiers of Australia? As to the item immediately under consideration, I would ask why we advertise to bring people to Australia when we have no land and no situations to offer them ? Does it not seem that in doing so we are securing immigration under false pretences? Every healthy immigrant, according . to American actuaries, adds to the wealth of this country £20 the day he lands as a factor of production and consumption, and is worth £80 a year to the State. But is it fair or honest to bring these people to Australia when we know it is impossible for the Australians themselves to get one foot of land unless they pay four times what it is worth ? We should look at this question as business men. I am sorry to say that the followers of the Ministry are financial dreamers - Utopian boodleiers. The idea of men in this great country wanting to bring people here, when thousands of those already here are out of work, when there are thousands of applicants for every block of land offered, and when a few men own a large section of this State ! Your public men are afraid to tackle the question, and yet you call your people courageous. No man, whatever his wealth, position, or ability, should stand in the way of the State. We want defence. Honorable members say we must be prepared to defend ourselves from an expected onslaught by some foreign nation. We are talking about buying guns, about a navy, and about drill. Why, it is on the nerves of the people of this country. We are talking about building <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts.</inline> You are frightened of Germany. You say, " Some day we will have to fight her." Why not fight her now, if you will have to fight ? Do not wait until the other fellow is ready, if a fight is inevitable, but fight when you are ready. What sort of advertising do you do here? A lot of money is spent on it. I see from the Estimates that something is always going out ; but I never see anything coming in for it. You have not the first ideas of how to advertise in this country. You do not know you are alive on the question. Who will read your big articles in newspapers ? </para>

                <para>Government side, "Do you want fifty starving men looking for one job?" The two great antagonistic forces in this world are the power of capital, without a soul to be damned or a body to be kicked ; and on the other side the power of labour. But those two forces have a common interest. In Americathey used to look upon labour as a raw commodity, to be bought in the open market, just as they would buy raw. material and transform it into the finished product. That is the line that, the people in Australia are going on to-day. I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Agnew,</inline> at Collingwood, state the other night that 65,000 children had died in Australia during the last nine years. If the wise and able men of this country had attempted to build foundling homes where those children could have been put out to be looked after, as is done in Canada and the United States, you could have increased your population with your own people, instead of having them planted in baby farms all over Australia, and losing a great proportion of them. Australia has gone in for a great borrowing system. If you do not devise some proper scheme of finance, whereby the States and Commonwealth will co-operate, your public debt in forty-four years, at the rate at which you are borrowing now, will amount to £500,000,000, and the interest bill will be nearer £20,000,000 annually than the £8,500,000 at which it stands to-day. The. other day the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Times</inline> stated that New South Wales has worn out her welcome on the London market. A few days after New South Wales had floated her loan, and got £9410s.or £95 net - that is, paying on every million , £50,000 of a loss below par, on which the people of Australia must pay interest - the London County Council went on to the London market and floated £1,000,000 at £102 net, or £20,000 above par. Therefore, the difference between a New South Wales loan and a London County Council loan at the same rate of interest, and for the same currency of time, was£70,000 odd in a million. You call yourselves financiers, when on £2,000,000 you pay £140,000 more in a loss of capital on which you must pay 3½ per cent. interest for all time and eternity, because I do not think you ever expect to pay your debts. I never hear anybody talk about paying off. I hear every one talking about further borrowing. That is because Australia does not bother about anything but political financiers. A political financier is a man who has about 3 per cent. of superficial knowledge and 97 per cent. of dense financial ignorance. I want to compare this country with the United States. The debt of the United States to-day is only £200,000,000, although they owed nearly £800,000,000 when the war closed. There is £320,000,000 of gold in the United States. </para>

                        <para>- The United States could close up the national banking system, pay off the  £200,000,000,  and be absolutely free. Yet since the war of  1863  they have never had a political Treasurer. Their Treasurers have all been trained men. We have able financiers in this House, such as the honorable member for Flinders, the honorable member for Mernda, and the honorable member for Balaclava ; but you never see those men holding the Treasurership in Australia. We should not waste a penny in advertising to bring immigrants to Australia until we make such arrangements that we can put the men to work and provide positions for the women. In Canada immigrants are given land and means of transportation. There are agents to meet them in Montreal and Quebec, and the people are taken right to Manitoba, in the north-west. Homes are given to them, and they are helped in every possible way. </para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable member is greatly mistaken. Over  59,000  Americans have left the Nor-West territory of the United States during the last year or two, and taken up land in Canada. I know this to be a fact, because I owned property in Western America myself, and property has been sold there at high prices. People are taking millions of United States money into Canada because the Canadian Government offer inducements. Years ago, I said that we ought not to spend millions in keeping up our tinpot military system, but ought to bring people out to this country to buy the land. I have no desire to confiscate land, though' I do not wish to see millions of acres locked up for a few sheep. What would my military friends on the Ministerial side say if, in the face of a Japanese army, we sent out, say, a General Gordon at the head of a flock of sheep? Yet that is what honorable members opposite picture as the building up of a nation - a nation of sheep, billygoats, and bandicoots. It is only a dispensation of Divine Providence that will . induce this House to listen to, or study, finance ; one has only to make a financial speech to clear everybody out. </para>

                        <para>- Right or wrong, he was in opposition. In my opinion, the time is not far distant when we shall have elective Ministries, and do our business in about three months. I was present at the Collingwood City Council meeting the other night, and they did more business in one evening than we do in a week. We should elect our Ministers just as we do our Speaker; and then we should be able to perform our legislative duties, and be free to attend to our private business. </para>

                    <para>.- The- - - honorable member for Boothby, referring to some remarks I made early in the debate, appeared to have gathered the impression that I made an attack on the literary value of a publication which- his Government had bought at a. certain price for distribution in Europe. I did nothing of the kind ; I had not at that time seen the article, and all I attacked was the practice of giving contracts without calling for tenders to prominent political journalists "to advertise Australia." The statement I made was that some 7,000 copies of this publication had been bought at a cost of some £50 more than the price shown on the front page justified. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and I think a wrapper was supplied with, each copy ! The point I make is that the honorable member for Boothby told us that the object of the publication was, not to attract immigration from the various foreign countries mentioned, but to encourage trade with those countries. </para>

                        <para>- I have not had time to read every line of the publication ; but I do not think there is a word there about a land tax; the article speaks of things as they are, and not as we may hope them to be. It is stated most clearly that the lands owned by the States are of tremendous area. Is that <inline font-style="italic">couleur</inline><inline font-style="italic">de rose</inline> or a statement of fact ? If it is <inline font-style="italic">couleur</inline><inline font-style="italic">de rose,</inline> why have the Labour Government paid for it, to the large profit of the people who have produced it ? Honorable friends opposite address themselves to these questions as if they were opponents in the House to the closer settlement of the lands. As a matter of fact, the only difference between us is one of method. Honorable members on this side of the House - Democrats on this side of the House - are not those who are rapidly getting rich by advocating the abolition of wealth, but they are none the less Democrats. We believe that the States which, under our Constitution, are intrusted with the lands of Australia, should be intrusted also with the taxation of those lands, and the land policy generally. </para>

                    <para>. - We are all agreed that Australia, more than any other country in the world, needs immigration. We are one of the white outposts, and no other country is more required to be self-contained and self-supporting. At the same time. I am opposed to introducing immigrants until we have prepared the way for them. It is simply wasting money, unless the Government give some undertaking or definite promise as to making room for the newcomers ; and, in the absence of any such promise or undertaking, I shall certainly oppose any vote of the kind. My. personal experience of immigrants, who have lately been introduced, has not been satisfactory. I have -been appealed to again and again by those who have been brought ''here under delusive promises and inducements held out from one source and another, and now find themselves absolutely stranded. This is a most undesirable state of affairs; and, so far as my intelligence guides me, the arguments advanced against the land tax, which presents the only method of introducing a sturdy yeomanry, are fallacious. We are told that the land tax is inequitable, because it makes no exemption. That argument is used even by those who, at heart, are opposed to a land tax of any sort. I. am prepared to admit that, ethically, there should be no exemption from a land tax, the values that are aimed at being those belonging to the people. One does not .need to be a deep thinker, or a learned economist, to recognise that the constantly increasing value of land is the result of public expenditure and effort. Many honorable members have been taught in that school of political thought. They will therefore admit that unearned increment is a legitimate mark for taxation. We ask the landholders to return to the people the value which the people have conferred on their land. That is a fair and reasonable request, and those who own land should be only too pleased to pay such a. nominal charge. But the position of affairs in Australia is such that we need, not merely a tax on unearned increment, but a tax which will be so heavy as. to make it impossible to hold large areas of arable land without putting them to the fullest cultivation. To bring about the full use of land, I am prepared to vote for a tax of as much as is.. in the  £1  on large estates. Of course, land which is not suitable for close settlement has comparatively no unearned increment, and some absolutely none at all. But land which is constantly increasing in value should be subject to a progressive tax. When the State attempts to buy back land, it puts up prices against itself. It is a remarkable fact that the recent attempt to buy back land in New South Wales has resulted in a considerable increase in the price paid by farmers for small holdings. The price paid for the first instalment of land bought back, and resold, was on the average something like  £1,600  a farm,, but on a later instalment the average was about  £2,000  each for thirty-six farms or more. That, to my mind, clearly proves that it is idle to attempt to settle the country in this way. Moreover, it is ruinous. In addition to paying for the unearned increment, the State increases values by becoming a buyer. What is needed is to cheapen land, and that can be done only by the imposition of a land tax. We aim at breaking up the big estates, and, incidentally, at raising revenue. We do not wish to tax the smaller estates, because we contend that their holders already pay more than a fair proportion of taxation. The man on a small area is an active member of 0 society, who, in proportion to the land he occupies, contributes a thousand times as much to the State as does the man who holds a large area of equally .good land. That has been demonstrated again and again. I have had particular facts and figures brought under my notice recently which go to show that, on a rough average, a small man farming  250  acres of fairly good land contributes about  £80  a year to the revenue in railway freights, whereas if the holder of  30,000, 40,000,  or  100,000  acres were contributing in like proportion - which he is not - he would be increasing the revenue enormously. Instead of making all he can out of his land, even for himself, the large holder does not get from it a tithe of what it should return, and escapes his just obligations. He does not contribute nearly so largely as does the small 'man by paying railway freights to and from the centres of population. Customs duties, and innumerable minor taxes. In comparison with the small man, the big man contributes next to nothing to the revenue. That is the logical reason for exempting the small man from, taxation, unless the taxation of his land is accomplished by the remission of taxation of other kinds. We aim at reducing things to an equality. A progressive land tax would be revenue producing up. to a certain point, but it would have a tendency to break up the large estates. When that had happened, the small men who would settle on the land would contribute largely to the revenue, and greatly augment the public funds. In my opinion, this defence of our land taxation proposals is needed. I do not think honorable members have clearly understood our reasons for exempting small men from taxation. Those which I have put forward are proper and effective. I urge the Government to include land taxation in its programme. It seems to me that' the present line of cleavage between the two great political parties is due to the division of opinion in regard to land taxation. Clearly, to obtain the support of certain honorable members, Ministers had to jettison their land tax proposals. But the country cannot progress without land taxation. Without it we must have stagnation. In the face of the fact that the situation in Europe is critical; that we have an awakened East knocking at our door, and that our population is infinitesimal compared with the property which it controls, it is imperative that we take steps to place ourselves in a position of greater security. Ten years hence, Australia's position will be worth nothing, unless, in the meantime, a land tax is imposed. Once we have progressive land taxation, it will be unnecessary to discuss proposals for increasing immigration. The fact that land is available here, and that a paternal Government is willing to assist men without capital, on the French system of credit, will lead to the inundation of the country by a virile population, such as years ago came to our shores in the hope of winning gold from the earth. When men elsewhere know that they can secure in Australia areas of land sufficient for the support of a. family in comfort, they will come here' in large numbers, and we shall have all the immigration that we need. Unless land is made available, the continent will be lost to Australians in the course of the next decade or so. I see nothing to save us. That any Government should so abandon the destinies of the country as this Government has done to secure support, is a tragedy for which posterity may yet live- to curse the present generation. </para>

How, in God's name, can a young man keep honest  On  such a salary, if he has to maintain the dignity of a position in the Commonwealth service ? I know that, in reply, an argument will be used which has grown hoary on the lips of every sweater who has put a vile marl* on the earth by living on it, namely, that these young men know the conditions under which they have to go. This stigma is one which we should remove from our escutcheon. </para>

I was under the impression that State servants on being transferred to the Commonwealth had their rights conserved, and it was my boast, until lately, on many a public platform, that men and women in the Federal service received equal pay for equal work. I find, however, that that is mere moonshine, judging by the treatment that has been meted out to three transferred officers, apparently because they are women. These women, one with twenty years' service, another with twenty-two years' service, and still another with twenty-three years' service in Victoria, were recently transferred to the Commonwealth, and they are receiving the munificent salary of £78 per annum. Yet we have in the Public Service Act a provision that any adult who has been for three years in the Public Service of the Commonwealth should not receive less than £1 IO per annum. </para>

                        <para>- They have just been transferred to the Commonwealth Service, but I am sure that if they were men they would have received different treatment. I do not blame the present Government. I should speak as I am now doing even if the Fisher Government were in office. I was sorry to see the signature of a member of that Government attached to the notice of transfer which appeared in the Government <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> Rather than sign such a notice I would have resigned had I been a Minister. I have made my protest, and will take another opportunity to press these cases on the consideration of the Government. I hope to receive from the Treasurer an assurance that the young men to whom I have previously referred will have their travelling expenses paid in future. </para>

                    <para>.- We find in division 40, an item of £850 "to reimburse the States, cost of carrying out provisions of the Commerce Act of 1905." I hope the Treasurer will ask his colleague the Minister of Trade and Customs to look into this matter with a view of determining whether or not the Commonwealth is not paying more  than it ought to do for this work. I believe that the total expenditure under this heading for the year will be nearly £10,000, and that it was never contemplated when we were passing the Commerce Bill that we should be saddled for all time with such an expenditure. Only the other day we had an admission by those engaged in the tanning industry that they had derived great benefit from the Act. Under it their leather went into the London market as being practically of the finest value since it was warranted free from adulterants. ' My contention is that the States should bear some proportion of this expenditure, and I hope that the Treasurer will submit my view to his colleague. </para>

                        <para>- What kind of Australian defence is this? We are talking about the defence of the Commonwealth, and we find now that the late Minister discovered that he could not supply 20 per cent, of rifles to the enrolled members of rifle clubs. How can the Department expect to get an enrolment of this very important arm of defence when it cannot furnish a larger supply of rifles than that? It seems to me that if there is any further increase in the enrolment the allowance of 10 per cent, must be reduced to 5 per cent., and so on. I strongly urge upon the Government that if they wish to encourage the formation of rifle clubs in the country districts they must provide a sufficient number of rifles to enable the ordinary amount of practice to take place. It is ridiculous to expect that sixty men in a rifle club can get sufficient with only five rifles at their disposal. This part of the defence scheme is a' very weak one, and the question of armament ought to engage the earnest attention of the Government. I remember that when the first Labour Government were in office they discovered a like deficiency, and gave to the Old Country a large order for rifles, but apparently the growth of rifle clubs has continued at such a rate that we are now practically in exactly the same position. This treatment of rifle clubs is not in the direction of encouraging the formation of others. In Molong; in my electorate, there is an old-established corps of the Australian Light Horse, and a strong civilian club, and, if I mistake not, some other form of defence .force is represented there. For a number of years they had a range in use, but it was condemned, I think, by the local council as being dangerous. After a considerable amount of trouble the Department discarded the old range, and arrangements were made for the selection of a new site. It was understood that the new site would be made available very quickly, but the lease of the land was not executed as speedily as it might have been. Who is responsible for the delay I do not know. The Department say that it was due to the fact that a gentleman who was interested in the land to be secured for a range site was absent in the Old Country, but he says that it was due to their  unbusiness-like  methods. So far as I can gather everything is now in order, but when it comes to the question of equipping the new site I am informed by the Department that no funds have been made available. In fact, I understand that the recommendation of the Department was to provide funds for this range on last year's Estimates, but for some reason unexplained the then Treasurer decided to eliminate the item, with the result that during the current financial year the Department have not been able to effect the improvements necessary to make the range available. </para>

                <para class="block"> What I want to know from the Minister of Defence is whether, in view of the special circumstances of this case, any attempt has been made in this Supply Bill to provide the money which was asked for last year by the Department, and, if so, will the work be taken in hand as speedily as possible, to enable the riflemen to become efficient? I made special representations to the Department recently about the range. The whole of the facts of the case have been under review, and as far as. I can ascertain they are as I, have stated them. The rifle clubs and others who are interested in the range have been deprived of the use of it for twelve months, and they want to know how much longer they are to remain in that unfortunate, position. The fault lies with the Department. This is not the way to encourage the development of our Defence Forces. It is only another instance of the disheartening experiences which young men in country districts have to put up with in their desire to do their duty by equipping themselves for' defence purposes. They should receive some consideration at the hands of the Government. If provision is not made for the work until the Estimates are brought down the probabilities are that the vote will not be passed until just before Christmas, and that will mean that the work will not be taken in hand until some time next year, making a year and a half, and perhaps two years, that the range will have been lying idle. This is a case that deserves ' special consideration, which I hope it will receive from the Treasurer and Minister of Defence. </para>

                    <para>. - There were at one time in my electorate five rifle clubs. They had two ranges, one of which has been closed. I am speaking from memory, but I think the other was at Oakleigh. There was a case of rifles there, but when the club opened it an officer of the Department threatened them with all sorts of pains and penalties if they dared to use them. The young fellows in the district were very keen on rifle shooting, but they have had to give it up on account of the absence of a convenient range. At present they have to go to Williamstown on their Saturday afternoons, and that takes the whole afternoon. When there was a range in the district "they could get an hour's shooting at any time. , I feel that the departmental officers. Have very little sympathy with the rifle .clubs, but if we wish to protect this country we" ought to teach every man to shoot. I trust the new Minister will see that every facility is given in that direction. These young men get no payment, although they give their spare time to practising rifle shooting for the good of the country. The permanent military men have not the sympathy that they ought to have with these volunteers. Men who are prepared to give their time to learning to shoot should receive every assistance from the Department. Money spent in putting up and keeping in order these rifle ranges is money well spent in the defence of Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister of Defence the difficulty which the members of the Cadet Forces at the public schools and elsewhere have in getting their uniforms. Many of the cadets are the children of very poor people, but, although the parents put up some proportion of the money, considerable delay takes place in getting the Government or the contractors to do their part in providing the uniforms. A specially urgent question is the need for increased accommodation at the Adamstown rifle range. That is the centre of a large district. It serves a population of, I suppose,  150,000,  and on the occasions of the annual matches or rifle 'courses it is patronized by men from Sydney and from as far north, I suppose, as the border. All the musketry courses for the district have to be fired there. I learn that only recently when they were trying to get through an ordinary mus.ketry course the men were firing over one another at the different distances in order to get through. Something should be done there to 'accommodate, not only the men who must go through the musketry course, but also the members of rifle clubs who patronize the range. The competitions for prizes, for which I presume we' provide money, also take place there, and I am told that the accommodation is utterly inadequate for the number of competitors. The caretaker's residence is a standing disgrace to the Department. No family should be expected to live in quarters such as the caretaker and his family have to occupy. I hope the Minister will look into the matter as early as possible, with a view to improving the range. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister might well see into the matter. Guns of that pattern are now in Tasmania and Victoria. If they are second-hand, the people have been deceived, and if we paid for new guns the country has been robbed. If we got 'them at a low price, that makes the case no better, because we had no right to purchase them if we knew they were second-hand. I think that the Minister of Defence might tell us whether there is any truth in what I have said. He will find the papers in the Department. If the facts are as related, the officer responsible for purchasing the guns, and the firm which supplied them, ought to be brought before some tribunal. If we were supposed to get new guns, and were supplied with weapons that were six years old and out-of-date, somebody ought to be punished. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to compliment the Minister of Defence on the attention he has given to the .matter I brought under his notice regarding the strike at the Williamstown rifle ranges. A number of men employed there were being treated very unfairly, because men employed at the Newport Workshops, who were already in full employment, were -given preference in regard to engagement at the ranges, over men who had spent a <inline font-style="italic">good</inline> deal of time in learning the business, and ought to have been engaged. I feel sure that the Minister will see that the suggestion I have made is worth carrying out, and that men who are eligible, and who are out of employment should tie considered first. I can indorse what has been said by the honorable member for Calare, in reference to the shortage of rifles. It is absurd that there should "be only one rifle to every twenty of the men who are prepared to risk their lives for' the defence of Australia. Imagine -the ridiculousness of twenty men being engaged in an action, and nineteen of them waiting until one fell, in order to take up his rifle and carry on the firing ! If we cannot import sufficient rifles, then, in the name of common sense, let us start a factory and manufacture our own. When the Transvaal was fighting against the mighty British Empire, not only did the Boers make  their own rifles,- but they- actually constructed big guns. Surely we possess sufficient intelligence to do the same sort of thing. If the Minister of Defence will only show as much energy in the administration of his Department as he used to display in criticising the Government when he was Leader of the Opposition, it will not be long before every man in our forces will have a rifle. I recognise much good in the Minister's past actions. I commend to him the idea of making the defence of Australia dependent upon a land tax. In my opinion a land tax should be made to pay for the whole of our defence. In England at one period there was almost incessant war for over 100 years, and, nevertheless, no debt accumulated. It was only when the Hanoverian succession occurred, and the debts of Charles II. of unblessed memory had to be discharged, that a national debt was commenced. Let me commend to the Minister the example of  a country whose legal enactments can be claimed to be scientifically exact, and whose Customs Tariff is, in respect to the principle on which it was framed, probably, the best in the world. I allude to the country which Great Britain chose to be her ally for defence and offence, namely, Japan. Japan offers an % excellent example of what can be done. I * shall quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Financial and. Economic Annual of Japan,</inline> published by the Government Printing Office, Tokio. I learn from this book that £100 of income pays a tax of <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 10s. But in case of special emergency the tax would be £3 9s. A man who has an income of ,£300 ordinarily pays <inline font-style="italic">6 0, I</inline> but in time of emergency, he would pay £13 16s. A man who has £1,000 of income will pay £30 ordinary .taxation, the amount to be increased by 150 per cent. - making £75 a year - in a time of emergency. A man with an income of ,£10,000 - and there are many wealthy men in Japan - would under ordinary circumstances pay an income tax of ^550, but the special tax which might be imposed would be .£2,035. I do not blame any one for having a large property. II wish every member of this House had a large income, and were able to pay taxation on a large estate. I do not wis'h to see a miserable, shabby land tax, such as exists in Victoria. <inline font-style="italic">The Age,</inline> to its eternal credit, has thundered out its denunciation of the Victorian tax in no uncertain way. It is. I believe, the most absurd land tax in the whole world. Let us  see what England's ally, Japan, does in  this respect. The income tax of Japan realizes £2,700,000 per annum. The land tax realizes £8,571,000. Let me quote this passage - </para>

                    <para class="block"> The land tax is levied according to the value of land which is assessed on the basis of capitalizing the net earnings or the rent of land and entered in the official land registers. The land tax is collected from the pledgee in the case of land under pledge, from the superficiary in the case of land under superficies of more than a hundred years' duration, and in all other cases from the land-owner. The annual rate of land tax is fixed at per cent, of the assessed value of land, but under the Extraordinary Special Tax Law the tax was increased to rates ranging from 3 per cent, to 17.5 per cent., according to the class of land. </para>
                    <para class="block">In the stress of war, we have no idea of what the tax would be. But it is our duty to find a means by which we can raise a much larger revenue than we do at present, and I do not think that we can discover a better source from which to raise it than the land. I wish now to speak on the twopenny halfpenny, tinpot <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> proposal of the Government. I do not think there is a member of this Parliament who imagines that the paltry present of one battleship of the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> type would wipe out our obligation to the Home Land. I am sorry that the Fisher Government were defe'ated,_ because I am satisfied that if they had remained in office they would have been prepared, if necessary, to take a referendum upon this question. The creators of this Parliament would then have had an opportunity of controlling it, and I am sure they would have said that, for defence purposes, the land should be the sole source of revenue. If that much were conceded, and twenty <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> were required to assist the Home Land, the Ministry of the day would then be in a position to raise them. So far, not a penny piece has been collected in Victoria towards the presentation of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to the Mother Country. Let honorable members contrast that with what Japan has done by voluntary subscription on previous occasions, and I think that the Jingoes of the country must hang their heads with shame. I say, let our workshops ring with the sound of 5,000 hammers wielded by men engaged in making provision for the defence of Australia. Let the air resound with the cheers of 50,000 men who can be sent by means of a railway to any part of the Commonwealth - to the Northern Territory, for example - where danger most threatens us.

                    <para>. - I merely wish to say that I do not desire honorable members to imagine that I am treating them with discourtesy by making the few remarks which I propose to make. I have listened to their complaints in regard" to the scarcity of rifles, and I feel almost disposed to add one or two complaints of my own. There is quite a familiar ring about some of the grievances which have been ventilated, particularly about those mentioned by the honorable member for Calare. There are cases in my own electorate in which men suffer disabilities from lack of rifle practice, and during the short time that I have been administering the Defence Department I have found that the position, so far as the riflemen of the Commonwealth are concerned, is anything but satisfactory. I have done my best to remedy matters, but, of course, a great deal remains to be done. I do hope that honorable members will accept my assurance that my sympathies are entirely with the riflemen of Australia, and if I can do anything to remove the disabilities under which they labour, I shall be ready at all times to do it. I do not object to these matters being brought under my notice, but- I want honorable members to recollect that, however hard we may fight upon the floor of the House, our opposition to each other ceases the moment we come to do business in the Department. I promise to look into the complaints that have been made, and to rectify them wherever it is possible to do so. But I may point out that we shall not overcome all our troubles in this connexion until we are able to manufacture our own rifles. Within the next few days I hope that we shall be able to take the first active steps in that direction. </para>

                    <para>.- I would ask the Postmaster-General to obtain in- formation as to whether the trunk telephone line between Sydney and Melbourne is a paying one. No difficulty should be experienced in getting that information. At the time this line was projected, I objected to the metropolitan residents being placed in a different category from residents in the country, who are obliged to guarantee a certain sum before any new line will be constructed by the Department. I should like the Minister to ascertain the exact position before the next. Supply Bill is under consideration, so that honorable members may know whether the persons using the trunk telephone line between Sydney and Melbourne are placed in a superior position to that occupied by country residents. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to direct attention to a new departure in Postal administration. It appears that in new centres where postal facilities are sought, the Department practically says to the applicants, "You must carry on the business yourselves for a period of twelve months, and then if the traffic warrants it we will consider your request." I know of two cases in my own electorate. One is on the raihvay line between Parkes and Condobolin. At a certain point on that line a number of new settlers have located themselves, owing to the cancellation of certain improvement leases. As a matter of fact, about fifty families are settled there, and they have endeavoured to obtain a post-office at their siding. In reply the Department has informed them that it will provide them with a mail bag, and if they can secure the services of some person who will receive the bag, make it up, and attend to the distribution of mail matter, it will allow him £1 per annum, and at the end of six or twelve months, if the traffic warrants it, steps will be taken to establish a post-office there. Precisely a similar position of things obtains at another siding on the Cowra-Harden line. That is not a progressive policy to adopt in developing country centres. If any concessions are to be made, they ought to be to these outlying places; and I hope the Postmaster-General will look into the matter, and see whether a more liberal policy cannot be adopted. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot allow this vote to pass without supplementing what has been said by the honorable member for Calare. Only today I brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General a country locality in my district, which the State authorities have thought of sufficient importance to construct a raihvay to, but where the administrators of the Post and Telegraph Department decline to afford the usual facilities until it is shown that they will prove a paying affair from the start. All this seems to be due to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott,who</inline> runs the Department, and has done so for a considerable time. But we must not forget that in the metropolitan areas extensive services have been ordered without any guarantee. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. In the locality to which I have referred there are a large number of settlers; and under the circumstances it is not surprising that some people are finding that Federation is not having the desirable results they expected. A railway has been constructed there for about forty miles, at a cost of £3,000 a mile; and yet it is not deemed of sufficient importance to provide telegraph or telephone facilities. The same complaint can be made in regard to other places, though in a lesser degree. I do not know whether all this is because the Deputies have no responsibility, and are just figureheads, subject to red tape. I venture to say that there are twenty or thirty localities in which there are large numbers of applicants for letter-boxes,which could be erected at the cost of a few shillings, and return revenue at the rate of £1 per annum each. The boxes I have in my mind were promised two years ago, and have not yet been supplied. First, I was told that a consignment was expected from England, and next that some were expected from Melbourne ; and, as a matter of fact, I am not only ashamed to meet my constituents, but also ashamed to have to interview the Postmaster-General on such small matters, when his mind ought to be de- voted to business of much greater importance. As I say, I do not know whether all this arises, because the  Deputy  Postmasters-General have no control, or whether it is because they will not take the initiative ; but, at any rate, the administration of this Department is not nearly so good as in the pre-Federation days. For instance, before we entered the Union, no guarantee of 10 per cent. was asked, but 5 per cent. was considered sufficient to cover interest and wear and tear. In some places, after the guarantee has been subscribed, the desired facilities are not afforded. Only the week before last, in a small community, some.  £32  was subscribed in order to prove the <inline font-style="italic">bond fides</inline> of the people in their desire for telephonic communication ; butt if I may judge from experience, three years will elapse before the work is carried out by the Department. </para>

                    <para>. - In reference to the remarks of the honorable member for Yarra, as to the trunk telephone line between Melbourne and Sydney, I shall be happy to comply with his request, and place full information before the House at an early date as to the capital and working cost. I am not quite sure that the results from this line are so satisfactory as might be desired, but, at any rate, full information will be given at an early date. The honorable member for Calare, and the honorable member for Grey, have rar fullest sympathies as a 'country member myself. It is highly desirable that country districts should have their requirements fairly considered. I found, however, when I assumed office, that certain practices and precedents had been laid down by my predecessors to the effect that certain facilities were not to be granted unless there was some proof or evidence that they would pay their way. I have only to repeat what I informed the honorable member for Corio recently that, for my part, I do not feel inclined to be bound by previous practices, but I cannot take the responsibility of reversing them without consulting my colleagues, especially on questions of expenditure on works which may involve loss of revenue. I do intend to consult my colleagues as to whether it is not desirable to establish a new rule that postal, telephonic, and telegraphic extensions in country districts shall be provided, even in cases where they will not pay. In such cases Parliament might be asked to make a special provision so that the Postal Department will not be charged with the loss. At any rate, I undertake to bring this matter under the notice of my colleagues. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer might give the Committee some information upon the proposed vote of  £20,000  for refunds of revenue, and also upon the proposed vote of  £100,000  advance to the Treasurer. Trie last sum has generally been considered sufficient to cover six months; but I have discovered that the Treasurer has sometimes Been granted more than  £200,000  'towards his advance account, by means of these Supply Bills. A certain sum' is granted under a Supply Bill, and is paid away, and later on recouped. That is not a desirable practice, and had I continued in the office of Treasurer, I should have put an end to it. </para>

                    <para>. - With reference to the vote of  £20,000  for refunds of revenue, I may inform the Committee that last year  £100,000  was voted for this purpose. The money is required to meet the money order account, and the cost of stamps placed on postal notes ; to pay the Eastern Extension and Pacific Cable Companies their share of the revenue from cablegrams; to refund amounts paid to revenue in error, and also for the re-purchase of stamps. These are the principal headings under which expenditure takes place under this vote. We are asking in this Supply Bill for one-fifth of the amount voted for this purpose last year. With regard to the Treasurer's Advance, the  £100,000  asked for is required' to pay for new works in progress, including: works carried out under contract and works being carried out by day labour. It is estimated that we "shall require  £80,000  for this purpose. The Treasurer's Advance account is also' drawn upon to provide a trust fund for the Government Printer for the payment of wages and material for Government printing, and also to meet payments under the Naval Agreement. About  £8,000  will be required for this purpose. These payments are made in the first instance from the Treasurer's Advance Account. The balance .of the  £100,000  will be required to meet unforeseen and extraordinary expenditure. </para>

It has been customary to ask for considerable sums at the commencement of the financial year, because in the interval between the end of a financial year and the time at which the Government obtains fresh appropriation for new works and buildings for the .current year it is necessary that these works, which are being carried on all over Australia, should be paid for out of the Treasurer's Advance Account. </para>

I am discussing a proposed vote of  £100,000  towards the Treasurer's Advance Account. I have always taken up the attitude that public moneys should be expended only upon the direct authority pf Parliament. I am prepared to admit that sometimes exceptional circumstances arise which render it necessary' that the Treasurer should be in a position to meet small accounts, but when he asks the authority of this House .to expend from the Treasurer's Advance Account the sum of  £100,000,  some explanation is necessary. If the right honorable gentleman had intimated yesterday that  £80,000  of the amount would be expended in paY.ing for works already authorized by Parliament </para>

Although the Treasurer intimated yester-. day that some of the money would be required to carry on public works, he did not indicate that anything like  £80,006  was needed for that purpose. Had the information been given earlier, the debate would probably have been shorter. </para>

                        <para>- We have now dragged certain information from one Minister and another, which we have got by way of interjection or in little bits of speeches. After two days' debate, we have succeeded in obtaining for the people a statement as to how the money which we are voting is to he expended. I do not think there has been undue delay, but the Government must be held responsible for whatever delay has occurred, because the Treasurer did not, on introducing the Bill, make a proper explanation of its items. </para>
