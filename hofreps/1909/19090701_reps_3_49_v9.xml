                    <para>. - It is stated in to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that I persistently advocated the payment of ,&#163;600 a year to the  members of this Parliament. I have never advocated the payment of that sum, because that is merely the pay of an ordinary politician, and, being a statesman, I have advocated the paying of a statesman&#39;s salary, namely, ^1,000 a year. The irreducible minimum was ,&#163;750. The newspaper also states that I asked Australia to go to war with Germany. Nothing of the kind. Being myself born in a Federation, knowing that Australia is an integral part of the British Empire, and being a thorough loyalist and believer in one&#39; country, one King, one hope, one aspiration, and one destiny, I have advocated the British Empire going to war with Germany unless that country is prepared to submit to., disarmament, or to agree to arbitration, with a view to disarmament. &#39; The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> also states that the Minister of Defence got up while I was &#34;rambling on a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.&#34;</inline> &#91; was speaking, not about <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts,</inline> but about finance, the basis of the universe. </para>

                    <para>- Yesterday, during an absence from the Chamber which I regret, the honorable member for Perth, under cover of a personal&#39; explanation, delivered himself of a brief&#39;onology, in the course of which he was: pleased to mention my name. It seems, characteristic of those who leave the Labour party that they should seek occasions to apologize fox their defection, and that their apology should become the more abject* as their defection is the more pronounced. In the course of his remarks- the honorable member applied &#39;to me the epithet, &#34;political adventurer.&#34; It would have been more courageous had he given to the House his authorities for doing so, instead of seeking to cover up his track by refusing to name those whom he says have spoken of me by that term. Had the words been used in South Australia, it would be unnecessary for me to draw attention to the matter, but as, in this Parliament, I enjoy the acquaintance of men whom a few months ago I was not privileged to know, it may be necessary to offer two or three words of explanation. Let me say, first, what my political career has not been ; and, secondly, what it has been. I did not join the Labour party in any State in  1899  following upon the establishment of payment of members, and after its pioneers had paved the way. I did not enter politics upon the inauguration of the Federal Parliament. I did not bitterly complain of non-inclusion in the Watson Ministry, and did not leave the Labour party because of non-inclusion in the Fisher Ministry. My career, as is well known to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> though, perhaps, not so well known to other honorable members, is this : I was a foundation member of the Labour party in South Australia. The party was formed there .in  1891,  and for the five years preceding that dale I had filled successfully various offices in a trade union. I contested an electoral district in  1893,  as a duly selected Labour candidate, and since then - with the exception of a period in which T resigned my seat in Parliament to go to the South African war - I have always successfully contested seats as a duly selected Labour man. When I add that I have declined Ministerial preferment, and that, but three months before entering this Parliament, I declined the Agent-Generalship of South Australia, I think that these facts will outweigh the expression which the honorable member, in his anger, used in regard to me. When I said, three or four days ago, that the honorable gentleman left the Labour party because of his non-inclusion in the Fisher Ministry, I spoke words which he had himself put into my mouth. He contested the ballot for inclusion in that Ministry.- </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member&#39;s name went to the ballot on two successive occasions. Finding that the voting on his behalf did not increase, he was obliged to make a virtue of necessity, and withdrew his name. Immediately the final result was&#39; known he came to me, presumably because I am the youngest member of his party in the House, and informed me that he intended to leave it because of the inclusion in the Ministry of a certain gentleman to whom he applied the words which yesterday he applied to me. I remonstrated with him, and endeavoured to dissuade him, but my remonstrances were of no avail. He assured me that he intended to leave the party, pointing out that there were opportunities for him outside it. I reminded him that the method! of selection was precisely that which he has claimed as his own especial method, namely, the elective one, but even that was of no use, the honorable member finally assuring me that he - intended to leave the party because he found that other good men had succeeded after leaving it. </para>

                            <para>. - I do not think I need offer any apology to the House for speaking on this motion. When I rose last week, I did not intend to occupy a great deal of time, and hoped to conclude my remarks on Friday before the House rose. As honorable members know, however, I was subjected to much interruption ; and, not desiring to inconvenience honorable members who wished to catch their trains to the different States, I asked leave to continue my remarks. At the time the House rose, I was dealing with the necessity that had arisen for displacing the Fisher Government, and&#39; intended to point out later on certain proposals of theirs, which, in my opinion, were quite antagonistic to the best interests of the country. I was dealing particularly with an act of their administration which to me, appeared a .gross violation of a distinct pledge given by the previous Ministry with the concurrence of the Labour party as to the trust fund for naval purposes, and endeavouring to show that, although the Labour party repudiated any responsibility for the pledge, it was none the less one in which they by their voices had acquiesced. In fact, some of the members of the Labour party went so far as to almost speak <inline font-style="italic">ex cathedra,</inline> on the part of the Government, in assuring the House that not a penny of the money would be touched until &#39;it had been voted by Parliament. In support of that view I quoted from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> statements made by colleagues of the present Leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for West Sydney, who was Attorney-General in the Fisher Ministry, ;ind the honorable member for Hindmarsh, another Labour Minister, both of whom were responsible with their leader for the violation of a pledge to which I was calling attention. There are several quotations I could make; but the addition of one other will suffice to show that I had reason and proof for what I said. On the occasion in question the late Leader of the Labour party, the honorable member for South Sydney, said - </para>

The method of expenditure will come up for consideration when the Bill is before us, and the details are presented. But this, as I take it, is to be an indication of the desire of Parliament in respect of the naval side of Defence. As to details, we have, of course, the general scheme of the Prime Minister, but the class of ships upon which this money and any supplementary sum is to be spent is a matter for future consideration. </para>

What I say is that the honorable member for Newcastle, amongst others, agreed to this vote only on the understanding that not one penny would be spent until specific authority had been given after a scheme had been approved. This was the assurance given by the present Prime Minister, and it was acquiesed in by the present Leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Hindmarsh, and others, and by the honorable member for West Sydney. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member has a short memory. He said, on page 12085 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> that he agreed, &#34; with the proviso which had been advocated.&#34; The plea that the Labour Government were in no way bound by the action of their predecessors is simply a puerile pretext for evading responsibility. One member of the Labour party went so far as to reprove the honorable member for Wentworth for even doubting the wisdom of accepting the assurance that no money would be spent without the approval of the House j and if there were no other justification for displacing the&#39; Fisher Ministry this great violation of an unequivocal pledge would be sufficient. I do not wish to take up time by reading further quotations ; but, if honorable member will refer to a speech I made, as reported on page 2402 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 27th November, 1908, they will see that I carefully warned the Labour party what they might expect, and that they could not remain in office very long ; I warned them that in assuming office they were taking a seat over a mine in which was a lighted fuse which, at any time, might fire the powder , and blow them up. They knew they had nothing else to expect. If solemn pledges given in respect to the expenditure of moneys voted for trust funds are to be violated with impunity, as happened in this case, it will be for the House to carefully consider the real value cf future pledges of the kind, and to require them to be put in writing, or incorporated in a Bill. </para>

                                <para>- .That is a mere quibble. The honorable member was a consenting party to that pledge. I hope we shall never have a recurrence of such conduct ; if we do it will certainly go a long way towards bringing discredit upon our parliamentary institutions. I have spoken to this motion because it is not mv intention to join in the debate on the Ministerial statement or the Address-in-Reply. My desire is to accept the invitation which the Prime Minister extended to honorable members to refrain from taking full advantage of their privileges in this regard, and to offer their criticisms of the whole of these motions on only one or other of them. Another reason why the Labour Government should have been displaced was furnished in the speech which they put into the mouth of  His Excellency  the Governor-General at the opening of this Parliament. That speech contained unification and Socialistic proposals calculated to seriously injure the country. The policy of Socialism, piece by piece, which has been so persistently advocated bv various members of the party, was introduced in the Labour Government&#39;s programme, and was intended, I presume, to be dealt with during this session. I refer more particularly to paragraph 17, in which we have the statement - </para>

It is proposed, also, to extend the jurisdiction of Parliament wilh regard to trusts and combinations in restraint of trade, and to provide for the nationalization of monopolies. </para>

We were to have a further instalment of their Socialistic principles in- a proposal for the nationalization of monopolies. </para>

Tariff and other legislation passed lately has been in the direction of establishing monopolies as an excuse for dealing with them later on by the Socialistic system of nationalization. The general public have little idea of the extent to which the Socialistic aims of the Labour party are sought to be furthered by them, both inside and outside this House. We have had from that party definite proposals for the nationalization of the shipping, industry, the tobacco industry, the sugar industry, the iron industry, and coal mines. That is a fairly big list to start with. But we have had, in addition, a proposal submitted by a member of the party in another place providing for an alteration of the Constitution, by adding at the end of section 51 the following paragraph - </para>

                                <para>- I am opposed at all times to State Socialism. I am opposed to monopolies,&#39; and to legislation by the Labour Party, which would create monopolies. I am certainly opposed to the creation of monopolies merely for the purpose of using them as a Socialistic peg for nationalization. The motion to which I have just referred covers a large measure of Socialism, but I do not know that the electors of the Commonwealth have ever expressed themselves in favour of Socialism. It is a proposal made by a representative of a minority of the people - by a member of a party which is only a small minority in the two Houses, and we are entitled, as the representatives of the majority of the people, to resist such propositions until  they have received, at a general election, the indorsement of the electors, who are the real arbiters. Monopolies can be most effectively checked, not by Socialism, .but by freer competition. We also had a pro- &#34;posal by a former Leader of the Labour party to forcibly take some ,&#163;8,000,000 of the people&#39;s savings from the banking institutions, and to use it without payment of interest. I come now to the attitude of the Labour party in the State Parliaments in regard to establishing monopolies. We have been assured from time to time that the State and Commonwealth Labour parties have the same aims and objects. That is borne out. by the proposals of the State parties, which dovetail so perfectly into those of the Commonwealth party. A new plank adopted by the Labour Council sitting in Melbourne in April last was as follows : - </para>

                        <para>That is a pretty drastic, step towards the ultimate goal of Socialism - a concrete proposal to substitute for the present system of production for profit a system of production for use. The commercial interests pf the community are to be entirely sacrificed, trading is to be stopped, nobody is to produce for profit, and production, so far as the Labour party can control it, is to be for use, and the products are to be divided amongst those who are engaged in the industry only. The employes are to be the consumers of the wealth they produce, so that none of it is to be exchanged for other forms of wealth. They are to produce wealth only to consume it themselves. What will be the commercial outlook of this country if proposals of that kind are to be seriously entertained ? Undoubtedly, if the party that embodies views of that kind in its platform were returned with a majority it would make a serious effort to carry some of those ridiculous proposals into effect. If they did succeed they would bring about such a condition of affairs that most people, including those on whose be&#34;half such legislation was enacted, would think this a good country to get out of. Singularly enough, whilst the members of the Labour party claim to be the saviours of the country, the only friends of the workers, and the only ones who care about Labour legislation, they are always holding up New Zealand as a shining example of what democratic legislation will do for the worker. But there is no Labour party in New Zealand, and only a&#39;t the last election the first Labour member was returned to the Dominion Parliament. All that progressive legislation which the Labour party claim as being most beneficial to the wage-earning classes has been accomplished there without the assistance of a Labour party. That is a great satire upon the work of the Labour party here. All that has been accomplished in New Zealand has been the result of Liberal legislation. After all, the sane portions of the Australian Labour party&#39;s proposals are those which have been abstracted from the Liberal programme. The platform adopted by the New South Wales, Labour party contains the following Socialistic proposals : - </para>

                        </quote>
                        <para>That is a fairly comprehensive Socialistic programme. In fact, it covers what some honorable members elegantly term the &#34; whole hog &#34; of Socialism. By the time they have secured., all those things they will  have  established a complete Socialistic State. And those are not items set down for mere academic discussion by debating societies, but serious proposals for actual legislation. Therefore we, in taking the earliest opportunity of sinking sone of our minor and other differences, in order to prevent the realization of legislation of that character, are doing a distinct service to the country, and acting in the interests of the people at large. </para>

Many a good Democrat wears a silk hat and a frock coat. In fact, I have seen some honorable members of the most Socialistic proclivities emulating those fashions. I have given some reasons why it was necessary to make a. serious attempt to unite all the forces in and out of the House which were opposed to Socialistic legislation and to the liberty-destroying aims of the Labour party. An attempt has been made, and let us hope has succeeded, to bring those forces together by the fusion of which the present Prime Minister is the head. What will be the ultimate result of the fusion it is impossible at present to state. But we hope for the best. Certain broad lines of agreement were submitted for the consideration of both parties, and certain proposals were agreed to. When there is a fusion of parties whose members hold widely divergent views, there must be sacrifices, though not necessarily of principle. There must be give and take on nonessential or minor questions if unity is to be obtained on common points of agreement. The basis of fusion submitted to both parties was not that published in the newspapers. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 29th May, 1909, the. first proposal read - </para>

                        <para class="block">There is a great difference between the meaning of those two versions. According to that of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> it would appear that there is to be no interference with the Protectionist policy in rectifying anomalies. Nothing is said about the policy as a policy ; only the rectification of anomalies is dealt with. My reading of that version is that if the rectification of anomalies were proposed, the parties to the agreement, of whom I am not one - whatever they might do in regard to the Protectionist policy itself- would be bound to vote for Protection, and the Free Traders would have to swallow their fiscal principles. The interpretation I put on the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> version is that there is to be no interference .with the Protectionist policy itself either directly or ii&#62; the rectification of anomalies. </para>

                        <para class="block">That statement differs very distinctly from, the two I have read. The &#39;proposal submitted to our party provided for no interference with the Protectionist policy of the Tariff unless for the purpose of rectifying anomalies. As the right honorable member has made this statement to the press, I do not think that I am guilty of any breach of party confidence in referring to the matter, though otherwise I should&#39; not have done so. Under the proposal submitted to us, when the rectification of anomalies was brought forward every Free Trader and every Protectionist would&#39; have had the right to vote according to his conviction and principles. The proposals published in the newspapers takeaway this freedom from Free Traders. I&#39; am one of those who insisted most strongly that there should be no ambiguity in regard to the position of honorable members as to the fiscal question.. </para>

I have given certain pledges to my constituents by which I am bound- It rests with other honorable members, of course, to say what interpretation they put&#39; on this particular clause of the agreement. I am not suggesting that anything underhand or sinister was done. I did not attend the combined meeting of the two parties, where something may have been done of which I had no knowledge, because I was informed beforehand that the selection of the leader was cut and dried. </para>

                                <para>- Accidents happen in politics as elsewhere; one can never tell. I do not wish to create the impression that I think that anything underhand has been done. There may have been a subsequent arrangement, resulting in the proposal which I have read being communicated to the press. My attitude to the fusion is one, not of antagonism, but of friendliness, tempered with caution. I propose to support it, if the accepted terms of the compact itself are observed, when I think that the best interests of the country will be promoted by the legislation proposed, and if its proposals do not conflict with the direct pledges which I have given to my constituents, or with my political principles. I do not think I should be expected to do more, and when it is stated that I am taking a stand as an independent, the words do not correctly define my attitude. When I used the word &#34; independent &#34; on Friday, I merely meant acting independently in the sense that I was free to exercise my right of criticism of the proposals of the Government, or any other proposals not immediately covered by the agreement for the fusion of the parties. I do not commit myself body and soul to the fusion ; that is to say, I am not prepared to indiscriminately support the Fusion Government in any and every circumstance. I must be guided by principle and conscience in giving the Fusion a general support. </para>

                                <para>- Then it escaped my notice. This is a matter, in my opinion, of extreme urgency, which should be dealt with at the earliest possible moment, in the interests of not only New South Wales, but of the Commonwealth generally.&#39; I cannot help noticing that, since the fusion, there have been persistent attempts on the part of a section of the Melbourne press to defer the settlement of this question, on the ground that it is not necessary to proceed with it, seeing that we are doing very well as a Parliament where we are. I object to the pernicious influence sought to be exercised by the Melbourne newspapers, and especially by the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which I regard as one of the most mischievous publications in the whole of the Commonwealth, and certainly antagonistic, at all times, to the State I represent. While I never forget that I am a Federal representative, I always insist on my right to prevent any assaults on the interests of New South Wales, -and we have seen various indications of a desire on behalf of the Victorian press to aim a blow at that State whenever opportunity occurs. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is the arch enemy of New South Wales. Under the circumstances, the sooner we are removed to a Federal Capital, the better it will be for the community, because we shall then obtain something approaching a Federal atmosphere. </para>

We, as representatives, are accused by the Melbourne newspapers of being actuated by &#39; a parochial spirit, but, as a matter of fact, if we desire to see a true parochial spirit, we have only to read the Melbourne press and to listen to the utterances of some 01 our representatives in the border constituencies of New South Wales, who take their cue from the Melbourne newspapers. The idea in the minds of the newspaper proprietors of Melbourne seems to be that Federation was instituted in the interests of Victoria, and particularly in the interests of Melbourne and the Melbourne press. It is necessary to keep careful watch, even in view of the present fusion of parties, and see that no undue dominating influence is exercised by these newspapers on Commonwealth legislation. I sincerely hope that the present Government will seek to settle the Federal Capital question at the earliest possible moment, in order that our politics may be free from the baneful influence to which I have referred. </para>

                            <para>.- The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes once remarked that a well-known politician in New South Wales reminded him. of a mole burrowing in the ground - he could not be seen for the dust he made. It strikes me that in connexion with the present political situation, a good deal of dust has been stirred up with the plain object of diverting attention from the serious issue before us. Even before Parliament met, we had the press stating what the Labour party were going to do, but I am sure that no one can say that there was any correctness in the forecast. We were told that the Labour party were going to resort to all sorts of obstruction, and, even now, the pr&#39;ess of Melbourne has the impudence, under a large cross-heading, to charge us with &#34; stone-walling.&#34; This is really a reflection on our party, because I think that, if we desired to &#34;stone-wall,&#34; we could do very much better than we have done up to the present. As a matter of fact, we have not gone beyond the bounds of ordinary business; but, if occasion did arise, we should perhaps be able to show what a&#39; true &#34; stone- wall &#34; is. The honorable member for Lang has long been known for his connexion with the Free Trade and Single Tax party, to which he adhered with great loyalty ; and it is highly interesting to find that gentleman now barracking for a great Protectionist leader, and supporting a Government of this kind. Two other honorable members have spoken from behind the </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">Government, and the Prime Minister may be congratulated on the evidences of loyalty thus given. It strikes me that we shall have to go a considerable distance ere the Prime Minister will be able to justify his words that this fusion is not a mere coalition or union for a Parliament, but a permanent union of the people of the country. We have yet to find evidence of that loyalty which is necessary to a real fusion ; and, in supporting the motion before the House, I intend to briefly give-some points of the history of the present political development, so far as they appear on the surface. It is quite evident that there has  been a great deal of secret negotiation; the honorable member for Lang has told us a little of it, although he was &#34;not quite there.&#34; It is not at all clear exactly what took place, but we shall no doubt ascertain in time. Honorable members are fully acquainted with the change that took place last session, when the Leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Parramatta, tried his hand at wooing the present Prime Minister, who, however, was very coy and shy of entanglement. When the House went into recess, honorable members will remember the great cross-headings in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> booming the tour of the Prime Minister in Tasmania, and throughout the continent, which they described as a &#34;great Liberal a-wakening.&#34; But the term &#34;Liberal&#34; is used by the Prime Minister in a very different sense from that used by the newspaper I have mentioned; and I propose to show what the difference is. No one can complain of the Prime Minister stumping the country, and trying to rouse his party ; but there was an effort made to weld together the different elements in the House as a combination against the Labour party.  For a considerable time, however, no success followed those efforts. I shall read the programme presented by the Prime Minister to the country during his tour, and presently compare it with that now before us, making due allowance for revision, and so forth.- The Labour party have their objective, and, of course, other parties follow their example, and must also have an objective. This was declared in the case of the Prime Minister as - </para>

                        <para class="block">Matters went on without any special change until the late Prime Minister, the honorable member for Wide &#39;Bay, delivered his policy speech at Gympie. That honorable gentleman presented something like thirty different items in his programme, including new Protection, land and absentee tax, effective Federal arbitration, old-age pensions, to be paid in  July, invalid pensions. Australian Navy, finance, no borrowing, High Commissioner to be appointed, compulsory military training from the ages of ten to twenty years, medical inspection of school children, encouragement of volunteer rifle clubs, nationalization of the iron industry, taking over the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island, dealing with the question of the Federal Capital, the transcontinental railway, immigration, an amendment of the Old-age Pensions Act, a Commonwealth note issue, and legislation affecting bills of exchange, marine insurance, bankruptcy, electoral and Public Service reforms, navigation, seamen&#39;s compensation, and Customs. That programme was received with acclamation by the people of Australia. I have felt the pulse of the public at some twenty-six meetings that I have addressed - fourteen in Tasmania, and twelve in New South Wales - and every reference I made to the Fisher Government&#39;s policy at those  gatherings was received with applause. Even the press could not criticise our proposals; they simply asked how it was proposed to find the money in order to give effect to them. Then, again, I found that the suggestion that we should give a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> was received with derision, and I venture to say that that is the experience of every honorable member who has had an opportunity at public meetings to test the feeling of the people. The policy of the late Government was no sooner announced than an underground scheme was set on foot. That policy struck a blow at vested interests, providing, as it did, for a graduated land tax, which would hit the big estates, and for the nationalization of monopolies. A big effort was therefore made to bring together the other parties in -the Parliament, in order that the doom&#39; of the Labour party might be sealed; and steps taken to prevent it from carrying any of these proposals into effect. No attempt was made to condemn the Government policy ; our opponents knew better than to do so. They simply determined to undermine our position. One of the first steps taken in that direction was an attempt by the Employers&#39; Federation to nobble the present Prime Minister. That honorable gentleman was invited to meet the Chamber of Commerce in Sydney, and a secret circular was sent out by .the Employers&#39; Federation to insure a packed meeting. We know what followed. Messrs. Farleigh and Beale were deputed to visit Melbourne, and a modern Joshua appeared on the field and commanded the sun of progress to stand still. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hogg,</inline> of the Chamber of Commerce, was the fourth representative appointed to carry out negotiations, and those gentlemen worked hard to secure sufficient influence to induce the honorable member for Ballarat to agree to a fusion of parties. The matter was put in the hands of the right honorable member for Swan, who ultimately succeeded in winning over the present Prime Minister, and the fusion was soon brought about. I propose now to make a quotation from that ,great Liberal newspaper, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> as clearly emphasizing the situation at the time of which I speak. Up to the 14th May, the possibility of a Coalition appeared so hopeless that the right honorable member for East Sydney said, as reported on 6th Ma)r - </para>

                            <para>There are those who- say that the differences between a Cook and a Deakin are slight as compared with those between a Deakin and a Fisher. But that is just the reverse of the truth. The reason why the Deakin Government was able to hold office so long by the help of the Labour party was just because on nine points out of ten the Liberal and the Labour policies are the same. Consequently, the Liberal leader&#39;s  difficulty  with Labour is not in a matter of policy. It is that Labour, even while in a kind of loose alliance with Liberalism, has proclaimed itself the relentless foe of its own allies in the constituencies. Liberals, therefore, must fight Labour in the electorates, whatever they may do in Parliament. It is, of course, exceedingly difficult to induce Liberals to support a Labour party in the House when that party is sapping and mining all the Liberal seats &#34;in &#34;the country. This is really where the political shoe pinches. And in .the irritation it produces we must have very much sympathy with the Liberal party and its leader. Still, when all these allowances are made, and even when such considerations are emphasized, they do not suffice to excuse the Liberal party permitting itself to be absorbed in a combination of Conservatism and anti-Socialists, where it must become a back number, without power, without influence, and only a disappointed spectator of the drift of high purposes. In this time of stress and strain, when all kinds of influences are being employed to submerge the Liberal party and its leader, it is the duty of that party more than ever to stand firm in its integrity, and the decision of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> to efface himself as leader means the virtual effacement of the party whose fortunes were intrusted to his care. </para>

                        <para class="block">At this time the honorable member for Ballarat proposed to stand aside. He did not care to lead the contemplated Coalition, but the pressure brought to bear upon him was so great that he was ultimately squeezed  into it. The honorable member has said that the only excuse which his party had for declining to support the Labour Government was that it would not grant to some of his followers immunity from opposition. </para>

                                <para>- Every one knows that he has made it. I come now to the complaint made by the Liberal party as to our attitude in regard to the constituencies. We claim that we conduct our business on democratic lines. Our platform is drawn up not by politicians, but by the people - by organizations, leagues, and unions, comprising many thousands of the electors. In New South Wales, for instance, there are some 86,000 registered trade unionists, so that those who speak of the unions as comprising only a few men have no knowledge of the real facts. The honorable member for Ballarat has always publicly advocated that politicians should create a policy and that the people should follow them. That is an autocratic stand to take up, and is altogether wrong. We contend that reforms should be initiated by the people themselves, and that policy has been adopted by us. When honorable members of the Deakin party urge that we should induce our followers to grant them immunity from opposition they ask us to do something which we have no power to do, and which, if we had, we should decline to do. It is absolutely wrong in principle. It is for the people themselves - the leagues, organizations, and constituencies generally to determine the matter for themselves. What right have we to compel the leagues and other organizations outside, as suggested by the honorable member for Ballarat, to grant the Liberal party immunity from opposition, if they are not inclined to do so? We have provided for adult suffrage, and should not deny to any individual the right to vote for any candidate he pleases. If that right is to be denied the electors, why do not the Government bring in a Bill to prohibit the electors choosing their own representatives ? It is only because the Liberal party thought that the people would not recognise the fallacy of such a proposition that the Deakin party made it. The same complaint was made by the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> as if we should be justified in throwing over the principles of a life-time. It is an absolute admission that the honorable member for Ballarat cannot depend on a majority in any of the constituencies to support him. If the honorable member for Maribyrnong, for instance, cannot get in if Labour runs a candidate, he can only get in by Labour support. There is, therefore, no majority in the constituency that really supports the honorable member for Maribyrnong, and the same may be said of the honorable member for Bourke, the honorable member for Batman, and other Government supporters who have been so long associated with the honorable member for Ballarat. Then they put forward in their platform proposals to secure majority rule. If they have a majority, they have nothing to fear from what any local league may do. To put that kind of statement before the people as a- justification for the sacrifice of principles is most ridiculous. It will not stand a moment&#39;s examination. You must either coerce the electors by denying them their rights or allow them to make their own choice. Then we are told that we, as members of Parliament, have great influence, and that if we gave the local. bodies advice they might take it; but they cannot expect us to go to the different constituencies and speak in support of members whom we regard as being often unreliable. Our experience has been that the &#34; good as Labour &#34; man, as he calls himself, has been anything but reliable&#34; at a crisis, when we were going to make history by a vote. </para>

I am showing the hollowness of the excuse put forward for the fusion, that the Labour party outside - which is not the party in the House, because we do not control it, and have no right to control it - puts up candidates against members of the Deakin party. No one has a right to control the electors but themselves. </para>

It is also an admission that they have been neglecting organization. The honorable member for Ballarat found that out. He went round to organize the Liberal party, but apparently did not meet with sufficient success, or great influences were brought to bear upon him to bring about the present situation. I have not quite finished quoting from that great organ, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> because, it occasionally does contain most able articles, that on the facts are unanswerable.

                            <para>The one thing which stands out conspicuously in the present political situation is that the Leader of the Liberal party is preparing once again to split that party into two sections, and thus virtually wipe it out of existence. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> does not contemplate this. No one suspects him of an act of deliberate treachery to his own party. But any one who opens his eyes can see plainly that that must be the immediate result of any fusion with the Conservative parties of the Corner and the straight Opposition.. At present the Liberal party in Parliament is fifteen strong. This has come about through the defection of men like </para>

The recent campaigns of its leader in Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland were undertaken for the sole purpose of consolidating Liberal strength in the next appeal to the country. The party has recently adopted a political programme for the immediate future, and all this was done in full accord with
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline>
                                its leader, on the understanding that he was determined against coalescing with Conservatism, except on the understanding that the Liberal programme is to be made the basis of any new combination. All these facts are so well known, so recent and so fully accepted that no possible dispute can arise as to their accuracy.
                            </para>
                            <para>Suddenly the whole situation is changed like the flash of a cinematograph. And the changes are made by the Liberal leader without any consultation with his party. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> announces that as he cannot get the Leader of the Opposition to agree to the Liberal policy, he has given up the idea on his own account, but has commissioned <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest to undertake the task, making the best terms he can, on the understanding that should <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest strike a bargain with the direct Opposition, he <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Deakin),</inline> while taking no personal share in it, will counsel such of his own followers as may choose to join the new combination. It is quite well known that nothing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> may do or say will induce the solid body of Liberals to go over and follow a Conservative Government led jointly by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook.</inline> To do so would be to play the part of rank treachery to the electors who sent them into Parliament. It is inconceivable that Messrs. Wise, Mauger, Hume Cook, Chanter, Coon and Salmon and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne could dream of such an alliance as that mentioned. They could not meet their electors after such a shameful <inline font-style="italic">volte, face,</inline> and such a turning of their backs on all the professions on which they gained their seats. Indeed, it is notorious that most of them have already let this be known. If, then, these seven Liberals refuse to stultify themselves in the manner which their leader is suggesting, what becomes of the Liberal party? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> may carry seven or eight with him into the Conservative alliance, but only at the expense of annihilating at once his own party and its central and dominating position in the Parliament. On the consummation of such a movement as fusion under a Forrest and a Cook, there would no longer be a Liberal party, a Liberal leader or a Liberal platform. All the recent work of organization and consolidation would be cast to the winds, and that not bv the consent of those who have been engaged in it, but solely  by the deliberate act- of the man who was trusted as its leader. A more unthinkably absurd outcome of the situation cannot be conceived. It is political suicide in its most degrading form </para>

To the true Federalist it is a monstrous proposition that such a right should be withheld from the Commonwealth. To the Protectionist it is the very essential of his creed.

The culpability for failing in this natural alliance - an alliance which might have proved so profitable to the  country  - lies not with Liberalism, which was always willing, but with Labour, which was adamant against co-operation. </para>

                        <para class="block">The blame must rest upon that party which definitely refused to form an alliance. I have quoted briefly the proposals for legislation which the Fisher Government put before this Parliament. I have done so in order that it may be seen that the promises publicly made in the Gympie speech, and other addresses delivered elsewhere, would have been kept had the late Government had an opportunity to give effect to them. Nothing has been said in criticism of the policy of the Labour party. The reason for putting it out of office is one which the honorable member for Ballarat has declarer! to be insufficient. That he has been swallowed up by the Conservative elements in this Parliament justifies our contention that he has gone back on his principles. I have briefly indicated how the Employers&#39; Federation worked to bring about a fusion by sending round circulars, so as to pack meetings of the Chambers of Commerce with &#39; &#39; the right-thinking persons,&#34; and in other ways. Messrs. Hogg,. Farleigh, Beale, and Joshua meet in secret caucus with the leaders of the new party. Like the witches in <inline font-style="italic">Macbeth,</inline> they danced round the cauldron containing the ingredients for the fusion, and, from the nature of those ingredients, we know that there must have been a great deal of &#34; bubble, bubble, toil, and trouble &#34; before any result was obtained. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua,</inline> when interviewed subsequently, speaking on behalf of all four manufacturers, said - </para>

Then followed political assassination. The honorable member got his knife into the contracting parties. Now he appears to have committed political bigamy, and I am afraid that the desire of one of his spouses to have her own way, and the caustic tongue of the other lady, may drive him to suicide. I do not see that the combination can do any good.

                                <para>- He corrected only one word, and I am willing to accept that corle:.1017. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> has shown that it was a complete <inline font-style="italic">volte face</inline> for those led by the honorable member for Ballarat to join with notorious Conservatives, who, for years, have been sitting in opposition. To do so, they abandoned the principles on which they were elected. When a member has changed his political views, he should, if he wishes to remain in Parliament, appeal to the people for their sanction to the change. Members have no right to sell their principles, as honorable gentlemen opposite have done. There were eight planks in the platform which the honorable member for Ballarat put before the country, but the fusion platform contains not a word about Federal unity or preferential trade. Preferential trade was one of the proposals on which the Deakinites went to the country, but it has now been thrown overboard, as has the principle of Federal unity. The reason for this is shown very clearly. Then there is another plank, which the Government are introducing, no doubt to placate the honorable member for Parramatta and others who are always speaking on behalf of the States, instead of leaving their interest to be put forward by themselves. We find that the Liberal leader has sacrificed the two principles of Preferential Trade and Protection ; and my object is to convict the Prime Minister, and those who follow him, of a <inline font-style="italic">volteface.</inline> In regard to new Protection, no consideration whatever  is given to the consumers, although that was a point on which much stress was laid at the elections, and during the recess, by the honorable gentleman. It was a point discussed here, and emphasized very strongly  and I remember the late Leader of the Opposition, the right honorable member for East Sydney, insisting on the protection of the consumer as well as of the manufacturer. Then we have the Liberal leader dropping the White Australia and the immigration planks. We can only read by signs and actions; in fact, we see that the Government will not trust any Minister to speak lest he &#34; lets the cat out of the bag.&#34; Some little light is thrown on the situation by the honorable member for Lang; but it is quite probable that he was not at the meetings, in case he should tell too much. </para>

                                <para>- What I state is the fact. The Government apparently propose to hand over every tiling but defence and postal business to an Inter-State Commission. We find nothing in their programme about economy of administration; and, in: deed, I do not see how they can speak of economy in view of the way in which they propose to give money&#39; away. Then, apparently, the Government have thrown over that important and sacred plank, the direct responsibility of members; and there must be some reason for all those changes. Doubtless, however, we shall have the honorable member for Maribyrnong saying that it is the great Free Trade party of New South Wales and other States, and the Revenue Tariffists, who have sneaked in under the banner of Protection. I challenge anybody to show that what I am saying is incorrect in any way ; and I assert that practically six out of eight planks have been dropped. The programme we have now is not that of the old Liberal party, but that of the new fusion - of Joshua and others, who tell the fusion what is to be done. Then I ought to point out that in the programme there is not a word about State debts, which, with the party now swallowed up by the Conservatives, used to be a burning question. The Prime Minister has adhered to only two of his own planks, and even these have been amended or altered, and evidently now bear a meaning different from that attached to them by Protectionists.&#39; The Prime Minister knows that he never would have carried the Tariff but for the help of the Labour party, the members of which had adopted the policy of new Protection ; and if the honorable gentleman now touches the Tariff, he will have to depend on the support of members like the honorable member for Flinders, who, coming into the House as a Protec.tionist,  voted against the Government duties eighty-two times, paired against them twenty-eight times, and neither voted nor paired 108 times. That representative voted against effective Protection 218 times, voted for the Government duties fifty times, and paired for the Government duty ten times, out of divisions totalling 287. &#39; The programme of Protection has been sacrificed absolutely by the Prime Minister. It is not claimed that the Tariff is absolutely perfect ; such a contention would, I am sure, not be made by the honorable member for Maribyrnong, the honorable member for Batman, the honorable member for Hume, or the Prime Minister. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Corio does not count. He ran very nearly on the Labour platform last election, and was almost ready to sign the pledge ; and it is not surprising that, when he held a meeting recently, he should be met by about six of his followers and a hundred or more of the Labour league crowd. However, he proceeded to denounce the latter as parasites and Tammany people ; and we Know what the electors will do when a representative takes a course of that kind. The Prime Minister, as I have already pointed out, boasts that this fusion is not merely for a Parliament, but for all time ; and, of course, that means, as every member of a fusion expects to be returned, the placing of the fiscal policy in their hands. The object of the fusion is to prevent split votes, which would give an opportunity of success to the Labour party ; and the latter are opposed simply because they are the Labour party. Under such circumstances, what outlook have the Protectionists in Australia, seeing that they depend on a party the majority of whom are absolutely opposed to the policy? In an address, which some honorable members seem to find amusing, the honorable member for Corio made a sarcastic reference, which he applied to the Labour party, but which, in reality, can apply only to the party to which he now belongs. The honorable member said that if the Labour party consisted of thirty members, and twenty-three were Free Traders, the balance of seven could be compelled to vote Free Trade. That applies with full force to honorable members opposite, but it cannot apply to the Labour party, no member of which is bound on the fiscal question.  What chance has the Prime Minister, and his len or eleven Protectionist followers, against the thirty-two Free Traders and Revenue Tariffists, who now constitute the Government supporters? Yet the Fusion party are pledged to go to the country unitedly, and stand bv each other. </para>

                                <para>- My claim is that we have adopted the policy of the new Protection. We propose to give the local manufacturer the Australian market provided that he pays reasonable wages and does not overcharge the consumer. That is a concise definition of the new Protection which we favour, and it will be recognised that since we have adopted that policy we are the only truly Protectionist party in the Commonwealth Parliament. The Protectionists of the Coalition have no chance of securing effective Protection or any improvement of the present Tariff, and they have also thrust aside the principle of preferential trade. A majority of the members of the Coalition party are opposed both to Protection and to new Protection. </para>

We now have on the Government side of the House a Revenue party, the majority of whom are opposed to Protection. Those who desire the growth of Australian manufactures, and the observance of Australian conditions of labour in connexion with them,- must now look to the Labour party ; there is no other party that they can trust. No objection was taken by the Deakin party to &#34;our policy, and the late Government was turned out of office, not because of any want of proper administration, but solely to enable a majority against the Labour party to be obtained in this House. As a matter of fact, the fusion was brought about by the monopolists - by the big land owners and all those who have been fighting Labour, both industrially and politically, for many years. Their desire .was to prevent a blow being struck at land monopoly, and they have certainly succeeded-. What do the Government propose in regard to the new Protection ? I do not imagine that they will do anything to give effect to their proposals- </para>

                                <para>- The Government will never do what they are aiming at if I can prevent them, and I do not think that the country will allow them to do what they propose. Much useful legislation has been passed, but if the present Government are to remain in office there must be retrogression. Ministers would have us believe that they have completely changed, and that we have reached the political millennium, but we know that changes do not come about so rapidly. Let us look at their co-called -new Protection policy. They are going to ask the States to allow them &#39;to set up an Inter-State Commission, with power to look after production and exchange, to find new markets abroad, and to extend local industries. Those four duties would in themselves keep the members of the Commission busy, but we find that they are also to run .a Labour bureau, to study unemployment, to deal with the Tariff and anomalies in the Tariff, and to arrange for uniform conditions of industry. We are not told whether they are going to find employment for the workers, but if they are to study unemployment they must associate with the <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> unemployed. As to the proposal that the Inter-State Commission shall arrange for uniform conditions of industry, or, in other words, abolish unfair competition, I would remind the House that there are two ways by. which that may be done. In the first place, the rates of wages paid throughout the Commonwealth may be reduced to the level of the lowest prevailing in any one State, or they mav be raised to the highest standard observed in any State. I do not think that the Government are likely to select as members of the Commission men who will be prepared to raise wages; on the contrary, I think that they will select those who are prepared to bring about a reduction of wages. The InterState Commission is also to conduct an agricultural bureau and to deal with immigrants. In short, so many duties are to be intrusted to it that scarcely anything will be left for the attention of this Parliament. On the face of it, the proposal is an ill-considered and ridiculous one. When the appointment of an Inter-State Commission was originally suggested, the intention was that it should consist of three men, but it would be impossible to find three men capable of dealing with all the questions which it is now proposed to refer to it. The Prime Minister did not explain how all this work was to be done by the Commission ; he simply read the Ministerial proposals and proceeded to divert attention to the proposition of the Labour Government, that the Constitution should be so amended as to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to deal with industrial matters. It was certainly not our intention, as suggested by the honorable member for Ballarat, to take steps to secure absolute Commonwealth control of all industrial matters. We proposed, not that the States should be stripped of their existing powers in regard to industry, but that steps should be taken to enable industrial matters to be dealt with under a Federal system of arbitration, which would not interfere with any State system which was working smoothly. The present Government, however, propose the creation of one central body to attend to all these great questions.&#39; I defy any one to prove that the scheme is workable. It means a cumbrous central organization having numerous branches, which must add enormously to the cost of administration. That I dare say is the reason why we find in the Ministerial statement no reference to economy of administration. The Government know that by providing all these billets for their friends they must add materially to the cost of administration. The party on the Government benches cannot be correctly described as a Coalition, because it really comprises many parties. It is a mixture of individualistic units, no two members of which are in agreement on any one topic. Having thrown over-board Protection as the chief bone of contention among them, they have spread over the Ministerial statement a mass of proposals so stated that it is impossible to understand what they mean. I propose now to show who are behind and actually controlling the Government. We find sitting behind the Prime Minister the honorable member for Flinders, and I shall indicate what reason there is for the working classes to hope for any consideration at the hands of such a Ministry. They have thrown over the new Protection, and abandoned any desire to protect the consumer. The commercial classes can form any combine they like, because the Government are backed up by the Employers&#39; Federation. No sooner did we carry out our promise to the manufacturers to guarantee them the Australian market on condition, that they paid decent wages, than they took action in the Law Courts, and upset the Excise provisions. This Government is a Government to aid monopoly. It was put into power, and is supported bv monopolists, and it is appealing to the monopolists to return it again at the next election. The big land monopolists are already planking down their hundreds to insure the return of those who are opposed to this party, which is now the only Democratic party in the House. There used to  be  other honorable members with Democratic tendencies, but they have sold themselves, and are now in the heart of the enemy&#39;s camp. Our experience of the honorable member for Flinders in Victoria is widely known. One action of his - the introduction of the Coercion Act - will live for ever in the memories of the people of Australia. That was one of the most autocratic measures ever introduced. In fact, it had no parallel in the world. Can the man who could conceive of bringing in that measure be any friend to labour? I can give other instances. There used to be a very good Factories Act in Victoria providing for Wages Boards. When the honorable member for Flinders was Premier of Victoria, he destroyed the value of that part of the Act. A Wages Board consisted of five representatives of each side, with an independent  chairman,  and a simple majority used to decide the question. That did not suit the honorable member. He introduced a provision requiring a seven-tenths majority, so that the employers had to gain over two of the employes, or the employes to win over two of the employers. Honorable members know the position in which employes on Wages Boards have been placed. Many of them have lost their jobs, and been boycotted for their actions on Wages Boards, so that the effect of that provision can be realized. Then the honorable member created an </para>

                        <para class="block">Appeal Court from the decision of Wages Boards, so that the lawyers could come in and ruin the unions with their heavy costs. He introduced also the &#34; reputable employer &#34; standard, admittedly a difficult thing to interpret. In one instance in Melbourne, where a miserable sweating wage was paid, the only &#34;reputable employer&#34; that could be found was one who paid what was acknowledged to be a very low wage, but under the law introduced by the honorable member for Flinders, he had to be taken as the standard. Of course, as a representative and agent of employers, that was the very kind of thing aimed at by the honorable member. One of the most outrageous provisions, however, was that there should be absolutely no limitation of apprentices. Every one who has studied industrial questions knows that there must be some limitation, because without it many employers would do all their work with boy labour, the Australian youths, fresh from school, being very quick and intelligent, and soon earning very fair wages. Under that system, the apprentices do not get their training, as they ought to get it. from proper expert workmen. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Flinders took great care to have no legal limitation of apprentices, and then, lest there should be reasonable conditions in country districts, he knocked out the provision that the Act should apply to shires, and so confined- its operation to the metropolitan districts. Now let us turn to the honorable member for Fawkner&#39;s record. He is reported as follows - </para>

                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">That is to say, the employers would not have any of these things, but would go on rejoicing in sweating their fellow men, if they were allowed to do so. In fact, they would continue to introduce into their businesses practices to which,&#39; in other circumstances, they would not subject their fellow- men. In this connexion, I would like to emphasize an important fact. You will have noticed, sir, that in all the laws governing mankind, individuals are dealt with and punished for any breach of them, but it is different in the case of companies, or corporations, as the Americans call them. If ever we deal with the Companies Act, this is a point that should be remembered. When a board of directors governing the affairs of a company - and nearly all business is now carried on by companies - meet together, they do things as a Board that would be positively revolting to their manhood as individuals. They will say, as a Board, &#34; We are sorry to have to do this, but the shareholders expect it. We are here to make this business pay.&#34; Then they treat their workmen and others in a way that no individual employer would be guilty of. In short, under the company system, a new kind of ethics has been introduced. So organizations such as the Employers&#39; Union take up an attitude collectively which as individuals they could not justify. They are opposed to everything that will improve the conditions of the workers. They are opposed to industrial peace, unless they can secure it by freedom of contract. The honorable member for Fawkner sits behind the Government, and has considerable influence with them.  His  views are in keeping with the statement of the  President  of the Chamber of Commerce the other day, that he was against a reduction of the working hours below forty-eight per week. They would not favour forty-eight hours if they could get a lot more. When the building trades of Melbourne had a strike to secure a forty-four hours week, and when their demand was about to be conceded, the Employers&#39; Federation intervened and coerced the builders to refuse it. Their secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole,</inline> said that while forty-four hours was reasonable for that industry, they would have to give way on other things if they gave way on that. That is the attitude of the body which now governs the Government, and whose guiding hand the Government must obey. If they do not, they will be put out, and some more confidential circulars will be posted round by the secretary of the Employers&#39; Federation to form a new political organization. I have here a report of the InterState Conference of Employers&#39; Unions, from which I propose to quote some of the resolutions, but I wish first to account for the striking out of the White Australia plank from the platform that the honorable member for Ballarat submitted to the country. We know that the honorable member for Parkes has always opposed any restriction upon coloured immigration, and  would admit all the coloured races of the world if he had his way. One of the members of the present Cabinet was for many years a member of the Black Labour party in Queensland, and we have no evidence that he has changed his views. The  President  of that Conference said - </para>

                        <para class="block">Those are the sentiments of the gentle(rr.an at the head of a powerful organization representing all the capitalists and employers of Australia - the body that has been the principal cause of every big industrial disturbance, from the maritime strike in 1890, which it engineered and organized, down to the latest trouble. The members of that body said, &#34;Hear, hear &#34; to those sentiments of their President. They were opposed to the White Australia policy, and would like to bring back the kanakas. Those are the people who are going to frame the new Protection proposals and look after the interests of the working classes. This is one of the resolutions passed at the Conference - </para>

                        <para class="block">That, very fittingly, was proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Darling, and heartily approved of by the Conference. Freedom of contract means an absolute refusal to recognise trades unions, which have been a powerful weapon in the hands of the working classes to secure justice. Both here and in the Old World they have done a great deal to improve the lot of the workers. If that body of employers had their way, there would be no workers&#39; organizations, and no collective bargaining, but everybody would have to take what the employer offered him, and be civil. I cannot understand how any man could have the courage to stand up in any public gathering and openly oppose the improvement of the lot of the great mass of the people who produce the wealth of the country, and upon whom the employers have to depend for their living. The Conference also opposed the White Australia policy, declaring that &#34; the present Immigration  Act was a bar to the progress of the Commonwealth, and hurtful to Imperial sentiment.&#34; They also declared against legalizing the eight hours day. They have always been opposed to any shortening of the hours of labour ; but I have quoted sufficient to show their attitude. That is the body whose representatives assisted the Government to frame their new Protection proposals. We have the novel experience of a millennial period, where the secretary of the Anti-Sweating League, who, according to newspaper reports, has .done a great deal to abolish sweating, is dominated by the Federated Employers&#39; Union. The honorable member may shake his head when I say he is dominated by them, but they are the power behind the throne, and it is to them that he will have to look for support, because there is no chance of honorable members on the Ministerial side being elected unless they are backed up by the reactionary forces. They will not get the votes of Labour men this time on the plea that they are as good as Labour men. </para>

Many things may be justified on the score of urgency, but that excuse cannot be pleaded in this instance, because Ministers could have easily waited a week or two for the reassembling of Parliament.

                            - We shall find out later whether that is so or not. The Government, without consulting Parliament, has pledged the country to an expenditure of -&#163;2,000,000. I claim that this action was not justified by the existence of a great national emergency, and that, in any case, there was no immediate urgency. I do not disregard the fact that Great Britain is charged with the defence of the Imperial shipping, but there is no evidence that another great nation is preparing to make an attack upon us. In support of that statement I have one or two quotations to read. About two years ago a body of press representatives visited Germany, and travelled through the country. One of them,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sidney</inline>
                            Low, afterwards published this account of the manner in which they were received and treated -
                        </para>
                        <para>Great, therefore, was our surprise to discover . that we were being made the objects of a really striking demonstration, in which representatives of all classes were concerned. The occasion was seized to show us, and through us our countrymen, that Germany is not universally hostile to us, as some English and some German writers contend ; that, on the contrary, the most influential sections of its population are friendly ; that the fire-eaters, who are s&#39;tirring up strife and bitterness daily, do not express the thoughts and wishes of the vast majority of Germans; and that these latter, so far from welcoming the project of a quarrel with England, with enthusiasm, would regard it with the utmost repugnance and dismay. Exceedingly to our astonishment, we found that our tour was being turned into a sort of triumphal progress, that the newspapers were filling their columns with accounts of our doings, and firing off a salvo of &#34; leaders &#34; in our honour at each of the towns we visited ; that ceremonial and municipal entertainments were being everywhere prepared for us on <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> scale of lavish magnificence; and more than all, that we were receiving gratifying tokens of goodwill, not merely from those we met at banquets and receptions, but from those we encountered in the streets and public places. We discerned no trace of coldness or hostility anywhere; on the contrary, smiles and cordial salutes, and hearty handshakings and handkerchief wavings were our portion in some towns, and politeness and amiable interest in all. That these tributes could be due in the smallest degree to any personal qualities of our own, we . could not be vain enough to imagine. We were made much of because we were supposed to represent, in a higher degree than any of those other British commissions or delegations which have been seen in Germany, the people of Britain as a whole. The Germans said to us, as pointedly as they could : - &#34; Go home, and tell your readers that we like them, that we want them to be friendly to us, that we wish to keep friends with them, whatever they may hear to the contrary.&#34; </para>
                        <para class="block">That shows that the German people have no desire to provoke such a serious thing as a war between themselves and Great Britain. Then, in a recent issue of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> there was published a statement, alleged to have been made by <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Kaiser to an interviewer from the <inline font-style="italic">Shipping Truth,</inline> to whom the Kaiser said - </para>
                        <para>You English make the one big mistake of always imagining my people are seeking to spoil your trade supremacy on the seas. All my people want is a share of it - of course, as large a one as possible. That I and my people are sincerely desirous of having nothing but the amicable relationship with the English peoples may not be believed in your country, but we are used to be misunderstood. It is strange, and a source of great regret to me that, notwithstanding my protestations and the official statements of my Ministers, it should still be possible that your people should cherish so deeply hostile an attitude to my people in their trade relations. </para>
                        <para class="block">He goes on to say that the shipping competition accounts for a good deal of the feeling between the two countries. Let me also quote what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon has said on the subject - </para>
                        <para>I was in England during the progress of the naval scare. It was apparent the whole business was worked up for party purposes by the Tory newspapers and Tory opposition. No responsible person with whom I spoke doubted the supremacy of the British Navy, nor is it doubted&#34; that its absolute supremacy is essential. That its strength must be maintained is unquestionable. Supremacy of the sea need not have the meaning which some German extremists could interpret for it. But it does mean supreme in its power to defend the Empire, and resist aggression. It does not mean that we are out with a broom for our mastheads, determined to sweep all foreigners off the surface of the sea. But its significance is such that no one will threaten the integrity of the Empire, with impunity. The question of the immediate construction of eight instead of four <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts,</inline> irrespective of whether experts did or did not advise that they were necessary, was immediately seized upon for party purposes, in my opinion. Whilst willing that Australia should, if necessary, give not one, but a dozen, <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> (if we could), I think that the two millions or more that a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> would cost might be better spent in establishing or strengthening our own naval forces and Imperial defence in some other way, or it might be by largely increasing our annual contributions towards the cost of the portion of the navy more immediately concerned in the defence of these shores. A little while back it was cabled to London that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was all fora <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> or nothing. Now it would seem that he is for a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> or something else. </para>
                        <para class="block">Since then, on the 26th June last, a cablegram has been published in our newspapers; stating that - </para>
                        <para>Speaking last evening at the National Liberal Club, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Gray, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, referred to Great Britain&#39;s foreign relations, and. declared, &#34;There is nothing under discussion by Germany and Great Britain that is likely to cause difficulties.&#34; </para>
                        <para class="block">My contention is that there was no justification for the scare in the Old World, which was a political move, just as here the action of those who profess to regard the matter as one of great national urgency was a move to strike a blow at the Labour party. That party, however, is led by a man who kept his head ccol, and! who had taken a more effective way to defend Australia than the holding of big meetings. A list of the names of those who assembled on the platform at the Sydney Town Hall shows that the meeting held there was a party move. The excitement engendered on these occasions-  is a danger to the welfare of the country.. When the present Government, without the authority of Parliament, offered a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to the Imperial authorities, it got 1 rebuff, being told as plainly as it could be told by the authorities of a great and dignified nation, speaking to the representatives of an important part of the Empire, &#34;We do not want a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.&#34;</inline> They accepted in its stead the alternative proposal, nebulous though that is. Later on, we shall probably find that the British Admiralty has advised us to spend our money, as the Fisher Government proposed to do, in providing for our local defence by .building up a navy here to co-operate with the British Navy. The Government has sent a gentleman to England to represent Australia at a &#34;Conference which the &#39;Fisher Government had a big hand in bringing about, so that the best arrangements may be made for the defence of the Empire. Those who have spoken about the disloyalty of the Labour party will find, when they come to analyze the acts of the Fisher Government, that we are thoroughly loyal, and that in that Government we had, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, Ministers possessing the courage of their convictions. </para>

                            <para>Like many other diseases, militarism is contagious. One nation can be infected by another until there is an epidemic round the world. A parade of battleships can kindle fires in the blood of even peaceful peoples, and increase naval appropriations in a dozen lands. Is it possible, some one asks, for a world to become insane ? That a community can become crazy was proved by Salem, in the days of the witchcraft delusion ; that a city can lose its head was demonstrated by London, at the time of the Gunpowder Plot; that a continent can become the victim of an hallucination was shown when Europe lost its desire to live, and waited for the end of the world in the year 1000. Why should it be counted impregnable that many nations, bound together by steam and electricity, should fall under the spell of the delusion, and should act for a season like a man who has gone mad. But it is not true that the world has gone mad. . The masses of men are sensible ; but at present the nations are in the clutches of the militarists, and no way of escape has yet been discovered. The deliverance will come as soon as men begin to think and examine the sophistries with which militarism has flooded- the world. . . . The militarists are peace-at-any-price mcn. They are determined to have peace even at the risk of national bankruptcy. Everything good in Germany, Italy, Austria, England and Russia is held back by the confiscation of the proceeds of industry carried on for the support of the Army and Navy. </para>

                            <para>Much has been written about the horrors of war ; the time has come &#39;to write of the horrors of an armed peace ; in many ways it is more terrible than war. War is soon over and the wounds healed. An armed peace goes on indefinitely, and its wounds gape, and fester and poison all the air. War furnishes opportunity for men to be brave; an armed peace gives rise to interminable gossip about imaginary goblins and dangers. Tn war, nations think of principles, but in an armed peace, the mind is preoccupied exclusively with devising ways of increasing the efficiency of the implements of slaughter. War develops men, but an&#39; armed peace rots moral fibre. </para>

                        <para class="block">These are only short quotations from a very excellent article, but it shows the dangers that may arise. It is quite true that the burden of these armaments on the nations of the world is becoming terrific; and we know that a w&#39;ar between the two great nations which have been mentioned would be a terrible catastrophe. It is recognised that in Prussia the people are a fighting community, and that they have a large &#39;sum hoarded ready for war, and it is also true, as the Kaiser is alleged to have said, that great capitalists are interested in such a turn of events. Under the circumstances, there is always an element of danger, and we on this side of the world, although we are a peaceful people, and have declared against militarism, must be prepared not only to defend our own shores, but to assist in the defence of the heart of the Empire. It is a very serious thing to lend any encouragement to the excitement produced by the cry of war, and I charge the newspapers with attempting to raise a cry of the kind. A gift of ^2,000,000 would represent an enormous burden for Australia, and would render us all the more helpless in the matter of defence if trouble came. England really does not want the assistance offered, because there, and also in Japan, for instance, the necessary funds can be raised by means of an income tax, and we must not forget that to build a vessel of the kind here would cost about 10s. per head of the population, as against 9d. in either of those countries. Even from the point of view of sentimental effect, the offer was ill-advised. We ought not to be overwhelmed by such appeals as have recently been made, and which may lead to unjustifiable waste of human life, energy, and treasure. </para>

Glancing at the question of finance, I have to point out that, since Federation, there has not been the slightest attempt on the part of the States to curtail wasteful expenditure. New South Wales has been more extravagant than ever. The indebtedness of Australia has increased in that time by some &#163;39,000,000 ; and yet we have the Government taking its guidance from Joshua Brothers, organized employers, and others responsible for this state of affairs. Several proposals have been mentioned by the Government which involve borrowing, although the debt of Australia is enormous, represented, as it is, by State, municipal, and private loans, the interest for all of which has to be paid by the Australian worker, using the word in its broadest sense. In addition to the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> expenditure, and a suggested loan for postal requirements, we have to face the taking over of the Northern Territory, and the building of a transcontinental railway, the latter of which is estimated to cost about .&#163;4,000,000, and the former ,&#163;1,000,000 or ,&#163;2,000,000. All these proposals appear to me to represent utter recklessness on the part of the Government. </para>

                                <para>- And they will be found excellent regiments if they are required for the defence of Australia. But these men - and they number 44,000 - are against any expenditure by the Government on a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> in the way proposed. The workers, too, are against the Government; and it is certain that no country would tolerate .an Administration such as that which now presides over the Commonwealth. While saying that, however, I am not at all sorry there has been a fusion of parties. Over and over again. I have contended that there are only two parties in both States and Commonwealth ; and that fact has not been lost sight of, although the Labour party worked very well with the Deakin Government in an alliance. As a matter of fact, this fusion is about the best thing that could happen to the Labour party. I have been studying the history of that party somewhat in detail recently, and I commend that history to the Prime Minister and others who have declared that we are always more antagonistic to those with whom we have been in alliance. That statement is not true in fact. In very many cases, in connexion with both Federal and State politics, Labour organizations have granted immunity to those working with Labour. When the Labour party in the Parliament of New South Wales held the balance of power, and was in alliance with the Reid party in 1895, it did not oppose the Reidites. </para>

The facts show that our party has not grown so vigorously whilst we have been working in alliance with others as it has done when we have been in direct opposition. In 1900 there were only 67 Labour members in the Legislative Assemblies of the States, which at that time had a total membership of 428. To-day, however,, with a total membership of 347 in those Houses, we have 129 Labour members. We started in New South Wales in 1891 with 36 members, and in 1900 we had 67 in the </para>

                        <para class="block">State Legislatures. In this Parliament we have worked with another party, but at each election have gained on all others. Even in Federal politics, however, we have not always opposed the candidates of those in alliance with us. In the Parliaments of Australia to-day, we have a total of 184 Labour members, and we have nothing to fear as a party from the present Coalition. It has led to a clear definition of parties. Had the Fisher Government remained in office they would have had to depend upon the support of some honorable members who are a very uncertain quantity. The whole political history of the honorable member for Ballarat, for instance, shows that he is always restless and uncertain when not in office. Then, again, the right honorable member for Swan is never happy unless in office. One can well understand that, since he was so long in power in Western Australia. The love of office grows on a man, and the honorable member for Ballarat is no sooner out of office than he becomes restless. That being so, we should probably have had unsatisfactory work had the Fisher Government remained in power, and called upon the present Prime Minister and some of his followers to support some of the advanced legislation embodied in their excellent programme. Members of the late Ministry have justice on their side in claiming that a Government should be deposed only on the ground that its policy does not meet with the approval of the country. They were turned out of office, however, solely because they were branded &#34; Labour.&#34; Such a state of affairs ought not to exist. </para>

                                <para>- Because they were going too slowly. The present Government is likely to be ten times more extravagant than the Deakin Government was; but it is evident that it cannot last long. No party constituted as it is could hope to have a long life. It is all very well to say that the Coalition means a permanent fusion of the people, but the people themselves will declare against it. If the Government have so much faith in the judgment of the electors, why are they not prepared to go before them? When they asked for two months&#39; Supply I was inclined to think that they possibly entertained the idea of going to the country without delay, but in due time, in any event, the people will be able to say whether the policy of the late Government or that put forward by those now in office is best calculated to promote the well-being of the Commonwealth. The Ministry propose to sublet a great deal of the work of this Parliament to an Inter-State Commission, a likely member of which is the honorable member for Parkes. Imagine that honorable member being called upon to conduct a Labour .bureau ! He is an individualist, and is absolutely opposed to trade unionism. </para>

                                <para>- I may be mistaken as lo his attitude towards trade unions. I do not wish to misrepresent the honorable member for Parkes, but I know that he is an individualist, and is opposed to the restriction of immigration. Yet he is a probable member of the Commission, which is to conduct a Labour bureau, attend to immigration matters, and deal with anomalies in the Tariff. The honorable member has been a consistent Free Trader, so that the Protectionists know what to expect from him. Another likely member of the Commission is the honorable member for Fawkner, who declares for freedom of contract. The third member may be the honorable member for Flinders. All three are able men, and it is not improbable that they will be appointed to deal with the enormous volume of work to be delegated to the Commission. What have the working classes to expect from a Commission so constituted ? Those who think that they will be fooled as the Government would fool them make a mistake. We look with the utmost confidence to the time when we shall be able to make an appeal to the country. As to the business to be put before us, I recognise that there are several non-party measures, such as the Bill, to amend the Old-age Pensions Act, which ought to be dealt with. I do not know whether the Government will ever reach them, for, judging by the remarks of some of their followers, there is not much loyalty amongst them, and it would appear &#34;that the statement of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that the support of the Free Traders is very uncertain is likely to prove correct. We have had an indication that the Government intend to deal only with the financial question this session, and that they will merely fill in the interval between now and the date of the introduction of the Budget with the consideration of a few non-party measures. We shall be able, perhaps, to prevent them from doing any harm The Coalition  comprises men who have vigorously opposed and &#34;stone-walled&#34; some of the good legislation passed by this Parliament, and we shall see now whether they will attempt to undo any of it. If they do they will not succeed without a great deal of trouble. I do not wish to be a party to any declaration of warfare regarding ordinary business, but so far as these larger questions are concerned, I may say at once that we do not intend to allow any changes to be made until the country has had an opportunity to say whether or not they are desirable. After the next general election, we shall have a Labour Government once more in office. For the first time in the history of Australia a distinctly Labour Administration has had an opportunity to put forward a Ministerial programme, and that programme differed materially from our ordinary fighting platform, which comprises a very limited number of planks on which our party is pledged to act. and work together. On all other questions, we are free to vote as individuals. The late Government did their work as any British Government would. They met in Cabinet, and framed a bold and more truly national policy than had ever been put before the people. Although we had had several Governments, consisting of the picked men of the States - men of long Ministerial experience - and had passed some legislation of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> humanitarian character, it remained for a Labour Government to put before the people of Australia the &#39;boldest and most truly national policy that had ever been submitted to them. We had previously in power a Ministry that declared its great object to be the development of Australian industries, yet it did nothing to establish ship-building in the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister said that fiscal ism was only lightly touched on  by  the late Administration. He overlooked the fact that the Labour Government had not only declared for new Protection, but that the Labour party generally had shown by deeds, not words, their attitude towards the Tariff. He overlooked also the fact that during the recess the Labour Government took steps for the construction of our own little navy in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- We have, and the Protectionist members of the Coalition cannot hope to carry any alteration of the Tariff OIl Protectionist lines without our assistance. Every member of the party formerly led by the right honorable member has declared himself free from any pledge in that regard. The right honorable member for East Sydney, who, although absent, still has influence, and must count in the party, has declared that the agreement does not affect the individual views of honorable members. Judged either by &#39;words or deeds, the Fisher Government is the Government that could be relied upon, and the Fisher programme is the one which the country will adopt. The miserable policy which the present Government have put forward is not a programme at all. They really propose to sub-let all the functions of the Government of the Commonwealth to the States and an Inter-State Commission. They will never get such a thing carried, and in the first place they will never obtain the consent of the States to do it. It would be hopeless to ask the country to amend the Constitution in the way that the Government suggest. They must reckon with the Labour organizations, which will put up a big fight all over Australia against any such policy. The consumer is not to be provided for, and combines and trusts are not to be interfered with. There is no proposal to meet the decision of the High Court that questions may be asked under the Industries Preservation Act, but that no action may be taken afterwards to crush the trusts. The Government declares against our policy, .which is to nationalize, and so put an end to any injurious monopoly. It is a Government which backs up monopolies instead of interfering with them. It depends upon monopolists, and upon all the people who -are against improving the lot of the masses. They are against touching the big land-owners. Their plea is that the matter should be left to the States, although they know as well as we do that the States cannot touch the land monopoly question, because the vested interests in the Upper Houses are too strong. The Government will not propose a land tax, and refuse to touch the great commercial combines, and yet we are asked to put our faith in them. They are a mixed team of men with conflicting views, who were brought together only at the last minute - actually on the very day the House met. It was impossible to get them together before. The fusion proposals were pronounced a failure after all the negotiations, that started six months ago, and it was only by the powerful influences behind them that the present Government  came into existence at all. Already we see that they do not look a happy family. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member  for Indi  knows nothing about it. He is about the last to whom they would tell any of their Cabinet secrets, so that we need take no notice of him. But I do take notice of some other honorable members, who have told the House frankly that they have not been swallowed up in the fusion, but are maintaining their own views. It is on those utterances that I base my contention that Protection and the new Protection have been sacrificed, and that preferential trade, and, in fact, everything that the honorable member for Ballarat submitted to the country at the last election and was returned to carry out, has been thrown overboard. Any proposals, that the Government do make to deal with the big interests are useless. Even in administration they began with an act upon which they stand condemned. It was injurious to the welfare of Australia, uncalled for, and wrong in principle, and in doing it they have weakened the capacity of Australia to provide for its own defence. If this Government live I shall have another opportunity of dealing with a number of other matters, while if they go out, we shall forget all about them, and proceed to do sensible business for the country. If we succeed in obtaining an appeal to the electors, we shall at least have somebody -to settle the question, and we need not waste time now upon minor details of the Government policy, with which a great deal of fault could be found, and which requires a great deal more explanation than we have yet had. It was a novel experience to hear the Leader of the Government reading a statement of policy instead of making a policy speech, and then making a light and flippant attack on the party who are now in Opposition. Both the honorable member for Lang and the honorable member for Corio paid a great deal of attention to the Labour party. That was an admission that they feared it and knew its strength, vigour, and organization. Those attacks are meant only to divert attention from their own mistakes, to use a very mild term, or their own wrong-doing in sacrificing principles in order to come together with no other object than to defeat Labour. We know why that was done. It was to help on the reactionaries. There seems always to come a time when the Tory reactionaries get into power for a limited period. It gives them a chance of showing how unfitted they are to carry on the Government. All history shows that the capitalistic section of the community is the most unsuited of all for that task. The members of it have a great conceit of themselves. They think that no one can govern the country like them, but they are the most costly and inefficient crowd that can be found to conduct either public or private undertakings. Whenever Labour has had a chance to manage affairs, it has shown a great capacity for economic government and business organization. In neither of the cases where we have had the opportunity of conducting the government of Australia has any fault been found with our administration, and the Ministerial  policy  which the Fisher Government was allowed to put forward has been more acclaimed by the people than has the programme put forward by any other Government. </para>

                            <para>.- I congratulate the honorable member for Darling on the temperate way in which he has put his views before the House. It was at least refreshing after the screaming we have had -from the members of the late Government because of their defeat. Nothing is so calculated to destroy the influence of the Labour party as the ungracious way -in which they went, out of office. I did think that, knowing that they had not a majority, they would take a lesson from the action of the present Prime Minister when they displaced his previous Government. When their time came to be told that they must cross to the Opposition benches, I expected that they would take their defeat graciously, but they did not. They have been complaining ever since. </para>

Protection has been cited by the honorable member for Darling as one of the main questions endangered by the fusion, but it may be news to the honorable member that the majority of the members of the fused party voted for more effective Protection than the Labour party did as a whole. </para>

Protection is safer in the hands of this side of the House than in the hands of honorable members opposite. Instead of complaining because they were put out of office ; instead of asserting that the Prime Minister has deserted his principles - and that, of course, is incorrect - the Labour party should consider themselves under a debt of gratitude to him as a great party leader, for giving them an opportunity to participate in passing legislation which has been to the advantage of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- I voted for the legislation which appeared to me, as an independent member, to be best for the people. While the Labour party were backing up the Prime Minister, and helping him to pass what, in some cases, was useful legislation, they had a say in shaping the destinies of Australia. While they were in office themselves they had an opportunity to misuse some of their administrative privileges and powers. But now that  they  are relegated, for the first time in the history of the Federation, to the cold shades of Opposition, they find themselves powerless. Probably that accounts for &#34;all their complaints. They occupy now the position which as a minority in the House they should occupy. The essential differences between the policy of the present Government and that of the Labour party consist of the latter&#39;s schemes of nationalization and the proposed imposition of a land tax. </para>

It will leave the State tribunals, which are in close touch with the commercial elements, free to fix the rates of wages within their respective States. The Wages Boards, being composed of equal numbers of employes and employers, are expert tribunals. I have always recognised, however, that there is a difficulty in having distinct tribunals fixing wages in different States, and that this might give rise to variations in the standard of wages. It is, therefore, necessary to have some Court or body of appeal from the decisions of the State tribunals, in order that the wage standards might be harmonised, that one State should not gain an advantage in manufacturing over the others, and that the conditions might be as far as possible standardized. The Government propose that appeals may Ee made to the Inter- </para>

I shall not discuss the Labour party&#39;s impracticable proposals for the nationalization of industries. I admit that they have added a number of practical planks to their policy, borrowed from the Liberal party. They thought that by doing this they could make an effective appeal to the practically-minded in the community. The nationalization of monopolies really means the nationalization of every private enterprise. </para>

                                <para>- The Liberal leader is responsible for most of the practical legislation on our statute-book. The Labour party cannot do more than claim credit for supporting his proposals ; it cannot claim them as its policy. The land tax proposals of the party are double-barrelled. It is intended, by means of a land tax, to aim first at the large estates, bursting them up, and, secondly, at an increase of revenue. To effectively burst up the large estates, the proposed tax must confiscate existing values to some extent. Therefore, the Labour party&#39;s proposal is confiscatory. While the main object is to burst up the large estates, the tax is spoken of also as a means for raising revenue for the carrying out of the defence and other proposals mentioned by the honorable member for Wide Bay in his Gympie speech. In October last, the present Minister of Defence quoted a speech delivered by the ex-Leader of the Labour party, the honorable member for South Sydney, in which that gentleman said that the party had pledged itself to an exemption of &#163;5,000 on the unimproved capital value of land, and that the tax should not exceed 4d. in the &#163;1. He declared its main object to be the bursting up of large estates, and said that it was of little moment if the small man escaped at the time by reason of the fact that estates of less than &#163;5,000 in values would be exempt. The honorable member for New England has also been very frank on the point, advocating a progressive land tax, with an exemption of &#163;5,000, with the object, first and foremost, of compelling owners to sell, to give opportunities for closer settlement. The honorable member for Werriwa said last session that the Labour party proposed a land tax &#34; not for the purpose of raising revenue,, but to promote land settlement.&#34; He said  that if the tax brought in revenue, it would not be effective for the purposes of the party. &#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has said that the incentive to the advocacy of a land tax is the desire to abolish &#34; the blighting curse of landlordism.&#34; Similar sentiments have been uttered by other members of the Labour party. These references show that the first object of the tax is to burst up the large estates. The Leader of the Labour party was also probably driven to put forward a progressive land tax by the need of finding revenue for the proposals which he mentioned at Gympie. </para>

                                <para>- Yes; but he proposed it as a means of direct taxation, as well as a means for bursting up large estates. The honorable member for Corio has shown that 700,000 of revenue would be needed to give effect to the policy of the Fisher Government. I consider that a progressive land tax, as a. means of promoting settle- _ ment, and raising revenue, is doomed to failure. The figures of the Commonwealth Statistician are difficult to follow, because the States have each their own method of compiling statistics, which prevents the making of exact comparisons. But it is possible to estimate approximately the probable revenue from taxation such as that proposed by the Labour party. In Australia, 126,000,000 acres have been alienated, or are now in course of alienation. Of this area, 50,000,000 acres are situated in New South Wales, 26,000,000 acres in Victoria, and the balance in the other four States. For the purposes of my calculation, I have exempted Victorian estates of less than 2,500 acres, and estates in New South Wales ot less than 2,000 acres. </para>

                                <para>- Of course, there are some. The honorable member can make his own estimate of &#39;the number (which would be exempt under the proposals of the Labour party. Taking unimproved  values as a basis, there are picked estates in New South Wales, Victoria, &#39; and Tasmania of less than 2,000 acres each, which are certainly worth ^5,000. But in a calculation affecting the whole Commonwealth they are not very numerous. If honorable members opposite question my figures, let them work out some scheme of their own. </para>

In New South Wales something over &#163;340,000 per annum is obtained from land value taxation on 50,000,000 acres. &#39; Taking the New South Wales method of valuation, after deducting the exemption of that State, the 73,000,000 acres to which I have referred may be said to be worth &#163;2 an acre. </para>

                                <para>- It must be remembered, in criticising my figures, that there are immense areas in the interior of Queensland and Western Australia whose unimproved value is very little. In putting the average value of the alienated lands of Australia at &#163;2 per acre I am probably going beyond the mark. However, I calculate the total value to be about &#163;150,000,000. If from that the exemptions are deducted - and they total about &#163;21,000,000-there is left &#163;129,000,000. Taxation on that, at an average rate of 1&#189;d. in the pound, would produce about three-quarters of a million. Therefore, the proposed land taxation would not raise half the amount required to carry out the Gympie policy. </para>

                                <para>- Last year the New South Wales land tax returned nearly  200,000,  and in the previous year  350,000,  before exemption in the case of municipal taxation was allowed. The New South Wales exemption is  &#163;240,  while that of the Labour party is  &#163;5,060.  Let us now consider the probable efficacy of a progressive land tax as a means for bursting up large estates. New Zealand is always being cited as an example of the good effects which follow land taxation. It has been stated over and over again that the New Zealand land tax has burst up the large estates of the Dominion, with the result that settlement has increased by leaps and bounds, to the great prosperity of the country. Let us now see what New Zealand has done. The Dominion is a little larger than Victoria, and, therefore, has a little more land, and there the Government levy a tax of one penny in the pound, with an exemption up to  &#163;500  in value, in addition to a progressive land tax on all estates over  &#163;5,000  in value. In  1904  there were in New Zealand,  379  estates of over &#163;5,000 in value, while in  1908  there were  415.  In Victoria in  1904  there were  309  estates of over  &#163;5,000  in value, and in  1908  there were  231.  In New Zealand in  1904,  there were  223  estates of over  10,000  acres and under  20,000  acres, and in  1908  there were  248  j whereas in Victoria in  1904,  there were  180  estates of such dimensions, as compared with  118  estates last year. In  1908,  in New Zealand, there were twice as many estates as in Victoria, of  5,000  to  50,000  acres, and twenty times as many estates of over  50,000  acres. That is the lesson we have to learn from the imposition of a land tax in New Zealand, for the purpose of bursting up large estates. In New Zealand there is a progressive land tax, whereas in Victoria there is not, but the fact remains that Victoria has beaten New Zealand in regard to the bursting up of large estates. </para>

                                <para>- My proposal is that the State should come in and purchase. I have one or two examples of estates settled under the Closer Settlement Act, and of estates that have been cut up and sold privately in Victoria. Near Hamilton there is an estate of  44,900  acres, of the value of  &#163;412,000,  which, when subdivided privately, resulted in thirty-six new people being placed on the land. In the same district there is another estate of  25,000  acres, of the value of  &#163;187,000,  which, when subdivided under the Closer Settlement Act, resulted in  166  new settlers. </para>

                                <para>- I may explain that the closer settlement policy in Victoria prevents the re-aggregation of the estates, by means of a compulsory residence clause = attaching to the freehold. In the case of the Government subdivision the average acreage per homestead is  154,  and the average value of the estates  &#163;^1,126,  whereas, under private subdivision, the average acreage per homestead is  1,247  acres, and the average value  &#163;11,444.  These are two typical instances of what is going on all over the country. I am not prepared to say that the policy has been put into operation, in real earnest in any of the States ; and I think that there is plenty of room for extension. If we are to settle Australia with that population necessary to defend it, and develop that civilization we look for, we must deal with this great problem. </para>

                                <para>- I dare say; and my only complaint is that the States Governments have not adopted the system extensively enough. Of the  &#163;250,000,000  borrowed by Australia, some  &#163;180,000,000  has been spent in the construction of railways ; and a similar amount spent in the repurchase&#34; of land for settlement purposes - though I am not advocating any such expenditure at present, because I do not think it is necessary - could not fail to be followed by good results. At present I am merely contrasting railway securities with land securities, and urging that subdivision of estates, at moderate rates, could in no case prove a mistake on the part of the States. The proposal for a land tax brings this question of settlement at once within the arena of discussion. Under the Constitution we have to deal with immigration ; and it is necessary that the important question of land settlement should be seriously discussed with the Stale Governments, in order that the necessary areas shall&#39; be provided. We have already signalized our partnership in the Empire by the ready offer of a battleship, or some other form of assistance; and, in a little while, there will be a conference between the State Governments and the Commonwealth as to the settlement of the financial question on a basis that will, I hope, allow both to develop the resources of the country in the speediest and soundest possible way. I trust that proper consideration will be given to the work that the Commonwealth Government must undertake in the development of the Northern Territory, the defence of the country, and the construction of transcontinental railways, and also that it will be seen that the States are not crippled in the developmental works they have to undertake in the form of railway construction and water supply, and other important public services. &#39; All these problems are of very serious importance; and I hope that yet another, namely, new &#39; Protection, will be discussed at the Conference, in order that some satisfactory solution may be arrived at, so as to give the workers the justice to which they are entitled. But, however important these questions are, those of immigration and land settlement are really the more vital, and ought to be tackled, so that we may absorb, at any rate, a substantial percentage of the immigrants whom we hope will shortly be brought here through the action of the Federal Parliament. If it is not possible to come to a proper understanding with the States, it may be necessary, as already foreshadowed by the Prime Minister, to ask the people of Australia to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to purchase lands in various parts of Australia, so that immigration may go hand in hand with a reasonable scheme of land settlement. I hope that the Conference will be held during the coming spring, and that it will not only settle the other questions to which I have alluded, but that the Prime Minister will not leave it until a definite arrangement has been made for the various States to make available .areas of land necessary to absorb at least a very substantial percentage of the immigrants that the Commonwealth will endeavour to bring here within a few years. </para>

                            <para>Why was it that civilization rose on the banks of the Nile and not on those of the Danube or  Mississipi?  Civilization depends upon soil and climate. In Egypt the harvests may be foretold and controlled. Of few other parts of the world can the same be said. In most countries the cultivation of the soil is uncertain. From seed-time to harvest, the meteorological changes are so numerous and great that no skill can predict the amount of yearly produce .... if dependence&#34; upon the rainfall from the heavens is the only supply. Nor is it sufficient that a requisite amount of water should fall, but to produce the proper effect it must fall at particular periods of the year. In Egypt man is not the sport of seasons, because he has the yearly and regular flows of the great Nile River. Agriculture is certain in Egypt, and there man first became civilized. </para>

                        <para class="block">Here then is a lesson thousands of years old that is not inapplicable to Australia. No other country has perhaps such possibilities of successful irrigation as Australia offers. We have great mountain ranges running along the eastern coastline from which rivers take their rise, coursing through the fertile districts of the southern portion of this continent. And what is being done to develop this country ? At the last general election I strongly advocated that the Federal Parliament should . take control of the great waterways of Australia. However much we may temporize with this great question I still believe that it will be necessary before long to exercise some Federal control over our great and valuable streams that are now running to waste. We have only to look to the experience of other countries to learn what are the possibilities of Australia in regard to irrigation. In twelve States of the United States of America there are under irrigation 15,000,000 acres. Before water was carried on to that land many parts of it were estimated to be worth not more than 5s. per acre, but it will now readily bring from &#163;20 to &#163;30 per acre. Some of those estates are already carrying 750,000 people. As far back as 1890 the present Prime Minister in a work on irrigation in India - a book that has since been described by probably the greatest irrigation expert in the world, as the most comprehensive yet published on irrigation development in that country - showed that there were some 30,000,000 acres under active irrigation and intense cultivation there. That area has since been increased to 50,000,000 acres, and it is estimated that nearly 200,000,000 of the 300,000,000 people of India are dependent directly or indirectly on those irrigated lands. We have in the Northern Territory a third of the area of India., and rivers which, whilst they may not compare with the Ganges or the Indus could nevertheless be advantageously used for irrigation purposes. During the rainy season large volumes of water run to waste that might be stored in reservoirs. There is also a possibility of introducing with success in the Northern Territory the well system, that has proved so beneficial to India as an irrigation agency. The Territory, in short, offers facilities for irrigation, not quite as good as those prevailing in India, but capable, nevertheless, of being so utilized, if the genius and energy of man be applied to them, that a population of many millions may be settled there. The sooner we take the work in hand and provide there a defence of producers, instead of a standing army, the sooner we shall prove our fitness to develop this great continent. Some of the western States of America are similar in climate and character to the arid districts of Australia. We have along the Murray between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 acres which could be brought almost immediately under active irrigation and intense culture. Ten thousand acres under cultivation in Mildura are carrying 5,000 people, and the average production of that settlement is greater than the average production of Australia as a whole. That shows that with irrigation it can carry as many people to the &#34;acre as can land on the Nile, which has been under irrigation for centuries. We have from 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 acres lying in the valleys of our large rivers, and we have the credit, the engineering skill, and here and in Great Britain the people with the energy and intelligence to develop that land. It seems to me that all that we require now to lay the foundation of a great and prosperous settlement in those valleys is the exercise of the genius of statesmen and legislators. I hope the Prime Minister will have a full and comprehensive report prepared incidentally on the irrigation possibilities, and primarily on the navigation possibilities of our large rivers. Under the Federal Constitution, wisely or unwisely, the Commonwealth control of our rivers relates only to their navigation. It would be possible, however, for the Federal Parliament to construct weirs along them in order to provide for navigation, and Under sections 98 and 100 of the Constitution it is competent for the Government to appoint a Commission to prepare .a comprehensive report on their navigability. The instructions to such a Commission might well include a direction to report on the irrigation possibilities which they offer. </para>

                                <para>- I am speaking, not on behalf of Victoria, but with a regard for the welfare of Australia generally. I have dealt now with all the questions on which I intend to touch. I have shown that the land tax proposals of the Fisher Government would not have the anticipated effect of settling on the soil people of limited means, who find it difficult to acquire land unless it is offered to them by the State on easy terms. I have also shown that it would not produce as much revenue as the late Government imagine, and that the Conference which is about to be held has large and important duties to carry out. I hope that among the important questions with which it will deal will be those of irrigation, land settlement, and, if possible, the Federal control of the large waterways of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- Is it any wonder that a motion of no-confidence in the Government should be submitted by the Leader of the Opposition when we find that not on iv has the country no confidence in them, but that some of the members of the Government doubt each other. There is no confidence amongst those who sit behind them or beside them. As an evidence of that some members of the fusion will not even take the trouble to attend the House in order to assist the Government. They do not appear here at all. They are ashamed of the fusion, and have never put a foot in this chamber since it was consummated. I am glad they have some sense of shame. The only redeeming feature of Ministers is the sense of shame that drives them from the chamber when they are under the lash of the Opposition. I am glad to see so many of them in their places to-night. It is a remarkable thing that in this same reeking stable we find the professed advocate of a White Australia - the Prime Minister, who has not stuck even to that - and the alleged Democrat, the honorable member for Maribyrnong, harnessed up with the bitterest black labour advocate in the House - the honorable member for Brisbane. The Prime Minister went beyond all precedent, and formed a Ministry of ten, in order that he might be able to include that spotted gentleman in his team. The first act of the Honorary Minister after his appointment, was to rush to the press to ventilate his anti-Australian views with regard to naval and military defence. This was too much even for the Prime Minister, and he brought to book the honorable gentleman, who had received Ministerial office as a guerdons for his decile support of Australia&#39;s greatest political traitor, who sits in that corner. </para>

                                <para>- I intended to say  &#39; political traitor. &#39; &#39; I can imagine the Prime Minister saying in effect to that docile gentleman, &#34; You are in our pay, and must do as we bid you, not as you believe you should do.&#34; The honorable member has to follow the Prime Minister no matter what he thinks of his proposals. He is bound hand and foot. I can imagine the Honorary Minister replying, &#34; As to principles,  1  glory in having none. I want &#39;a billet. Your will shall be obeyed,&#34; but probably with the dangerous mental reservation - &#34; Perhaps.&#34; The Honorary Minister has been sent to England to attend a secret Conference. How can any man who has expressed publicly the views that he has expressed upon the naval and military defence of Australia, advocate the Views which the Government want him to advocate at that Conference? It is impossible for him to do it, and I do not know that he will trouble to do it. We shall never know if he has troubled to do it. I do not wonder at the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> being anxious to have my late Ministerial colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> sent Home as the mouthpiece of this country, to voice the sentiments of the Australian people with the  zeal born of conviction, and not with the duplicity and weakness of a hired mercenary. There is Australia&#39;s danger, yet that is the position. Need I say more to show the utter shamelessness and rottenness of a Government who could actually send as their representative, a man who does not share the opinions of the body of which he is a member, and does not hesitate to place his own views before the public? The Prime Minister, when in Tasmania, said at Queenstown, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 2nd March : - </para>

                            <para>I have been challenged because I have given the principal place to the consideration of the position of parties. A party is a body of men united in certain common principles to which they  desire to give effect. The justification of the party&#39;s existence is that they seek the same things by the same means. If they do that they are such a party as we&#39; desire to see, because it would be in the popular interest, but if they are but a group of men brought together for social ends in personal combination, that is not a party in any sense of the term. Policy must come before the party, and be the foundation of the party. </para>

Rather honorable members opposite are banded together, as the Prime Minister said, as a social group, and their object is to get as many billets as they possibly can for themselv.es and their friends.

                        <para class="block">Are those the ends that the Postmaster-General and his colleagues are seeking? Do they propose to destroy the White Australia policy, and interfere with the Immigration laws, or has the right honorable member for East Sydney agreed to accent 1he views of the Postmaster-General? Who has made the sacrifice? One or the other must have made it, and one or the other must be a political traitor - false to his principles. Which is it? We do not know the terms of the compact, which was made in secret, but it is impossible for the Postmaster-General to say that he is favour of the White Australia policy, and that he is also &#34; seeking the same things by the same means &#34; as the right honorable member for East Sydney. The four honorable members who constitute the remnant, not the wreckage, of the old Liberal party - they represent the true Liberalism, and have proved themselves to be the only Liberals in the House - spoke in sorrow, and not in anger, when they expressed their regret that the Prime Minister had deserted them. I admit that the honorable member for Hume spoke in anger, but he had reason to. He would not have been a man if he had not felt angry at the treatment he received. The three others expressed their greatest sorrow thai they had been deserted, and 1 well remember the words of the honorable member for Gippsland. He said he was glad that the honorable member who- applied the gag that prevented the House from considering the policy of the Fisher Government was not a member of the Deakin party.. He could not believe that his late leader was the man who gave the command to his little weak instrument, the honorable member for Wentworth, to apply the stiletto. What can he think of his late leader to-day, after the Fisher Government have been turned out in the dirtiest and most contemptible manner that ever a Government was dealt with in any of the Parliaments of the Commonwealth ? They were not allowed even to put their policy before the House, to say nothing of having it tested on its merits, and without those who were opposed to them daring to insinuate any charge whatever against their smallest act of administration. The honorable member for Gippsland could not believe that his late leader could be guilty of such contemptible conduct. </para>

                                <para>- This is the first time in the history of Australia that such tactics were used. The Prime Minister, of course, tells us that his policy does not change. It was the same in 1901 and 1903, and it will be the same in 1950 if he is alive. He never intends to carry anything. He has never tried to carry anything. He talks at large all over the country and all over the Old Country upon defence, but he does absolutely nothing. The moment another Government has the courage to do something, he becomes a fault-finder. He does not say, &#34;Go on; good luck to you. We are delighted to think that you have the courage to do what we feared to do.&#34; Although the Government have snatched a temporary victory, I see the benches opposite swarming with renegades - rats - from the Labour party. They had a new addition to their ranks the other day. I have always looked upon the honorable member for Perth as an honorable and upright gentleman, but I would point out that if any honorable member is dissatisfied with the platform and actions of the Labour party there are two honorable courses open to him. He may carry out the pledges that he made to those who sent him into Parliament and to those who selected him as a candidate, and whom, in his own handwriting, he undertook to support, or he may resign his seat. The honorable member for Perth has done neither, and the fusion is welcome to him. There is no room in our ranks for men of that character. I see on those benches the honorable member for Bourke, the honorable member for Batman, and even the honorable &#39;member for Corio, who went almost upon his hands and knees crawling to the Geelong branch of the Labour party - the party he chooses to denounce to-day. </para>

It is only on the assumption of hypnotic influence, or witchery, that I can explain the fact that- honorable members are drawn to the side of one member who has risen to his position by treachery, and the assassination of his friends. There is no one who can better propose legislation as a fruit fair to the eye, or extol its virtues in more mellifluous language, than the Prime Minister can; but his legislation is always rotten at the core. </para>

                                <para>- The Prime Minister would have been glad had I so followed him. But, as a member of the Labour party, I had freedom to express my opinions without consulting any one at any time, and I always did so. What was the value of the Harvester Excise Act, passed as part of the new Protection ? How has the union label legislation benefited the workers? Honorable members say that I supported the last Deakin Government; but did I not denounce it, and tell the Prime Minister that his legislation would not be worth the paper upon which it was printed? Did I not say that, if the Government wished to do something for the industrial classes, it &#39;should have the constitutionality of its&#39; legislation tested, so that, if necessary, amending legislation could be introduced before the Tariff was dealt with. The &#39; Prime Minister has stated that the Labour party wishes to carry legislation with a view to raiding the classes to give the booty to the masses. I have never used language such as that, nor. been guilty of such a misrepresentation. No member of the Labour party would do what we are said to wish to do. The Prime Minister and his colleagues, however, allowed the employers to enjoy for eighteen months booty which they had obtained from the Parliament on the promise to treat their employes fairly, in consideration of the passing of a high protective Tariff. I am a Protectionist, and would vote for higher duties than are now in force. But I shall not trust the employers again, nor shall I trust the Ministerialists. In South Australia we were once sold by, the employers, and in Victoria we have been twice sold by them; we shall not be sold the third time. We shall see that the workers get their share of Protection by passing machinery which will give effect to our wishes. We are ready to do what honorable members opposite dare not do; we are willing to protect the employers. </para>

                                <para>- They are tongue-tied, shackled, and manacled, as members of the Labour party never have been. Let me point out some of the members opposite who have sacrificed their principles. First, Jet me refer to the honorable member for Fawkner. In the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 22nd November, 1906, he is reported to have said that he could not sit behind the Prime Minister,  because he was always afraid that that gentleman would drift towards Socialism, and that he could not sit behind&#39; the right honorable member for East Sydney, because he was a Free Trader. There is no place in the House for the honorable member. </para>

                                <para>- The Labour party is anathema to him. I would not sit cheek by jowl with him. I could not, like the honorable members for Bourke and Maribyrnong, tell my constituents that the  president  of the Employers&#39; Federation had been laying his head alongside mine, while we devised legislation for their benefit. The Labour party would not have the honorable member for Fawkner, and, as he cannot sit behind either the honorable member for Ballarat, or the right honorable member for East Sydney, he has no right to a seat in this Chamber. What, then, are we to think of his present position ? Can we rely on the utterances of an honorable gentleman who, after making the statements to which I have referred, has, without consulting his electors, become a supporter of the honorable member for Ballarat? </para>

That statement appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> of the 29th October, 1906. I have not said anything stronger than that.

Their promises must henceforward be expressed in writing. The electors will require them to sign their pledges in the future, or, more probably, will choose other representatives; The honorable member for Franklin is also reported to have said, on the 19th November, 1906, just prior to the elections, that if he had to vote he would rather support the Labour candidate than the honorable member for Ballarat, who was a weathercock. I hope that the Prime Minister is proud of his supporters. I should not like to be at the head of men who had called me a weathercock, and said that I was the most contemptible figure in Parliament. They make lovely companions, these Labour rats, and those who, although they have -not ratted from the Labour party, do not differ much from those who have done so. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Wentworth is always afraid that the stiletto may flash out at any moment. I believe that he is heartily ashamed of having been the instrument with which the Fisher Government was despatched. I wish now to say a word or two 4n reference to the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> offer. Defence cannot be provided for by spasmodic effort. I sympathize with those who agitated for the offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to Great Britain, as evidence of our feeling towards the people of the Mother Country; but the Fisher Government had to consider plain facts. We knew that the Old Country did not need a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> and that to merely offer one would not increase our defences. Great Britain could build a hundred <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> if she needed them. What she needs are sailors to man her vessels. If we could provide two sailors for every German sailor, we should do something of more value than the giving of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline> I know that hitherto the power and prestige of the British Empire has rested in her navy, and. I have confidence in that navy. The Fisher Government gave effect to its policy before the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> scare occurred. We all know now that the scare was engineered for party purposes. Suppose a big firm having its main office in Melbourne, and branches in Ballarat, Bendigo, Castlemaine, and other places, was affected by a panic, and one of the branches wired to headquarters to say, &#34;Don&#39;t be alarmed, we are sending you &#163;500,&#34; would not the public at once think that the firm was about to fail? Such a message would probably bring about the downfall of the business which it was intended to assist. There is great unrest in India at the present time, and I am sorry for it ; but those who went about trying to make it be believed that the British Empire was on the eve of breaking up, ran the risk of kindling a blaze in India that it would have been hard to extinguish. </para>

                                <para>- I would not touch him with a 40-foot pole. For months the Minister of Defence and his late leader, the right honorable member for East Sydney, went about the country denouncing the proposal to establish a navy and introduce compulsory military service. These gentlemen have now changed their opinions. The electors never gave any authority for any change of opinion on those questions; and if a representative does change his opinion, he ought certainly to seek his masters&#39; approval. As a matter of fact, honorable members opposite are afraid to face their masters, because they know what the result will be. The Labour party have held meetings in every part of Australia; and we have found the people unanimously with us. The Attorney-General dare not speak as honorable members are now speaking about the gift of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> if he were in Adelaide, for I can tell him that even the Conservative journal in that city denounced the proposal in trenchant terms as utter foolishness. We have heard a great deal from honorable members opposite, when speaking outside the House, as to whether it is a proper course to present a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline></para>

                            <para>The loyalty of British ship-owners does not extend to employing British crews. The proportion of foreigners in British ships grows apace. In the event of war the Admiralty could not draw upon the mercantile marine for reserves for the warships, because without their crews merchant ships will be unable to carry food supplies from abroad to the ports of the United Kingdom. And when those crews include, apart from 25,000 men of the Royal Naval Reserve, no less than 37,694 aliens, the position in time of war must be all the more desperate. To leave the merchant vessels with foreign crews in charge would be courting treachery and disaster. And to make matters infinitely worse, the merchant service is so strongly detested by its sailors that they deserted in large numbers. Last official year saw the desertion of 12,000 men, and in one year there was a total unauthorized exodus o* 27,000 men from British ships. These facts, supplied to the Sydney press by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> W. Moore, secretary to the Imperial Service Guild, show that one of the problems to be solved by Britain in case of war is an adequate reserve force of sailors. </para>

                                <para>- There is no provision for wastage in war. Does the honorable member know that we could not even horse our land defences at the present moment? That is the statement of the greatest military authority of to-day - that not more than half the number of horses required could be obtained. I hope that, in this connexion, honorable members will peruse the report of a Committee with which I had the honor to work, in regard to the horsing of artillery in Australia, and that they will put the recommendations into practice, because this is a most important point in connexion with the defence, not only of Australia but of the whole Empire. I have perused the memorandum of the Government - this extraordinary conglomeration of words - meant to represent a policy. It is a policy, however, that has never been explained, and it certainly supplies the kind of material to occupy the Prime Minister in explaining it for the next five years - and he will do it well. I find that under the heading of &#34; Industrial &#34; an Inter-State Commission is to be appointed to do almost everything under the sun. There has been added to the Government, in order to get one more supporter, a gentleman with whom I should never like to sit if I were a Minister, seeing that his views are so divergent from those of his colleagues ; and if this Inter-State Commission is to carry out all the duties mentioned, the Government will be able to &#34;provide billets, not only for all their own friends, but also for all the friends of the advisers of the Government, &#39; Joshua, Beale, and company. But we refuse to oe fooled any more with this kind of thing. As has been the case with Liberals throughout the world, I find the Prime Minister offering a make-believe promise - giving something which is of no value to the workers or anybody else, but which means big fees for the lawyers and ruin to the unions. </para>

                                <para>- The late Attorney-General did not propose any such legislation; and I have no desire <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> see laws passed which have no other effect than that of harassing both employers and employed. Do not let us legislate unless we are prepared to make our legislation effective. When the Australian Industries Preservation Bill was introduced in this House I pointed out that it was founded on the Sherman Act, under which - although it had been in operation for sixteen years - not one trust had been dealt with. That is the sort of legislation we shall always get from this Government. </para>

I knew, too, that if my belief proved to be well grounded, I should be able to show the people the utter worthlessness of the measure, and that we should then be able to obtain more effective legislation. I shall always vote for a Bill that will not, in my opinion, do what is claimed for it, in order to show the public what humbugs there are on the other side of the House. Are we to obtain new Protection from the Government? No. I propose to quote from a. speech made by the Minister of Defence in order that we may learn whether or not the same old game is to be continued.

                                <para>- Quite so. The Government are going to appoint a Commission to save themselves the trouble of propounding a preferential trade scheme. We can well understand the reason. There is no hope of agreement among themselves. They cannot agree upon preferential trade, and some one else must do the work for them. The Inter-State Commission is also to establish a Labour bureau. The Government know nothing about such a bureau, and so they are going to shunt its creation on to some one else. </para>

                                <para>- We include in our programme, not shams, but schemes that can be carried out. After the Tariff had l:&#62;een in operation for three years - after we had been able to ascertain its anomalies and how it worked - we should undoubtedly have been prepared to give our industries the protection they deserved and needed to encourage their extension. As the honorable member for Darling put it this afternoon, we are pledged to do that, whilst honorable members opposite are against it. The honorable member for Bourke does not like that statement. What will he say when we tell his constituents about it ? He has been &#34;hob-nobbing&#34; with the honorable member for Maribyrnong, who has done a little local preaching in his time, and who, I desire to say in all seriousness, has not yet learned the simple Bible lesson, that he cannot serve God and mammon. He is now on the side of mammon. He cannot be on the side of the employers unions and on the side of the industrial unions at the same time. Which side is he going to take? Is he going to tell his electors that he intends to work for the industrial unions? What is the honorable member for Indi going to do for the unionists? </para>

                                <para>- Does the&#39; honorable member for Maribyrnong say that he can serve two masters - that he can serve the Anti-Sweating League and the sweaters? That is the position that confronts him. We see on the Government benches the representatives of the sweaters and also, if not the present at all events a former secretary of the Anti-Sweating League. Is it not extraordinary to find honorable members so associated, and offering the workers the form of new Protection outlined in the Ministerial statement ? No one knows better than does the honorable member for Maribyrnong that it is a farce and a deceit. </para>

I do not indulge in generalities or misrepresentation regarding the caucus methods of the Government party ; I am not familiar with them, but I am willing to tell them of our methods. They have not told us. how the fusion was brought about without the knowledge, of the honorable member for Hume. They have not told us how it came about that a number of members of the Liberal party broke all their pledges, whilst one of the staunchest Protectionists and Liberals in the House was not even consulted about the fusion. It is interesting to learn what the honorable member for Flinders had to say a little while ago on the subject of the new Protection. </para>

The honorable member for North Sydney, for whom we all have the highest respect, and who, I believe, is absent on account of ill-health, stated in an address delivered in Adelaide, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> of 3rd March, 1909, that &#34; the new Protection was only a sham.&#34; He is one of the most honorable members on that side of the House, and he openly and honestly made that declaration.

When the honorable member foi Bourke interjected just now, I had lost sight of the fact that the &#34; confusion &#34; is to last not only till the next election, but after it, and that every Protectionist on that side of the House has been tied down for the next four or five years, and we do not know how many more years after that. But still, of course, the Tariff is not to be &#34; made a stalking horse of to disguise the weakness and lack of policy of the Government&#34; ! Those honorable members will be tied down as long as the fusion can possibly be made to last. I am glad to say that in the interests of the manufacturers of this great country it is far more likely that, when the Tariff comes to be dealt with, it will be at the hands of a Government drawn from this side of the House, who will treat it more honestly than it can possibly be dealt with by that side.

He was in Opposition then, and although it was not the duty of the Opposition to tell the Fisher Government where to find the money to carry out its own schemes, it certainly was their duty, if they made proposals that the Fisher Government would have to finance, and that were not in its policy., to tell the country where they would find the money. Has the Treasurer yet found out where the money is to come from?- The Government know nothing about their own finance, but we know where the money is to be found. It was little short of political brigandage for the Government to dip their hands into the Treasury to the tune of  &#163;2,000,000  without consulting the people, and without consulting Parliament, while it was sitting.

I challenge the honorable member for Bourke to find a single word about a naval scheme from the inauguration of the Federation until the honorable member for South Sydney put his scheme before the House. Some of us have rather good memories, but the honorable member for Bourke has a short one when it suits him. To show what reliance is to be placed upon the Prime Minister&#39;s promise, I wish to deal with the question of the cable service. No doubt honorable members have read the following cablegram from London, which recently appeared in our newspapers - </para>

                        <para class="block">The Government policy contains a proposal for the cheapening of cable rates. Let me show the value of that. If there is one curse which afflicts this country more than does the land monopoly, it is the cable monopoly. A Deakin Administration was responsible for allowing the Eastern .Extension Telegraph Company to open an office in Melbourne, and thus to take business away from the Pacific Cable Company, which every Government should do all in its power to assist. When the Copyright Bill was before Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> carried the insertion of a clause dealing with the cable monopoly. It was near the end of the session, and I had got so tired of the Government of the day that I felt inclined to leave the House altogether, hoping for better things in the new session. But, as I was interested in the attempt to break down the Cable Combine, I stayed. The Government had promised to support legislation to deal with that combine, and what was my astonishment when I was asked if I would be willing to allow the clause of which I have spoken to be dropped, to enable the Copyright Bill to be passed into law ! I immediately went into the Prime Minister&#39;s room, and asked the Minister if the clause was to be dropped. He said, &#34; Yes. The whole House is in favour of dropping it, because it is too late in the session to pass it, and it will not do what is aimed at.&#34; I asked, &#34;Then why not amend it?&#34; He replied - and I believe it to be true - that the question was too important to deal with so late in the session, adding, &#34; I promise you that next year this Government will introduce legislation to deal with the matter.&#34; That was the compact made with me. He wished me to stay and keep a House. Now I have always been here from the moment the  Speaker  takes the chair until the adjournment, and, of course, I stayed. Next year, the Attorney-General of the day - who is now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs - laid a couple of clauses on the table, and made a ten-minutes&#39; speech, saying that the matter with which they dealt was important, and should be considered by honorable members. I have in mv letter-box the notes from which I was going to speak in regard to that legislation, but they have not been used yet, because the Government did not give us an opportunity to discuss it. That shows the fraud that was practised upon us. Is the House aware that if a Labour daily newspaper is started in Adelaide it will be impossible, under present conditions, to get a cable service for it? </para>

Although we boast of our freedom, we depend for our cable news from other parts of the world upon a combine which can suppress and distort as it pleases, and which causes great loss to the community. Does the Government propose to  deal  with this combine? What right has it to say that no one shall share with it in the cable news ? </para>

Its establishment cost him a large part of his private means, and a great deal of labour. He was astounded at the difficulties placed in his way. Opposition of every kind was created by the highest officials in the Imperial service, and lies of all kind&#39;s were circulated by the Eastern Extension Company, such as the statement that the depth of the ocean would not permit the laying of the cable. When it was proposed to seize an island as a landing station, America was allowed to step in and prevent that being done, although the territory would have been of great value to the Empire. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sandford</inline> Fleming, speaking at the Jubilee Exhibition, so far back as 1887, said - </para>

                            <para>This is not the first time that a company or an individual has been called upon to relinquish a monopoly found to be inimical to the public welfare. Is it for a moment to be thought of that Canada and Australia are never to hold direct telegraphic intercourse because a commercial company stands in the way? Are commercial relations between two of the most important divisions of the British family forever to remain dormant in order that the profits of a company may be maintained? Are the vital interests of the British Empire to be neglected ? Is the permanent policy of England to be thwarted? Is the peace of the world to be endangered at the bidding of a joint stock company?

I venture to say that it does not cost the great daily newspapers one farthing for their cable news, but that, on the contrary, they make a substantial profit. Why should we not do as is done in the Old Country ? When I was connected with the third oldest newspaper in the United Kingdom, .the <inline font-style="italic">Aberdeen Journal,</inline> all that that office paid for the foreign cable news was the cost of telegraphing it over the special wire from London. At 2 o&#39;clock in the morning, the whole of the London daily newspapers are printed and ready to be sent into the provinces, and then the direct wires are set to work, and the whole of the cables thus made available throughout the Kingdom. Why should we allow a monopoly, which declares that no one shall live except on its own terms? </para>

I should compel the big dally newspapers to allow any newspaper to share the messages, if the ordinary prices are paid. </para>

I have no desire to be unfair to any monopoly or combine ; but I contend that every newspaper, and every member of the community, should be put on the same footing. The result of the present monopoly is that no independent news can be published - that untruths sent by cable cannot be contradicted. </para>

                                <para>- In that matter, there ought to be specific charges ; and, as I have no proof, I do not wish to deal with it. There ought to be absolute freedom in regard to cables, to those who desire to found new newspapers. I shall have a further opportunity of dealing with the question ; and, in the meantime, I ask the Postmaster-General to think the matter over, and see if he cannot compel the press monopoly to sell the news to all who wish to buy. Reuter&#39;s Company, and the other press agencies, can be dealt with by an amendment of the A,nti -Trust Act. The Prime Minister has told us how determined he is that no trust shall rear its head in Australia ; but here we have one that has not only reared its head, but is doing infinite damage. I hope the Government will not introduce such a foolish Defence Bill as they did before - a Bill quite in keeping with all the legislation lately introduced by the Prime Minister. That Defence Bill would accomplish nothing, and prove utterly unworkable. </para>

The Minister of Defence knows what a howling mess the Prime Minister and his late colleagues made of the Postal administration. .They had millions of money at their disposal ; but when the late Prime Minister came into office, not one sixpence was left. The Post and Telegraph Department might have been put in efficient order, if businesslike methods had been adopted ; but the State Rights members showed a desire only to placate the States, to the exclusion of great national concerns. Now the Government talk glibly about spending scores of thousands of pounds; and they will have to spend millions if they endeavour to people the Northern Territory ; because there is the debt to be considered, and roads are required in every direction. </para>

                                <para>- Many thousands of pounds, in order to pay old-age pensions. I am not going to blame the present Minister of Defence for anything in connexion with his Department, though I am sure I shall have much to blame him for later on, judging from the speeches we have heard from him. lt may be, however, that the honorable gentleman is going to sink his views in this, as in other matters, and bow to the Prime Minister. One set of views is held by the head of the Government, another set by the Minister of Defence, and a third by the Honorary Minister ; and under such circumstances, what kind of a hotch-potch may we not expect in the Defence Department? We are asked to spend  &#163;2,000,000  on a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought ;</inline> but I contend that if such an amount of money were spent in peopling the Northern Territory, it would be doing something for the Old Country and also Australia. The Old Country requires no monetary aid ; we have only to tell her, should the occasion arise, that we require several millions, and we would be given them as cheerfully as we should give them to her in case of necessity. I see that the honorable member for Wimmera is in the chamber ; and I desire to refer for a moment to the jumble of figures which the honorable member placed&#39; before us in the course of his address. I am sure that no one could make head or tail of what he was driving at; the only conclusion I could come to was that he was endeavouring to show that .there has been plenty of land settlement in Victoria lately. It is well known that in South Australia,  304  persons or companies own  3,545,000  acres of land, while  1,269,704  acres of alienated lands are held by  30  persons or companies; and the position is very little different in Victoria. I ask the honorable member whether he knows that in Victoria there has been a serious decline in the rural population? The records of the Statistical Department show that, between  .1884  and  1902,  the cultivated farms in fifteen counties declined by  2,352,  and that in  1893,  the area under cultivation was less than that in  T873,  while in.  1896  the cultivated farms had declined by  4.000.  Does the honorable member know that in 1904 there were 1,849 fewer holdings, as compared with 1884, although there, were 2,500,000 acres more in occupation? Does that look&#39; as if settlement were progressing ? The land of whole parishes in many instances has been merged in one large estate, the property of one person. That has taken place in a State having an area of 56,245,760 acres - an insignificant territory compared with that of other States. </para>

                                <para>- That has been due to the rush for land. I wish now to show very briefly what would be the effect &#62;of the adoption of the land tax proposals of the Fisher Government. Under the voluntary purchase of land system, which came into operation in South Australia in 1902, over 3,000 persons have been settled on the land. The adoption of the Labour Government&#39;s land tax proposals would lead, not to 3,000, but to 300,000 persons being settled there, and to many hundreds of thousands more being settled, in other parts of the Commonwealth. The Yongala Estate, which has an area of 53)59i acres, was acquired by the South Australian Government in 1902, when its improvements were valued at ?4,513 13s. 9d. It then carried 35,000 sheep, and two or three families. The Surveyor-General, in his report for 1907-8, shows that the estate was subdivided into 133 blocks, and allotted to 127 persons. The result is that the present value of improvements on the land is .?33,461 12s., whilst it is carrying 14,942 sheep and lambs, 973 horses, and 964 head of cattle. Last year 15,346 acres were under cultivation, and 9,435 acres in fallow. During the previous season 238,727 bushels of wheat, and 10,358 bushels of barley and oats were reaped from 15,068 acres, and the population, on the estate, including children, is now 615, all in comfortable circumstances. If the Fisher Government&#39;s land policy were adopted, we should settle thousands of similar estates. I want now to show the character of some honorable members opposite. I have here a cutting from a newspaper well known in the Wimmera district. I refer to the Warracknabeal <inline font-style="italic">Post,</inline> which in its issue of 1 6th March last, gives a report of a meeting  under the following headings, &#34; Kellalac Mail Service,&#34; &#34; Indignation Meeting of Residents.&#34; &#34; Some Plain Speaking,&#39;/ <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Mr. Sampson,</inline> M.H.R., Criticised.&#34; I think that the report ought to be brought under the notice of the House.

                            <para>There was something peculiar about their mail service altogether. As the meeting knew, some time ago they got up a petition and applied for 1 mail from Warracknabeal to Murtoa, up one day and down another. They could not get it. They were told at the time that it was a thing impossible. All of a sudden, they were given this new bi-weekly service from Warracknabeal. They were never consulted about that, or asked if they wanted it. Another thing he noticed was that on the previous Friday night they did not get their weekly papers <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> Murtoa. So far as he could make out, there was some underhand work in connexion with that. </para>

                            <para>It seemed to him that some one had been at work, and had the papers sent on to Warracknabeal so as to swell the new service. . . Before the <inline font-style="italic">Post</inline> was started, they were told by_ their representative, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sampson,</inline> that nothing could be done.

                            <para>The  chairman  said he had received a letter from S. Sampson and Co., which seemed to show that their member was representing the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> and not Kellalac, in the matter of the mail service, and that the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> was trying to get back the subscribers it lost when the <inline font-style="italic">Post</inline> started. He then read the letter, which began, &#34; Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. -</inline> Seeing that we have secured a biweekly mail to Kellalac,&#34; and concluded with &#34; hoping to see you reinstated on our list of subscribers.&#34; </para>

Even if it involves a waste of time, I shall adopt any means to prevent the passing, of the new Protection scheme which is now proposed by the Government, and which the honorable member for Flinders said -was a balloon, and a pricked balloon at that. We shall not have that kind of thing foisted upon us. I deprecate the wasting of time, and hope that the Government will bring forward measures that are really of advantage to the country. They will have my support in that direction, and I hope they will make a start with the Old-Age Pen-&#39; sions Bill. When they do something that is for the benefit of the people they will get no factious opposition from me. I hope the honorable member for Wimmera will reply to the charge which I have quoted. Honorable members opposite who hurl charges of Tammany methods at us can find nothing so nearly approaching Tammany as is contained in that report. </para>

                                <para>- No. According&#39; to that circular the honorable member for Wimmera took action and is using his success for pecuniary advantage to himself. Those, are Tammany methods, and the charge will have to be refuted or the House will have to take notice of it. I hope that if any honorable member on this side is ever guilty of anything approaching that, the House will deal with him at once, and I will assist the House to do it. Whether honorable members opposite agree with our caucus methods or not, they can charge nothing in the shape of Tammany methods against us. </para>

                                <para>- Apparently the honorable member does hot want us to have the power to do honest things. With regard to immigration, it is absolutely useless to talk until two things are done. It is only another sham, or as the Minister of Defence says, another &#34; piece of political cheatery.&#34; The honorable member is cheating the people of the Commonwealth when he tries to make them believe that it is possible to get any large amount of immigration until the country has been opened up and money has been found to bring the immigrants here. There is no difficulty at all about getting immigrants. We have absolute proof of that. Does the Minister of Defence know a gentleman of the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> Preedy, who has been the chief land agent in London for the New South Wales Government for the last four years ? </para>

                            <para>There has been a slump in Canadian immigration. This is Australia&#39;s opportunity. Englishmen, Irishmen, and Scotchmen in hundreds are prepared to try their fortunes so soon as we say we are prepared for them. When we inquired for immigrants in Aberdeen, Forfarshire, and other countries, we found plenty . of a desirable class of people awaiting an opportunity to go to Australia. . . . We have been recruiting from the country districts of the United Kingdom, and take only those for whom we can guarantee work. Australia could get 40,000 persons a year from Great Britain if she could&#39; find them employment. Artisans would come in hundreds if given the slightest encouragement. </para>

There is no difficulty about getting immigrants, except that the Government are not in earnest about the question. I ask leave to continue my remarks to-morrow. </para>
