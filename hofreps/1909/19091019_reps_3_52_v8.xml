                        <para>- It was stated in Saturday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> that the Postmaster-General proposes to communicate with the Commonwealth representative in London, to obtain the best expert advice as to whether tenders for the erection and equipment of wireless telegraphic stations shall be sought for only from the Marconi firm, or left open to all. I ask the honorable gentleman whether he cannot obtain from Captain Collins simply a statement informing the Government if there is a contract between the Marconi Company and the Admiralty, requiring the latter to use only the Marconi system in its wireless communications. I ask him, too, whether he will endeavour to show&#39; the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of his Department, which has professed anxiety to institute wireless telegraphy in Australia, by calling for tenders for installation at an earlier date than January,  191 1. </para>

                        <para>- I have given instructions to my officers for tenders to be called for, but delay has been caused by the necessary work of settling the conditions and the form of the specifications. All possible information is being obtained from the Admiralty and from Captain Collins. I shall be pleased to act on the honorable member&#39;s suggestion as to the advisability of ascertaining whether the Admiralty is bound down to any particular system of wireless telegraphy. It is my desire and intention to carry out the will of the House in this matter without the least unnecessary delay. I shall not tolerate formal objections or. technicalities, but there must be preliminary inquiries&#39;, and I must take the advice of professional men. </para>

                            <para>- The transaction is a business arrangement between the Egyptian Government and the Suez Canal Company. The former has no interest in Australian concerns, but our desire for reduced rates has been represented to the company as strongly as possible on several occasions, but without success. The plea is that the reduction of rates on Australian steamers cannot be considered until the widening of the canal now in progress is finished. No opportunity to press our claim on the company will be lost, but this transaction affords no special opportunity to repeat it. </para>

I have pointed out that any person or State affected has a remedy at law. If an import is stopped by the New South Wales Government, and the importer considers that action an abuse of the police powers of the State, there is nothing to prevent him from raising the question in the Courts. </para>

                        <para>The way not to do it is being shown at present by the Library Committee of the Federal Parliament in connexion with the collection of books and records which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick</inline> has presented to the Commonwealth. This magnificent library of early Australian and Colonial history, after an attempt to scatter it among thousands of books in the general library had been resisted, has been consigned to the vaults at the rear of the House of Representatives. Here, the priceless manuscripts, charts, and books, which had not been out of glass cases for years, are on ordinary deal shelves, open to dust, and liable to rapid destruction. For four months the question of finding suitable accommodation for the works has been under consideration, and to-day this simple matter of buying some book cases with glass doors appears to be as far off settlement as ever. It is a poor compliment to one who has spent a lifetime in the collection of historical records, and who now regards them almost with the love of a father for a child, that his gifts should apparently be unappreciated in this way. </para>

I wish to ask whether, in view of the great benefit derived by citizens of Melbourne and visitors to this city from the exhibition of the Petherick collection in the Queen&#39;s Hall, the Prime Minister will not take steps to enable all who desire to inspect the collection to do so? </para>

                        <para>-I think that as a member of the Library Committee, it would, perhaps, be better that I should reply to the honorable member&#39;s question. I am sorry that the statement that the Petherick collection has been buried in the vaults of Parliament House should have been repeated. </para>

I refer to the fact that the Victorian infantry have not, for the last twenty months, been supplied with bayonets. As about two-thirds of the men have never had bayonets, it is impossible for them to be instructed in bayonet drill. I wish to know if the Minister is able to make any statement as to when the bayonets will arrive, so that the men may receive necessary instruction. </para>

                    <para>.- Shortly before the adjournment on Friday last, the Minister told the Committee that a serious consideration which must weigh with honorable members in approaching this agreement with South Australia is the particular clause in the agreement whereby South Australia, in consideration of our assenting to the agreement, gives us permission under the Constitution to proceed with the construction of the trans-continental line to Western Australia. It is suggested that it is right from the point of view of the Commonwealth, when arranging for the construction of a line in the Northern Territory, to make some arrangement with regard to a similar Commonwealth project towards the West. But if this is being held out to us by the people of South Australia as a sort of ultimatum to compel our acquiescence in the transfer of the Northern Territory, as one would understand from the Minister&#39;s remarks on Friday last- </para>

                        <para>- I do not think they have any prior claim to Australia taking over a proper proportion of the Northern Territory, and developing it according to its own views, but the honorable member is perfectly correct if he means that Western Australia has a prior claim in regard&#39; to railway construction. I am glad to learn that this condition of the agreement, to which the Minister of External Affairs referred with such extraordinary innocence on Friday afternoon, is not intended as a bait for Western. Australian members. If it were, it would be the surest way of putting this House out of sympathy with the whole proposal, because this is the last legislative body in Australia to consent to dictation - to blackmail - of this type. I would suggest that, even in the temporary absence of the honorable member for North Sydney, the abundant merits of his proposal should receive the indorsement of Ministers. It is quite useless to think that this Parliament can be led, against its own better judgment, to adopt the proposals arrived at by the Prime Minister, when head of a former Administration, in agreement with the then Premier of South Australia. It is transparent that this Parliament will not accept them. I hold that it should, therefore, show South Australia exactly what it is prepared to concede. That is the least that we owe to that State. The right honorable member for East Sydney suggested that we ought to signify, by speaking, what our intentions towards South Australia are; but to refrain from endeavouring to alter the agreement by a vote. </para>

                        <para>- For once in his life, the right honorable member is on rather illogical ground. I can see no difference between a refusal on our part to take over certain property - to wit, a railway in South Australia - or certain real estate, in the shape of portion of the Northern Territory, which we do not wish to receive. Unless we show definitely by our votes what we mean to do with regard to the agreement, our attitude will be misrepresented outside. A number of people in South Australia will say that we have refused to sanction the agreement, not because the most that we would assent to is contained in the honorable member for North Sydney&#39;s amendment but because we do not like the agreement itself, and they may try us by making an offer a little higher than the honorable member for North Sydney suggests. That would lead again to endless delay, and to an increase of the irritation so markedly expressed on Friday afternoon by the honorable member for Grey. </para>

                        <para>- I should not like to charge the honorable &#39;member with ever having said a comical thing. As the successor of the late honorable member for Adelaide, the honorable member seems almost to feel as if the mantle of that gentleman had fallen upon him, and to think that every remark of his should be taken with the greatest seriousness. We can claim in all sincerity that we are concerned purely with Australian needs. If, after we have taken over such portion of the Northern Territory as we think advisable - the tropical portion that South Australia cannot more capably develop - the experts advise us that the route through the centre of the Territory is in the best interests of the Territory and Australia as a whole, I shall be delighted to record my vote for it. But, in the absence of such information, this Parliament would be false to its duty, and to all business principles, if it consented to an agreement compelling it to build a railway through a certain portion of the Territory, and connecting with a certain city in Australia, without regard to the necessities of Australia as a whole. </para>

                    <para>.-I intend to support the amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney. It appears to me that it is infinitely preferable to the proposed agreement, and its adoption will convey to South Australia an indication of what she may expect this Parliament to sanction, because it is abundantly clear that the tentative agreement has no possible chance of being ratified. If the Territory were handed over to the Commonwealth from the twenty-second parallel the railway construction which we should have to undertake would be comparatively light, and from that stand-point I am decidedly in favour of the amendment. It seems to me that the proposed agreement is rather of a one-sided character. I quite recognise that South Australia is entitled to every credit for having struggled with the administration, of this huge area since 1863, and for having maintained it as a white man&#39;s country. Nevertheless, I scarcely think it is fair that the other States should be burdened in. the way that they would be burdened if this agreement were accepted. The taking over of the Territory would involve an outlay of &#163;10,000,000, and a much larger expenditure would be necessary to develop it. From that stand-point it seems to me that the amendment is very much preferable to the clause in the Bill. If it is what it has been painted to be - and I have no reason to believe that it does not possess the large and fertile areas which have been claimed for it - it seems to me that South Australia should be permitted to develop it as far as the MacDonnell Ranges in the best way possible. That would necessitate the construction by South Australia of 200 miles of railway to connect the line which now terminates at Oodnadatta with the point mentioned. From every standpoint I regard the amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney as preferable to the agreement embodied in the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the amendment will not be carried. As long as I can remember, doubts have been expressed as to the development of what has been called the &#34; dead heart of Australia.&#34; This Territory comprises hundreds of millions of acres, and no one possessing a truly Federal spirit would say that the burden of developing it for the good of Australia should be left to one State. It is to say the least peculiar that certain honorable members should argue that it should not be borne by all the States. A problem like this should surely be solved by the federated people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am surprised that the honorable member should indulge in such cheap sneers. We should be guilty of absolute meanness if we shirked the responsibilities of the Commonwealth in connexion with this Territory. South Australia with a comparatively small population has for many years guarded this door to Australia from coloured invasion. She says to-day, &#34; We find the financial burden of developing it too pressing, and think that the Commonwealth should relieve us of it.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The railway conditions will have to be fought out. It is absurd to say that it would be unwise for us to own a railway running through State territory. Such an argument has been advanced either in the House or in the press ; but to my mind we could not do better than extend our ownership of railways in the States. As a matter of fact, in time of war we should have to assume control of the whole of the railways of the States. It would be advantageous for us to take over the Territory and construct a railway through it; the more sections we build the better. We should be able to control the gauge and perhaps make a better job of the work than any State could do. On the other hand, if we allowed South Australia to carry the present line as far north as the MacDonnell Ranges, she would construct it in accordance with her present gauge. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps the South Australian gauge would be found suitable ; but the suggestion that we should not own a railway running through a State is quite opposed to the Federal spirit. I reject the suggestion that this amendment would be beneficial to South Australia. That part of the Territory which it is pro-  posed shall continue in her possession may contain great mineral possibilities, but many years would elapse before South Australia would be able to promote settlement and development in the north. </para>

                        <para>- But a mere handful of people could not develop that country. For the safety of Australia, settlement should proceed as rapidly as possible in the north, and the Commonwealth can most effectively promote that settlement. That is one of the reasons why I favour the transfer of the Territory; but I shall vote against every clause of the agreement of which I do not approve. </para>

                    <para>.- As the right honorable member for East Sydney has said, the proposal now under consideration should have come from South Australia, if it is to be considered at all. If, as has been represented, the suggested variation of the agreement would be better for South Australia, she should decide that point for herself. The proposal is, as I understand it, that there should be no railway conditions, and that the whole of the territory north of the twenty-second parallel should be handed over to the Commonwealth unconditionally, except in regard to the portion of the debt chargeable to the territory taken over. </para>

                        <para>- I  would ask honorable members not to spend much  time over this proposed&#39; modification&#39;, because there is no possible chance of its being accepted by South Australia.  I  do not know whether it would not be better from a South Australian point of view if the Commonwealth were to take over the area down to Hergott Springs, so long as the other conditions stipulated for were complied with. South Australia might consider such a proposal as that. But it is absurd for us to place the suggestion now made before the State. It has been stated that this proposal was put before the South Australian Legislature. The proposal made to the South Australian&#39; Legislative Council by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duncan</inline> was in the following terms :  -  &#34; Provided - (a) That the southern boundary of the portion of the Northern Territory to be taken over by the Commonwealth be fixed approximately at the twenty-second degree south latitude.

                        <para>- I would remind the Committee that there is a considerable section of the South Australian people who are strongly opposed to the transfer of the Northern Territory on any conditions. Some of the members of the Legislative Council who were of that opinion sought to vary the agreement with the real object of killing the Bill. They did not want to have the Territory taken over. </para>

                        <para>- I think that was their object. It has never been seriously suggested in South Australia that the northern boundary of the State should be extended to the twenty-second parallel, and the remaining portion of the Northern Territory handed over to the &#39;Commonwealth without conditions, a proposition to that effect has never been formally laid before the Legislature; nor has it been seriously proposed to the public of the State that South Australia should abandon the railway conditions. I am certain that it would be useless to make such a .proposition, because it would not be accepted. The country which it is proposed by the honorable member for North Sydney that South Australia should retain has the smallest rainfall in the whole Territory. </para>

                        <para>- Who said that? I would not father any such statement. The extension of the railway to the MacDonnell Ranges would help to make the line pay, or rather it would develop country in the vicinity of the Ranges. It would enable the desert to be .bridged, and the good land to the north of the Ranges to be opened up. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the MacDonnell Ranges have a magnificent future from a mineral point of view. When I speak of the MacDonnell Ranges, I do not mean &#39;merely the country in which the Ranges are situated, but also that which is watered by the streams which flow north from the Ranges. But the proposal of the honorable member for North Sydney is not one which South Australia could seriously consider as an alternative. She now controls the whole Territory, and she is asked to accept responsibility for the worst portion of it, with the exception of a piece of mineral country pertaining to the Ranges. </para>

                        <para>- No ; the books say that the MacDonnell Ranges country is good, and capable of carrying a considerable number of sheep. But, because of insufficient rainfall, the land between the northern boundary of South Australia and the MacDonnell Ranges is inferior. The proposal now under consideration is simply to extend the border of South Australia, so as to include the inferior portion of the Northern Territory, with the exception of part of the MacDonnell Ranges, without any compensating advantage. It would be very much better for South Australia, if she is going to extend her boundary, to extend it to the ocean and retain the Territory altogether, and I feel&#39; quite certain that that is what it will do. I ask honorable members not to vote for the amendment. It is not a fair proposal so far as the State is concerned, .and, further, it is one which its Parliament will not accept. </para>

                        <para>- The very moment that the honorable member for Wakefield made this suggestion, they seemed to think that it was an entirely new one; whereas, as I pointed out in my speech on the second reading, it was made fifteen years ago by a member of the State Parliament, the late Honorable J. Langdon Parsons, who, however, proposed to fix the boundary at the twenty-first parallel, so that the matter has been well thought out and considered in the State. There is no doubt that the State will not agree to the amendment. A very pertinent interjection was made to the honorable member for Wentworth by the honorable member for Grey when he asked this question, &#34; If the Commonwealth were to take over the northern part of the Northern Territory, and leave South Australia with the country up to the MacDonnell Ranges, would the honorable member vote for the construction of a railway connecting with the State railway system?&#34; I think that if this amendment were carried, South Australia would require an assurance that that railway would be joined with its system and constructed when its own line was built, for the simple reason that the Commonwealth would be in the position of having a railway up to the Macdonnell Ranges to bridge over a very difficult part of the country, and then develop Commonwealth territory at the expense of the State. I do not think that there is any use in discussing the amendment so far as the State is concerned. I have been astonished at the scepticism which has been shown by a number of honorable members in regard tq the value of the Northern Territory. They seem to think that honorable members for South Australia have been painting the country in too rosy colours. I want to quote two extracts in addition to what has been supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lindsay,</inline> who knows the country so well, and the literature which has been distributed. I propose, first, to quote the opinion of a man who knows more about the value of the Northern Territory, and what it can produce, than, I suppose, any other man alive*. I refer to the curator of the Adelaide Botanical Gardens, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M.</inline> W. Holtze, because apparently a few honorable members do not know what has been done.

                    <para>This I have proved to the satisfaction of every visitor able to judge in the Botanic Gardens at Port Darwin, the soil of which is decidedly not superior to the average soil of the Northern Territory, and have done so on an expenditure per acre less than that generally considered necessary on properly conducted plantations. If I had not done this, how could I have obtained the numerous distinctions for my exhibits at the Calcutta Exhibition, where I competed against the best efforts of India, Ceylon, and Queensland, and where I was awarded eight certificates of merit, together with two gold, one silver, and three bronze medals for produce grown in the Botanic Garden, produce prepared without proper appliances, simply with domestic implements by <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Holtze</inline> and myself? </para>

                    <para>T confidently assert that the Northern Territory is exceptionally rich in minerals, only a small part of which has been made known to the public. I do not believe that the same quantity of minerals, veins of gold, silver, tin, copper, and lead will be found in any equal area in Australia. In fact, I doubt if in any provinces will be found any country so singularly <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> exceptionally favoured as  Arnheim&#39;s  land is in respect to &#34;mineral riches. </para>

                <para class="block">What the honorable member for North Sydney wants to do is to Jet South Australia take the territory up to the MacDonnell Ranges. I admit that it is very, rich country, because there we have had a battery running almost continuously for, I think, twelve years, which has never put through stone that produced less than lj ounces of gold to the ton, though we have not a mine in the MacDonnell Ranges. That work has been going on from year to year, so that there is no doubt about the mineral wealth of the country. I may mention that the better class of country extends much further north than the twenty-second parallel., I think that the honorable member for North Sydney must see that it would be very foolish indeed for South Australia to agree to retain the country up to that point, and have no guarantee as to what the &#39;Commonwealth will do with the country north of it. For that reason I hope that the agreement will be rejected. </para>

                    <para>. - I had no intention of again speaking on this question. I have not tried in any way, except by speech in the Committee, to influence honorable members in favour of the amendment. I took the action which I thought was right from my stand-point, leaving honorable members to act as they saw fit. I object to the statement just made by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, and that is what brought me to my feet. He stated that my amendment was intended to defeat the agreement. </para>

                        <para>- If I were against any agreement I should have no hesitation in saying so, nor would I see any difficulty in taking that course. What I adopted was the course which my own  opinion favoured. South Australia is quite right in asking to be relieved of the Territory, the troublesome portion of which is that within the tropics, and, to my mind, the Commonwealth has the right to consider the request a fair one for relieving the State of the Territory and its deficiency. But when we come to the conditions of the agreement, whilst I hold that South Australia should be recouped its expenditure, and even a fair portion of the accumulated deficiency - for although I do not think that it recouped the British Government any potion of its accumulated deficiency when it took over the Territory, I am willing to concede that. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the British Government made a number of costly experiments, which resulted in failure. I am not saying that South Australia should be called upon to refund that deficiency, nor am I objecting to the State asking for consideration as regards its own accumulated deficiency, because I consider that any reasonable proposition in that direction ought to be assented to. I am also willing that all liability which the State has incurred in the way of loan for the development of the Territory should be recouped. In that case the State would receive practically all that it had spent, and in addition it would be relieved from a yearly loss which is heavy now, and which will increase for many years with the greater effort to develop and settle the country. The people of South Australia, as well as those of the other States, must benefit by any development of the Northern Territory; but if there be a transfer South Australia alone will not be responsible for the cost of that development. That being so, the Commonwealth must take over the Territory free of conditions which would prevent its settlement and development by whatever means might be considered most desirable. I am not assuming a State attitude in this matter, nor do I think that the State attitude should be recognised even so far as South Australia is concerned, except in respect to the refunding of her past expenditure on the Territory. I do not advocate the construction of any particular line of railway, not even a line through the back country of Queensland and New South Wales, connecting the present lines which run inland from the coast. Those lines will be connected eventually by the States concerned, for the development of their own Territory, by facilitating the removal of stock from drought-stricken districts, and providing other conveniences for the carrying on of the pastoral and other industries. </para>

                        <para>- I have not heard it expressed here. I should oppose such a proposal were I a member of the Parliament when it was brought forward. What I now propose is not unreasonable. The Commonwealth will refund to South Australia all her expenditure, and take over her liabilities, reserving to itself the rights if the very expensive extension of the present line from Pine Creek to the MacDonnell Ranges is found not to be the most desirable way of developing the Territory, to follow some other route. When the Commonwealth becomes directly responsible for the Territory, its object will be to develop it as quickly as possible, in order to reduce the annual loss. If the construction of the line which representatives of South Australia advocate is considered best, it will be done, but if it were thought that another line or lines would better develop the Territory, the Commonwealth should be free to make it or them. I propose the advancement of the north boundary of South Australia to beyond the MacDonnell Ranges because it has been stated that the line from Port Augusta north has not yet reached country from which the traffic can be profitable, and that when it taps the MacDonnell Ranges it will pay. If South Australia contends that the transfer of the Northern Territory as at present bounded would make it impossible for her to extend her railway to a goal which she has in view, it would be unfair to insist on the retention of the present boundary. Of course, if South Australia is content to have the boundary remain where it is, that is another matter. </para>

                        <para>- In a number of speeches, reference has been made to the value of .the MacDonnell Range country. I do not wish to force territory on South Australia, but I have gathered from the statements which have been made that it would be an advantage to the State to have the MacDonnell Range country included within its borders. In giving this extra territory, the Commonwealth should not accept any obligation to construct any particular railway, or to take over the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. If this Parliament is not prepared to do those things, it would be an advantage to South Australia, according to the statements which have been made, to obtain the extension of territory which my amendment would give. The amendment has been moved in the interest, not of the Commonwealth, but of the State, and on the assumption that the Commonwealth will not accept the conditions regarding the construction and taking over of railways. The right honorable member for East Sydney said the other day that he did not think that there should be an .attempt to amend the agreement. </para>

                        <para>- We can indicate our views clearly only by making amendments. Speeches have been delivered entirely in favour of the agreement, partly in favour of it, and against it. Some honorable members have indicated one line of difference, and others another. Unless we materialize our views in an amendment, we cannot indicate to South. Australia the conditions which we are prepared to accept. I do not wish the Commonwealth to refuse to undertake the responsibility for the annual deficit, past expenditure, and future loss in connexion with the Northern Territory, nor do I object to its undertaking the cost of developing that Territory. The development of the tropical portion will prove most difficult, and for many years will cause a very heavy loss. What I object to is the binding of the Commonwealth by conditions regarding the taking over of an existing railway and the making of another, which I do not think should be in the agreement. If the Committee is with me, it will support the amendment. If not, it will accept the agreement as it stands. I do not think that the conditions regarding future railway construction should be insisted on by South Australia. If they are, they should not be accepted by the Commonwealth. In taking over trie Territory, the Commonwealth pledges itself to do its best for the development of the Territory, not in the interests of any State, but of the Territory, and, consequently, of all Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- The words of the last  speaker  might lead one to believe that he is overwhelmed with love, and a desire to do the right thing, for South Australia. We must give him credit for the purest motives. But the Committee is concerned, not with the motive power of the honorable member, but with where we are likely to stop if he be permitted to move us. If I were driving a motor, the motive power would be a matter of very little concern to me so long as the machine continued to progress in the direction . I desired. The honorable member for North Sydney will see that whatever his motives in submitting his amendment may be, he ought to consider the result should honorable members permit themselves to be influenced by his proposal. </para>

                        <para>- If the amendment were accepted, the proposed transfer of the Territory from South Australia would be a thing of the past. The honorable member can* hardly expect the people of South Australia to favour his proposal. Whatever be his motive in submitting it, his amendment, if adopted, would result in the rejection of the agreement, and the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth would not now. take place. Whether honorable members desire that the Northern Territory shall ever be_ taken over by the Commonwealth, I do not know ; but the project is one to which, I think, serious attention should be given, even  if the agreement includes some small conditions which do not meet with the entire approval of honorable members. </para>

We require from another of the States about a flowerpot-full of earth for a capital site, and there has been more consideration shown, more bowing of the head, and changing of opinion in this House, from time to time, in order to meet the extraordinary views of the responsible authorities in that State, than could well be conceived. </para>

                        <para>- We want an area which, compared with the area of the Northern Territory, may be described as a. flowerpot-full of earth. South Australia is offering to the Commonwealth a territory as large as that occupied by many nations. We have certain powers, as a Commonwealth Parliament, but under the Constitution we cannot exercise supreme control over one square yard of territory in the whole of Australia. Under this agreement, we are offered millions of acres, hundreds of thousands of square miles, of excellent country, embracing the climatic conditions to be found in almost every other part of the Commonwealth. On compliance with a few comparatively trifling conditions, the Federal Parliament would be in a position to exercise supreme control over this territory, to do with it as it thinks fit, and to exercise, within its boundaries, full powers in the matter of government. Notwithstanding the great possibilities of the Northern Territory, and the desire expressed in this Parliament for a territory of our own to develop, we are haggling over the conditions in a manner which, I venture to say, does not reflect credit upon us. South Australia has had control of this Territory for a number of years. During that period, the people of South &#39;Australia have held the Territory for Australia, and not for a small section of the people of the Commonwealth. They have not done, as I venture to say has Wen done in New South Wales and Queensland, misused a portion of their territory in such a way that the Federal Parliament would now be only too glad to buy them out under any conditions. The only request made now is that the Northern </para>

                        <para>- A few pounds only. South Australia is asking about twopence per acre for the Northern Territory, including improvements in the shape of harbors, jetties, railways, and other public works. The South Australian people are offering to the Commonwealth the Northern Territory, with all its resources, on condition of the payment of a few pounds of debt incurred in connexion with it, and the construction of a railway, over which the Commonwealth would have complete control, connecting the northern with the southern sea. If the Territory is taken over on the terms suggested by one or two honorable members, however plausible their statements to the contrary may be, no portion of it will ever be developed unless the trade with it is directed to one particular city. The curse of Australia up to the present time has been that, in every State, country has been opened up and developed only if it increased the trade and importance of the capital city of the State. As this Parliament is at present constituted, and is likely to continue, no power will be able to move it to construct the railway referred to in any but one direction, irrespective of the interest of any State in the construction of the line. Some honorable members aver that South Australia is asking that the Territory should be taken over. I happened to be in the South Australian House of Assembly when the agreement was approved by the Parliament of that State. I was in daily conversation with the late Premier of the State when these matters were under consideration. I wish to say that, while there was an impression among public men that the Commonwealth Parliament, with its greater powers, and financial strength, would be able more quickly and profitably for the whole of Australia to develop the Northern Territory ; yet, so far as the people of South Australia were concerned I did not know, and do not at present know, of, any overwhelming desire on their part that the Commonwealth should take over the Territory. There was an intimation to the then Premier of the State that, were he able to secure an agreement of a reasonable character, he might depend on the Parliament of South Australia to support that agreement. </para>

                <para class="block">He came here and entered into a conference with the Prime Minister, and was supported during the whole of that conference by one of the leading daily journals of Victoria. As a result, an agreement was arrived at. I should like to contrast the treatment of that agreement and of another recently arrived at by the Prime Minister and certain other persons. This one was subsequently ratified by the South Australian Parliament. Consequently it is now an agreement between the Prime Minister - acting for his Ministry and for his side of politics, at any rate, in the Federal Parliament - and a State. Yet some honorable members are about to break it, apparently with the lightest of hearts, and with an utter disregard for the interests of the whole of the State which stands behind it. At the same time the same members are urging others to stand fast to the agreement upon the financial question, which up to the present has been made only between the Prime Minister and certain ephemeral Premiers of the different States. I cannot understand the change of front. The one agreement - made between the Prime Minister and certain Premiers who come and go, one of whom has already gone, and three others of whom are in a distinctly parlous condition - is of such a binding character as to force the whole of a particular party behind it, and the Prime Minister stands or falls by it, asserting that his Ministry must live or die with it. But in the other case, where the agreement is between the Prime Minister and the whole of the people of a State, and has received the unanimous approval of the Parliament of that State, the same honorable members seem to believe that they can break through it as lightly as air, with an utter disregard for all its provisions. I respectfully submit to honorable members that, whatever may be their immediate view, the fact that an opportunity is offered to them of being supreme masters, through this Parliament, of so huge a territory,  with  all its possibilities, ought to have some influence in determining them to accept the comparatively small conditions which stand in the agreement. I have no authority to speak either for South Australia or for any of its representatives, but I say distinctly that, if this amendment is carried, what is left of the agreement cannot possibly have <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> support. I regard the amendment as fatal. If it is approved of, the agreement might just as well be thrown out. Indeed, it would be better if honorable members would say at once that they will not accept the agreement, and leave it open to South Australia, if she so desires, to offer further conditions or to undertake the development of the Territory herself. I do not know who first suggested that the southern portion of the Territory should remain under South Australian control, and that the part north of the MacDonnell Ranges should be taken over by the Commonwealth, but, whoever the individual was, he made the suggestion purely on his own initiative, and so far as I can find, without authority. He must have been acting entirely upon his own responsibility. It finds no favour in South Australia, and, so far as I can gather, it has no possible chance of acceptance there. I had no overwhelming desire that the offer embodied in the present agreement should be made. Had I consulted my own personal wishes, I should have preferred that South Australia should retain the Territory. A time will come, probably within a very few years, when the Federal Parliament will ask South Australia to hand over to it that portion of the Commonwealth. Even earlier, perhaps, this Parliament will keenly regret that it did not accept the agreement with its limited conditions. Although the motive of the honorable member for North Sydney may be as pure as a motive can possibly be in a public man, I hope that his amendment will be beaten. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Hindmarsh has suggested that honorable members must be sceptical as to the value of the Northern Territory. But we cannot well be sceptical on that point, in view of the very glowing picture which has been painted of its merits and possibilities. I, for one, am not at all sceptical. I place a good deal of reliance upon the statements of the honorable member for Grey, who has seen a large portion of the country, and knows1 a great deal about it, and who had no hesitation in giving his personal testimony- as to the value of the Territory. But I am sceptical whether the Commonwealth can develop it better than could the State Government. The development of Australia can be best achieved within the strict lines of the Constitution. The Commonwealth may advantageously carry out its more legitimate functions, leaving all internal development to take place under the&#39; aegis of the States. </para>

                        <para>- I do not. I call it a proper function if South Australia cannot possibly develop the Territory herself. But South Australia takes up a very strong position in saying that if the Commonwealth will not accept the transfer she is prepared to retain the Territory, and that this is our last chance of getting it. She must therefore have the intention as well as the means to develop it. The honorable member for Adelaide said that the Commonwealth Parliament ought to take it over, because we could then do precisely, as we liked with it ; and in fact, be the supreme masters of the situation. That indicates to me an intention on the part of some honorable members that the Commonwealth Government should, in addition to exercising its proper Commonwealth functions, take possession of the Territory and undertake work which the State Govern.ments are essentially designed to perform. That would be altogether a mistaken mode of procedure. If this Parliament should ratify the agreement and take, over and become the supreme masters of the Territory, we can only properly retain the mastery of it while its development remains in its initial stages. As soon as it becomes sufficiently developed, the necessity will be cast upon us of giving it some sort of Constitution and making its position analogous to that occupied by the other States. </para>

                        <para>- Although that may be the ideal in the minds of the Government, we must remember that South Australia is prepared to develop the Territory. It has been said that she will develop it if we do not. Therefore, as that is the proper function of a State, why not allow South Australia to perform it ? It has been asserted that if we take over the country north of the 22nd parallel, we shall still not have given South Australia the richest portion of the Territory. Let us go a little further north and give them the Territory which they claim is necessary for its development. But&#39; as a <inline font-style="italic">guid -pro quo</inline> let South Australia relieve the Commonwealth of the responsibility of taking over the line from Port Augusta. I am distinctly averse to the Commonwealth taking over the railways of any State until it is prepared to take over the railways of all of the States. </para>

Inasmuch as it is repeatedly asserted that the Territory contains a large area of good country, and that it is wealth producing, surely South Australia should be allowed to develop it.

                    <para>. - I recognise that for years South Australia has maintained the Northern Territory as a white man&#39;s country. It has prevented the boodleier from intruding into that immense domain. Queensland,, on the other hand, introduced black men, and their deportation necessitated every man in Australia putting his hand into his pocket. Some honorable members are like the missionaries who raise money to send to far-off lands to promote the work of Christianizing the heathen, many of whom are then brought to Australia to be sweated in the cane fields, and are ultimately returned, still heathens, to their islands. I am going to vote with the representatives of South Australia. The proposed railway from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta will not benefit Tasmania any more than the proposed railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie will do, but it is a matter of national concern. We are not here as parochialists ; we are here to do that which will benefit Australia as a whole and will be productive of good to the diversified interests of the country. (Posterity will be benefited bv these railways. They will be used by, amongst others, the young sons of Tasmania, who will go to the Territory, and the back-wash will return to the other States. It would not be fair to refuse to take over the MacDonnell Ranges country and to throw on South Australia the work of extending the line from Oodnadatta to the twenty-second&#34; parallel. Such a railway will never pav until thousands of people have been settled  there, and that settlement will not be possible until we have a National postal banking system to help the people. </para>

                        <para>- The way in which the Government vary the order of business and, whilst professing anxiety to expedite the consideration of a Bill, drop it as soon as an opportunity occurs to push on with it, certainly does not appeal to me. I have not spoken on the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, but think that the people of South Australia are entitled to have without delay the decision of this House with regard to it. The Defence Bill was considered so urgent about three weeks ago that the closure was applied to expedite its progress. It has been urgent indeed for several years, and the Government now think it of such pressing importance that they have adjourned the further consideration of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, although they have obviously a majority in favour of it. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt. The Government have present to-day a majority ready to pass the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill ; but they are not prepared to put them to the test. It is necessary that the people of South Australia should know without delay what is to be the fate of the agreement ; but apparently some honorable members opposite have said to the Government, &#34; We will vote with you against the amendment proposed by the honorable member for North Sydney, provided that you do not proceed further with the Bill.&#34; If that is not the position, why did the Government report progress when they had in attendance a majority apparently prepared to pass the Bill. Whilst the Defence Bill deserves every consideration, whether it is proceeded with to-day or to-morrow does not seriously matter. But why not settle the agreement with South Australia as to the Northern Territory while honorable members are fully acquainted with the facts? If the Government are not in favour of the agreement, why not let the people of South Australia know? Why continue to adjourn the matter? In my humble opinion, the Government are humbugging with a most important question, and bringing the Commonwealth into contempt in the eyes of the South Australian people. I have no sympathy with the attitude which they are adopting. </para>

                    <para>.- If the honorable member for Kalgoorlie is so much concerned about the passage of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, he should have expressed his opinion to that effect while the measure was before the House. If I recollect rightly, however, he did not raise his voice in favour of the Bill. I do not know whether it was his modesty that prevented him from saying anything, but he did not even object to progress being reported. I am glad to learn that the view of the Leader of the Opposition as to the urgency of the Defence Bill is not shared in by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie. I understood the Leader of the Opposition to ask for a postponement of the measure because a member of his party is ill. I rejoice that the honorable member for Kalgoorlie desires to proceed with the Bill, and am glad that the measure will be dealt with while he is in such an amiable frame of mind. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Wentworth has either misunderstood me, or placed a wrong construction on what I said. The point which I put to the Prime Minister does not affect me personally, but, if there is a member of this House whose attendance would be desirable when the Defence Bill is under consideration, it is the honorable member for West Sydney. I have a telegram from him stating that he has been medically advised to remain at home for a week. While not urging the Government to delay the Defence Bill,I think I was justified in bringing that point under the notice of the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- I know of no such arrangement. While the matter of the Northern Territory may not be so important as the Defence Bill, yet it is really a part of our defence policy, because no effective defence of Australia can be devised until the Commonwealth is in possession of the Territory. It is possible that the opportunity to acquire it may disappear if we do not grapple with the question at once. To say that the Defence Bill is more important is simply to say that the whole is greater than its part, which we all admit. </para>

                    <para>. - I understood that the Government intended to proceed with the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill until the amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney was disposed of.I desire to repeat what I urged upon the Government last week, that the question should be settled as early as possible. It is useless to delay a settlement until we approach the end of the session, because the Senate must have time to consider the subject. Furthermore, the question should be settled one way or the other, in order that South Australia may know what position she occupies in relation to the development of the Territory. It is useless to talk about lack of population and settling people on the soil of the Northern Territory if we delay dealing with the matter. I feel confident that, had the Government decided to proceed with the Bill further this afternoon, we could almost have disposed of it at to-day&#39;s sitting. Of course, I have no wish to take business out of the hands of the Government, but I impress upon them the desirableness, and, indeed, the urgent necessity, of arriving at an early decision if the spirit of the agreement is to be carried out. </para>

                    <para>. - In my opinion, the Northern Territory question should be settled before we proceed to deal with the Defence Bill, because the northern coasts of Australia are in most need of defence. In saying so, however, I may state again that I am opposed to the whole defence policy, because it is unnecessary. We no more require such a policy than it was required as between Canada and the United States, which settled questions at issue between them as far back as  181  7, and have never since had a warship on the lakes. </para>

                        <para>- But what kind of warships? The vessels there are merely little schooners. We must base our defence scheme upon a recognition of the importance of defending the Northern Territory. We should not dilly-dally with the question. But procrastination is the fundamental basis of the British Constitution ; and it seems to me that procrastination is also the fundamental basis of the Fusion, or fungus, organization which supports the Government. The further postponement of the Bill is to me an evidence that the Government have neither confidence in themselves nor sincerity. I want the people of South Australia to know what this Parliament proposes to do in the matter. Let the people and the Parliament of South Australia know where they are. Let the Treasurer of that State know whether he has to go on financing the Territory or whether the Commonwealth intends to do so. The agreement is a business proposition. Surely no one will deny that a European or an American syndicate would very quickly grab the Territory if offered? </para>

We are stopped at every turn from the cradle, and at last we are kicked into the grave. It seems tome that it is the same when I try to speak here. I am trying to show why the Government ought to ask the House to dispose of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill today. When the Prime Minister and the late Premier of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price,</inline> entered into the agreement, it seemed to be satisfactory to both sides, so why should we postpone its consideration? Is not to-day the day of salvation ? Tomorrow we may meet with damnation. </para>

                        <para>- That makes the position worse. It shows that last week the Government wished to postpone the consideration of the Bill and did all that they possibly could to prevent honorable members from expressing an opinion. If the Bill is a part of their policy, let them go on with it to a finish, otherwise let it be defeated and thrown aside. The question of the transfer of the Northern Territory has been dangled before the House for many years. It has been described as part of the policy of the Government, but it seems that the consideration of the Bill is not to be pushed on, and that it must once more go under the table. I do not think that that is fair to the House. When we come here prepared to discuss the Bill the Government wish to postpone its consideration. Presently the next Bill on the notice-paper will be served in a similar way. If the Government wish to go on with the consideration of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill to a finish, let them do so independently of whether that means putting it under the table or carrying it into effect. I hope that when it is again set down for consideration the Government will proceed to a finish. </para>

                    <para>.- It is simply marvellous that directly the amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney was rejected the Government, although they had a majority, decided to postpone the consideration of the Bill. In view of the fact that it cannot be more than seven weeks to the end of the session, and that this measure has to go to the Senate, does any one think that there was any sincerity about the proposal to postpone its consideration to-day? We have had before us an agreement which is being treated very differently from that other agreement which the honorable member for Adelaide referred to this afternoon. It does not matter how members of the Fusion party vote against this particular proposal, but they must swallow the other agreement. Apparently the Government fear that if the Bill is proceeded with it will be carried. Finding from a division that they were in a majority they immediately asked the Committee to report progress for the purpose of having the Bill thrown under the table. The Prime Minister interjected recently that last week there was an arrangement made with the Opposition for the purpose of adjourning the consideration of this proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I voted with the Government to adhere to the agreement and against the amendment of. the honorable member for North Sydney. It is rather strange, by the way, that an honorable member who is retiring from Parliamentary life was put up to move it. As soon as we supported them the Government became afraid and dropped the Bill. If a division is called for on this motion I shall vote for the Government proceeding with the consideration of the Bill, believing that it should be disposed of as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that, sir, but I was drawn off the track by the irregular member for Wentworth, who has no right to interject. Apparently the Government reckon that they have the numbers, and are, therefore, anxious to adjourn the consideration of the Bill. If they say that it will be proceeded with at a later date I trust that it will not be a very far distant date, and that we shall have an opportunity of keeping faith with the people of South Australia. They should know whether or not we mean business, and this question should not be kept dangling before the country from Parliament to Parliament, as it has been. </para>

                    <para>. - This is one of the most unfair debates which I have ever heard in this House. The conduct of business was arranged by the Government, as far as it could, to meet the convenience of honorable members who have been taking an active part in discussing these measures. </para>

                <para class="block">We have pressed on this particular Bill, although it has occupied an inordinate share of the session, taking into account the business to be transacted, because it was represented that if the vole on the second reading or upon the important amendment just dealt with were adverse to the Government, either contingency would cause a reconsideration of the agreement as a whole. In order that we might ascertain whether any radical alterations would be required, we brought the measure forward at a time which did not suit the convenience of the Government, and meant a sacrifice of time that ordinarily would have been devoted to the consideration of the Defence Bill. The latter measure was expressly set down on the notice-paper for to-day, to meet the wishes of some of those, including the members of the Opposition, who have a right to be heard on the question. Then, again, in order that we might arrive at a decision on a critical amendment which might involve further consultation with the Government of South Australia, we agreed to continue the consideration of the Bill until such time, not later than the dinner hour to-day, as would enable that amendment to be disposed of. The Government have met the House frankly and fairly, have not considered their own wishes, but have arranged the business to meet the convenience of honorable members, who have a title to be considered in this matter. As soon as the amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney was dealt with to-day, then, in accordance with the arrangement, made apparently with the consent of the whole House present, for no one objected on Friday last- </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member is being asked to vote on a clause outlining some additions to the existing Act, providing for compulsory training as set out in the Bill, and enlarging generally the scope of the Defence Forces. The clause is really an explanatory clause, and the matters with which it deals will require to be discussed separately on other clauses of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- As it is proposed to change what previously were known as &#34;Militia&#34; and &#34;Volunteer &#34; forces into &#34; Citizen &#34; forces, and the clause covers practically the whole of the Defence Force, I suggest that the Minister might make it his business during the next few months to delve into the question of the Central Administration. When the Estimates were before us last year I ventured in a &#39;few words to direct attention to the ever-increasing cost of the Central Administration, and according to the reports of experts the ever-decreasing efficiency of our forces from a war point of view. </para>

It deals with an alteration in the name of the forces, with a matter of designation and not of administration. </para>

                    <para>-I should like to ask the Minister of Defence whether he does not think that it would facilitate the passing of the Bill if he were to postpone this clause until other clauses of the measure have been dealt with. The proposed headings for the various Parts of the Bill cannot remain as they are set out in this clause unless the various clauses included in those Parts are later agreed to by the Committee. I am myself proposing the insertion of a few additional clauses dealing with the training of officers and it would be convenient to include them in a separate Part of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- The headings of the various Parts of the Bill must depend on the form in which it leaves the Committee. I remind the Minister that it would be very inconvenient to have a general debate on (he main question under there headings. The honorable gentleman will do well to postpone the clause. Unless that course is adopted, should it be necessary later to alter these headings we should have to recommit the Bill to make the alteration. </para>

                    <para>.- I am very pleased with the proposed amendment of the existing Act. Nothing ever gave me more surprise than to find that the garrison artillery were not acquainted with field gun drill. I considered that one of the greatest anomalies in the service. When the first Defence Bill was introduced by the right honorable member for Swan, the honorable gentleman said that the Permanent Forces would be the skeleton of a militia force in time of war. I know from my own experience in the Imperial service, that whether artillery men belonged to field, garrison, or horse batteries, they were capable of handling either siege or field guns. When the honorable member for Richmond  was Minister of Defence, I was surprised to learn that the Royal Australian Artillery were garrison artillery, and did no field gun drill. The honorable gentleman promised that when the time came for a revision of the Act he would bring the matter before the Cabinet, and I understood that the Cabinet decided that the word &#34; garrison &#34; should be deleted, so that the Royal Australian Artillery might be used in any branch of artillery work. I am glad that the amendment is proposed in this Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to ask the Minister of Defence to outline what is meant by Naval Volunteer Forces, in sub-section  3  of the proposed new section. Is it intended that we shall have naval forces who at times will be paid and at other times will not be paid? Is there to be on the naval side a similar distinction to that which exists on the military side between the ordinary paid militia and the volunteers? </para>

                    COOK (Parramatta- makes no such differentiation as the honorable member suggests. All it does is to continue the Naval Forces as they exist at present, simply separating them, for purposes of definition, from the Military Forces. Nothing is yet settled as to the future of the Naval Forces. That will very likely be determined by reports which we hope to receive from London regarding what is requisite for manning and officering the new units about to be created. My own idea at present is that we shall require a new Naval Bill to deal with that matter. All I am doing for the present is to continue what is already in existence, separating it from the military side for the purpose of clearer definition. For instance, the subdivision of the Naval Forces is quite different from that of the Military Forces.

There is no naval volunteer force to-day in New South Wales such as there is in Victoria. The Sydney Naval Brigade is composed of men who have led a deep sea-faring life at some time or other. Some of them have even been in the British </para>

                <para class="block">Naval service. They are officered by men who have mainly passed out of the ranks of active sea captains, and others who have been Naval Reserve men. A few years ago there was formed in New South Wales what was called a Naval Volunteer Force, which had the same relation to the Naval Brigade as the land volunteer force has to the land militia. The honorable member for Maranoa seems to ridicule the idea of a Volunteer Naval Force, but on further examination he will find that it is not open to so much ridicule as he thinks. There are numbers of young men whom he calls yachtsmen, but who often earn their livelihood as fishermen or on ferries, or in other ways, in Australian ports and harbors. They are debarred from entering the Naval Brigade because they have not had deep-sea experience, although accustomed to handling boats inside, and even outside, harbors. The idea of the Naval Volunteer Force was to obtain recruits of that character. </para>

                        <para>- I am not referring to that class. I am pointing out a class of men that can be obtained for our Naval Forces. Too much attention has been given in the past to the land Volunteer Force, at the expense of the Naval Volunteer Forces. There are numbers of young men in the various ports who have never been to sea, but who earn their livelihood, or spend a great deal of their time, on the water, and who would make admirable material to train for the Naval Forces. I am not prepared to say whether it was wise to differentiate between the Naval Brigade and the Naval Volunteers, but, while the conditions for admission to the Naval Brigade are so stringent as to preclude those young men from joining it, their only opening is to associate themselves with the Naval Volunteer Force. It would be far better to abolish the Volunteer Force, and, at the same time, to remove the embargo which prevents men, and particularly young men, who have never been outside the waters of a harbor, from joining the Naval Brigade. If the honorable member for Maranoa is prepared to agree to that, the difficulty can be got over. But those young men should not be shut out. . In the past, the Naval Brigade has, unfortunately, been culled only from a select few. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill does not deal with the matter at all, and, as the Minister said, a new Bill dealing with the naval section of the defence scheme will be required. This is simply an introductory clause, reiterating the conditions that exist to-day, and, whether the Leader of the Opposition strikes out the words &#34; Volunteer Forces&#34; or not, the Naval Volunteer Forces will remain, because provision is made for them under the existing Act. In the early days, the Naval Volunteer Forces in New South Wales were recruited from the desirable class of young men to whom I have referred, but, after a while, there came in the commercial clerk and others, who probably went aboard a yacht only on a Saturday afternoon, or even once a quarter. Today, the yacht has been supplanted to a great extent in that regard by the motor-launch, but, in any case, it would be absurd to compose our Naval Volunteer Forces of such men. The Naval Brigade that we ought to build up is a body of men who in an emergency could take the place of trained men on war vessels, and be a sort of auxiliary force. While the Leader of the Opposition may be right in his view, this is not the proper Bill in which to give effect to it. </para>

The honorable member for Wide Bay would do away with the Volunteer Forces altogether. There are certain conditions, however, that must be met, and it would be unwise to cripple the Department which, in administering the Act, might find it desirable to have volunteers, either in the form of junior cadets or pilots. </para>

                <para class="block">There is no previous reference, however, to &#34; active Naval Forces.&#34; I could understand the provision if the Naval Forces had been divided, as are the Military Forces, into active forces and reserve forces, but, as the Bill stands, I am at a loss to account for it. As to the other point which has been raised, a man is either a volunteer or is compelled to join some force. If he is compelled to join, he at once ceases to be a volunteer; the question of compulsion is not affected by the fact of whether or not a man is paid for his services. It is absurd to say that a man is a volunteer because, although he is compelled to join a force, he is not paid for his services. </para>

                    <para>.- This is another clause with which it seems to me we are dealing rather prematurely. We are now. proposing to provide, before we have the Naval Bill before us, into what classes our naval defenders shall be arranged. This House has shown a desire, of recent years, to have more efficiency in our Defence Forces, and when the Naval Bill is before us it will probably insist that the Naval Forces shall be as efficient in personnel as any they are likely to meet. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly ; otherwise, they are worse than useless, since they give us a false sense of security. When the Naval Bill is before us we may decide that the principal Act, which we are now amending, shall be further amended, in order to do away with what may be described as  mere flummery. We may, for the sake of argument, decide that our Naval Defence Forces shall consist of permanent men and naval reserves. I am speaking only of the possibilities; but I ask why we should now set about amending the principal Act, since, when the Naval Bill is before us, we may have to further amend it, </para>

                    <para>.- This is not an abstruse question. All that we have to determine is whether or not we are going to continue the application of the volunteer principle to either arm of our defence system. Are we going to create little privileges for privileged people or are we going to establish a defence system on the basis that we need men capable of defending Australia irrespective of what their position in society may be? The Minister will be well advised if he agrees to the omission of these words. </para>

                        <para>- I have been a volunteer, and have always been in favour of the volunteer svstem, but know that it has absolutely broken down. The young men of my birthplace are much disturbed because the volunteer system is to be done away with, and their corps is to be disbanded. But that is not the point. We are entering upon the serious business of the defence of the Commonwealth, and should eliminate from the system anything suggesting that there are privileged people who are entitled to privileged positions. It is for that reason I hold that these words should be omitted. </para>

                    <para>.- I am in accord with the position taken up by the honorable member for Wide Bay, because my desire is to obtain an effective defence system. In my previous speech I tried to explain the history of the volunteer system in New South Wales, but it has since occurred to me that a good deal more could be said about its experience of Naval Volunteer Forces, which I may explain were naval only in name. In Sydney the men used to dress as sailors and parade the streets. After being trained for two or three years on a hulk or a boat they would march through the streets with bands playing &#34;Sons of the Sea&#34; and &#34;A life on the Ocean Wave,&#34; but that is about all that they knew. A good many of them did not get out of Pitt-street, Sydney. Our object should be to secure effective defence. More opportunities should be afforded to young men to associate with old sea dogs and form a Naval Brigade or Reserve or Militia. If the deletion of the words Volunteer Forces&#34; would get over the difficulty, and secure the existence of only one force, well and good. If the Minister will refer to the Central Administration he will find that, whilst originally the Naval Volunteer Forces of New South Wales were composed of men with long seafaring experience, they were afterwards composed of men who merely received a limited amount of cutlass drill and who should have been in the land forces. There are thousands of men located on our coast line who, if offered a choice to join, would prefer the Naval to the Military Forces. If the deletion of the words &#34; Volunteer Forces &#34; will not shut out those men 1 shall support the amendment. I think that in a maritime country such as ours is the Naval Reserves should be much stronger than they are. It is only eighteen months ago that I fought from the other side of the Chamber for the strengthening of our Naval Reserve Forces. The honorable member for Ballarat, who was Prime Minister then, as he is now, said that there was no necessity for reserves, as they had enough men. But now he says that what we require are better trained men and more of them. The incident shows the difference of opinion which will take place in the course of a few months. I think that there is a good deal in the contention of the honorable member for Wide Bay. </para>

                        <para>- It has been admitted that those forces have failed to do what was expected of them, and are not worth continuing. I think that we are entitled to know the reasons which prompt the honorable gentleman to continue Volunteer Forces in one arm of our Defence system. I can confirm what the honorable member for Dalley has said about the Naval Volunteer Forces of New South Wales being merely young landsmen dressed as sailors. On Saturday afternoons they used to mount a gun on the <inline font-style="italic">Neptune</inline> - an old punt - which was used during the week to take out rubbish. I remember going out with them on one occasion when I was a boy. When we were about a mile and a-half outside the Heads nine out of twelve were so sick that they could not stand. I was a spectator as long as I was able to hold up my head, but I confess that I lay. down as soon as everybody else. In the past the Naval Volunteer Forces have been a greater failure than the Land Volunteer Forces, and why the Minister should seek to perpetuate the volunteer system. I do not know. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member says that there are no Naval Volunteer Forces, and that he is not introducing any. In that case, why should he not consent to the omission of the words &#34; Volunteer Forces? &#34; Let honorable members look for a moment at the difference between the Militia Forces and Naval Forces as laid down in sub-section1. It raises at once a class distinction which ought not to exist. I urge the Minister either to defend his action or to agree to the omission of a clause which provides for the enlistment of non-paid men. I hope that he will see the wisdom of agreeing to abolish the Volunteer Forces in each arm of our Defence system. </para>

                    <para>.- I have listened very carefully to the speeches, but I must admit that I am not clear as to who are to compose the Naval Volunteer Forces. Is it intended that they shall be trained and made as efficient as the Militia Forces? If so, what is the idea of having a separation? It is a most undemocratic innovation. If the volunteer and the militia forces are to be trained in exactly the same manner, and the one is to be made as efficient as the other, why should there be a fine of demarcation between them ? There is more in this defence scheme than compelling people to do what they ought. There is the idea of conducting our defences on democratic principles. To have two sides to our naval defence, each equally equipped and efficient, is contrary to that idea. The suggestion of the honorable member for Wentworth is a good one, and the Minister would be well advised if he accepted it, and postponed the clause, if the Leader of the Opposition does not object. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me that there has been a slight oversight in the drafting of the clause. There has apparently been an attempt to redraft a provision which stands in the original Act, and in the redrafting to divide the naval from the military side  of our defence. The idea in the draftsman&#39;s mind may have been to omit all reference to volunteer military forces, and to leave the naval forces as at present. I understand that the Minister proposes to abolish the volunteer forces on the military side. </para>

                        <para>- The volunteers are to be merged in the militia forces. My own idea is that the volunteers have not come up to expectations, and many members of volunteer corps would prefer to be merged into the militia forces. Further on in the Bill it is proposed that certain cadets shall be called naval cadets, and be trained as such. I think that if we are to touch on naval matters at all in this Bill we ought to do away with the volunteers altogether. It has been said by way of interjection that there are no volunteer naval forces. If that be so, why leave in the Bill words which would permit of volunteer naval forces being raised ? I view with a certain amount of apprehension the. possibility of any Minister of Defence raising naval volunteer forces, and having two sets of men, militia and volunteers, perhaps to the detriment of both, and with no evident advantage to the Commonwealth. Perhaps the Minister will explain what his view really is. </para>

                    <para>- - As I have already said by way of interjection, there is no adult Naval Volunteer Force at the present time. If the amendment were carried, it would be impossible to recognise any kind of volunteer effort, and the Boys&#39; Naval Brigades, and similar bodies which now exist on a purely volunteer basis, subsidized by the Department, which prescribes the standard -of efficiency, would have to go. That is not advisable. There are organizations of boys in various parts of the country which are doing useful work, and learning duties which they would have to perform if they entered the Navy. Their success depends on individual zeal, and their basis is that of volunteer effort. Indeed, there is a great deal of voluntary effort of one kind or another in connexion with the defence of Australia. To be logical, the honorable member would not only get rid of naval volunteer forces, whether composed of adults or boys, but would also get rid of Military Volunteer Forces, and take away the power to recognise, later, perhaps, the Boy Scouts, an organization which now numbers many thousands, and is increasing every year. Only lately, I&#39; ordered a report to be made as to its military value over and above that which the boys will possess when they come under the compulsory clauses of the Bill. Then it has been suggested that there should be inaugurated a. League of Frontiersmen, such as they have in the Old Country, South Africa, .Canada, and other parts of the Empire. I doubt the wisdom of abolishing volunteer effort in connexion with our Naval and Military (Forces. So far as I am concerned, there is no intention to apply the volunteer principle to adult forces at present, but the honorable member in going further, would put a stop to a volunteer movement which is of great value to the Commonwealth, in that it prepares boys for the exercise of naval or military duties which they would subsequently be called upon to perform. This is only an enabling Bill, lt neither prescribes nor dictates, but simply gives us the power to recognise, if necessary, a volunteer effort which exists and is of great value. I ask the honorable member to allow the words which he wishes to omit to remain in the clause. </para>

                        <para>- The matter is one over which we need not quibble, the question being whether we shall have compulsory and volunteer forces side by side. While my sympathies are with volunteer effort, I think that if we have both militia and volunteer forces we shall weaken our defence. I would point out to trie Minister that proposed new section 32 is differently worded from proposed new section  32A.  The former enacts that the Citizen Naval Forces shall be divided into Militia Forces, Volunteer Forces, and Reserve Forces, while the latter says that the Citizen Military Forces shall consist of Active Forces and Reserve Forces. There is no provision for Active Forces in proposed new section 32, which deals with the Citizen Naval Forces. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that the Naval and Military Forces are being differently treated, and that opportunities are being made for the creation of volunteer forces, which I think both unnecessary and inadvisable. I should like to temporarily withdraw my amendment, with a view to amending the first sub-section of proposed new section 32 by inserting the word &#34; Active &#34; before the word &#34; Militia.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I should prefer to see the words struck out, but I can quite understand the honorable member&#39;s preference for the Bill as it stands, because it would allow that to be done in Victoria, which has been done in the past, and which I object to. It should be remembered that under this Bill we are proposing compulsory naval and military training, and the existing condition of affairs will be entirely altered. The boy scouts, in common with every other military organization, will be subject to training. I presume that the older boys referred to by the Minister would be those who had passed the cadet stage. They ought to be drafted into the Militia Forces, and that would settle the whole matter. The honorable gentleman seems to be agreed that it would be unwise to continue a practice adopted in the past of permitting one section of the community to do what another section would not be permitted to do. We do not think that that should be perpetuated, and it can only be avoided, by striking out the words  &#39; Volunteer Forces . &#34; </para>

                        <para>- It has,&#39; and the Minister of Defence must know that. He might supply information about practices which I am sure the Treasurer would object to under a system of compulsory military training, but which this Bill would permit. From his explanation I do not think that the Minister of Defence has fully grasped the position. I should like te ask the honorable gentleman whether it is intended that there shall be any distinction in the matter of dress between the officers and men of the Volunteer Forces and those other branches of the service ? </para>

                    <para>.- When I heard the Minister speak of this as being merely an enabling Bill, I was left in some doubt, in view of his desire to retain the Volunteer Forces, as to what he hopes to be enabled to do under this Bill. If the measure is intended merely to permit the Minister to do something, it is clear that he may not do it, or that a subsequent Minister might assent to schemes which the present Minister, or, perhaps, the country would npt approve. The honorable gentleman argues that the Volunteer Forces should be retained, because he does not desire to crush the volunteer spirit. He thinks that the amendment would in some way interfere with the Boys&#39; Naval Brigade&#39;s and Boy Scouts. </para>

                        <para>- That appears to me to weaken the Minister&#39;s argument. . I am afraid that we shall have a multiplicity of corps wearing uniforms of various descriptions, and that officers called upon to exercise them will be completely mystified as to what they are, and what they are able to do. Some will be boy scouts, under a different organization from other branches of the forces, some members of boys&#39; naval brigades who will not be called upon to do what the members of a militia naval brigade would have to do. There will be so many corps under so many different degrees of control that concentration in time of need will be a very difficult matter indeed. If a desire to recognise the boys&#39; Naval Brigades and Boy Scouts is the Minister&#39;s only objection to it I think he might accept the amendment. As soon as a cadet brigade is formed under this Bill, it will be possible to have a regiment of boy scouts if so desired. The Minister can prescribe the training, the uniform, and the name of any particular regiment without allowing it to be a separate volunteer institution, which would only fall back into the position which the present Volunteers hold in relation to the </para>

We were told that it was not the present intention to raise adult volunteer corps. But what will the future bring? We have tried the volunteer system for a number of years, and it has not been a success, but if we permit the words &#34;Volunteer Forces&#34; to be retained, some subsequent Minister, giving way to the peculiarities of a section of the community, may permit the raising of a volunteer corps which will be enthusiastic for a year&#39; or two, and then gradually fall away to comparative nothingness so far as the effective defence of the country is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Their &#39; enthusiasm would not be a disadvantage, but enthusiasm, unless properly guided and controlled, sometimes leads to excess, brings about chaos, and interferes with the work of properly trained troops. Enthusiasm is excellent if properly controlled, but the enthusiasm of the Volunteer Forces at present, in comparison with that of the Militia, does not make for the effective defence of the country. </para>

                        <para>- If. the Bill is passed in its present form, the matter of giving permission will rest in the hands of the Minister. The only control which Parliament will have will be that once a year, when the Estimates are under . consideration, we may &#34; bark &#34; for an hour or two, but the thing will go on. No reduction in the Estimates will be permitted, with a view to removing any volunteer forces then raised with the sanction of the Ministry of the day. Such a force, when once approved, will always have sufficient political power to influence the Minister of Defence, whoever he may be, even perhaps against his will, and certainly sufficient to enforce its recognition whilst the Estimates are going through. We are changing the whole tenor of our Military Forces, having found that the Volunteer Forces : are comparatively a failure, so why not on this occasion do away with them entirely in regard to naval defence also, and let us have a militia that we can thoroughly understand, and that can be organized in such a manner as to make it effective, attractive, and a proper defence. If the Minister intends to retain these words merely to pander to the few thousand lads - and those behind them - who to-day are boy scouts, or who are in the Naval Brigade, then we can see at once that there is behind him an influence which is not conducive to a proper administration of the Defence Forces. In the circumstances I hope he will agree to the excision of the words throughout the Bill, wherever they occur. </para>

I have not had quite as much naval and military experience as have some other honorable members, but I have had a little, and have always found amongst the Volunteer Forces a good deal of enthusiasm, tending in the right direction. </para>

The honorable member, whom I look upon as one of the military experts of the House, knows that we are aiming at the effective defence of the country, and whether we get it by a compulsory, a militia, or a volunteer system, we shall achieve our object so long as we have a properly trained force that can always be made effective at the. right time. Our rifle corps are volunteer forces. </para>

                        <para>- We get trained troops. In various parts of Australia we have a number of trained men under the volunteer system that we should not have otherwise. There might not be a sufficient number of them to form a corps, or to attach to the militia, or to a permanent battery, but there are some in these small places, and they are enthusiastic, and will be of value. I admit that it is not desirable to encourage the system in large centres, but throughout. Australia we want as many trained men as we can possibly get. We should give every man who offers himself for the defence of his country ah opportunity of being trained, whether in a small or a large body. I shall, therefore, uphold the Minister in his desire to retain these&#39; words in the Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- Now that the honorable member for Corangamite has raised the question of the superiority of the volunteer, let me draw his attention to&#39; a little incident that occurred on the Yarra last year or the year before. A body of volunteer engineers or artillerymen - they belonged to one of the scientific branches of the service - were going down to Swan Island in the <inline font-style="italic">Manawatu.</inline> The boat happened to run her nose on to Coode Island, or into the bank up the Saltwater River, and three-fourths of them jumped ashore and absolutely refused to obey the order of the commanding officer to return to the boat. They returned to town, and went to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> office for sympathy. They asked whether something could not be done by telephoning the Minister to secure passes for them to go down to the Island by rail. That is a sample of volunteer forces. Does the honorable member want to perpetuate the system throughout the Commonwealth? When the enemy appears at our gates, and some of the ships happen to run aground, does he want troops who will jump ashore and demand to be taken to the scene of action in coaches or motor cars? </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to split hairs with the honorable member. The honorable member for Corio has declared that it provides for compulsory volunteers. What that means I do not know. At the annual encampment at Langwarrin there has always been a perfect ferment between the Militia and the Volunteers, owing to the disparity which exists between the amounts payable to the respective branches of the service. If we are going to adopt the principle of compulsory military training let us have everybody in the net. Are the Volunteers to be clothed in a different uniform from that of the regular Militia Forces ? </para>

                        <para>- I hope to see the honorable member for Parramatta occupying his present office for a long time, but we must not forget that we are passing a measure for the guidance of future Ministers, as well as the present Minister of Defence. We need to be careful that the organization of our forces is placed on a sound and efficient basis. We must have no consideration whatsoever for this or that class, but must determine how we can, with the greatest economy, secure the highest efficiency. I am not going to follow the honorable member for Maranoa into his general denunciation of the volunteer system. The honorable member naturally feels a little sore on the subject, because I understand that, at one of the most eventful periods in his life, he met with, disaster at the hands of volunteers-the Zulus. </para>

The Minister is not pledged to every line of this provision, if it can be improved. I suggest that he could secure the existence of the naval cadets, which are part of his  naval scheme, and which he wishes to have on all fours with those of the land scheme - </para>

                        <para>- Every volunteer effort costs money. The experience of our competent officers is that the value obtained for money expended on volunteer effort is not as great as that obtained from money expended in other directions. Consequently, every penny we expend on volunteer effort is to a certain extent wasted. I know of some volunteer regiments hat are very good ; but there are others which are unspeakable. I do not wish, however, to discuss that subject. I should like the Minister to explain the position he takes up. </para>

                    COOK (ParramattaMinister of Defence &#91;8.33&#93;. - The whole question simply resolves itself into one of whether or not we are going to have any voluntary service in connexion with the Defence Forces of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition holds that the compulsory provisions of the Bill must cover every effort put forth for the defence of the Commonwealth. The question arises whether or not so drastic a proposal is necessary or advisable. If carried into effect, it would go very far. It would mean, for instance, on the military side, a re-organization of the Medical Reserve. The members of that reserve are not trained for war, but they are trained to render medical service. Are we going to say to those men, &#34;We will not have your efforts unless you come into the forces &#34; ? This proposal would prevent us from utilizing their services.

                        <para>- I have heard that so often that it amounts to tedious repetition. Every time any one says something from which my honorable friend dissents, he becomes insulting and interjects, &#34; You know nothing about it.&#34; I hope that my honorable friend knows something about the subject, though from hearing him and reading his speeches I do not think that he does. Remarks of that kind should be stopped if any good is to be done. I wish to point out that there is a good deal of voluntary effort in connexion with our forces at the present time. I have alluded to our Medical Reserve, which is organized on a purely voluntary basis, and is one of the most effective military reserves to be found anywhere. </para>

                        <para>- They have always been provided for. Nothing fresh is proposed to be done in any shape or form so far as I know. I would point out that in connexion with our Naval Forces it may be that at the beginning we shall need voluntary services in certain directions. Why for instance, should we compel men to at once enlist in the Navy who are employed with the main object of doing carpenters&#39; work or boat-building, painting, coopering, or anything of that kind? There is a good deal of non-combatant work to be., done in connexion with the Navy, and I am not sure that we need make men enlist who are required for such purposes. We cannot run our Navy entirely by means of enlisted men. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say we have, if the power were stretched, but there is no intention to do so at present. There is an intention, however, to leave the power in the Bill in case any emergency arises which would necessitate taking advantage of voluntary services for non-combatant purposes. Moreover, I am anxious to retain this provision in view of the developments which may take place in connexion with the Boys&#39; Brigades, which, after all, are extra to the Naval Cadets. They are not the same in any way. There may be similar developments in connexion with the Boy Scouts. There are thousands of boys in Australia who are now doing duties which, perhaps, are not provided for in our scheme. It is extra military work. At the present time we are having an investigation made as to whether the Boy Scouts movement has. any extra military value over and above what we are providing for. </para>

                        <para>- I am proposing nothing in regard to them at present. As I have said, I am simply having an inquiry made to ascertain whether what they are doing is of extra military value, and whether they are performing services which are not provided for in the Bill. If their services are valuable, something may have to be done for them by way of a capitation grant, just as we make a capitation grant of 7s. 6d. per head per annum towards the Boys&#39; Brigades. </para>

                        <para>- I have yet to learn of any country in which voluntary services, are discouraged. Their value is recognised even in Continental countries where conscription is in force. Under  this  Bill, however, no adult can perform voluntary service unless he has first been compulsorily trained or lives outside the prescribed area for compulsory training. What is proposed is not intended to take the place of compulsory training. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but th.it is not what the honorable member said before. I say now that the Boy Scouts are doing work which is extra to anything required from our Cadets, and that if their work has any extra military value and a good claim is made out for some recognition, we may have to assist them. That is all. We are taking power under this Bill to recognise efforts of that kind. I might say the same in connexion with the League of Frontiersmen which it is proposed to form in Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may call any of the services extra to those provided for &#34;fancy services&#34; if he likes. All that I know is that such efforts are recognised in other countries. Voluntary efforts are recognised over and above the conscription which is enshrined in . the legislation of many nations. We are merely asking Parliament to recognise voluntary efforts in the same way. </para>

                    <para>.- Every time the Minister gets up to explain what he means, he gives a different reason for what appears in the Bill. On the first occasion the honorable gentleman urged that the words objected to should stand, because the Boy Scouts were doing good work on a voluntary basis. He said that there were no Naval Volunteer Corps in existence in Australia at present, but in his previous statement he said that he had no knowledge of any such corps being likely to be brought into existence. The whole of his latest address, delivered after he had time for consultation with expert officers, was in favour of volunteer corps of every kind. </para>

                        <para>- Let me take the strongest case - that of a naval corps. What is to prevent a corps of medical men from being part of the Militia as effectively as a corps of barristers? Are men to be allowed, because of their professional position, to form a volunteer corps, and not to be part of the Militia Force to defend Australia? If the Government have made up their minds to that course they ought to say so clearly. If the toilers alone are to constitute the Militia, and other persons are to constitute special corps, then it - will not be an effective defence system at all. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member now saw that there are no volunteers of the kind in the Commonwealth at present, but he speaks of the boys who are being trained as though this provision were only to cover them. In my opinion, these words are not needed. I think that the honorable member for Wentworth touched the crux of the whole question when he said that under this provision a Minister could permit the formation of any number of volunteer corps. As I understand the Minister&#39;s explanation it is that these volunteer corps will fulfil the same service as the compulsorily trained militia, and that men will be. able, by joining these corps, to be exempt from the ordinary training. The Minister shakes his head, but, in my opinion, that was his line of reasoning. If that is so, in my opinion, the Bill might as well be thrown under the table. I am quite prepared to take a vote on my proposal. I desire to omit the provision relating to Reserve Forces for reasons which I will give when it is reached. If any words can be substituted in place of the words &#34; Volunteer Forces &#34; I am quite prepared to meet the wish of the Ministry. I feel, and I say it with reluctance, that we must provide for an effective force to defend Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- If I thought that any of the fears of the Opposition in this direction were likely to be realized I should certainly vote with them, because I do not desire to see any volunteer corps by the side of militia or conscript corps. The only reason why I want the words &#34; Volunteer Forces &#34; to be retained is because I think it is necessary to provide for a certain class of lads who would have to serve, and who otherwise would not be provided for. In the first place I desire to refer to the remarks of the honorable member for Maranoa, whose opinions I always respect because I think that he is honest and fair. In the two illustrations which he gave he was singularly unfortunate. As I understood his observations they were directed against volunteer forces, and in favour of permanent or militia men. He gave as an example the case of some men who at the last Easter manoeuvres went down the river, and who, owing to a collision or an idea that their boat was sinking, jumped on to Conde Island. They were members of a special corps of engineers or artillerymen. </para>

May I remonstrate with my honorable friend against his continued sneer at Saturday afternoon soldiers? He is a member of a party which does believe in citizen service. If we are to get any good out of the Bill we shall have to depend on the service of men who will do their training mostly on Saturday afternoons. </para>

If I thought that the Bill meant the creation of volunteer corps by the side of militia or conscript corps, I should vote with the Opposition, but the Minister has distinctly repudiated that idea.

                        <para>- I think that once the sea! is set upon the idea of compulsory military training a Minister will not consent to go back to any half-hearted system of volunteer work. Further, there is no doubt that there are special classes which will have to be provided for under a  volunteer clause. It would be regrettable if in the future .the Minister had to come to the House, as he is doing under clause 4, because in regard to a garrison we made a mistake which has lasted for five or six years. It is only fair to trust the administration, whatever it is, in this matter, and give the Minister a certain amount of freedom in necessary directions. I will mention one direction which occurs to my mind. The pilots of Australia are to be enlisted, and although they are not constantly paid they are a corps under regulation. </para>

Again, take the case of the recently -formed Intelligence Corps. They exist in order to procure proper surveys of the whole of Australia. The intelligence officer, Colonel McCay, was wise enough to get the services of a large number of Government surveyors in the Lands Departments of the States. These men have enlisted in the Intelligence Corps, as well as photographers and specialists of all kinds. </para>

                        <para>- The persons to whom I refer are men over the age of 21 years, and, therefore, the compulsory clauses of the Bill do not apply to them. But the service needs their special abilities. It is also necessary to make provision for volunteer medical corps. One of the greatest services rendered by Australia to the Empire during the Boer war was the sending to South Africa of distinguished surgeons, such as the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Fitzgerald, who, with other surgeons, like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Treves, who went from the Old Land, did work of the greatest value, purely as volunteers. Were Australia to need such services, they would be gladly offered and rendered by the many able medical men whom we have in our midst. To take advantage of their skill and organize it to secure the greatest efficiency, it will be necessary to have a provision such as that to which the honorable member for Maranoa objects. As he is aware, the worst men connected with an army are the undisciplined camp followers. </para>

It is not that we contemplate the creation of volunteer corps of fighting men, but that provision must be made for other volunteers whose services are needed. For instance, it is not proposed to make the ordinary provisions of the Bill applicable to the clergy, but it is necessary in time of war to have chaplains. </para>

Without it, an irregular condition of things might arise, from which much harm would result, and a special Act would have to be passed to provide for the regulation&#39; and :control of the necessary volunteer corps to which I have referred. The Minister has promised that the provision will be applied only to such volunteers, and to the naval cadets of whom he has spoken, and I accept his statement. </para>

                    <para>. - I am in favour of the Bill and of the provision we are discussing, and would not have risen had it not been for the remarks of the honorable member for Maranoa regarding the volunteers. They were uncalled for. During the last fifty years, thousands of men have given up a great deal of their time, and done very valuable work, in fitting themselves to defend their country. Had they been called upon to fight, they would have stuck to their guns as the honorable member did. I have yet to learn that the man who is paid is better than the man who volunteers. A paid man may be able to devote more time to drill than the volunteer can afford to give, but we must not forget the sacrifices which our volunteers have made in the past. Many of them, too, in the Bushmen&#39;s and other contingents, did good work for the Empire during the South African war. I am in favour of compulsory training, but we must not forget the good work of the volunteers. I know of one or two corps in Tasmania which have been in existence for fifty years or more, and some of their members are now qualified to take a place alongside the trained men of the British Army. Thousands of men took a thorough interest in this work before payment was thought of, and many of them would be ready, should occasion demand it, to again volunteer for the defence of Australia. As to the shooting of the rifle clubs at Williamstown, I think that the paid military men would not do any better under the same- conditions. Many of the best shots in Australia belong to rifle clubs, the members of which have also done much to fit themselves for military work. </para>

                        <para>- They struck because the forces in other parts of the Commonwealth were being paid more than they were receiving. They were willing to give their services to the Commonwealth, but they felt that, as Tasmania was paying its share of the cost of defending Australia, they should be treated exactly as were those on the mainland. I do not blame them for that, though had the officer in charge known his business, and acted as he should have done, there would not have been a strike. The Tasmanians were not the first to ask for payment for work which they did as volunteers. I believe that if military training were made compulsory, and without pay of any kind, Tasmanians would be as ready to fall in with the proposal as would the people of any other State in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- There appears to me to be some justification for the fear expressed that if our Citizen Naval Forces were to be divided into &#34; Militia,&#34; &#34;Volunteer&#34; and &#34;Reserve&#34; forces, certain persons in the community would be disposed to join the volunteer section in order to evade service which they would be obliged to render if they joined the militia section. I think it would be optional with the Minister to permit that kind of thing under this provision as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- The danger might not be present to the mind of the present Minister of Defence, but we do not know what pressure might be brought to bear on some subsequent Minister to permit people to join a volunteer section of the Citizen Naval Forces, and so avoid the rendering of service prescribed by the Act. The reference to doctors has really no bearing on the matter, because doctors would be men trained at a university, and not at a military school of instruction, and if they joined the Volunteer Forces, it would be as doctors and not as soldiers. I think the Minister has overlooked one important safeguard, and that is that under this Bill no one would be employed in connexion with a Military Force who had not served a term in a Militia Force. I intend to outline an amendment which I think would provide for all that is desired, and prevent evasion of the compulsory service provisions of the Bill. I give notice now that I shall at a later stage move the addition of the words &#34; such Volunteer Forces to render service in excess of the compulsory service prescribed.&#34; That would meet the danger of any one taking refuge in the Volunteer Forces provided for in this provision in order to evade compulsory service. </para>

                    <para>.- The debate has not been a loss of time, because the question is one of great importance, and during its discussion a number of new ideas have been submitted by honorable members. After listening to it, I have come to the conclusion that the power to raise volunteers, while a power that would probably be subversive of efficiency if exercised in ordinary normal times, might he one which the Minister of Defence would desire to retain in view of some grave emergency such as war. </para>

                        <para>- How would he get the men required ? The honorable gentleman forgets that we are dealing now with the Naval Forces. He might call upon a farmer near Bourke, or a resident of one of the remote inside districts of Queensland. If such a man were required to serve on one of the skittish little torpedo boat destroyers he would probably die of the effort to hold on by his eyebrows the first day he was on board. So far as our naval effort is concerned, if we wish suddenly to fill up gaps in time of emergency we shall have to get our help from the Australian mercantile marine. I can see nothing in the Bill which would enable the Minister to accept the services of the. most suitable volunteers at such a time of emergency. </para>

                        <para>- The persons who would volunteer to fill up the wastage of war would be drafted to the less specialized departments, for instance, as stokers or deck hands. They could be trained to fulfil the duties of such positions very quickly, whereas it might take five or six years to train a man up to the standard of efficiency required for an able seaman of the Imperial Navy. I should like the Minister to accept some such amendment as I have suggested, but I would prefer that the Bill should be passed in its present form than that the Minister should not have the power at any .time to accept the service of volunteers. </para>

Let me tell him that in South Australia we have an excellent medical staff, but it is attached entirely to the Militia Forces. There is not, and never was to my knowledge, a single medical officer attached to the Volunteer Forces in that State. There is nothing to prevent every medical man who desires to render service to his country from attaching himself to the militia if he is wanted. </para>

                        <para>- The pilots are in precisely the same position. They can be attached at any moment to the Militia Forces. We have heard about <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Treves, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Fitzgerald, and others volunteering for service, but there is nothing in this Bill to prevent <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Treves from volunteering to be of service to the Australian Forces, or to prevent the Minister from accepting his offer and attaching him to the Militia. The amendment suggested by the honorable member for Wentworth is valueless. The principal Act provides that every person from eighteen to sixty may be called upon in the order of age in time of emergency. </para>

His  suggested amendment is not necessary, because, if those within the first prescribed ages when called out cannot supply the necessary number capable of serving in the Navy, the Minister can call on the next ages, and so on! up to sixty. </para>

                        <para>- One of the Minister&#39;s predecessors, the honorable member tor Richmond, did what the Minister tells us that he would not&#39; approve of. Is it not just as likely &#39;hat some successive Minister may do precisely the same ? History has repeated itself in that way over and over again. The only real reason the Minister has put forward for retaining the words &#34; &#34;Volunteer Forces &#34; is the necessity of providing for the- boy scout movement, hut a later clause provides that all the male inhabitants of Australia shall be liable to he trained &#34; as prescribed.&#34; What does &#34; as prescribed &#34; mean, except that every male inhabitant can be attached to any branch of the forces that may be prescribed? The honorable member for Bass was a little unfair to the honorable member for Maranoa. It is not a question of disparaging the Volunteer Forces. After a long experience in them, I say unhesitatingly that they were anything but satisfactory. We could not get the men to attend a sufficient number of drills to make them efficient. The Volunteers have done excellent work, but any one who has been in camp with them, as I have been year after year, and compared their turnout with the turnout&#39; of the Militia, will know, in the first place, that there was a difference of anything between 30 and 50 percent, in the attendances. In the next place, not nearly so many of them turned out to the number of drills that the Militia put in. What is the use of the honorable member&#34; for Bass telling us that forces, of that sort would be of use iri the field? The&#39; volunteer soldiers who went to South Africa, and who had had a fair amount of training, had to be taken to the base and drilled there, and drilled also all the way to&#39; the front. They then became valuable. They were volunteers in the first place&#62;.. but they had to be made soldiers before they were of use. If the Minister looks&#39; into the matter closely he will see that -it will be wise to accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I must confess at the outset that I am somewhat mystified by the various explanation&#39;s that have been given. My chief objection is to allowing any man to escape the compulsory training provisions. When the Minister of Defence- assures us that the provision will affect .&#39;doctors and chaplains, the position seems. to- me&#39; to be an extraordinary one. If the ordinary volunteer were as well trained iri soldiery as is the doctor in his profession, I could urge no objection to this proposal. I have sons of my own, whom I would willingly give in the defence of Australia, so long as the sons of other people render the same service. But I object to any  citizen  escaping from his responsibility in this- connexion. It has been urged that the idea of compulsory military service &#39;is repugnant to Britishers. But history establishes the fact that on every occasion in which the Mother Country has been embroiled in a big war, the compulsory method has been adopted. T have never yet met a citizen of Switzerland who has objected to the system of compulsory military training. Of course, the idea of conscription is hateful to Australians. I wish to see a compulsory system adopted, under which the men will be made efficient soldiers. In my judgment, the Bill should go very much further than it does. We have already reached the danger zone, and we should provide for active service conditions. </para>

                    <para>.- I feel some difficulty in regard to this proposed new section, which I said at the outset ought to be postponed. The Minister would perhaps facilitate the passage of the Bill by saying now that, if proper cause be shown later on, he will be prepared to recommit the clause. As it stands it is by no means perfect, although better, I think, than my honorable friends opposite would have made it. I do not ask for a definite assurance from the Minister, who, I know, wishes the Bill to be perfect; but I hone that he will give us some such statement as I have suggested. I do not desire now to move an amendment on the lines that 1 suggested a little while ago, because I recognise that the measure requires very careful consideration. </para>

                    <para>.- Subclause  3  of proposed new section  32,  as it stands, is both useless and dangerous. I am not going to argue the question, since it is practically the same as that with which we have just dealt ; but I do hold that sub-clause  3  should not have found a place in the Bill. It is foreign to the sentiment of the Bill, and repugnant to the principle of compulsory military service. An Administration which, while pretending to do one thing, desired to do another, would be able under that provision to prevent the effective defence of Australia. It is for that reason that I move - </para>

                        <para>- It would. This clause will give the Minister power to control volunteers. If the amendment be agreed to it will mean that Australia will refuse the offer of men who, because, perhaps, of their industry, are in a position only to volunteer their services. Such a state of affairs never existed in the British Empire, and I hope that we are not going to bring it about here. I trust that the Committee will affirm the decision given a few minutes ago, and declare that Australia is willing to accept the services of all her sons who are anxious and willing to prepare themselves to assist in her defence. </para>

                    <para>. - This is being made a partisan measure. Honorable members opposite do not seem to understand the principle of compulsory training. I am opposed to it. I fought against the idea at the Brisbane Conference, and I will fight against it everywhere. But I have to bow to the majority. I cannot understand, however, why the supporters of this Bill want to place our Defence Forces partly on a compulsorily and partly on a volunteer footing. Are we going to have this country half free and half slave? The one is a negation of the other. Peace and war are the bi-products in the mills of art and industry. Man was put here by God to subdue the earth. He has not subdued it. And because he has failed in that respect we are now engaged in a controversy between sentimental idealism and realism. This is the strangest House a man can get into, because no one seems to know anything about anything; and the less people know the better qualified to be here they seem to be. As we have laid down the principle that there is to be compulsory training, let us stand to it, and not introduce the voluntary principle at all. The curse of the whole military system of America has been that the aristocracy of the country have become a great volunteer association. The wealthy people have special barracks apart from the rest of the community, and whenever there is a prospect of a strike in America, the sons of the millionaires are ready to go out with guns and shoot down the working men. And they do it every time. Yet here we are, in the twentieth century, talking militarism. I am opposed to the whole business, because it seems to me <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be introducing a new system of slavery into this country. What we want is a system under which every second Saturday afternoon the drill sergeants would call their men together by the ringing of bells, and train them. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Corangamite seems to be under the impression that if the words objected to were excised from the clause, it would prevent the Minister of Defence from availing himself of the services of people who volunteered in time of emergency. If that be the only objection to the amendment, I point out that ample provision is made to the contrary. The Minister would always be able to avail himself of those who volunteered for service. During the South African war, a number of Australian officers went to the front as supernumeraries to the contingents despatched from Australia. Their services were accepted by the Imperial Government, and some of them did good service. Similarly in Australia, any Minister of Defence would have a perfect right to accept the services of any person who chose to volunteer. The excision of the words in question would not interfere with that right in any way. It would simply prevent a future Minister of Defence from raising a volunteer corps in antagonism to the Militia Forces that will be in existence. I maintain that the two systems cannot work amicably together. They are not doing so now. We ought not to perpetuate the system or permit a future Minister to interfere with the basis of our Defence Forces, in accordance with the party exigency of the moment. That has been one of the banes of the Defence Forces of Australia, particularly since it has been under the control of the Commonwealth. We have had a frightful number of Ministerial changes, and we may have an equal number during the next eight or nine years. The Defence Forces are at the mercy of every individual who gets into the Defence Department. Somehow or other each man seems to be under the impression that he understands the Department better than any other, and it is the one Department to which any Minister can be put irrespective of previous knowledge. If we leave all these powers so far as volunteers are concerned, it means that the Defence Forces will continue to be the plaything of every succeeding Minister, or the party which happens to be behind him, or the exigency of the moment. In such circumstances will he not have full power to take advantage of every individual who likes to come forward and volunteer, whether he be a professional or technically trained man or not ? There is nothing to prevent that from being done. Why should we permit a Minister under the clause to raise a volunteer force of a character which is not likely to be effective? </para>

                    <para>. view of the fact that the operation of the compulsory service clause is to be limited to certain districts where the population is comparatively numerous, it is advisable, if not necessary, that some provision should be made for raising volunteer forces. That appeals to me as an unanswerable argument, and I commend it to honorable members for their earnest consideration. I feel quite sure that in many of the far back districts, young men will be only too willing to enroll as volunteers and. train themselves to a large extent in the art of war, thus becoming a very valuable adjunct to the Defence Forces of the country. </para>

                    <para>.- In his speech, the honorable member for Echuca referred to the formation of volunteer corps in the inland portions of the various States, but this sub-clause deals only with naval matters. We have not yet reached the provision dealing with military matters. I take it that the aim of the Bill is to compel every individual in the community to take part in the defence of Australia. With that object I am in thorough accord. But the provision before the Committee excepts a certain section of the community from compulsory training. Where is the necessity for making that exception? The danger which I see is that those who would object to come under the compulsory training system might form a number of bogus volunteer corps for the purpose of evading their national responsibilities. </para>

                        <para>- I still have a doubt that volunteers are not sufficiently distinguished from permanent men. So many objections have been taken to the subclause that I think that doubt ought to be cleared up, so that there shall be no distinction between one unit of the community and another in regard to his liability to take part in the defence of the country. If the members of the largest section of the community are to be called upon to devote a certain amount of their time to training then the members of other sections should not be allowed to escape their responsibilities, by simply calling themselves volunteer forces. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Corangamite was very much disturbed when the honorable member for Wide Bay wanted the Committee to delete the words &#34;Volunteer Forces&#34; from sub-clause  1  of proposed new section  32.  He thought that it would interfere with the establishment of volunteer medical corps. But do such corps consist of &#34; officers, petty officers, and sailors who are not bound to continuous naval service, and who are not ordinarily paid for their services in times of peace &#39; &#39; ? I have yet to learn that doctors are not paid in times of peace as well as in times of war. How could they live if they were not? A doctor who is in the Defence Forces is not there for love of the service. During the strike which took place in Queensland in  1891,  several medical men in the outback towns volunteered their services  to  look after the &#34; scab protectors &#34; who used to march round from shed to shed. The honorable member for Fawkner will remember a doctor at Claremont who did so. When the Pastoralists&#39; Union refused to pay them, they applied to the Queensland Government. That was all the active service many of them saw. At that time military law was proclaimed throughout Western Queensland, men being arrested everywhere for being, as it was termed, &#34; of ill fame.&#34; </para>

This is a party move pure and simple. Honorable members opposite would swallow anything that the Government proposed. The honorable member for Wentworth is the only m.an on that side who has spoken a word against the Bill whilst the honorable member for Dalley is the only independent man there. Honorable members who support the Government remind me of the wav in which sheep follow their leaders, often with very ill consequences for themselves, as at Rookwood the other day. Apparently the Government are going to &#34; bullock &#34; the Bill through, as the honorable member for Hume &#34; bul locked &#34; the Tariff through. But their action will recoil upon them. They will not occupy the Ministerial bench for all time, </para>

He says that the provision to which we object was not drafted for the benefit of the yachtsmen of Sydney or Port Phillip, or, in other words, to give the sons and other relatives of the rich an advantage over the poor. But why has it been put into the Bill? Of what use are men who are not drilled or under discipline? Can it be expected that men who are not paid for their services will do as good work as those that are paid? </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to see the clause extended rather than curtailed. We have in Australia a large number of yacht clubs that include among their members a great many plucky young fellows. It is all very well for some honorable members to laugh. I have known such young fellows to go out in very rough weather in Port Phillip and in Sydney Harbor. I believe that with a little training advantage might be taken of the services which could be rendered by the members of these yacht clubs for naval purposes in time of danger. I suggest that they might be attached to the Naval Reserve Forces or Naval Militia Forces. I hope the Minister will deem the suggestion worthy of consideration. </para>

                    <para>.- Proposed new section  32A  deals with the active and reserve Military Forces, and it will be admitted that we can scarcely expect to have effective Military Forces if there are to be too many feathers about them. I direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that there are some who incline to the view that our present forces are overweighted at Headquarters. I find that, in the first year that the Federal authority had control of the Defence Forces, we had, exclusive of cadets and rifle club members, 25,578 men of all arms and the cost amounted to&#163;557,189. Last June, we had 23,316, or more than 2,000 less in all arms of our Defence Forces than we had eight or nine years ago, and the cost was &#163;510,236. I do not cavil at the numbers or the cost, but, so far as the Central Administration is concerned - our Headquarters Staff - a great difference is noticeable. Whilst the strength of our forces and their cost has remained practically the same as they were eight or nine years ago, the cost of the Central Administration has risen at what might be termed an alarming rate. The Estimates dealt with it in one line only in 1904-5, and, up to that date, there had practically been no difference in the cost of the Central Administration. In 1905-6, the Central Administration cost &#163;20,501. It is estimated to cost, during the current financial year, 1909-10, no less than &#163;40,529, or an average increase during the interval of about &#163;5,000 a year. In other words, whilst the strength of our forces and the total expenditure upon them has remained practically the same during the last eight or nine years, the cost of the Central Administration has been doubled in the last four years. In the circumstances, I think I am justified in publicly calling the attention of the Minister to the matter, in. the hope that possibly he may be able to look into it, and see whether we really get value for the money expended on the Headquarters Staff. If we are not increasing the efficiency of our forces - and, according to the opinion of experts, we are not - whilst we are at the same time doubling the cost of the Central Administration, there must be something radically wrong requiring immediate investigation by the Minister controlling the Department. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to say a word or two on&#39; the point raised by the honorable member for Adelaide. He seems to forget that the duties of the Central Administration are not confined to the training and efficiency of the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the forces. I sincerely hope that the Government and honorable members will recognise that the most difficult thing to provide in connexion with a military organization is the brains, or, in other words, the Headquarters Staff. In every civilized army, it is recognised that the operations of the Headquarters Staff are the most difficult and intricate of all the preparations of war. If the Central Administration were to pay greater attention, and required a larger vote for the purpose, to the necessary preparations for war, no one would be better pleased than I. </para>

This is the only country in which the work of securing the kind of information to which I refer is carried out under a voluntary system. I allude to the work undertaken by Colonel McCay, in the preparation of information showing the carrying capacity of our railway lines, our topography, our feed for horses, where water is, and so on.. </para>

                        <para>-I  do not propose to go into the subject in detail. &#91; think I have given honorable members who have studied the question grounds for serious thought in connexion with the Central Administration, but I do not say that it is or is not efficient. I do not pretend to be capable of criticising in a military spirit the technical work of technical officers, but I do say that a staff does not necessarily mean feathers. I take it that it means brains, and that the more we endeavour to provide brains for the organization of the Australian Military Forces, the better we shall be acting for Australian defence. I hope the Minister will always bear that principle in mind. </para>

                    <para>.- Will the Minister state what is meant by paragraph a of this proposed new section? If men are serving with the Imperial Forces outside Australia, they come at once under the Imperial Army Act. This provision is therefore either surplusage or is intended&#34; to meet an extraordinary position. Which is it? The only kind of case that I can imagine that it may be intended to meet is that which happened when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.Colonel</inline> Cameron was in England at the time of the Coronation, and was put in charge of the Military Forces from&#39; all the Dominions. Although he was expressly authorized to take that position, he was grossly interfered with, and I believe had to threaten, in order to maintain his rights, to remove the whole of the Colonial Forces from the ground. </para>

                        <para>- If the provision refers only to cases where men have enlisted with the Imperial Forces, it is absolutely unnecessary. The provisions in regard to paragraphs  b  and  c  are, I admit, necessary. When our men landed in South Africa, they immediately became subject to Imperial martial law, which applied to the whole country. </para>

                        <para>- I do not object to paragraph a so long as it is to apply only when men are actually serving in the field with the Imperial Army ; but I am afraid it is intended to meet some special circumstances. It should not apply, for instance, where we send a special corps to a country not under martial law, as we did in the case of the Coronation contingent: On that occasion,  Lt. -Colonel Cameron-  should have been in a position&#39; to direct his own men. I was proud of the stand he took. </para>

                    <para>. - The purpose of this amendment of the Principal Act is to meet the case of the interchange of officers and men. We are getting officers from the Imperial Forces to be attached to our staffs, and we are also sending our officers to the United Kingdom to be attached to the Imperial Staff. This provision is really being made at the request of the Imperial Government, in order that such interchange and standardization may take place. </para>

                        <para>- But I do not want to give away certain rights. I ask honorable members to recollect the action of the Watson Government in regard to Major-General Hutton. That officer came to Australia as an Imperial officer, and thought that he was above Australian law. He defied the Government and refused to give them the key to a cable until he was talked  to in a very serious fashion. Although he was a Commonwealth public servant be held that his first duty was not to the Commonwealth but to the Mother Country. </para>

It is suggested by the Imperial authorities, and suggested only after the passing of similar legislation in the Old Country. That is to say, they propose to treat our officers when they go to Great Britain precisely as we shall treat their officers when they come here. </para>

                        <para>- These matters are not unqualified and cannot be. When an exchange officer comes here he brings with him his own rate of pay and conditions as to pensions and so forth. We do not interfere with those matters; but for the purposes of discipline, control, and government our Act will apply to them while they are here. They subscribe to our law in every respect. That is why this clause is limited by the words &#34; subject to any Imperial Act.&#34; That qualification relates to the rate of pay, status, and promotion of an exchange officer. In every other respect he is subject to our Act precisely as one of our officers would be when serving on the General Staff at Home. I repeat that this is reciprocal legislation. </para>

                    <para>.- There is no reciprocity in the true sense ot the term, and I do not think that it is necessary that we should ask for it. In speaking in this way I have not in mind any question as to rates of pay. If in Australian officer goes to the centre of the Empire on service he comes automatically under the Army Act. He has no privileges, to my knowledge, under the Defence Act of Australia. All his privileges under that Act have to be abandoned. </para>

                        <para>- I agree. The honorable member for Corio, however, has raised an important point. If I understand him correctly, he has in mind not any question of pay, but the fear that an Imperial officer coming here might claim the right under an Imperial Act to act independently of any authority which might be exercised here by the responsible Minister under the Commonwealth Act. </para>

An Imperial officer who comes here and is dissatisfied with his position is of no use to Australia, and an Australian officer who is dissatisfied with his position in Great Britain is of no service there. If an Australian officer went to the centre of the Empire with a force behind him for any purpose, and was treated in such a way as appeared to him to be beneath the dignity of his position and that of his corps, he should be entitled to withdraw and take his men with him. </para>

                        <para>- An. officer might go Home with a corps for various purposes. We are a- nation and ought to assert our powers as such, subject, of course, to a &#34; due regard for the general welfare of the Empire. . To go into action in association with the Empire with a reservation would be absurd ; but short of that Commonwealth officers should in this respect have all the power and protection we can give them. I do not think that the difficulty suggested by the honorable member for Corio would arise, but his contention is not altogether unfounded. </para>

                    <para>. - At the outset I was rather struck with the force of the objection taken by the honorable member for Corio, but- upon consideration it seems to me to be based upon a misapprehension of the actual meaning of the clause. The clause does not declare or indicate directly or indirectly that an officer of the Imperial Forces serving here is to be subject to an Imperial Act. What it does say is that he shall be subject to the Commonwealth Act, provided that there is no Imperial Act inconsistent therewith. The- distinction may be illustrated by what has been said as to Major-General Hutton. It has been stated that that officer, while General Officer Commanding the Commonwealth Military Forces, was guilty of some breach of discipline under our Act. </para>

                        <para>- Was there any Imperial Act which said that, though the Australian Defence Act prescribed that Major-General Hutton was under the control and discipline of a properly constituted authority in this country, he nevertheless need not obey that authority in a particular matter? Even if so, the case that has been put would be irrelevant. There is no Imperial Act which says that an officer in the Australian Forces is not to be subject to the discipline of a local Act in all matters in which it applies. </para>

                        <para>- But the words in question would not touch such a case. There have, however, been cases in which an officer might have rights which are not maintained under Australian Acts; and it may be necessary, for the. purpose of preserving those rights, &#39; which are outside the domain of our control, that the Bill should contain such words. That, I presume, is the reason why they have been put in. Therefore, honorable members should get out of their minds the idea that the words &#34;subject to any Imperial Act&#34; are more than qualifying words ; and, if so, the objection to them seems to be removed. </para>

                    <para>.- As I understood it, the argument of. the honorable member for Flinders was directed to one point, namely, that there was no Army Act in England which gave Major-General Hutton the right to disobey an Australian Minister to whom he was bound to render service. Unfortunately, however, there is a safeguard in an Imperial Act, which the clause under discussion seems to me to abandon specifically. I allude to the Defences and Discipline (Army) Act, section 169 - an Imperial Act which applies in Australia. The Act provides that - . </para>
