			<para>By the division taken yesterday afternoon the House declared that it was not disposed to continue the discussion of the proposed Address-in-Reply to the speech of His Excellency the Governor-General, and as that course was taken in opposition to the Ministry, we do not propose to proceed further with business at this sitting, and will take the earliest opportunity to consider our position.

					<para>I think that I have made a sufficient reply to the remarks of the honorable member for Hume. If any particular allegation is made by him, it can be dealt with later. It is sufficient to say that his grievances, i f he has any, exist only in his own mind. My reply to the interjection of the honorable member for Hindmarsh is that there is not time to discuss my relations with the Labour Administration. In the entertaining review of the Attorney-General last night, there were convenient gaps in what, by courtesy, might be called his argument.</para>

					<para>In the first case there was not a vote given in terms against the Ministry, but there was what was quite equivalent, since on the hustings before we were returned, and also here, I had announced that the Government would accept their amendment as a challenge to us. I made no complaint on either of those occasions, and, on the latter, united with the members of the Labour Party in order to make the proceedings as brief as possible. We were then at the close of a session; and i f we had chosen to require a vote of want-of-confidence debate before retiring, and to fight that question in the House, the remainder of the session, or the greater part of it, would have been fruitlessly consumed. We were then in the middle of November, and, consequently, we should have had a dislocation of public business.</para>

					<para>I did no such thing ; I submitted a simple-motion for the adjournment of the House, and induced silence on the part of every honorable member who was supporting us, or sympathized with us. I even declined support that was offered to us from other parties, and which would have resulted, at least, in a long debate, and, upon terms, in my retention of office. I claim no special virtue for that. I say that the state of business made our action the proper thing to do in the public interest, and we did it. The course which we took yesterday was, as far as possible, modelled on the same lines. I have indicated that, at this stage of the session, due discussion of the lengthy opening Speech, much of it unable to be dealt with this session, would have been to the prejudice of public business, and the postponement of necessary measures. It was unjustifiable. Consequently I made a short statement to that effect, paving the way so that the Prime Minister on behalf of his party, could give any exposition of his policy he thought necessary under the circumstances. So far as that policy is concerned, I may say, in passing, that, before it was announced, I had been discussing, the general questions of the day, most of which it touched upon,, and that, after the policy was announced, I continued the discussion at length in many parts of the Commonwealth. Though, as the Prime Minister said last night, he had not read the criticism, that is not a matter for which I am in any way responsible.</para>

					<para>In one of them. 1 afterwards, in successive speeches, in order to make up for that defective report, dealt with those matters point by point. If the Prime Minister did. not acquaint himself with those speeches, that is his affair, and not mine. The fact remains that, so far as the policy is concerned, I have already fully expressed upon it the opinions which were shared by my associates and myself. Indeed, I summarized them again, except on the financial question, in Melbourne the night before we met here. I have done my part as to the policy. Now as to procedure. We adopted a method which gave the Prime Minister the opportunity if he had thought fit, after I pointedly directed his attention to the state of the House,' and to the impossibility of his hoping to carry out his programme, of •submitting any proposition he desired as to the conduct of ibusiness. This gave the Prime Minister every opportunity, and the widest latitude for taking a course himself, or suggesting any step to us which would have left a clear course open. When, in the exercise of his undoubted prerogative he chose to take no course or step, but to require a challenge from us, we gave him at once the same kind of 'direct challenge that was given last session to us. That is to say, we gave him a challenge that was disposed of without loss of time. We did this knowing that it must be followed by the motion for the adjournment of the House, on which it is possible for any ventilation of grievances to take place. That was fully calculated on by us, and would be fully understood by the merest tyro in politics. Consequently, when he said that the closure was applied last night, the statement, though technically justifiable, is not justifiable in fact.</para>

					<para>Parliamentar y practice is plain. After pointing out that the action yesterday amounted to an application of the closure, the newspaper went on to say that honorable members took advantage of the motion for the adjournment of the House. Is it to be supposed that honorable members on this side did not know that a motion for the adjournment of the House must follow, as the next step, which, when launched,' was bound to throw open the gates?

					<para>No , they properly came under the motion. When, the Prime Minister asked' that there should be no limitation of debate, and expressed the opinion that, under the circumstances, the motion should be given a generous interpretation, I , ' and every one here, assented. There was no attempt at any time during the whole of the debate to object in any way to the course which honorable members opposite took. They had a free hand. There was not a single appeal to the Speaker on the point.</para>

In the absence of any action on his part, or a proposal of any kind for meeting the present situation, i t became our duty to take the action we did.

					<para>I do not propose to deal further with last night's situation, because honorable members on both sides of the House are aware that the course adopted was in accordance with one of the most familiar motions made daily in Parliament. It was known as well to the youngest as to the oldest member of the House that after the success of the first motion not only would every opportunity for criticism be supplied on the very next motion—tha t for the adjournment— but , further still, when the House meets again that criticism would be resumed, and would necessarily range over the whole field into which honorable members felt inclined to enter. It would embrace a discussion of every business proposition that can be dealt with this session or which honorable members think may not be dealt with, although it ought to be.</para>

					<para>Whe n I apologize the honorable member may make a point of it. At present I am not apologizing but analyzing our procedure. With all these opportunities offered for discussing in Parliament every question now proposed or that may hereafter be proposed, no honorable member can say that the present Ministerial party will lose a tittle of their rights, privileges, or powers of speech as the result of our action. What they did lose was the opportunity to enter upon the general and profitless discussion here of a programme for the next election. To that waste of time I distinctly took exception yesterday from the same motive that led me to take a particular course at the end of last session, when retiring from office. My object was to avoid a hopeless sacrifice of parliamentary time at a period of the session when there is no time to be lost.</para>

					<para>Whe n I do not speak of it one half of the honorable members opposite, in chorus, invite me to do so, and when I speak of it the other half object. There is no pleasing them. The Government, well within their rights, declined to follow the straightforward course that we took last year in similar circumstances. They even declined to choose their own path out. This forced us to choose the shortest that could be taken. We are content with the result, and will proceed with any other step that may be necessary to get to real business or enable us to put our consecutive and comprehensive platform of Liberal legislation before the country.</para>

			<para>Th e honorable and learned member for Ballarat has just favoured us for the first time with some excuses for his present action. He has found that which we feared he had lost for ever^—hi s facility for explaining and excusing everything—an d has given us fresh occasion for amazement, and for some little amusement. The honorable gentleman has been endeavouring to elevate political assassination into a fine art, and to place it upon a scientific basis. It appears now that the reason why he assassinated the Watson Government was that he was inveigled under specious pretences to draft an amendment which he had not the faintest idea would have the result that followed its adoption.</para>

					<para>Th e honorable member for Ballarat has explained that he was entrapped into drafting the amendment, which brought about the defeat of the Watson Government. I quoted last night, by way of reply, the words used by the right honorable member for East Sydney to the effect that that was a hollow and specious statement of facts. If the honorable member says it is not true that he drafted that amendment, or that he voted for/ it under the belief that it was not vital to us, let him still take refuge in what flimsy protection such a denial will give him, for no other mani in the country will believe him. He has explained and justified the assassination of the Watson Government which he promised! to loyally support. Had De Quincey lived until now he would have been able to include in hisdelightful essay on Murder as a Fine Art the methods of the honorable member for Ballarat, for no man has adopted such a variety of methods, and none has contrived to more successfully evade the consequences of his political crimes. His last assassination in some respects out-Herods Herod, but his former achievements ran it hard for first place. Then there was the assassination of the Reid Government. He made that Government, he pledged him-.self to support it, he destroyed it by a speech which the right honorable member for East Sydney very properly assumed was not only the beginning of the end but the end itself. The right honorable member therefore came down with a Governor-General's speech of one paragraph; but did that save him from the wrath to come ? We go out be- cause our speech contains thirty-two clauses. He went out because his contained only one clause. Was the life of the right honorable member's Government cut short because the programme put before the House was too long for consideration? Rather it was such as could have been comfortably got through in one sitting day, and the right honorable member had such in contemplation. But it did not save him for a single hour. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat has told us that the right honorable member for East Sydney was under a complete misapprehension. When at Ballarat he gave the right honorable member notice to quit he never meant it. At the very moment when the right honorable member's political brains were falling over his shoulders, when his scalp was dangling at the honorable member's belt, the honorable member was really his best friend. God save us from such friends! Last night the honorable member abandoned the finer resources of political assassination and resorted to the bludgeon of the cannibal. Having perhaps exhausted all the finer possibilities of the art, or desiring to exhibit his versatility $n his execrable profession he came out and bludgeoned us in the open light of day. It was then that I heard from this side of the House some mention of Judas. I do not agree with that ; it is not fair—t o Judas, for whom there is this to be said, that he did not gag the man whom he betrayed, nor did he fail to hang himself afterwards.</para>

					<para>That was very good of the honorable member, and had the Prime Minister known that it was the length of our programme to which exception was taken, we should have been most happy to cut off the part which offended the honorable member. But since I have been in Parliament I have never known the leader of any Government to bring down a programme —excep t in the one case that I have already referred to—whic h the House did not say and know was unlikely to be wholly completed in that session. It is the custom of Governments to do so, and it has never been the practice of any House desirous of pushing on with the public business to throw out a Government because its programme was too long, when that programme contained those things which were necessary to be done at the time. Now what is to be done ? The honorable member says that his programme and ours are the same. His is the Liberal programme, and he has allied himself with those Liberals whom we see around him—wolve s whose eyes gleam redly through their sheep'swool covering—i n order the more speedily and effectively to carry it out. He says that he slew us quickly in order to save us from the tortures of a lingering death, and that in order that there should be no interruption of public business. He declared that it was this alone that actuated him in committing an act of the basest ingratitude towards this party, and one without precedent at any rate in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament. The people of this country, in spite of every effort to the contrary, ' will be made acquainted with the true facts of this case. Although the honorable member has thrown over him the shield of the most powerful organ in this State, if not in Australia, he will find that even that will not now save him, for the people can never be made to understand how it happens that the honorable member, who was our ally for the best part of nine years, and who was prepared to be our colleague fifteen months ago</para>

If he did not propose to go into the Ministry, he proposed to desert and assassinate it as he is doing now; or he was going to sit in a Cabinet in which the Labour Party had an overwhelming predominance; and which, certainly, as he must have known, would, if formed, have promoted exactly those measures which it now proposes to do.</para>

					<para>There is surely some moral obliquity about a nature such as his. No act that he commits, no party that he betrays, no cause that he abandons, affects him at -au. He regards himself as the selected and favoured agent of Providence. Everything that he does he does for the very best. He does it because there is nothing else that can be done to conserve the welfare of the people and the interests of the nation. To realize this noble ideal he has assassinated Governments, abandoned friends to the wolves, deserted principles, and deceived the people. Just now he wishes to fill the empty spaces of Australia; and he gathers about him those gentlemen who are responsible for the isnonopolization of the lands of Australia. He proposes to establish a citizen defence force. He has been converted to that policy. I have to declare that he 'has done much good in his time, for I heard him convert himself on the for .of a national defence force when he spoke in London. Up to that time he had been uncertain.</para>

					<para>Ah, yes! The cohorts behind the honorable member for Ballarat declare that we on this side of the House are disloyal; that wFen we seek to establish an Australian navy we do wrong. And so, the honorable member for Ballarat has allied himself with those who have always upheld what they call the cause of loyalty to the British Empire. Amongst others he has allied himself with the honorable member for Parkes. That. honorable member of late has been profoundly moved in reference to the position of Imperial affairs. We are given to understand that he has addressed many public meetings in regard to this matter, and that everywhere he has met with the most amazing expressions of approval of his policy—whatever that may be. This is what the honorable member for Parkes says of the honorable member for Ballarat—</para>

					<para>He is the political mercenary of Australia. He will lead any party—he will follow none! He is faithful to only one thing—himself. He is tine to only one power, and bends the knee to only one principle, and that is that which is at any time the most powerful. To the Age he never turns a deaf ear. Of that organization, the Orange Lodge, a manifestation of whose power in active politics we saw lately, owing to the incredible energy of our friend the honorable member for .Dalley, we see him a servile and humble adherent. He has done all these things; le has abandoned his party, and he h pplied the gag to those who were his friends and allies, and prevented them from explaining their policy, a policy which he declared—was it lye or six or ten days ago—to be a good one for Australia and a policy which even now he is unable to attack successfully. He sits there now and declares that he is content to leave everything th the cool judgment of the people. He means the refrigerated, the hypnotised jpdgment of the people. Let him get to the people, whilst the facts and the memory of his latest acts are fresh in their minds. When he says, "We will sweep the country," the statement is perfectly true. The honorable gentleman will sweep the country, but we shall be the men who hold the broom and he will be the broom with which we shall sweep it.</para>

				<para>I wish to offer my congratulations to the honorable and learned ..member for Ballarat upon at last assuming what I believe to be his rightful position in this House. I have believed for some considerable time that he should be associated politically with those in whose company we now find him, the individuals whom he described as the wreckage of the black labour party of Australia. I wish also to congratulate the Opposition upon electing the honorable and learned gentleman to his present position, because they are well advised, who, when dealing with persons accustomed to use the stiletto, make those persons walk in front instead of behind them. The right honorable member for East Sydney will appreciate that statement. I am not surprised that under existing circumstances the right honorable gentleman, who was accustomed to sit on the front Opposition bench, is content nowto have the honorable and learned member for Ballarat in front of him. It is fitting that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, the prospective. Prime Minister, should make his first statement to the House in the form of an apology. He has apologized to those with whom he was associated in the troublous times of the past, and he has apologized to the House for the course followed with his sanction, if not on h1s motion yesterday. He rightly felt the denunciation of the four members of the Liberal Party who spoke, and it is fitting that he should make an exulanation and an apology this morning, but I am afraid that he did not strictly adhere to the facts n what he said. He said that honorable members . opposite were adopting towards the Labour GQvernnlent the attitude adoptecr by rrieinbers of the Labour Party when his. own Administration was about to Le driven from office. . Quoting from Hansard for 27th November, page 2389, I find that he: said—</para>

					<para>I ask the honorable member for Wimmera to say who was responsible for initiating the debate to-day. So far as I know the members of the Labour Party had not the slightest intention to say a word this morning. I had made a few notes of the speech which I had intended to deliver yesterday. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat is the person who initiated the present discussion. Does the honorable member for Wimmera believe that the Labour Government have shown any unreasonable hesitation in leaving office? Will he say that if after the motion carried against them yesterday, they had asked for an adjournment until next Wednesday, such a request would have been unreasonable?</para>

					<para>—The honorable member for mdi is unable to appreciate the conduct of a party that is straight and above' board. He interprets everything they do. in the light of the actions of people who are as warped in their views as himself. We are justified in asking what is to be the programme of the Government that will succeed the present Government. The honorable .and learned member for Ballarat hasmade no statement • as to what the policy of his Government is going to be. He certainly said at the Melbourne Town Hall' the other night that it was intended to haye effective protection as a plank of the platform of the Liberal Party, but only in last night's Herald we saw that the right honorable member for East Sydney emphatically repudiated any agreement to go beyond the terms of a fiscal truce. Where is the honorable and learned member for Ballarat to get effective protection?</para>

					<para>Those who, with the honorable member for mdi, believe that the present Tariff is sufficiently protective can have no cause for complaint. But did the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, when the Tariff was passed, admit that it was sufficiently protective? We know that he considered that it had been amended out of all recognition by the Corner Party, and by the wreckage of the black labour parts' of Australia. He contended that the Tariff, as passed by this House, was not satisfactory.</para>

					<para>My hostility to the Government of the honorable member for Ballarat was due to the fact that I have never believed in him. I have always believed that he is what is described in the outside world as a political flzgig; one of those persons who will sell their friends, and those most closely associated with them, in order to aggrandize themselves and secure their own position. It does appear to me that the honorable member for Maribyrnong could not have. been more accurately described than he was by the right honorable member for East Sydney, when the latter declared that in his capacity as Postmaster-General he was "the most stupendous joke of the century." But to return to the taunt which has been hurled against me regarding the action which I took in this House and nowhere else respecting the postal prohibition imposed upon the correspondence of Messrs. Freeman and Wallace, I merely wish to say that all I ever claimed was that the firm in question should have their case submitted for determination to an impartial tribunal.</para>

					<para>The only association I had with any one else was when the honorable member for Riverina declared his intention to move for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the prohibition imposed upon the letters of Messrs. Freeman and Wallace, I certainly said that I would support him. I hold that the meanest criminal in the community is entitled to be tried and convicted before he is punished. The right honorable member for East Sydney made a similar statement. Is he also to be charged' with being interested in this particular firm? When the prospective Prime Minister resorts to such questionable and despicable methods of obtaining satisfaction against those whom he knows were particularly interested in securing his removal from office, and against those who will ultimately pursue him, I think that he is adopting, a very miserable attitude.</para>

					<para>I think that the honorable member for Hume will admit that on a former occasion I did as much as did any member of this House to secure the removal of the honorable member for Ballarat from office, and I know that there was a certain amount of jubilation amongst his followers when they found that my name was not included in the Labour Cabinet. I think that the future Prime Minister and his supporters have adopted a line of conduct which can only result in their own political annihilation. Those honorable members who have now secured a fiscal truce from the howling protectionists, who desired to pile on additional duties, can afford to say, "We are dealing with an individual who is unreliable, and who is likely in a spasmodic outburst to do injury to our cause, and therefore it is fitting that he should walk in front of the column." In leaving the case of Messrs. Freeman and Wallace I wish to add that the attitude which I adopted in reference to that firm is one which I shall uniformly observe in the case of any individual or firm who is judged on ex perle evidence. No individual will ever vainly appeal to me to assist him to have his case decided upon its merits, and in the light of day. In connexion with the present situation it is interesting to note that no policy has yet been submitted by the prospective coalition Government. Its members have merely repudiated the statements of one another. At present, therefore, we are limited to a discussion of their past achievements. I am satisfied that if this House did the right thing, instead of adjourning till Tuesday next, it would adjourn till next July in order that in the interim the electors might be afforded an opportunity of expressing their opinion upon those who have so grossly betrayed their trust.</para>

				<para>I fail to recognise any need for the use of the strong language which has . been indulged in this morning. I congratulate the prospective Prime Minister upon his present political associations. When I said this morning that I felt deeply sorry for him last evening when he was so uneasy and pale under the trenchant criticism of the Attorney-General, I can assure him that I meant it. I always feel sorry when a man so far forgets himself as to fall from a high position to the lowest depths of political degradation. The honorable member for Ballarat showed us how comfortable he was last evening by losing his temper the moment the proceedings of the House opened to-day. I see the late leader of the Opposition sitting on the Treasury bench for the moment. I wish to congratulate him, and at the same time to give him a little advice, if' he will take it from me. Whether he takes it or not is neither here nor there, but I am going to offer it. There is no need for him to go and ask the prospective Prime Minister to do this, that, or the other by way of carrying out his policy.. I can let him into the secret history of our party in this House. We never asked the prospective Prime Minister to do anything for us, as he will admit. We never went to him and tried to coerce him into doing anything, and he will indorse that remark. ' On former occasions he has always agreed with me that we never unduly pressed him by going to him and asking him to do this, that, or the other in connexion with the carrying out of a certain policy. Whether the honorable member for Parramatta wants some free-trad project to be carried through, or whether he wants anything else in his political platform to be carried out, he has nb need to press the honorable member for Ballarat. He has only to get the honorable member for Illawarra, or one or two other honorable members on his side, to go to a public meeting and say, "This is what we want." And the honorable member for Ballarat is so putty-like that he will immediately mould his opinions to the desires of his. party. I give that information gratis to the honorable member for Parramatta, who, I am sure, will appreciate the spirit in which it is given, and use it to the fullest possible extent. In this House we have never carried a reform or any measure which was branded with the ideals and thoughts of the Labour Party by asking the honorable member for Ballarat to act. We simply published our proposals to the' world, and, although on one day the honorable member was opposed to them, on the next day he was prepared to come into the House and carry them out. Was that done for the sake of holding office? What was it done for? The honorable member had one idea in his political cared, and that was to keep certain honorable memhers off the Treasury bench. He is now associated with them, and I offer him my hearty congratulations. I remember the time when he stood on the floor here and indignantly denied the statement of the honorable member for East Sydney, who had accused him of betraying his Government in connexion with the Ballarat speech. The honorable gentleman said that he did not mean his speech to be taken in that way, and that he had no intention of going to Ballarat to give the honorable member for East Sydney notice to quit. Does not the book David Syrne, which has just been published, say that David Syme, of the Age, practically sent the honorable member to Ballarat to give the honorable member for East Sydney notice to quit?</para>

					<para>I thank the honorable member for the correction. The cablegram must have left here on Thursday or Friday at the very latest. Under those circumstances, what can we expect? We cannot expect anything else from the honorable member for Ballarat. 1 congratulate my honorable friends opposite. I can imagine the honorable member for Maribyrnong sitting in the, !Ministerial room before the fire with the honorable member for East Sydney, and the latter telling him that he was the most stupendous joke of the century. I can also imagine the honorable member for Corio, whom I do not see in his place just now, telling the honorable member for East Sydney how he juggled with the finances of New South Wales, and I fancy that I can hear the honorable member for East Sydney telling him that he was a freak of nature—the rest of the remark I leave out. I can also imagine the honorable member for Franklin saying before the last election that he would thank God if the Labour candidate would only beat Mr. Deakin. I can imagine him sitting subsequently alongside the honorable member for Ballarat and saying that he would never be associated with any Government which included him. I can also imagine the honorable member for Swan mounting a table in one of the rooms and delivering an address on dirt-eating. He seems to have swallowed so much of that commodity that. one could almost take him to be a rubbish heap. Still, I suppose that he could give a very interesting lecture in that particular line. I can imagine the honorable member for Richmond telling the honorable member for Parramatta how he removed several skins from his body, and how the latter shed his skins like a snake in the spring time. I can imagine the honorable member for Wentworth telling the honorable member for Ballarat that he put a stiletto in the back of the Reid Government. No doubt it would be ver' interesting to listen to all these little exchanges. From the bottom of my heart, I sincerely congratulate honorable members on the other side, with the exception of one or two who, I know, are not very comfortable over there. I remember the time when the honorable member for Fawkner sat in the Opposition corner, and was accused of telling the Employers' Federation that there was going to be, a class fight. When he was accused by the honorable member for Barrier of having made the statement, he tried to wriggle out of it. I am pleased that there is to be a class fight. I am thoroughly convinced that if the workers of Australia hope to get reforms which will be lasting and beneficial to them, they can only achieve their ends by a class struggle. I hope that a class struggle will be made, and that it will be as bitter as it is possible to make it. I make that remark after years of serious• consideration. I have observed the conduct of those who from time to time have pretended to be their friends, but who, whenever vested interests were attacked in any shape, immediately came together to down a proposed reform. The honorable member for Darling Downs got the honorable member for Ballarat to go to Queensland recently to deliver certain addresses in the interests of their party. In Brisbane the honorable member for Ballarat advocated a land tax, but when he got' to Darling Downs, where he was pledged to deliver a similar speech, he had to back down on the land tax at the in stigation of the representative of the constituency in this House.</para>

Under these circumstances he will require a good deal of watching. However, I offer my hearts' congratulations to honorable members opposite. I am sure that they are extremely happy. The honorable member this morning showed how happy he was last iight by the excited manner in which he interjected during the speech of the Attorney-General. No men in the chamber look more happy than do the right honorable member for Swan and the honorable member for Ma.ribyrnong, to say nothing of the honorable member for Darling Downs, who knows that his doom is sealed.</para>

					<para>The honorable member is more gifted with speech than I ever hope to be, and will have an ample opportunity to explain his position. I congratulate the late leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Parramatta. Before he does anything rash, I advise him to look over the strong men with whom he has to deal—the strong intellectual and political entities in the party in the persons of the honorable members for Maribyrnong, Darling Downs, and Batman. I have shown him how he can squeeze and mould the prospective Prime Minister into any shape he desires. When he has done so, the others whom I have named will humbly follow. I hope that honorable members opposite will be a happy family, and that the time will never come when they will separate. I again offer them my hearty congratulations, though I except a, few whom I shall not mention, whom I know not to be very comfortable in their present positions.</para>

					<para>I have a copy of the original letter. The honorable member for Cook is well able to look after himself, without the assistance of the honorable member for Maranoa.

					<para>The honorable member might also ask some of the "scabs" who cart pianos in times of strike! I hoped, when I rose to do justice to the honorable member, that he would show a desire to treat me similarly, but, as he does not, I shall have to refer to some remarks which he made on the subject some time ago. He did not then deny having done that with which he is now charged, but his attitude was that the letters which he wrote were written in confidence, and it was scandalous to publish them! He has accused me of having made a mutilated statement, but I have proved my words to him by reading portions of his own letter, and referring to his own words as reported in Hansard on the ioth October, 1907, when the honorable member acknowledged that he had written to the association and the Liberal politician referred to. However, I have said enough to prove that it was not worthy of this Chamber for the honorable member to contradict me in the way he did last night.</para>

					<para>I desire to say that at the time this incident occurred, certain members of the New South Wales Labour Party were speaking in reference to the Boer War. I very strongly held views opposite to those expressed, and certainly did write some letters in reference to speeches made by them in the district in which I live. Those letters have been manipulated by the press of New South Wales altogether out of their meaning. Pieces have been cut out and pieces put in with the effect that the context has been altogether destroyed ; qualifications which would convey a totally different meaning have been altogether omitted.</para>

				<para>I can scarcely let an opportunity such as this pass without saying a word or two. Honorable members of the Opposition must realize to the full that they have not dealt in a manly and straightforward spirit with the Government. In the whole history of politics, from what I have observed and from what I have read, I have never known an Opposition, immediately on the completion of the Prime Minister's remarks, to move the closure so as to prevent honorable members who support the Government from at once expressing their opinion on the momentous questions before the country. However, no one is more proud than myself to-day to find all the Conservative elements on one side of the Chamber. It should indeed be the happiest day for every true member of the Democratic Party, who has been fighting for years consistently for the masses of the people, to find at last the enemy all in one camp. We have at last adopted n. truly Australian method of identification. Throughout this country it has ever been the practice to adopt the branding method so that the respective owners of cattle may be readily ascertained ; and for many years we have been trying to brand the Conservative elements in Australian politics. Owing, however, to the fact that the honorable gentlemen opposite, and those whom they represent,. have hitherto had sufficient numbers to enable them to divide the spoils, vve have not been able to brand them as they are now branded—that is, as the enemies of the people of this great Commonwealth. I compliment them on having come together ; nnd I think that the leader of the Opposition is in his proper place. I admit, with some diffidence, that he was in a very peculiar position before he took this step. He and his party had had the support of the Labour Party for seven or eight years ; practically they had the support of. the party so long as they were prepared to carry into effect measures which we felt to be in the interests of the people of the country. And we must not forget that the honorable gentlemen opposite also admitted such measures to be in the interests of the people, and declared that they. were only carrying out principles embodied in their platform from time to time. -What is the difference between the platform of honorable gentlemen opposite and the platform of the Labour Party? Let any man read the two platforms—the Governor- General's speech, and the platform indicated by the leader of the Opposition, and he would find very little difference indeed between the two. The only difference is that we go one step further, and make our platform a complete reform, whereas they stop at the ritical point where inefficiency enters and stagnation commences. We of the Labour Party say to them, " We want you to go to the kernel of the trouble, and adopt a land tax in the interests of the settlement and the defence of Australia." But those men, although they have professed to be democrats all these 'ears, are not prepared to adopt that reform which alone can safeguard the future of Australia and make the people happier than they are at present. They hesitate to take the step; and why? Because honorable members in the Opposition corner —the landlords and men at the head of the Employers' Union, who represent everything that is antagonistic to the uplifting of the masses—are in the controlling position today. The power lies, not with those who have gone over with the honorable member for Ballarat, or with the men associated with the honorable member for Parramatta— but, as will be found in practical politics, with the Conservative Party in the corner, who hold the helm of State, or will do so in the course of a few days. Why are they given the helm? Simply because the other men of the combination cannot obtain the power without their aid. Those not of the Corner Party are prepared to turn topsy-turvy, or from right to ]eft, and forsake their former allies for the sake of the emoluments of office—for the sake of maintaining for a few years at the very most their position in Australian politics. In referring to the honorable members in the Corner, I do not mean the knight of the nosebag, the right honorable member for Swan.</para>

					<para>The religion of the honorable member for Swan and, the religion of the honorable member for Ballarat is apparently summed up in the one commandment, "Man, mind thyself." They have availed themselves of every opportunity to intrigue for office. The honorable member for Ballarat claims that his present attitude is due to the fact that he and his party were threatened with political suicide if they continued to support the Labour Party. 1 admit that the labour organizations outside have determined that the time has arrived when they should place a brand on those who profess to be " as good as a labour man." We are tired of those who merely indulge in platitudes about labour, and have no real sympathy with our parts', and our party outside have determined that such men should pay the penalty of their insincerity. The honorable member for Ballarat and his party have had the support of labour for eight year, and as the result of that support have been enabled to enjoy the emoluments of office. It is true that they have given us somewhat grudgingly some of the planks of our platform. But now that we put before Parliament a programme that is practically an advance on anything that they have submitted, they not only forsake us, but ally themselves with the enemy. They are not prepared to give the Government an opportunity to prove what they are prepared to do. I recognised that sooner or later, before the next election, the honorable mem- 'her for Ballarat must withdraw his support from the Labour Party. It was only natural that he should not be prepared to lay his head on the block, and to calmly await the fall of the executioner's knife at the behest of the Labour Party. It would be unreasonable to expect any man to submit quietly to annihilation. But it seems, to me that the honorable member would have acted far more honorably than he has done had he refrained from taking action until our programme had been presented to the Parliament, and he had pointed out any parts of it which, in his opinion, was antagbnistic to the welfare of the people. Had he shown some reasonable ground for, his action, no one could have demurred.</para>

					<para>But it was not the Gympie speech that led the honorable member for Ballarat to take up his, present position. Long Wore that speeh was delivered he had been conniving at a fusion of parties. He has taken over a programme accepted by certain organizations in the Commonwealth, and for a large part of which the honorable member for Dalley is responsible. That honorable member some time ago stepped from the ranks of the free-traders. He told his constituents that he was going to leave that party so far as its policy was concerned. Since then he has been ostracised by it, and has been induced to draw up a policy more in keeping with the position that he holds: We find now that the honorable member for Ballarat and his party have practically adopted a platform that has been submitted to other organizations. The honorable member for Da.11ey has taken up an attitude far more worthy of commendation than is that of the other representatives of New South Wales in the Opposition. Those honorable members, some of whom will be members of the coalition Ministry, came into the House as avowed free-tradrs; they declared free-trade to be a panacea for all the ills of the Commonwealth, and yet to-day they are going back on their promises to the electors. They have practically betrayed their pledges to those who sent them here. The honorable member for Dailey said that he recognised that a change in the fiscal policy, hedged about with proper safeguards, was necessary. But the other representatives of New South Wales in the Opposition declared for free-trade, and now give no sign of shame, although they must know that they have betrayed the people who sent them here. My sympathy goes out to their constituents— to the people to whom they gave the promise that they would carry the banner of free-trade to victory. If there is one attribute more. than another that the representatives of the people should possess, it is that of consistency, and of loyalty to the programme that they advocate on the hustings. But the free-trade members of the- Opposition have taken up what may be described as a brazen-faced position. In entering into the compact with the Deakinites they implored the latter to leave some crevice or loophole in the agreement through which they might crawl when they had to meet their constituents. And what is the loophole ? It is that they shall have a free hand with regard to the fiscal question. Is their attitude worthy of men who claim to be fighting for a principle that is dear to them? Is it right that they should be content to do nothing to remove an evil of which they complain, and to say: It As long as you do not alter what has been done—as long as you do not eliminate from the statute - book the measure of protection which has been granted—we will work with you; hut when anomalies are to be considered you will give us a free hand." A free hand in those circumstances is simply a phrase for throwing dust into the eyes of the people. The freedom that they have secured is freedom to vote against the Governmetit with which they are about to ally themselves, or to try ineffectively, as they profess to be able to do, to prevent the onward march of the protective policy. The name of freedom is a glorious one, and the honorable member for Ballarat uses it more than does any other man in this chamber or outside of it. It is the text from which he preaches from every platform. He says that the cause of freedom and liberty is taking him and his followers out of the ranks of the men with whom they have been allied so long, but what kind of freedom do they mete out to their friends in this House? The very first sign of their love of freedom was given yesterday, when their first act, after obtaining the power to do it, was to curtail freedom, to cripple liberty of speech, and to strangle the rights of honorable members by moving the gag. Those are the men who cry out for liberty and freedom, and their action yesterday is a sample of the treatment which they will mete out to the people's representatives. in this chamber. I welcome any such method as they now adopt, for it always recoils upon those who use such unfair means to suppress and subordinate their opponents. I shall welcome the application of the gag time after time, provided that it is put on, as it must be put on, when the people's watchdogs are trying to defend the liberties of the people that sent them here. The honorable member for Parramatta can afford to sit on that bench and smile thesmile that is. customary with him when things are going his way.</para>

					<para>I do not think we shall ever be able to discover another man who has done or is capable of doing what the honorable member for Ballarat has done since I have been in the chamber. When I was returned to this House, someyears ago, I felt that in the National Parliament I should find some evidence of strong men working with a strong purposefor a determined end. I find that they are strong in evil, strong to do wrong, strong to forfeit their principles, strong to. denounce that which they formerly recommended, strong to sacrifice the people who sent them here, strong to abandon every. thing that tends to make a man an honorable man in this chamber. That is where their strength lies, as indicated by what we see on the opposite side to-day. I sympathize more with the electors than with any member on that side. I welcome the fusion that has taken place. I realize that it is but the beginning of the end, and that we havegot the enemy into one camp at last. It is only a matter now of lighting on, on the lines that Nye have laid down for nearly twenty years, and upon which we have travelled religiously, without deviating to the right or the left. It is only a questionnow of moving onward towards the goal of our ambition, because that party of fragments, whose different sections have no sympathy with one another, and which consists merely of a number of men who are seeking to escape from the condemnation of the people, cannot live before the united fire that will be directed upon them by the true representatives of the people in this chamber. Many of them have cried for dissolutions. I have heard the honorable member for Parramatta, the right honorable member for East Sydney, and others, saying—" Let us give the people a chance to say what we should do." May I ask them to-day if they are prepared to go to the people? If they are, I can assure them that we are quite prepared to meet them on the hustings within the next week or two. I know that those men, whose guilty consciences must haunt them in their quiet and reflective moments, dare not, with their consciousness of wrong-doing, go before the electors within the next twelve months, at any rate.</para>

					<para>I know that the honorable member has a pocket borough. He was anxious to cut off from his electorate the workers who sent him into the first Parliament. He was discerning enough to see the future so clearly that he cut himself away from the very men who put him into national politics, and made him what he is, the moment the redistribution of seats enabled him to do so. It is not to-day that he runs for the first time into the 11tonservative Camp. Tnis is not the first indication of his desire to join the enemies of the democracy. He did it when the redistribution of seats took place, forsaking the men who gave him political birth, and running into the arms of the Conservative electors of Parramatta, not for then, but for this time that he saw coming, when he would join the men whom he had condemned, at a time when he was in his proper senses, and belonged to the party that he now despises.</para>

					<para>The honorable member for Parramatta is so case-hardened that he can stand anything. He has been in the crucible, preparing for the present situation, ever since he left the Labour Party. His has been no sudden change. It has been a slow, but continuous, change, and he is so thick in the hide to-day that he cannot be penetrated even by the sharpest of weapons. No doubt the honorable member will enjoy the emoluments of office. But while he enjoys them the bitterness will enter into his 'soul. The ghosts of his former principles will haunt him night by night. In spite of, all he may think, emoluments will not remove those spectres from' his bedside. Coming to the Corner party, it is obvious that whether they secure seats in the incoming Ministry or not does not matter. They really hold the fort. They are the men who can make or mar the new combination. Those eleven members in the Corner represent monopoly. They are the arch anti-democrats. . They are the men who are going to control this new combination. They will hold the balance of power in the triangular duel that will be going on day by day in the parti' that has been brought together by methods the most obnoxious ever resorted to in Australian politics. People talk of the three Party system in this Hquse. It has been condemned by politicians. But what do people think of the three parties now bound together in one party, the blessed trinity of monopolists, Conservatives, and arch traitors to the principles which they have espoused? We have had three parties proposing different policies and fighting on different lines until a few weeks ago; and does any one mean to tell me that these three parties are going to assimilate and work in unison for the welfare of the people? Their sole object is to defeat the Labour Party. The right honorable member for Swan may make the best of his present opportunity, for, as surely as he is sitting in this chamber to-day, so soon as the people of Australia awaken to the perfidy that is taking place, so soon will the doom of the members of the new combination be sealed. So soon also will the people of Australia acclaim the programme of the one party in politics that is not ashamed to put before the country fearlessly, honestly, and continuously, a policy that is designed in the interests of Australia. Is it any disgrace to leave these benches by the methods adopted by the party opposite? In my opinion it is not a disgrace, but is one of the best things that could possibly happen to our party. We shall now know who are for us and who are against us.</para>

					<para>When I look at the honorable member who interrupts me, and contemplate his cold-blooded character, I am not surprised that he can take anything coolly. :But I have principles which I hold dear, and I feel for the cause which I espouse. The honorable member for Womera has been sent here to represent a constituency consisting largely of men on the land. In his district, however, there are many large estates; and there are in it many farmers whose Sons are seeking to follow the ,occupations of their sires, but who can; not get land upon which to settle. He asks me to keep cool, when I take stock of this state of things. I am convinced that when the day comes for honorable members opposite to appear before the electors they will not be able to keep so cool as they advise me to do. If we could go before the people in two months' time, I am convinced that the result would be to make a precedent in history, so that no party elected to this Chamber in the future would, for a moment, dare to do what the party opposite has done. The flag of labour is being hoisted higher and higher on the mast of popular approbation. The day of retribution for those who have done this wrong to the cause of labour is at hand. Many of them will have a difficulty in facing their electors, having regard to the pledges given in days gone by. We shall soon have an opportunity of demonstrating to the people of this country what political policy is best calculated to promote their interests. I do not altogether agree with the remarks of the Prime Minister, in which the honorable gentleman appeared to me to be urging as a favour from the new combination that Senator Pearce should be sent to England.</para>

					<para>It appears to me preposterous to expect the party coming into power under conditions now known to every one to recognise the wisdom of send-. irig the present Minister of Defence to the Conference to be held in London. I believe that from a party political stand-point they might fairly decide that it would not be a proper course for them to indorse. But. apart from that, in view of the fact that there will be so many sore heads when the selections for the new Cabinet are made, and so many members of the party who will not be satisfied, it is hopeless toexpect that the new Government will be in a position to consider the claims of any person outside their own following, no matter how beneficial to the country the appointment of such a person to such a position might be. Speaking of the land tax, the honorable and learned member for Ballarat to-day, in answer to the honorable member for Kennedy, stated that he did not advocate in Brisbane that the States should tax the land, and refuse to advocate it in Toowoomba. In justice to the honorable- and learned member, I might say that I was present at his Brisbane meeting, and distinctly heard him say that he did not favour a Federal land tax. He said that the States should imposeland taxation, but in the event of the States Parliaments failing to do so, hewould then consider whether it would not be necessary for the Federal Parliament to impose such taxation.</para>

					<para>I am satisfied of that, but I wish to be fair. At Brisbanethe honorable and learned member for Ballarat posed as one who had been a land taxer for a quarter of-a century. He said that one of his pet ideals in Victorian politics was .a land tax, and that he had advocated it for years in Victoria. I do not deny that for a moment, but if_ the land tax at present in force in Victoria is the only result of many years of advocacy by the honorable and learned member tor Ballarat, then God help the people who would have to depend upon any land tax which might emanate from him as a Federal Prime Minister. There is no State in the Commonwealth in which the land tax imposed is such an apology and makebelieve as it is in Victoria. Throughout his career the honorable and learned gentleman has been propounding great ideas. He is an idealist before everything, but I defy honorable members to point to one instance in which he has adhered to an ideal, and given it effect in the statute-book of the country. He has been in politics in this country for over a quarter of a century, and during the whole of that time I think he has not been out of office for more than twelve months. If that does not indicate a hankering after the emoluments of office, I do not know what does. I say here, and now, that a progressive land tax is a proposal in connexion with which the honorable member and the party with which he is now associated can never secure the confidence of our people. The honorable gentleman can never hope, with the conservative element in the party which he now leads, to be able to give effect to a land tax which will be of any benefit to the people of Australia. In that lies our security. Honorable members opposite will never agree to an effective progressive land tax, and it is therefore only a matter of time when the people realizing that what the honorable member for Ballarat talks about he does not do will take action to displace him. He says that we cannot hope to defend this continent unless we people it. We cannot expect to hold it, or that Japan, with her teeming millions, will remain quiet very long, unless we take steps to populate the vast empty spaces of Australia. But what is the honorable gentleman's policy for the population of those empty spaces, and for the settlement of people on the best lands of the country, which are now occupied by only a few sheep? It is only a make-believe, in keeping with his professions throughout his career. The honorable gentleman knows, in his heart, that there is only one means of populating this country, and protecting it. He knows that unless we adopt that means speedily, we shall endanger the safety of this continent and this section of the Empire. He knows also that if he had continued his support of the Labour Party, a progressive land tax might have been imposed which would have done all that is desired. If he had done that, he would have proved that he was not a mere talker of platitudes, and preacher of politics, but a man prepared to do effective work in the political arena. The honorable gentleman has been eloquent in referring to the safety of the Empire. His perorations have charmed audiences of thousands during the last few months. He plays on this string from month to month and year to year, and then he attaches himself to a party that cannot give him the only reform by which this country can be populated and saved. If his action is not hypocritical, it is certainly detrimental to the welfare of this country, and the honorable gentleman ought to be branded as one who has been imposing upon the credulity of the people. I yield to no man in my admiration of the Empire. I value the liberties which have been bestowed upon us, and, although they are not all that we may desire, we must judge them by comparison with those which obtain in other countries. There is no country in the world which confers upon its subjects the same amount- of freedom that is enjoyed by those under the British flag. I am anxious to foster the development of Australia by making those monopolists who hold unduly large areas for their own aggrandizement disgorge, with a view to promoting closer settlement. But the honorable member for Ballarat is not willing that that result should be brought about. When he talks about the welfare of the great British Empire, he is simply playing with words.</para>

					<para>If the honorable member desires to bring that state of things about I have no objection to his organization. All I have to say is that the people with whom he is associated are not altogether blind to the composition of the party which occupies the Opposition benches. They are not blind to the difficulties in the way of placing democratic legislation upon the statute-book, and I feel sure that when the time comes they will sympathize with the toilers and the down-trodden, and that as brothers and men they will respond to an appeal to their humanitarian sympathies and will help us to haul down the flag of conservatism. Three years ago the honorable member saw the cloud coming. He realized that sooner or later the free-traders would have to swallow their principles, and accordingly he took time by the forelock, and formed a party of his own. I wish him success, so long as he does not ally himself with the party which is absolutely opposed to the best interests of the people. During this debate the honorable member for Ballarat has not indicated the reason why he has departed from his promise to support the Labour Party, so long as their measures were just and reasonable. Now there is no honorable member who is more able to explain anything, i f it is capable of explanation, than the honorable member himself. Even when he is not able to satisfactorily explain any matter he makes a very good attempt at doing so. But in the present instance his case is so utterly hopeless that he dare not allow his silvertongued oratory to run for five minutes. He has failed to respect the trust committed to him by the people, and he has been unjust both to himself and to his own party. Consequently he occupies the very unenviable position in which we see him to-day.</para>

				<para>Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.</para>
				<para>I feel that it is almost compulsory to make further remarks with regard to the combination or fusion that • we find on the Opposition benches to-day. The honorable member for Ballarat has played very many parts. I do not intend to repeat what has been  said, ably and concisely, in that regard by previous speakers. Sufficient has been said to enable the people of this great Commonwealth to draw their own conclusions from the Hansard report. Any debate which may be indulged in on this occasion is more than warranted by the unprecedented action which was taken on the Address-in-Reply by the honorable gentlemen who are coming into power. In addition to the many political parts he has played, the honorable member for Ballarat has been a great student of other things than polities'. Reincarnation has been, I think, one of his late studies. He has given, I believe, great attention to the possibilities of reincarnation as a factor in developing souls when they are transferred from this sphere to some other one. No stronger proof of that doctrine have I found than that which is furnished by the honorable gentleman. Surely reincarnation has come down to earth, when we find him continuously changing from one position to another, swallowing himself with that avidity which is characteristic of a man of his temperament, and proving beyond doubt that he, at any rate, can be reincarnated from month to month, or from year to year, as the political exigencies may demand.</para>

					<para>Exactly . It is not the honorable member for Ballarat alone who is an example of the doctrine of " reincarnation in our time." On that side of the House we find the process to be absolutely general. I hold in my hand a few remarks which have been uttered during the last few months in connexion with honorable members who constitute the Conservative Party here to-day. I propose to put on record one or two of the absolutely inexplicable utterances which have emanated from those honorable gentlemen who to-day find themselves in opposition to the party which sits on the riebt of the chamber. At Ipswich, on the 27th November, 1906, the honorable member for Parramatta compared the Deakin Party with "a row of fowls out in the rain— feeble, poor, and few." Whether they have gone to roost in his hencoop, or whether he has gone to roost in theirs, I do not know. I suppose that one may conclude thai they are not now in the rain, but in the sunshine of anticipation of the offices which they are to fill.i The honorable member for Parramatta is welcome to the companionship which he has formed. When a man can make an utterance of that kind only a few months ago with regard to the leader whom he now follows, and the party whom he is associated with, and whom he described as a number of fowls out in the rain, it must be an indication to the public as to what parties can come together in this House for a common purpose. Before we come to a verdict on a matter of this kind, we require corroborative evidence, and the more corroborative it is the more damning will be the verdict which must be uttered by the public when they read the reports of our proceedings. Senator Clemons, who has some knowledge O'f the honorable member for Ballarat and political parties in this House, used these words—</para>

				<quote>
					<para>The place Mr- Deakin held in Federal politics was that of a skilful fortune-teller with a shifty utterance. His political aims and decisions were as uncertain as the flight of a butterfly.</para>
				</quote>
				<para>How prophetic was that utterance made by Senator Clemons in Launceston on the 18th July, 1905. Here is a man, who nearly four years ago could see through the honorable gentleman, and describe him in the words I have just quoted. Never has any utterance more truly portrayed the conduct of the honorable member for Ballarat during the recent recess. I now come to the opinions of the honorable member for Ballarat with regard to other persons, and the public will marvel how they could come together after the utterance I am about to •quote. In the Age of the 22nd December, 1905—an d that newspaper always reports the honorable member for Ballarat correctly— h e is reported to have made these remarks—</para>
				<quote>
					<para>Our personal relations do not appear to me to demand more attention than they have already received. After repeated interviews I found him (Mr. Reid) vacuous and insincere.</para>

				<para>I wonder what the honorable member for East Sydney has to say of the honorable member for Ballarat to-day—</para>
				<quote>
					<para>I had been warned that I had to do with an unscrupulous and untrustworthy politician, and I found by bitter experience when Parliament met that I had to meet, as I told him to his face, black treachery as well. His treachery was to the men who at great risk to themselves had placed and kept him in power, against whom he aimed in his proposed dissolution the deadliest blow he could direct against the protectionist policy and party.</para>
				</quote>
				<para>That is the opinion of the honorable member for Ballarat with regard to his attitude after the defeat .of the Reid Administration. Are there any words which could be more damning to the personal or political reputation of any man than the words used on that occasion regarding the honorable member for East Sydney? How true they are to-day! That they have been proved up to the hilt by recent actions in •this chamber must be self-evident to every observing man. To-day the honorable member for East Sydney is practically gagged. He cannot say on this occasionwhat he would like to say. I feel that he dare not allow himself to speak. Otherwise the words uttered by the honorable member for Ballarat on that occasion werenot an indication of his true feelings towards the right honorable gentleman. Then the honorable member for Ballarat, as reported in the Argus of the 13th July, 1905, made use of these words regarding the right honorable member for East Sydney—</para>

Nothing but a great emergency would have induced me to accept it. The one man in Australia responsible for forcing me into his place—whic h I was far from envying and am far from welcoming—wa s Mr. Reid. His breach of faith with our party wasso indefensible that it made an instant severance inevitable. Either the Ministry or the whole of the business of Parliament had to be sacrificed.</para>

					<para>A s I am quoting from passages in which the names of these gentlemen appear, I naturally feel it difficult to follow the rule of debate to which you, sir, are drawing attention, and sometimes forget, that I should speak of them by the names of their constituencies. This is what the right honorable member for East Sydney said of the honorable member for Ballarat a day after the utterances, which I have just quoted, were published—</para>
				</talk.start>
				<quote>
					<para>I consulted him (Mr. Deakin) again on Wednesday, June 21st, three days before his speech at Ballarat, and I could still have sworn that he was as loyal and cordial as ever. I told my colleagues, as it seemed with a fallacious confidence, on the day before the Ballarat speech, that I could tell when a man had any ulterior motives or designs in his mind, and my personal intercourse with Mr. Deakin until the previous Wednesday had convinced me he was the same loyal and generous ally he had always been. That was on the Friday. Then came the Saturday's speech of my friend and ally. If that was the speech of the loyal and. generous ally I had taken him for, then I and all my colleagues acted wrongly and foolishly in doing what we did, and the suicidal mania became feasible.</para>
				</quote>
				<para>I' do not know how these men are going to justify themselves before the public, having regard to their previous attitude to each other. I come now to deal with another member of the Opposition, who has the respect of every man in this chamber, and, I think, of the people outside, the honorable member for North Sydney. It is only recently that he has fallen from grace. In order that I may not do him an injustice, let me quote what he has said about the man with whom he is now associated. This is a report of his remarks on the 14th September, 1905—</para>
				<quote>
					<para>But what of Mr. Deakin? Has he not risen, yet fallen? Risen to office but fallen in repute. Either he must be found guilty of disloyalty to the cause he advocated when he assisted so ardently in the formation of the late Ministry, as well as to Mr. Reid, and to those of his own party who took office in the Ministry with his approval, or he must be ranked as one of those whose political perceptions are becoming so blunted that he cannot weigh the decency, effect, or meaning of his own words and actions.</para>
				</quote>
				<para>In other words, the honorable member for North Sydney excuses the honorable member for Ballarat for his peculiar .position by indicating that he is not responsible for his actions—tha t the only reasonable and charitable view is that the leader of the Opposition cannot weigh the full effects of his words. Yet to-day the honorable member for North Sydney is found sitting in company with the honorable member for Ballarat. and will probably be a member of the Administration that is about to be formed. If ever there was got together a party of insincere men in any Parliament in the world, it is the party which will occupy these benches within the'next week or two. As I say, we have no complaint to make, because it will be our privilege to pillory these men every time we get a chance, until we can get them to appeal to "the country. It is our duty to the people, more than our privilege, to see that no stone is left unturned in order to leave on their reputation the stigma of reproach they have so deservedly earned for inconsistency during the time they have occupied positions on both sides of the chamber. I have shown a few of the beautiful inconsistencies developed by this fusion of parties; and I now have to charge the honorable member for Ballarat, and those associated with him, with absolute insincerity in their desire to populate and protect Australia. I have in my hand a list which shows unmistakably the earth hunger prevailing in this country. It is marvellous to think that with 3,000,000 square miles of territory we are not able to find land for 4,250,000 people in order to enable them to support their families and -benefit the nation.

				<para>In my own electorate, during the last month or two, seven blocks of country, which were part of cancelled improvement leases in New South Wales, and which had been declared unfit for pastoral use by the Minister of Lands, were opened as grazing blocks, and for these there were 700 applicants. The figures are an indication of the earth hunger to-day in New South Wales, and, to some extent, in Victoria and the other States, and represent one of the evils that the present Government are making an honest, sincere, and effective effort to remove. What are members of the Opposition likely to do in this regard? They have already declared that they desire immigration, but to what part of the Commonwealth do they propose to send immigrants? Do they propose to send them to  walks all around Australia ? Is it to those large areas of land that would feed thousands of human families and bring prosperity to the country ? No, they propose to send the immigrants to the Northern Territory— int o the torrid zone. The Government or party which could dream for a moment of importing immigrants, and sending them to the Northern Territory, contemplate one of the most diabolical acts of which any Administration could be guilty. Some honorable members did not take advantage of the opportunity presented of investigating on the spot the conditions and possibilities of the Northern Territory, but I did; and I say without hesitation that those lands will never be occupied excepting by the overflow from more favoured lands in the southern parts of the continent. Men cannot be transferred from cold or cooler continents to the Northern Territory, and induced to live there, unless they have passed a period of acclimatisation in the more southern and favoured parts of the country; and to send immigrants there would be the worst that could possibly be done for the advancement of this great continent and its future safety. There is no doubt that we shall have to take over the Northern Territory for defence purposes; but God forbid that the day is near when we shall attempt to delude immigrants from other countries into settling there, until they have, as I say, passed through a period of acclimatisation. As to opening up land for the applicants I have mentioned—fo r those sons of farmers and others who cannot find a place in which to put their labour to profitable use —w e are absolutely without any hope from any Government that may be formed of honorable members opposite. The honorable member for Ballarat suggests- that this matter should be left to the States, bur be knows as well as I do that to do so would be only a means of evading the question and escaping the responsibility which his position will carry. What can be done in the States, with "the Legislative Councils constituted of landlords, some elected and some nominated? In my judgment, there is not a State in Australia where the Legislative Council would agree to an effective progressive land tax for the benefit of the people; and, therefore, the honorable member for Ballarat is insincere when he puts his proposal forward and professes to be anxious for the safety of this continent from foreign attack. "While he has the landlords of the Opposition corner applying the brake to his political machine, the honorable member for Ballarat has no hope of placing on the statute-book a Commonwealth progressive land tax. I regard the imposition of such a tax as the king-pin of our progress, as likely to be the centre of all prosperity and success. Unless we have areas of land suitable for settlement to offer intending immigrants, we cannot expect, and ought not to attempt to induce, them to come here. The honorable member for Ballarat says that we must trust to the States to pass land tax legislation. What does that mean? Mr. Wade has intimated that he does not intend to do anything of the kind; but let us consider for a moment what would be the position if such a measure were passed by the Legislature of New South Wales. Would it attract population from abroad ? Certainly not. It would simply attract to New South Wales land-seekers'from other parts of the Commonwealth. It would be a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. We should simply transfer people from  one State to another. We should benefit one State by impoverishing all the others in the Union. Such a proposition, therefore, is impracticable, and, that being so, all the professions of the honorable member for Ballarat as to a desire to encourage immigration and, in that way, to secure the safety of the Empire, may be regarded as mere moonshine.</para>

				<para>During this debate, Mr. Speaker, I have not observed any anxiety on the part of honorable members on this side of the Honse to catch your eye. We have had from the other side of the House speech after speech attacking honorable members of the Opposition, and, listening to them. I have been led to speculate as- to how the public are likely to regard these proceedings. Will they not be inclined to ask—"Wher e do we come in?" We were promised that we should have in Federal politics a rarer atmosphere, but I must freely admit that as a member of the Parliament of New South Wales I never saw so much bad taste exhibited in connexion with the displacement of a Ministry as we have witnessed in this House within the last twenty-four hours. We have had a review of the  history of the relations that existed between the Deakin Administration and the Labour Party. We have listened to the honorable member for Hume castigating his former colleague, and we have heard much that in my judgment, will create on the part of the public a feeling of disgust in regard to Federal politics.</para>

					<para>I intend to deal with the fusion. We have been informed that the Labour Party entered into a compact with the Deakin Administration to keep them in office until certain measures were passed, and for a reasonable period after that time. The Attorney-General and the honorable member for Hume have vouched for the truth of that statement. They have said that there was a compact to keep the Labour Ministry in power for a reasonable time, and it is well that that fact should be placed on record, since the Labour Party on the platform and elsewhere, never fail to take to themselves special credit for purity of motive. It will be interesting to the public to learn that the Labour Party, without the knowledge of the electors and behind the backs of their own leagues, entered into a secret compact with the members of the Deakin Party by which the one was to assist the other. I can conceive of nothing more obnoxious in the world of politics. They complain of the tactics of those who are anxious to remove them from office, but such tactics dwindle into insignificance when compared with the secret compact made by the Labour Party behind the backs of their leagues.</para>

					<para>Wha t power have the Labour Party to enter into a compact with another party by which each shall be secured in turn a term of office? I thought that their only concern was to carry into effect the planks of their platform. I make no apology to the Labour Party for the vote which I gave yesterday. According to the newspaper reports, as the result of the coalition we are to revert to the old svstem of representative and responsible government. We are to have in power a Ministry having behind it a majority of the members of this House— a Ministry responsible for its own acts and making no alliance. Every member of the party is to have a personal responsibility—i s to be personally responsible to his electors for his acts in this Parliament. And this is what the Labour Party describe as a return to conservative conditions.</para>

					<para>Labou r members are returned to Parliament as members of a fighting party, and as such they meet in caucus, and the public are absolutely unaware of what is decided in caucus, either as to the life of a Government or otheiwise. The public do not know whether there is a majority of the party, or how great the majority is, in favour, for instance, of supporting the Deakin Administration, or how many are opposed to it. What I am fighting for is to have these, matters decided in this House in the open light of day. We are returned as public representatives, and our decisions should be made public. I am not grumbling at the attitude of the Labour Party, but I am grumbling at their decisions being come to in caucus. Such a "practice is destructive of the principle of representative government.</para>

					<para>If it has, I have not	 been present. I think the Prime Minister took up a very manful position in his replv to the attack made by the leader of the Opposition, and reconciled himself to the inevitable fact that the numbers are against him. But I am not at all attracted by the squealing which has gone on since, or by the amount of secret history that .has been disclosed to the public in our debates. All I can say is that i f Australia can stand 111 members of this Parliament, at ^600 a year each, squabbling like this, with seven or eight Ministers fighting not to go out of office, and seven or eight others fighting to get into office, it is a very fine country. I honestly believe that the citizens of Australia, the men who are not anxious to enter public life, are heartily sick of the conduct of politics. I am only too glad to see some solution arrived at. We have now onlv two parties, and it is easy for a man to choose which he will be with. I have chosen to be with this party. A man has now to be either with the political Labour Party or against it. The members of the Labour Party ought to be only too glad to come over to this side in opposition, in view of the coming elections, for I can understand their being in a stronger position after a few months in opposition than they are to-day, or than they would be i f they continued in power up "to the time of the elections. The honorable member for Ballarat is now the leader of this party. He must have a marvellous genius for commanding his temper, because I cannot understand how any member could take the attacks that have been made upon him so calmly. I do not know whether my nature is different, or whether I am not keen enough at playing the game, but I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that even you, with your long parliamentary experience and judicial nature, could not have sat upon these benches and taken attacks upon you in the way the honorable member for Ballarat has takenthe attacks upon him. It shows either a masterly self-control or a total indifference to the opinions of others. I do not know yet how to put it. It is still a mystery to me. I am used to the rough-andtumble of political life, but if any one said to me half of what has been said to the honorable member for Ballarat, I would not try to meet it even by mental exchanges, but I would ask my opponents if they really meant what they said, and if they did I would take pretty prompt steps to show them what I would do. As an old hand' at parliamentary life I am certain that the public, when they read these severe attacks made by honorable members upon one another, will refuse after a while to believe either side. They will come to the conclusion that it is only part of the game, and that it is impossible for it to be genuine, or else flesh and blood could not stand it. I have beard attacks made, not only upon the political position of the honorable member for Ballarat, but even on his very manhood. I cannot understand how any honorable member can take it so calmly. Perhaps I am taking it too seriously, but if it is only banter, I think that in a serious time like this banter could be very well left on one side. I may be wrong, but my opinion is that the honorable member for Ballarat is to-day the only possible leader of a radical force in Australia outside of the Labour Party. Time after time I have supported his measures, and I have simply now to wait until he brings in his platform. If , as some honorable members predict, he simply waits upon the honorable members in the Opposition corner, and displays Conservative views, I shall not vote for him any longer. I am backing him now on his past experience, and on his avowal of radical principles, and a radical policy. In doing so, I believe I am' correctly interpreting the wishes of my electors. If not, they will have an opportunity very shortly to vote against me. If the fight has to come, it might just as well come now as nine months hence. The Labour Party have fought me for years, and I would much sooner meet them in a fortnight's time than nine months hence. We are really entering upon a new condition of politics in Australia. The Labour Party, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, will appeal to the public to be intrusted with straight-out powers of government. They already hold twentyseven seats, and if they can onlv capture twelve more, they will be the ruling force in Australia. There will then be no danger of the disclosure of secret compacts or negotiations such as we have heard lately. Tbe greatest smudge upon Federal politics has been placed there within the last day or two bv the Attorney-General and the honorable member for Hume, when they stated that arrangements were made to keep certain people in power for a certain time, and that afterwards it was to be turn-and-turn about. For the last few years I have not occupied the' most enviable position in the House. Rightly or wrongly I have gone for what I have believedjfb be the duty of a responsible representative, and I have not gone back on the principles that I was returned to advocate and defend. Honorable members have said that I had to swallow a pill or bolus, but, if I did, I swallowed it four or five years ago, and it is digested now. A lot of other honorable members are only now swallowing their pill, and I hope it will not disagree with them. Although it is apparently the usual custom in this debate to show by quotations that on a certain date an opponent said certain things, and on another date said the opposite, making the quotations with a good deal of vim and vigour, I shall ask the leave of the House simply to quote myself. On the 27th November, 1908, when dealing with the Ministerial statement made by the present Prime Minister, I said—</para>

					<para>But the people were afraid of the Conservatives, and were only too glad to come under the Labour banner, which offered some hope of progress. The only Liberal leader that I can discern in this House is the late Prime Minister. I was not returned to either support or oppose that honorable gentleman; and all I could do was to vote for legislation in which I believed, whether introduced by his or any other party; and I am in that position to-day.</para>
				</quote>
				<para>That last sentence puts my position even to-day. 1 still believe, from my experience of the honorable member for Ballarat, that he is the true leader of the democratic forces of this country. He is the natural leader of the advanced party .in this House. What separated me from him in the past was the fiscal issue. I was with him in all questions of advanced legislation. If I could fall in with the methods of the Labour Party, I should have no hesitation in putting myself at the disposal of the Labour leagues. But I ' oppose their methods to-day, because I consider that they exercise more tyranny than any party that I have a knowledge of. I do not consult any Labour league as to whether I shall support advanced politics. I have views of my own, which I lay before the electors. If they choose to return me to promote those views, well and good. But I will not submit to what the Labour Party call discipline. There is no machine politics in Australia that exercises such tyranny in the name of discipline as that exercised by the Labour Party.</para>

				</talk.start>
				<quote>
					<para>I am simply pointing out that the Labour Party have succeeded because they have readily conformed to the twentieth century idea of politics, and have organized their forces. I wish to See put forward in this Parliament a programme clrawn on liberal and progressive lines. Such a programme will receive my support, regardless of by whom it may be put forward. The late Prime Minister introduced some legislation for which I voted, and I find myself associated with a party, some of the members of which are not prepared to vote fbr measures which I should favour.</para>
				</quote>
				<para>I am still waiting for.the coming of that leader. I am not " buying a pig in a poke,'' but am backing the honorable member for Ballarat on his past performances. If his policy be in the direction of radicalism, no man will be more pleased than I ; and I shall not believe, until it is proved to me, that a man with his record is going to surrender the Liberal principles to which he has always adhered. There are many honorable members who, in the past, have sat on the opposite side to me whom I am pleased to see on this side of the Chamber now. I can assure them that this side required a leaven of radicalism. We have it now. It came to us with a strength of eleven or twelve votes. I do not say that there was no liberal thought on the Opposition side previously. I am not so unjust as to think so. Nor do I say that honorable members have no right to express conservative views. Their views in politics are the concern of their electors. But, nevertheless, I am' glad to see an accession of Liberalism to this side, and trust that, for old association sake, the honorable memUer will take care that the platform of his Government is devised on Liberal lines.</para>

					<para>I think that there are some very strange people amongst his present friends; but that is his business. When the honorable member looks at his last night's speech a week or two hence, I think he will find that it will read something like this: " There is another swindle on, and I am not in i t . " That is how it sounded to me. I hope that I am not doing the honorable member an injustice.</para>

					<para>I did not say so, but that is what the honorable member for Hume probably thinks. I have not. been to the party meetings, but have read what has been going on. As to the new protection proposal, no honorable member is more sympathetic towards it than I am. I am pleased'to see the right honorable member for Swan putting on radical clothes at last. I remember saying, last session, that I did not know how he would get into them; but that is his business. I am also pleased that the Opposition Corner is adopting liberal views, at the instance of the honorable member for Ballarat; and the country ought to be grateful to him for the change that he has brought about. This morning it was said that the honorable member for Ballarat was the " boss intriguer." In my judgment, the honorable member for Parramatta has shown himself to be deserving of that description. He has got the honorable member for Ballarat on to this side. I had thought that it would be impossible for any one to do that. I do not doubt that we are going to have a big struggle in the future. But at the next elections the public will not .fail to be told what. the cause of the trouble is. It amused me to hear some honorable members opposite say that they did not have a chance of discussing the Governor-General's speech. As a matter of fact the speech is little more than a repetition of the platform of the Labour leagues. It is creditable to the Prime Minister that it should be so. Last session I took the opportunity of saying that it was of no use discussing what the Prime Minister then said; that we should have to wait for the Governor-General's, speech to know what his policy was. But, as a matter of fact, the speech was already writtenby the Labour leagues, and if the Prime Minister was the honorable man that I took him to be—as I know that he is—the Governor- General's speech was bound to be a formal statement of the programme of the Labour leagues. If the Prime Minister had not made it such, he might have had a nine months' longer tenure of office, but at the expense of a sacrifice of principle, and his own leagues would have put him out of power at the earliest opportunity. That, in fact, is one of the objections that I have to the Labour Party. I believe in the strong man theory, and I hope the honorable member for Ballarat will prove to be the strong-man on this occasion. I have no complaint to make against those who approve of the drawing up of a political platform by political leagues., but I hold the view that nations are advanced very often not by the action of numbers of individuals, but by the work of strong men who at different periods of their history appear upon the scene and lead them. No one will deny that machine politics exist in Australia to-day. The Australian Political Labour Party is probably as well organized as any political party in the world. If an honorable member like myself is attacked, no one on the same side thinks of coming to his assistance, but let a member of the Political Labour Party, though the humblest in their ranks, be attacked, and the whole party at once comes to his assistance. 1 know that in the constituency I have had the honour to represent for years, I have had to fight them time after time, and they have often brought the whole of their forces into the constituency to oppose me. Let it not be forgotten in this connexion that mine is a labour constituency. It is not a pocket borough, such as I heard referred to to-day. where the influence of certain powerful vested interests are sufficient to secure the return of a candidate. There is no stronger labour constituency in the Commonwealth than that which I represent, and I have had to fight all the forces of the Labour Party to secure my election. Honorable members opposite will not deny that the easy course for me would have been to join their ranks years ago. I have not done so, and there must be some reason for my refusal to do so. In political principle we are not so far removed, but my reason for not joining them is that the members of the Political Labour Partv have not, in my opinion, the personal freedom which they ought to have. I cannot, of course, disclose confidences given to me, and I shall not attempt to do so, but I do make this speculation, that in the ranks of the Political Labour Party to-day there are many members who would like to have the freedom I have.</para>

					<para>I say openly that I left them because they were rather too conservative politically for me, but they now have a radical and liberal leader, and, perhaps, have seen the error of their ways. Throughout this debate my name has been -associated with a certain outside organisation. My association with it has been referred to sometimes in a bantering way, sometimes in terms of ridicule; at other times with severity, or in a sneering way. But I have stood that kind of thing before, and am prepared to do so again. I lhave stood it in this Chamber and on public platforms in Australia. It may be said that on this question I am wrong, or that I have a "rat," but i f I have, it is my own rat.</para>

					<para>If it were i t would probably be in the honorable gentleman's pocket. It has been said that the fusion ihas been brought about by the outside party referred to. I must admit that, at the present time, the platform proposed is very much like that of the outside party, and I am waiting to see whether, in about a fortnight's time, it will not be more like i t . The members of the outside party to which I refer have realized that the political Labour forces of Australia have no right to the title of " Labour." They annexed it. The source of the most powerf u l influence in the political Labour Party to-day is to be found in their title. The most magical word that can be used on any platform in Australia is the word "Labour." The whole stock-in-trade of honorable members opposite is comprised in their title of the " Political Labour Party." I may be wrong, but I am beginning to think that, as a partv, they are more political  than labour to-day. • They are in the habit of indulging in personalities, in reference to the wealth and position of individuals opposed to them, but I am sure that there are many Labour supporters in the country who would be very glad to be as well off as are some of the members of the Political Labour Party. When they claim to be Samaritans and supporters of down-trodden humanity, I should like to see them practice a little of the doctrine they preach. If there is any poverty at all I seem to have my fair share of i t , but I do not travel on that, and do not desire to do so. When honorable members opposite denounce honorable members on this side as the " fat men " of the community who stand behind the vested interests of the  country, I put my own case, and I say that I do not stand behind the vested interests of the country.</para>

					<para>The y are not behind me When I hear honorable members opposite charging honorable members on this side with being well off, and trying to make the public believe that they are mere supporters of wealth, I cannot forget that there are some of themselves who could buy up the worldly possessions of those whom they denounce'. These personalities are most distasteful, but I know there will be a very keen fight at the next election, and that the Political Labour Party will not be too scrupulous as to the means they will employ against those to whom they are opposed. The outside organization to which some honorable members opposite have referred in tones of disgust, is the Orange Party of Australia. Let me say openly that I am a member of it, and I believe I took a fairly active part in the drafting of the platform of that party. They have come forward with a political platform, and are as keen in political warfare to-day as are the Labour leagues of Australia. Candidates who look for their support will get it only upon their platform.</para>

					<para>Th e best friend the honorable member had was Mr. Vale. These are matters which should be stripped of all disguise, and the party to which I refer make no pretence, but come forward boldly as a political party. They have a perfect right to form themselves into a political body, and to adopt the machinery that is best calculated to serve their own interests. The Labour Partv say, " Those who are not with us are against us. Those who will not come with us we will put to the sword." The rank and file of the organization to which I belong—eve n i f they are ill-advised—ar e at least honest in their desire to give effect to their own platform. They have as much right to organize as has the Labour Party. I recognise that at the next election there will be a struggle for supremacy, and I hope we shall win. An attack has been made on the honorable member for Maribyrnong, because he belonged to the Orange order. In my judgment, the time has gone by when an apology for belonging to it was necessary. There are men in the Labour Party itself who only a few years ago were themselves members 'of it. Yet the honorable member for Dalley is frequently used as a chopping-block because of his association with that order. Honorable members opposite say, " Poor devil, he is to be pitied." Now I neither ask for nor require the pity of honorable members. I repeat tliat there are members of the Labour Party to-day who only a few years ago were members of the organization to which I belong. I say further that the Labour Party owes its origin to that very institution. I am sorry that the democratic forces of that institution ever , allowed them to get away from it. With most of the views of the Labour Party I am in agreement, but I differ from its members upon the question of the machinery which it employs. If they are honest in their views they must in the future fight for true Socialism. They must publicly avow themselves as Socialists.</para>

					<para>It is remarkable how sensitive some honorable members are toany observations made by members of the Orange institution. They at once flatly deny the truth of those observations. But no contradiction is heard of statements made by the other side. The members of the Labour Party say, " We do not want sectarianism in politics." Yet they, know perfectly well that I have never advocated the introduction of sectarianism into our political life. A man's religion is his own concern between himself and the Creator. But the Orange institution is a political one. Its members believe that the Labour leagues are working for the dismemberment of the Empire, and that under the guise of Australian nationalism they intend to attack the integrity of the Empire. Consequently they have combined in the open light of day, as they have a perfect right to do. Let any member of the Labour Party announce his candidature for a seat in Parliament in opposition to the candidate selected by the Labour leagues, and see what the result will be.</para>

					<para>Th e Attorney-General endeavoured to make it appear that every honorable member sitting on these benches ought to wear a rosette. I wish that they did. If their political .programme is an advanced one, there is no doubt that the Orange institution will support them. To say that a man was drummed out of that institution because he voted for the honorable member for Corio is not true. The honorable member for Cook knows that. Prior to the last election he was accorded the assistance of the Orange lodge.</para>

					<para>I can only plead as an excuse for my transgression that I was watching some rather slippery customers, and therefore had to keep my eye upon them. I am astonished at the denial of the honorable member for Cook, but,, nevertheless, I must, accept it., The Orange institution has no quarrel with the Labour Party whatever. But when the Attorney-General spoke in the way that he did, he could not have acted in a manner more calculated to excite the resentment of that institution. He taunted it, and practically challenged its opposition. I repeat that the Orange Party has nothing whatever, against the Labour Party. There is nothing to prevent a member of. that party from receiving its support.</para>

					<para>I do not know whether the right honorable member has an absolutely free hand in respect to the Tariff or not, but I do know that the honorable member for Dalley has a perfectly free hand.' The Labour Party in the past have been successful chiefly because there has been no other party in politics which approximated to it from a progressive stand-point. In some States they have been Radicals, and in other States they have been Conservatives. At the next election they will have to meet a federalized party, and the issue will be made very clear indeed. I regret that these two able men in public affairs have been separated by fiscalism.</para>

Let us get the agony over. The labour people in my electorate say that I am dead. If I am dead I want to show them that I am a lively corpse. There is no question that at the general election we shall have a good fight. On his past professions and actions I can accept the honorable member for Ballarat as a liberal leader. ' If he does not bring in a liberal programme my course will be very clear. I can vote against him.</para>

					<para>They _ will follow the honorable member for.Ballarat, and i f he brings down a liberal programme they will support him. In their own interests some years ago, the Labour Partv sank fiscalism. In their ranks are extreme protectionists and extreme free-traders, but they are now growling because the party on this side has followed their example. At the last election I told my constituents that I was absolutely f u l l of the struggle about fiscalism, and that when it came to a question of 30 or 3? per cent., it was of no interest to the workers, and I advocated the idea of new nrotection. My only opposition to old protection was that it took money from the manv for the benefit of the few. If , however, means can be devised for insuring the benefits of protection to the worker and consumer, as well as to the manufacturer, it will have my support. Australia to-dav is protectionist. A free-trader who will come down to a duty of 25 per cent, is not a man worth wasting breath over. What I fought for in my younger days was to remove taxation from the necessaries of life, and to put the burden upon the shoulders of the wealthy. But I found that there was no chance of attaining that object. I am now an advocate of new protection, for I desire to see the benefits conferred by the Tariff shared by workers and consumers as well as by manufacturers. Right through the struggle over the Tariff I voted for the lowest duties on the necessaries of l i f e; but, as regards other articles, I stated openly here that I was in the scramble. It was not then a question of principle, but a mere scramble for duties in favour of certain industries. The only thing I am certain of is that I did not get enough protection for my own electorate. It is all very well for some honorable members to pretend that they are actuated by high principles, but when I found men voting free-trade for other States and protection for their own States I thought it was time for 'me to wake up and vote for what I could get. Four years ago I saw this situation coming. I believe that, in Victoria and New South Wales, there will be no- two members more bitterly attacked than will be the honorable member for Maribyrnong and myself. I welcome the attack, and my honorable friend does not seem to be very sorry about .the matter.</para>

					<para>I do not wish to detain the. House any longer, sir; but as honorable members on this side did not seem to want to attract your-eye, and I had heard many speakers from the • other side, I thought it was only fair that I should rise to express my views, especially as my name had been imported into the discussion. There is no doubt that the execution of the Labour Government is coming off, and it might just as well come off now as a fortnight hence, for the Labour Party have had every opportunity by platform and public utterance to defend their position. I vote for the party on this side, not blindfold, but in the blind as regards their policy. I do not know what it is, but I hope that it is on radical lines. If , however, they allow themselves to be governed by Conservatives, they must not expect my support any longer.</para>

				<para>I do not intend to delay the House many moments. I wish briefly to refer to a remark which was made by the honorable member for Ballarat. He said that he had listened to what I had to say last night, but that he could not find anything which would give a reason for my strong attitude against him, and the course which he has taken. I want to make the position very clear. I had been, at least I supposed I was,, in the confidence and the confidant of the honorable member for some years. Up to within, I think, about ten days—a t any rate up to the day before he approved of the right, honorable member for Swan and Senator Sir Robert Best going to Sydney — I was "with him. I never got the slightest hint that there were negotiations going on behind me. I accepted what the honorable member for Ballarat said to me in the same good faith and confidence a's I had been in the habit of receiving his statements for some years. As I have stated, I was with the honorable member up to that event, and I thought .that I was in his confidence. He told me that nothing would be done by him without first consulting me. That took place within an hour and a half of his announcement to the press that he wras not going to take office in a Ministry, and also the statement that was made the same evening that the right honorable member for Swan and Senator Sir Robert Best were going to Sydney to negotiate as to the formation of a ' Ministry. I was asked by some of my friends to see the honorable member for Ballarat next day. I went into his room, and told him that I had come to ask one question, and that was whether the right honorable member for Swan had gone to Sydney with his concurrence, and whether he himself had pledged his party, as far as he could, to support a Ministry which that right honorable gentleman might form. He told me that he had done so. It was done behind my back, sir, and I told him what I thought of him, and what I will always think of him. That is a pretty plain reason why I feel so hurt at the manner in which I have, been treated.  Although I gave my f u l l heart and my f u l l brain to the honorable member, I found, within a few hours, that he had been working behind me in a way which I have not language to describe. This makes it impossible for me, seeing the close relations which existed between us, to ever believe in him again. I might reasonably have anticipated that he would hate placed confidence in me but when I complained, he said, " I could not tell you about it, because i t was Sir John Forrest's secret." I exclaimed, " I am supposed to be in your confidence, and you have held back what you call Sir John Forrest's secret," to which "his reply was, " I could not give away Sir John Forrest's secret." I think it will be admitted that, throughout my career in both State and Federal politics, I have shown myself 'to be a strong protectionist. I have fought harder for protection than perhaps any one else has done. If I may be allowed to say so, I injured my health in the long Tariff struggle. But in connexion with the fusion —whic h will become confusion—o f parties opposite there is no statement as to what action will be taken to preserve the Tariff. I am not satisfied, and never will be, with the Tariff as it is, because its effectiveness was destroyed, or, at least, seriously injured by the efforts, of the Corner Party. There are many anomalies in it which I shall ask whatever party may be in power to rectify, and a number of duties which should and must be imposed in the interests of Australian industries. Tariff questions will not be allowed to rest. It is all very well for the honorable member for Dalley to say that it does not matter whether the duties that are imposed amount to 20, 25, or 35 per cent, ; it matters a great deal to the people of this country. I rose to clearly explain why my heart has been taken out of me, and my belief in human nature destroyed, by the action of the honorable member for Ballarat. In yesterday's Melbourne Herald I read a statement made by a prospective colleague of. his, or, at any rate, by one who will get  something from him—the right honorable member for East Sydney—whic h astounded me, and which I wish to have recorded in Hansard. It is as follows—</para>
			</talk.start>
			<quote>
				<para>The comments of the Herald on the terms of the fusion show that there has been a misconception as to the clause relating to the Tariff, said Mr. G. H. Reid to-day.</para>
				<para>"The clause referred to, as published this , morning in the Age," continued Mr. Reid, " is • no interference with the protectionist policy of the present Customs Tariff, unless to rectify anomalies. Before the fusion, the free-traders in the direct Opposition requested Mr. Joseph Cook to make our position under the clause perfectly clear to Mr. Deakin. • We pointed out that i f an alteration in the Tariff was proposed which raised the fiscal issue as between free-traders and protectionists, that we free-traders held our- •selves perfectly free to vote according to our convictions. To make assurance 'doubly sure, when the united party met, I . then defined our position again before the whole of the members of the new party. I pointed out to them that it would be most undesirable to leave any room for future recriminations as to the observance or non-observance of the basis of fusion. I told them that it must be understood distinctly that in becoming members of the new party weTiave agreed to a fiscal truce, and i f the Tariff 'question is re-opened to rectify any alleged anomalies, we have reserved our right to vote in accordance with our own convictions and those of our constituents."</para>
			</quote>
			<para>What does that mean, but that there is to be an absolute giving away of the protectionist position, and the hauling down of the protectionist flag? It is asserted not only" that no fiscal question is to be raised which may bring free-traders and protectionists into conflict, but that even when the rectification of anomalies is proposed, the free-traders will assert their right to fight against, and, if necessary, prevent it. The paragraph finishes with this sentence—</para>
			<quote>
				<para>The fiscal truce is not to last only during the present Parliament, but during the next one.</para>
			</quote>

				<para>I shall not detain honorable members more than a few moments. But in justice to mv late colleague and myself, one or two simple facts must be added to his statement. What he said about calling on me on the afternoon when the right honorable member for Swan left for New South Wales is perfectly true, and so is his statement that I did not inform him of the departure. It was particularly desired bv the right honorable member for Swan that he should arrive in Sydney and have an opportunity to see the then leader of the Opposition before the fact that he had left for the purpose was announced in Melbourne. He requested me not to mention the circumstances to any one, and I agreed not to do so. On the following day, I should have informed the honorable member for Hume of the fact that the right honorable member for Slwan had gone to Sydney, and of all the circumstances connected- with his visit there. The honorable member is. again correct when he says that he protested very strongly —vehemently—agains t the proposal that there should be a coalition Government of this character. But when the honorable member left me, so far as I am concerned, he appeared to be content with my own position, since I did not propose to become a member of the Ministry. .</para>

					<para>Th e honorable member went on to say that he took care that the copies were not burnt. He also said I had kept back from my colleagues the fact that a Bill was being prepared, and that he only heard of the existence of the Bill from the authorities of the Bank of England when he was in London. I desire to say that a Banking Bill had been considered by my predecessor, Sir George Turner, and also by myself, when I was Treasurer; that a Bill was drafted by the Treasury officials under my direction; that I consulted the Bank of England in, London and other bankers here; that the Bill was not settled for submission to the Cabinet when I left office; that the Bill so far as I. had got with it, all the papers connected with it, and also Sir George Turner's notes, were all left in the Treasury when I left office; that. I never gave any instructions to any officer to burn them, or any other public document, in my life. </para>

				<para>Whe n the debate has reached a stage at which personal explanations and recriminations are called forth, it is about time that it was ended; and I do not propose to contribute very much to its length. During the earlier part of the discussion I heard from my side of the House some attempts at congratulating honorable members opposite, though it is true there was a certain strain of irony about the congratulations. However that may be, I do not propose to follow' the example then set, because from the attitude which honorable members opposite adopt, and more particularly from the looks they present, I should say they have hardly settled down to the new order . of affairs, or reached the stage at which congratulations are acceptable. But I feel disposed to offer a word of congratulation to the honorable member who is about to quit the position of Prime Minister—the leader of the party with which I ha.ve been associated ever since • I entered into Commonwealth politics. The people now learn that within the ranks of labour, are to be found gentlemen as capable of discharging the highest functions of administration as any who could be found outside the party, and that the destinies of the Commonwealth are just as safe in their hands as they could possibly be in the hands of others.</para>

					<para>Quit e so the- marriage tie is just as safe in the hands of the present Government as it could possibly be in the hands of their critics, who have endeavoured to make use ' of this cry about the marriage tie as a means of besmirching and defaming men who are very much better than themselves in this respect. I am glad that an opportunity has been given to the honorable member for Wide Bay, and those associated with him, to disclose what they are able to do ' as administrators; and' every unbiased man will admit that they have done much to place the public departments on a more stable footing than that on which they found them. Their critics, i f they are prepared to give credit where credit is due, must accord that meed of praise to them. I do not wish to lay any special blame on the late Postmaster-General, but the Post and Telegraph Department had drifted into a condition that was making it a by-word amongst the people; and the present Postmaster- General has had to adopt some veryunpopular methods to bring about a better state of affairs. He has not been afraid to do so; and I hope that those who succeed him will carry on the good work he has initiated, and, in a short time, remove any cause there may be for the complaints and abuse which have been hurled at the Department. Similar observations may be made as to the Defence Department. We have had no proper scheme of defence, and though we have been talking about a citizen soldiery, the forces have never been placed on a practical or satisfactory basis. Apparently the Administration has not had that sympathetic aid it deserves; but the present Minister has made a move in what I think will be regarded as the right direction. Then as to the White Australia legislation, the Fisher Government have signalized themselves by the extent to which they have unearthed and brought to light the various methods by which undesirable immigrants,  and also, it may be said, opium, were being introduced. For their work in this connexion the Government have placed the Commonwealth under a debt of gratitude. In regard to the introduction of Asiatic labour, honorable members must adopt two alternatives as an explanation of the work done by the Government, The first is that, when the Chinese learnt that a Labour Government was in control, they thought it a good opportunity to send undesirable immigrants and also opium to Australia. If' that explanation lie not accepted, then the alternative is that the traffic in undesirable labour and opium had been going on more or less largely all the while, and it required a Labour Government to find it out and put a stop to it. Whatever may be the explanation, I think that every believer in the policy of a White Australia—ever y one desiring to see Australia thickly peopled with white races holding ideals and sympathies akin to his own—wil l concede that the Government has done good work in both these particulars. I wish to congratulate the Prime Minister on the substantial work he has done in the administration of his Department, and in initiating matters of policy. In the few weeks of the session that remained at his disposal, he lifted the Capital Site question from the ruck into which it had fallen, and remained for years, and enabled it to be satisfactorily dealt with. I trust that those who succeed the present Administration will continue his good work, and carry it to completion. Then, again, the great iron industry received substantial assistance at his hands by the passing of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, and I trust that "oefore long Australia will be able to produce high class manufactures of metal from her crude ores. Still' another good work done by the present Government was that of giving to the public servants of the Commonwealth the common rights of citizenship enjoyed by the rest of the community— right s that had hitherto been denied them. The Prime Minister showed by his action that he had the courage to strike *out on new lines. I am sure that the public servants of the Commonwealth are men of intelligence and capacity, and that they will so use their newly acquired privileges that the incoming Government will not dare to attempt to take them from them. In- ' deed I feel sure, that the States will be compelled to follow in our wake, and that the public servants of the States will soon enjoy these larger measures of citizenship, and use them to the genera] welLbeing of Australia. In these directions the Government have done good work, which, as a member of the Labour Party,'I can heartily commend. Then,* again, they met the Parliament with a .policy that is a distinct advance upon and a departure from the policies hitherto submitted. There may be a difference of opinion as to whether it is in the best interests of the Commonwealth, but I am sure those who have considered it for themselves are satisfied that it is not merelv new, but distinctly Australian, and fitted to meet the requirements of an Australian community. The incoming Ministry will have to follow closely in the steps of the present Administration." It is significant that those who are opposed to the Government have not dared to attempt to displace them by questioning any of their acts of administration, or the policy which they have submitted to the country. They have adopted other methods knowing full well that for the time being,- at all events, the Labour Government have behind them a large volume of public opinion. They dare not run counter to that opinion, but 'they hope soon to win it back, and to make their footing more secure. I am not here for the special purpose of keeping any particular party in power, but I certainly recognise the importance of effective administration. I want to see good liberal reforms provided for in Commonwealth enactments— reforms which the Commonwealth urgently needs—an d I desire to see such measures effectively administered. If, as the result of the fusion of parties, that has taken place, a large section pf the Opposition have been converted from their life-long adherence to Conservative principles, and brought so far under the banner of Liberalism as to be ready to carry out these reforms, I for one shall not complain. I shall certainly do my best to bring about that result; but I question very much whether that is the object lying behind the movement. I am fearful that it is intended not to bring about liberal reforms, not to secure the passing of legislation thatwill benefit the whole community, and will not bend to special interests and privileges, but to keep up those special privileges, and to ibend the powers of legislation and of administration, as they have been bent in the past. For that reason, I sincerely regret that the Fisher Administration is to give place to a Ministry representing the fusion Of parties. However, by their acts. they must be judged, and I shall await .with interest a statement of the work they propose to do. I see before me a combination of parties and interests that hitherto have been vitally antagonistic. We have before us the extreme Coaservatives on the free-trade side sitting with the'Liberal or "good as a Labour man." We have, too, the extreme Conservative on the protectionist side sitting with the Liberal or " good as a Labour man." Then, again, we have still another party consisting of honorable members who, so far as I am aware, have never professed any sympathy with democratic aspirations or legislation. That party held the balance of power, when th'e Tariff was under consideration, and exercised it in the interesta of the wealthy section of the communitv. Whenever they were called upon to vote for an item which meant high protection, and at the same time would yield much revenue, they voted with the protectionists to carry it into law. On the pther hand, i f , by voting with the free-trade section, they could secure the passing of a large revenue producing item, and defeat the protectionists, they were quite prepared to do so. The result is that the present Tariff is one of the highest revenue producing Tariffs, and, therefore, is incompatible with any degree of protection or free-trade. Those who so devised it took good care that the burdens of its revenue-producing items were placed, not upon the shoulders of the particular section of the community that they represented, not upon the shoulders of those best able to bear taxation, but upon the shoulders of the starving men and women, the workers of the Commonwealth. I fear that that policy will be repeated- in connexion with this fusion, and that, instead of getting liberal reforms, as some honorable members on the other side hope, from the present combination, they will find themselves, as in the case of -the Tariff, the tools of that extremely conservative Opposition Corner; who are out to look after the interests of their own particular section, of' the community, as no doubt they are entitled to do. If they can use the democrats on that side of the House to further their interests, so much the worse for those democrats. I am very glad that we have reached a stage which I regard as an epoch-making one in the history of the Commonwealth and of Commonwealthpolitics. Our lines are now' diverging. In the division which was recently taken, and in the divisions to be taken, there will be found on the one side of the House those who are pledged up to the hilt to the democracy of Australia, those who have in their life-work outside and inside the House done something substantial for the democracy, and- on the other will be found from this time forward those who are opposed to generally beneficial reforms, and strive by legislation and administration to further the interests of the specially wealthy classes of the community. We have reached a position where we can have a straight-out fight, and the electors will not in the future, as in the past, be hoodwinked by side issues such as free-trade and protection, or the claims of candidates to be "as-good-as-. Labour-men." There will be the two issues presented to them of radical democracy and old-time Conservatism, and they will' be able to make, their choice. If they are wise in their day and generation they will not spend forty years wandering in the wilderness of inconclusive and. unsatisfactory legislation and administration, but will strike straight out for the land of promise. The sooner they make up their minds to attain that object, the sooner they will get there, and the democrats on this side of the House will do their level best to get them there, and keep them there. I wish to commend the Prime Minister, who is about to retire from office, for the good work he has done,-not only in the administration of the functions of government, but in keeping the party free in years gone by from any alliance, combination, or fusion that would submerge its identity, and prevent it from being the live fighting factor that it has been. In the years to come there will not be so much danger on that score as there was in years gone bv. We have heard recently about the negotiations that took place here for an alliance or combination of the Labour Party with others, and1 the House' probably realizes that that attempt, about which there has been so much bitter contention to-day, was not the first of its kind. There had been previous moves in that direction, and it took sturdy, strong men in the Labour movement to keep it free from those entanglements. It has been kept free, and to-day it goes forward on a mew line of progress. I think that in bringing that about those who have been engaged in this great struggle have realized the expectations of those who sent them here. We have now, as we had beifore, two parties in the House, but before we had them so confused by other issues that the electors were unable to distinguish them. To-day the electors can distinguish them. Thev find that under fhe compelling force of the growing labour movement those'whose opinions yesterday seemed to be as far apart as the poles, and who have called each other hard and bitter names, are to-day ranged under onebanner and under one leader. That banner is antilabour, and that leader is against the labour movement, however much he may deny it.</para>

He was prepared to enter into an alliance that provided that " the free-trade members of the Labour Party shall have perfect freedom of action to vote for or against any proposed reduction or increase of duty." The honorable member for Hume now objects to the' position taken up by the right honorable .member for East Sydney. He claims that protection is in imminent danger at a time when the highest Tariff that.has ever been placed upon the statute-book of Australia is the law of the land, and yet, long before this Tariff was even inaugurated, he was prepared to ally himself with the free-traders in 'the Labour Party, and to give them freedom to vote just as they liked upon any items submitted, in order that he might get into office.</para>

					<para>I know that the Prime Minister voted against us nine times out of ten on the first Tariff. I know also that the first Tariff was rendered largely inoperative from my point of view owing to free-trade reductions. 'At that time, the new protection was not on the platform of the Labour Party. They adopted it after they were forced by shees weight of public opinion, and when they began to recognise the importance of the fiscal question. But no one can deny that it was absolutely essential to establish protective duties of Customs before the principle of new protection could be applied.</para>

					<para>I know nothing about Mr. Walpole. The honorable member seems to know a good deal about him. My point is that the honorable member for Hume cannot logically or consistently find fault with a party such as this, on the lines on which it is organized, in view of the fact that he was prepared to» receive free-traders into his party, and to give them an absolutely free hand on the Tariff, although he knew that at that time Tariff reform was absolutely essential, whatever may be the position at the present time. Now I come to another point.</para>

					<para>During the time when the first Tariff was being introduced. That resolution laid down the principle that before Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts which are the instruments of what is known as the new protection—can be applied, the old protection must be secure. That resolution, as I 'say, was signed by Tepresentatives of the Trades Hall Council and of the Protectionist Association. I repeat that the phrase was coined in my office, it was advocated by the Age, and worked out as a practical scheme, long before my honorable friend dreamt of entering the political arena or took a part in political. matters.</para>

					<para>The country will have a chance in good time. If my honorable friend consulted the best interests of the country rather than what he considers to be the chance of snatching a party victory, he would not advocate a dissolution t the present time. 1 notice that the Prime Minister, on two occasions, has repeated, and that two leading members opposite have :said, that a dissolution should come now. A dissolution of this Parliament should. come when the busines of this Parliament is completed. It would be unjustifiable to cause the exoeme of an election -in two succeeding years. It would be unwarranted to appeal to the country when there is in this Parliament a party which is prepared to carry on the business, of the country. Not that I 6tear. a dissolution. but I say that the conduct of the business which this Parliament has to do is more important than a dissolution. I am sorry that the honorable member for Hume is not present. because I wish now to allude to a statement he made in reference to an attempted alliance or coalition between the Labour Party and a section of the late Deakin Government.</para>

					<para>Unfortunately, statements made in excited, moments are used on the public platform, falsified, exaggerated, and turned and twisted, very often in such a way as to appear to be exactly he opposite to what they are. The facts are that when the Post Office crisis arose there was at the back of it some of the very worst forces of Australia. That crisis was brought about because I determined that a public utility should not be made use of for gambling or immoral purposes.</para>

					<para>That is another of the honorable member's innuendoes. I never brought forward •a Telegraph Bill, and never dropped one. The honorable member is always making innuendoes carrying inferences which he knows to be untrue. I repeat that I know nothing whatever about a Telegraph Bills and never dropped one. I am prepared to admit that the honorable member for Yarra backed up my action; but I do say that my attempts to keep that public utility free from the operations of those engaged in gambling and immoral practices led to my being treated in a way that was simply brutish, and almost unbearable, and that the Post Office crisis was largely brought about through my action in regard to those particular matters.</para>

					<para>Some of the most bitter opposition came from the man who was responsible for the crisis. I say that advisedly, and am prepared' to prove it. At that time the then Prime Minister said that the state of his health, and other circumstances, demanded that he should retire, and he handed over to Sir William Lyne authorit' to attethpt to effect an ailiance between the Labour Party and the then. Liberal Party. If there is now an alliance which my honorable friends opposite do not like, and which they believe will retard progress—though I do not think it will, for a moment—they and they alone are responsible for .it, because of their isolation, their selfishness, and their machine- Politics.</para>

					<para>The honorable membei .ought to know, that the present political labour machine came into force about the .time when the honorable member for Bourke was asked to sign the labour pledge, and when the honorable member for Richmond, in the State Parliament, refused to sign the labour pledge. He must know that that is what separated the honorable member for Richmond from the Labour Party 'in Victoria. I was allied with the Labour Party, just as the honorable member for Parramatta was, at a time when there was no pledge. I was not pledged to the party, but I received their support, and should be receiving their support to-day if thei were anything like loyal to. people who made Some sacrifices for them. I never signed any pledge.</para>

					<para>I did; but I never signed the labour pledge. I never signed any pledge that I would not stand again if I was not selected. That is the matter with which I quarrel. As the honorable member for Ballarat stated at the Town Hall the other night, we have no objection to selection bl the party. Every party must make selections. Every party must decide what candidates it will support; but outside the Political Labour Party no party calling itself a democratic party says "You must first come to us. We have the right to decide whether you shall go to the constituency." The honorable member for Yarra knows that he cannot stand for a constituency until he is selected. Until he is selected, no member of the Labour Parry can go to the electors.</para>

				<para>During his speech this afternoon the honorable member for Dailey referred to my connexion with an Orange lodge. I wish therefore to make one or two remarks in the calmest possible way, and without the introduction of the slightest feeling. Prior to the last election I was for some ten or twelve years a member of an Orange lodge. I joined that organization in my teens, when it was a religious, and not a political, body. When I was selected as a labour candidate prior to the Federal elections I was invited by the Orange lodges in my constituency to submit my name to them for selection. I refused to do SO. They selected the chairman of the Importers' Association of Sydney, Mr. Hindle. He was. my opponent, and they placed upon him the official seal of the organization. The honorable member for Dailey stated that I sought the support of the Orange lodges.</para>

					<para>I did not. I do not charge the honorable member with having made a statement which he knows. to be untrue, but I do say that he has either been misinformed or has misunderstood his informant. At the opening meeting of my campaign, in. the Nèwtown' Town Hall, I was asked whether I would accept support from Orangemen., and I replied that I would accept support from any persons who chose to extend it to me upon the labour platform, irrespective of whether they were Orangemen or Roman Catholics. I wish to tell the honorable member for Dailey that I am prepared to deposit £5 with any honorable member whom he may choose to nominate, conditionally that he lodges a similar amount; and if it can be shown that I solicited support from any Orange organization. after my announcement or selection as a Federal labour candidate, I am prepared to forfeit the money to any hospital in New South Wales, the honorable member to do likewise if proved wrong. I regret to say that, although there were ministers of the Gospel who entered Orange lodges, knelt down, and placed their hands upon, the open Bible, and declared that they would not see a brother misrepresented, those very ministers subsequently went round my electorate misrepresenting me. Not only that, but members of the Orange institution have endeavoured to induce those of an opposite persuasion not to record their votes in my favour on the ground that I belonged to the same institution as themselves. I know that [ have received votes from democratic Orangemen as well as from other democratic parties. No organization could prevent some men from voting for labour candidates. It is that fact 1which largely influenced the Orange organization in its recent determination to make a show for democracy as against the hide-bound conservatism which it had previously supported. I hope that the institution will support democratic principles, although 1 beg leave to doubt it. The honorable member for Dailey also referred to the alleged tyranny of the Labour League. I desire to mention a little bit of tyranny on the part of some of the Orange lodges. During the State elections which followed the Federal elections the then Premier. of New South Wales, Sir J. H. Carruthers, introduced the Tariff issue. In my electorate his candidate running for the Camperdown State seat had a placard abopt io feet by io feet showing a large loaf and a little loaf, and calling upon the electors in that part of my constituency to vote against the Labour candidate because of some alleged sins I had committed fedei-allv in connexion with the Tariff. I received letters from the Labour leagues, and also frcim the candidate, asking me if I was going to cowardly stand by and see him maligned on account of votes I had given in the Federal Parliament, and I replied " No." I went from this House to place m,yself alongside that man on the platform, and the result was that we administered an overwhelming defeat to those opposed to our party. It happened that in this State election the gentleman who was selected as the anti-Labour candidate, Mr. Cleggi, had opposed me most bitterly at the Federal election. He was, and is, a member of the Orange lodge, and was the selected Orange candidate in the State fight for the Camperdown seat, when I took the platform for the Labour candidate. I did not inquire what denomination the latter be-, longed to. All I wanted to know was that he held the same political faith as I did. I left him to profess his religion at whatever shrine he thought best, as a matter concerning his own conscience only. When that State election was finished the Orange lodge in Camperdown laid a charge against me of having spoken against the selected representative of the Orange institution While I was sitting in this Chamber I received letters stating that a charge had been laid against me, and calling-upon me to attend to answer it. I replied, stating that I could not leave my place in Parliament to attend a committee meeting of the Orange lodge. They wanted me to attend on a Thursday night. That would have meant losing a whole week. I asked the lodge if they would fix the meeting fol Saturday night. They refused to accede to my request. In my absence they heard the charge against me, and found that I had spoken at Camperdown in Support of a Labour candidate against a selected Orange candidate, and I was forthwith expelled from the Orange institution. I have the whole of the correspondence, and, if necessary, can produce it. The honorable member for DaIley spoke of the tyranny of Labour leagues. If any one asks me whether I am prepared to accept that kind of tyranny and indorse it—I do not care whether it is known by the name of religion or not—I cannot indorse it. It is a monstrous thing that an attempt should be made in this free country to prevent a representative of the people in the National Parliament from defending his actions, his policy, and his party on the public platform. I, for one, will not tolerate it from any section of the community whatever.</para>

					<para>If there is anything omitted or forgotten I would be glad if the honorable member would remind me by interjection or speech. The hor1orable member spoke with me on the subject, as also did several of the high officials in the Grand 'Lodge. They asked me if I would submit an appeal to the Grand Lodge against the decision of the branch lodge. The honorable iiember said he thought that if I liked to appeal I would be reinstated.</para>

					<para>Exactly. Some leading members of the Orange institution said the same thing, and invited me to appeal, and I replied that I would not appeal, as I did not want to belong to them any longer. Since my election to a representative position I have acknowledged neither one party nor the other. I was elected on the Labour platform, and it is my political duty to give effect to it. I know no creeds either on one side or the other. J claim for myself the right to worship where I choose, and I am prepared to allowthat liberty to any one who holds different views. I feel no bitterness towards any man because he does not belong to the same church as I do, and I hope that he cherishes no such feeling against me.</para>

					<para>It is not what one is asked to do, but what is actually done. From the honorable member's statement it might have appeared that 1 wished to introduce the question of one man's religion against another man's into the Labour movement. That I have always refused to do. I do not seek support on any other than political or ethical grounds. If a man is suffering in any way he should have a remedy, and should not be pitted against another man because of his religion.</para>

					<para>I know that the Chairman of the Importers' Association of New South Wales was selected on behalf of the Reid-Cook Party as a candidate against me. I also know that he had the official indorsement of the Orange insXitution, and that he is not regarded as a Democrat. I -know that he sought support from working men, and I know that working men in my constituency were asked, to vote against Labour proposals, against the nationalization of monopolies and other things- which if nationalized would confer a benefit upon them—not on the ground that the nationalization of monopolies was a good thing or a bad thing, but on the ground that one man vent to one church and another man went to another church. I have refused to associate these questions with the remedies for the troubles tinder which working men are suffering. I intend to continue to pursue that course. Unfounded statements have been made as to church influences, sporting influences, gambling influences, and vested interests of various kinds. I forgone will withstand any influence of this description, whether it comes from one section or from another. I am endeavouring to do justice to the masses, no matter what side they belong to, and to do my best to give effect to the policy I was sent here to carry out--to place the Labour platform on the statute-book of Australia.</para>

				<para>It was not my intention to speak in this debate; in fact, I understood when we met this morning that in all probability we would adjourn in about five minutes, but I desire to reply to some remarks made by the honorable member for Maribyrnong, criticising the method of selection by a party which he says he has never belonged to. Apparently, persons who are outside an organization profess to know more about it than those who are inside it. Any person in the community can join the Labour organization, and after the expiration of three months in some States and of a longer period in other States—it is just according to the rules of the various States—he can vote in the selection of all candidates. That is the method of selection in our party. Now, what is the method of selection in the party led by the leader of the Opposition? Let me go back to the last election, when there was a selection for the neighbouring constituency of Batman, and its present representative decided to stand for election. A deputation from the first meeting came up and waited upon the honorable member for Bourke in his room, and were told that the candidate, Mr. Coon, would have to sign a pledge that he would stand down if he was not selected by them—an organization of two or three persons.</para>

					<para>Honorable members of the Liberal Party also require its candidates to submit themselves for selection. The honorable member for Batman knows this to be correct. I saw him walking up and down outside this building while his committee were inside deliberating as to his selection, and the honorable member for Bourke said on that occasion, "We do not know yet. Mr. Higgins is a member of our party, and you will not be allowed to oppose him." The deputation from the honorable member was told that he could not even submit himself as a. Liberal candidate for selection unless Mr. Higgins was made a Justice of the High Court, it being the wish of the Ministry of the day that Mr. Higgins should not be opposed. The honorable member for Batman had to sign a promise that he would not stand for the position, in order to become eligible for selection by the committee.</para>

					<para>The honorable member for Batman will not den that he signed a labour pledge. I know that he did so on more than one occasion. He ran for a seat in the Collingwood Council without being selected to represent labour, and did not get in but when he put up next time, as a pledged labour man, lie got in. He signed to run as a labour candidate for Batman, but, at that time,.the Labour Party did not take the action which the honorable member thought it should take. I should not have risen, however, had it not been for the statements of the honorable member for Maribyrnong regarding the new protection. Incidentally I have shown that these ''pure merinoes," who say that they will not have anything to do with selection as it is practised by the. Labour organization, compel the candidates of their party to submit themselves for selection by committees not one-tenth as large as those of the Labour Party.</para>

The honorable member for Maribyrnong said that these things happened before I came to Australia, forgetting, or perhaps not knowing, that I was born here.

					<para>So do I; but the honorable member does not believe that he has. Can they remain true to their pledges and sit- side by side, banded together solely to turn the Labour Party out of office? Those who framed the Labour organization did better work than they anticinated when they decided that written pledges should be required from candidates on the platform which they shquld support if they were elected, and that meetings of the party should decide what action should be taken by it on any plank of the platform. The honorable member for Maribyrnong was elected as a protectionist, and so was the honorable member for Grampians. Both were chosen by the same newspaper.</para>

					<para>The honorable member was on the ticket of a newspaper as a protectionist, and so was the honorable member for Grampians; but I was not, as I was supposed to be weak on the question of protection, though I leave it to the honorable member for Bourke to say who gave more votes for protection when the Tariff was under consideration, the honorable member for Grampians 0r myself. There is some doubt as to who invented the phrase "new protection," but the honorable member for Maribyrnong claims that his party originated the ideas which it covers. If so, why did they take no steps to give effect to them, action being first taken in that direction by Senator Pearce?</para>

I remember that when the honorable member for Maranoa asked either the honorable member for Ballarat, as Prime Minister, or the honorable member for Hume, as Minister of Customs, whether there would be introduced Excise provisions so far as the workers were concerned, the honorable member for Bourke exclaimed, "What, make our people here pay and allow the importers to go scot free?

When 'the honorable member for Maribyrnong was speaking, about what I do not remember, just now, I interjected, " Like you did the Telegraph Bill." The honorable mem-  'her for Ballarat will remember that a Bill was introduced making some alteration in le telegraph rates, and that at that time 'the use of telephones for betting purposes 'had been prohibited—a course to which I -do not object. But when some of us expressed a desire to have a provision in the Bill then before the House, prohibiting the -use of telegraphs for iThe same purpose, the 'Government dropped the Bill, and it has not been heard of from that day to this.

					<para>Yes, to resign straight away. I was never asked to sign the platform, and I never announced myself as a Labour candidate for the council. If the honorable member can produce any document showing that I was a Labour candidate, I shall take the step I have stated. What does the honorable gentleman desire to infer? The very gentleman, Mr. Edward Lewis, who waited on the Government, in regard to my selection, is now a representative at the Trades Hall. He attended as a delegate at the conference, and came to the Minister asking for support, heading the deputation; and he is the president of the league. Is that the gentleman who gave the Minister the information that I was asked to sign the platform?</para>

					<para>.—I have stated what the Prime Minister said in October. When I asked the Prime Minister in this House, to declare the policy of the Government on the scal question, he said he would do so at the proper time. The proper time was at Gympie; but what he said there was that, rightly or wrongly, the Federal Parliament had declared for protection, and that, so far as his Ministry were concerned, they had not declared for protection at all. Why should I sit behind a Ministry composed of fiscal atheists? I was not sent here fox that purpose.</para>

					<para>No, I am sitting behind the honorable member for Ballarat, whom the honorable member for Darwin has described as the natural Prime Minister of Australia. I am asked to support a Ministry, the members of which might do as they pleased with the Tariff, as evidenced by the fact that the honorable member for Cook took twenty-four hours to make up. his mind whether he should vote for a certain duty, and finally voted for its reduction. The Attorney-General during this. debate has made an attack upon the present leader of the Opposition. Only a few weeks ago I heard the honorable member deliver at Randwick a speech, in which he declared that between the Deakin party and his own there was everything in common. To-day we are told that they have nothing in common, and, according to the honorable member, there is nothing too bad t be said of the leader of the Opposition. Why this sudden change? Speaking at Randwick the Attorney-General declared that the honorable member for Ballarat, and his party would not go back on the Labour Ministry ;- but on the very night that he made that statement a member of the Deakin party had thirteen Labour candidates nominated in opposition to him. Is it reasonable to expect an honorable member in such circumstances to stand by the party? I am expected to be loyal t0 the present Government, but I am loyal to. my constituents, and to them alone. I am here to assist in passing legislation that I believe will be in the best interests of the people. Is it reasonable that I should be asked to support a Ministry composed of free-traders such as the Attorney-General, the Minister of Home Affairs, the Postmaster-General, the Minister of Defence, and also the Minister of External Affairs? Honorable members may smile when I refer in this way to the Minister of External Affairs, but I venture to say that art examination of the records will show that when the Tariff was before us he voted forfree- trade more often than he voted for protection. Did not the honorary Minister charge his own party with having changed a protectionist Tariff, as introduced by the Deakin Ministry, into a revenue Tariff?' That being so, what does he now propose to do? The Prime Minister has said nothing as to the intentions of the Government regarding the fiscal question. He has. not fulfilled his promise to make a statement in that regard, and I should like him now to say whether the Ministry have decided to adopt a protectionist or a freetrade policy. I am here to support the policy of protection.</para>

					<para>I think that I shall have .a far better chance of doing so behind a protectionist leader than I should have, if I sat behind a fiscal atheist. That being so, I make no apology for the vote I gave yesterday. It was in accordance with my pledges, and I do not doubt that the future of Australia will be perfectly safe if intrusted to the honorable member who I believe in the very near future will occupy the position of Prime Minister.</para>

				<para>I wish to make a personal explanation. The right honorable member for Swan a few minutes ago introduced the name of the Under-Secretary to the Treasury, in his effort to refute an assertion I had made re-. carding the burning of some copies of a Banking Bill. I have visited the Treasury and have seen the Under-Secretary, who ays that he is not certain whether the right honorable nember on the occasion referred to gave an instruction that the docu- .ments should be CC burnt," but that an instruction was certainly given to suppress them. He remembers that I directed that they should not be destroyed, but that one or two copies should be sent to me. There is a memorandum on the file that one copy, if not two, should be forwarded to me. The Under-Secretary to the Treasury suggested to me, he says, that the documents should not be destroyed, and he put them together and deposited them in the strong room, where they have since remained. He supports my statement, in so far as he says that- the documents were to be suppressed. T. said that I was present when I heard the instruction given that they should be burnt, but the Under-Secretary is not prepared to say whether, the word "burnt" was actually used, although he knows that they were to be suppressed.</para>

I am proud àf the pledge I have taken, and, although I regret fo have to make an personal references, I wish to ask the honorable member for Batman if it is not a fact that during his membership of the Labour Party he signed a pledge. The honorable member does not reply, and I do not wish to press him for an answer. The honorable membei for Maribvrnong said that his objection to our system of selection is that a candidate has to sign a pledge that if he is not selected he will not oppose the selected candidate.</para>

					<para>It would be news to me. Many honorable members have made a lot out of the statement that the great protectionist movement and the Tariff are in danger, but I believe there are enough protectionists in the House to insure the safety of protection, and that we have enough protectionists even to increase the Tariff when we get an opportunity. There are also men who came into the House as free-traders, but who have admitted publicly and privately that the fiscal issue is dead, and that protection is the accepted and established policy of Australia. The Argus newspaper itself has admitted it, so that I have no fear on that score, whatever Ministry is formed. But what I do fear from what is taking place now is that the democracy of Australia will be in danger when the fusion party come over from the other side to take the Treasury bench. I ask honorable members to recall the splendid leading article that appeared in the Age of the 15th of this month, warning the honorable member for Ballarat that the course he was pursuing was a treacherous course to the democracy, and that he would not be able to perpetrate what he was endeavouring to do, because such sturdy democrats as the honorable member for Maribyrnong, the honorable member for Bourke, the honorable member for Gippsland, the honorable member for Batman, the honorable member for Htime, the honorable member for Laanecoorie, and the honorable member for Riverina, would prevent him from selling the democracy to the crusted Conservatives in the corner.</para>

					<para>A short fortnight ago, the Age uttered that warning, and more than a warning, to the honorable member for Ballarat, yet in the Age of yesterday we saw the names of the new Liberal Cabinet, and the new Liberal Party. In that new party, arrayed beside the honorable member for Ballarat, and the honorable member for Maribyrnoi,ig, were the honorable members for Parraniatta, Bendigo—a great democrat—and Fawkner a gentleman who •makes no pretence of democracy, and who is chairman of the most conservative organization in Australia, the Employers' Federation. I ask the democrats of Australia, much as they admire the honorable member for Fawkner, as an individual, whether they expect one atom of democratic feeling or action from him. I would ask the members of the late Deakin party, as they were known then, particularly the honorable members for Maribyrnong, Bourke, Batman, and Laanecoorie, whether they ..dare go before their constituents, and say that they are one and all united with the honorable member for Flinders. Those four honorable members will look well in the eyes of the democrats of their constituencies sitting cheek by jowl with the honorable members for Flinders, Grampians, Corangarnite, Echuca, Bencligo, Koovong, Fawkner, and In di—a.l I grand democrats in the new Liberal Party. I have hundreds of times stated on the platform that there was no real, difference —and I have been taken to task for it by friends of honorable members sitting opposite— between the honorable members for Maribyrnong and Bourke. for instance, and the honorable member for Flinders, because, while they were not pledged to sun- Port democratic legislation, the time would come when they would get away from it. They have proved the truth of our assertion. I have heard of missionaries going to the Solomon Islands to he eaten, or to China to be killed, and I suppose those honorable members have gone as missionaries into the ranks of the Conservatives with a strong determination to convert those gentlemen to democracy. I can say with perfect truth that the Opposition corner and fhe Opposition itself, ,before the remnant of the Deakin party joined it, did not contain one member with a shred of democracy about him. In spite of all that the sturdy democrats enumerated by the Age, on the 15th inst., can do, and in spite of the smiling face that they put upon the position which they are now occupying, the)' know well that they are no more at home over there than I. would be. The present situation has been brought about because the Labour organization has openly admitted that it will nominate pledged Labour men against those honorable members. But this is not the first time that that has been done. It was done at the last erection. The fight was fought, and some won, and some lost. But when the House met, there was no embittered feeling on the part of Labour members towards the members of the Deakin party. Although we had been engaged in strife at the .elections, almost immediately after Ave met here we got into one line of action. Strongly as the honorable members who have crossed the floor have fought the Labour movement in the past, and succeeded, they never yet made such a mistake, and never played somuch into our hands as they have now done by going over to the other side. As surely as we stand here to-day, their action will redound to the benefit of the Labour movement. I believe that the influence of the Opposition Corner Party will be detrimental to the genuine democrats who are supportingthe honorable member for Ballarat. Their influence will more than counterbalance that of the democratic members in formulating the policy of the incoming Government. No doubt the members of the Corner Party believe that their policy would be best for the country. I believe firmly that they think that it is to the interest of Australia. that a few should be better off than the many. It is inevitable that the influence of those honorable members should affect the sincere democrats. who sit opposite. Personally, I do not consider that our party has anything to complain of in the present situation. When it was announced that our party could no longer support the Government of the honorable member for Ballarat last year, r never in my most sanguine moments. dreamt that we should occupy the Government benches. I thought that . we should' be in direct Opposition. I knew that we were a minority, and considered that the Opposition side was our true place in this House., But events shaped themselves differently. Why? Because those who are supporting the honorable member for Ballarat to-day did not support him in his hour of need. I have heard some of them sa.y a hundred times that the only objection they had to the Deakin Government was that it was kept in power by the Labour Party. They say now that they. knew all along that they could get good legislation from the Deakin Party, but that that legislation was permitted to be moulded to too great an extent by the Labour Party. Yet when we announced to the late Government that we could no longer support them the then Opposition made no move to support the Deaki Government. When. a division took place, a few moved in their seats, but the honorable member for Ballarat told them to stay where they were. That was the time when they should have crossed the floor. But they did not, because they felt that there were men occupying seats in that Cabinet which they themselves ought to have, and they said—" We will turn, the Government out first and there will be a reconstruction afterwards." That is what is taking place now. We shall attain our true position in the House as a direct Opposition. Being, as we are, a compact body of men, who attend to their legislative work - do not let honorable members forget that— the incoming Government will have such an anxious tii:4 in keeping a House that if we do not secure a dissolution now, as I think we ought to do, the dissolution will undoubtedly come in a very short time. I believe that' when we come back there will be just as many parties in the House as there are now. That is only natural. The people themselves are divided on political issues, and this Parliament ought to be a true reflex of what the people think. The party supporting the honorable member for Ballarat will come back with just as many sections in it as there are to-day. There is only one party in which there are no sections, and that is the Labour Party. The Opposition Corner Party must have contained about a dozen sections, because they could never select a leader. There will always be different parties in a country where there are many shades of political thought. The honorable member for Ballarat may think that he has behind him a party of cohesion, but I have my doubts as to whether he is of that opinion, and am satisfied that he will find that he has such a restive team in hand that his legi1ation cannot be democratic. His supporters will take good care of that. Does he suppose that the honorable members for Fajwkner, Flinders Corangamite, and Echuca want democratic legislation, or legislation beneficial to the workers ? If he does not suppose that, he should not have agreed to a coalition, and if he does suppose it it is like expecting water to flow uphill. The interests of these men are against advanced legislation. It is said that "evil communications corrupt good manners." I must express the hope that such will not be the case with the democrats who support the honorable member for Ballarat.</para>

But, personally, I regret to say that in the future I can never look upon the honorable member for Ballarat in the same light as I have done in the past. He will admit that I always have meted out to him asmuch assistance as I could render, and have repeatedly expressed my admiration for him personally. r am sorry to say— although he may not care—that in future I shall be unable to extend that consideration to him that I have hitherto given. When I heard the honorable member for Ballarat hurl defiane at honorable members in the opposite corner, when they weregoading and jeering at him, I felt that he would always be found adopting that attitude towards those honorable members. When I heard him tell the members of the Corner Party to sit where they were, and that he did not want their support, I felt that he would look for democratic support.</para>

					<para>There are none so deaf as the willing deaf. However, a change has come about, and we must accept things as they are. If we get any good legislation from the mu/turn in parvo on the opposite side, I shall he very pleased. While I shall always give my voice and vote to break down that combination, and' will bend my energies to oust Victorian representatives included in it, in order to strengthen the Labour Party. I still shall, claim the right, should they bring forward democratic legislation, to support it. In saying that, I give a promise which I know I shall never have to keep, because I feel certain that a measure that will satisfy a democrat will never satisfy honorable members who are to-day behin the honorable member for Ballarat. In conclusion, I wish again to say that, come what may, the Labour Party gains. If we retained our position on the Government side of the House, it would be for the benefit of the people of Australia, and I contend also that what has taken place will necessarily be of advantage to the party, and to the people.</para>

					<para>I desire to make a personal explanation, and will not detain the House for many minutes. The Minister of Trade and Customs made a very serious allegation with respect to the Government of which I was a member dropping the Telegraph Rates Bill, because it contained a clause making provision for the prohibition of telegrams as well as letters. As a matter of fact, the Bill was never dropped, the clause I refer to was never carried, and the Minister of Trade and Customs voted against the clause being carried. I refer honorable members to page 4158 of Hansard for the session of 1901-2. I find that Mr. Clarke, the then member for Cowper said-</para>

					<para>I read the honorable gentleman's Sydney speech in more than one newspaper. He will admit that I am doing him no injustice when I say that, as reported, the speech was not fit for discussion. I referred to some passages which I said would kill the reputation of the youngest member of the House if it rested upon them. As a precaution, I took the .Age report and compared it with other reports of the speech, but some of the statements appearing in the report are so absurd that it would be ridiculous to quote them. To give an instance of how absurd they really are, I quote one passage, and will quote as many more as the honorable gentleman - pleases, if he thinks the passage I select is not a fair one.

					<para>There are other inaccuracies which I do not wish to quote A great deal has been said during this discussion about parties, the advantage that one party has over another, and the special independence of some particular part\' with respect to the Labour Party. I stated here not very long ago that I belonged to a party the members of which, when they become candidates, accept a platform drawn up by a conference, and agree to advocate and support it before the electors. I find, after the debate we have had that we have narrowed down the features objected to in the Labour Party's method of selection of candidates to the fact that 'they must agree to the policy before they become candidates. That now appears to be the only objection. Does the honorable member for Maribyrnong say that a member of Parliament continues to be a member of Parliament after a dissolution?</para>

					<para>It may be news for the honorable member for Bourke, but 'I' can infornñ him that on more than one occasion I have been asked not to go to a selection ballot, and in every instance I have insisted upon doing so. I did so upon principle. I believe in the principle underlying the selection of Labour candidates, and it is on that account that I am here to-clay I am not afraid of the leagues. Of course, I cannot speak from personal experience of what takes place in States other than that of Queensland. But I know that amongst the wellorganized parties in the Imperial Parliament, immediately an honorable member says anything against his leader, he is struck off the list. A mere casual reference is sufficient to bring about that result.</para>

					<para>Xo, nor do I say to the people of Australia that it is a good thing for parliamentary parties to lead in this matter. They are conservative, and there is a danger that they may become little organizations, whose members imagine that they are the salt of the earth, and who altogether forget the great principles of democracy. Victorian Labour representatives are well able to defend their own case. I can speak only of the position in my own State, and .I say that some of the finest men into whom God ever breathed the breath of life are associated with the Labour movement in Queensland.</para>

					<para>I am not afraid of the taunts in which honorable members opposite have indulged. I recollect what occurred in my own State in 1890. When the leaders of the Liberal andConservative Parties found that the Labour movement was gathering impetus, they - came together as one man. They coalesced against the rising democratic tide. Upon that occasion, the father of the honorable member for Darling Downs, with one or two others, dclined to join the coalition, and that very circumstance, not only protected him from attack, but gave him, for the whole of his life, the warm sympathy of the radical voters in that part of the State. Nor do I forget what happened in 1:899, when the first Labour Ministry in the world took office in Queensland, merely for the purpose of demonstrating that they were quite capable of discharging all the functions of government. Immediately they did so, the so-called Liberal Party coalesced with the Conservative Party., and meted out to the Ministry the same treatment that we received at the hands of honorable members opposite yesterday. Before they were given an opportunity of putting their programme before the country, a motion was submitted to take the control of business out of their hands. But did that kill the Labour Party ? Certainly not. Will the action of honorable members opposite on the present occasion kill the Labour Party? A thousand times " No." It will not even give it a set-back. Some honorable members have loudly proclaimed what they have done for the people from time to time. I hope that any services which they may have rendered them will be amply rewarded. But, simply because we may have rendered them good service, we are not to assume that we have an inherent right to represent them for all time. Quite the contrary. For an honorable member to say that he will do this or that, despite the organizations is simply to say something which is absolutely opposed to all historicat teaching in regard to parties. I am glad to have honorable members before me who know all about the Labour movement. I wish to say that a member of the Labour Party is not bound in any way to an organization between Parliament. He is merely bound to the platform which he signs, and which he must advocate upon the hustings before he is elected. Between Parliaments, the organizations cannot in any way whatever dictate to a member of the Labour Party who is representing a constituency.</para>

					<para>I have no objection to that complaint at all. I shall come to the crux of the question in a moment. Every organized party seeks to reduce the number of its candidates to a minimum, with a view t0 insuring their success. If the respective parties run four or five candidates, they go to certain defeat. What methods do 'other parties adopt to eliminate the least fit and to nominate one man? We have a well-recognised system. The honorable member may or may not admit that. In my opinion, it is the best system extant today to preserve the integrity and forward the interests of a political party.</para>

					<para>If that is the deliberate opinion of the honorable gentleman, I shall not further discuss the matter. After all this explanation, it is useless to discuss the question if such statements are to be made. The honorable member for Ballarat has not been free from blame in speaking about this machine and that machine. I am not denying that he believes that it may have a wrong influence and not the best influence in the public interest. That is a legitimate position for any one to take up; but it should have some relation to a policy. 1 believe in the system. It may have its faults; we would like to improve it. Every third year we have a duly elected conference. On the last occasion, members of the Federal Parliament formed an absolute majority of the Inter-State Conference. They drew tip the platform, and then my honorable friends want to tell the public that we are to do absolutely what a foreign body may tell us. It shows the absolute confidence of the people in their representatives when a majority of them in conference have the power of determining what the platform shall be</para>

					<para>No; it is only a passing reference I am making. More than once the honorable gentleman has indulged, in a little hilarity about the dangers of machinemade politics. With us there are no machinemade politics. As you, sir, know well, not 10 per cent. of the actual business of Parliamert is contained in any programme. A singular thing about the position of Labour Ministers is that administrative matters are not touched at all. In that respect, we are absolutely free. I am availing myself of. this opportunity to let every honest man and woman in the country know the facts. I am not so innocent as to think that wicked, malicious, and gross misrepresentations will not be wilfully made against us in the future as in the past. Every radical party has had to meet such treatment. In every age it is the method of certain men to keep their privileges by misrepresentations.</para>

					<para>I do not want to misunderstand the honorable gentleman. made a short note of his "magnanimous action" in making an intimation, through the whip of the late Cook party, about closing the debate on the Address-in-Reply. I do not hold that view. With all du respect to .the honorable member, I do not think that the circumstances then and the circumstances when I gave him private and public notice of the withdrawal of our party's support, are the same. It was only after a very long, and, I think, very serious consideration, and frequent interchanges of views between ourselves, that that resolution was arrived at last year. It was so fixed in my mind at the time that I did nof feel that I was called upon to ask for the assistance of the Govrnment in any way. As I said then, it was in the interests of tjie public that I .made that statement. Whether rightly or wrongly, it was made with that end in view, and the honotable gentleman will, I think, agred with me that I was not anxious which party got an advantage at the time. If the Op- Dosition had come into power, we should have supported them. We came into power; we intended to do our best, and we did.</para>

					<para>As regards getting anything put in writing, the honorable member knows that I hkve said that I have no use for that sort of friend. Nothing between me and another person needs to be put in writing. That is the position I occupy here. The honorable member has had a long' public career with a party which is well supported by the press. We are not so fortunate. We have only the platform from which we can protect ourselves thoroughly, and it is for that reason that I avail myself of this opportunity to state these matters as quietly and correctly as I can. I want now to refer very briefly to another matter. At the end of last night's sitting, I asked the leader of the Opposition whether the motion for the adjournment of the debate on the Address-in-Reply was moved with his concurrence and approval, and he said, "Certainly." At the moment I had not an opportunity of asking that question. T had to wait for a subsequent motion to be moved before I could even ask whether the motion was moved with his approval and consent. That courtesy is usually allowed to the Prime Minister in any Parliament, when a want of confidence motion is moved.</para>

					<para>May I remind the honorable member of the traditional courtesy which is allowed to the leader of a Government when a motion of that kind is moved l)y a private member. He is afforded the opportunity of asking the leader of the Opposition whether it is a party move or a mere motion of an individual member. That is an immemorial custom in constitutional Parliaments. I had not that opportunity afforded to me.</para>

					<para>No; but I stopped and spoke to the honorable member as I came out of the luncheon room. I leaned over him, and said, "I propose to take Cook's position, and make an intimation to which you will probably reply." I was careful not to use the word motion. The honorable member answered, "Yes, I will reply."</para>

					<para>The honorable member did not actually stop. He shook my hand, and asked, "How are you?" but it was only when coming through the door, as we were hurrying from the lobby, that I. learned that he had taken the place of the late leader of the Opposition. I have no recollection of any further conversation, and think that the honorable member is in error as to what took place. That, however, is by the way. Even if he had said what he thinks he said, that would not have been a sufficient intimation to me. I bring the matter 'up because the honorable member for Gippsland, in a speech whose tone, quite apart from its subject matter, was such as would do credit to a member of any representative chamber, said, "I am glad that what was done was not done by one of my late colleagues." How, then, could I understand, without asking the leader of the Opposition, how it was done? A gentleman whom the honorable member for Ballarat considered one of his most trusted, honorable, and able colleagues expressed a certain amount of jov—as any one who beard him must remember—because what was done was not done by any of his old colleagues. But it was done by intimation and agreement beforehand by his old leader. Therefore, to that extent the speech of the honorable mthber for Gippsland was a reflection upon him. I do not know that I should detain honorable members further. Perhaps I have already detained them too long. If I may be allowed one personal word, it will be this: I have not been idle. I have acted to the best of my ability in the service of my adopted country. I express no regrets. I ask for no consideration. In leading in a radical movement I have had to face opposition always active. I have not always overcome it; but I am here. If I do not return I shall express no regrets. It has been my good fortune to have seen a great deal of public life, and, in some small way, to help to mould the opinions of a number of people.</para>

					<para>I trust that, whatever be the result of the new arrangement, it will be of advantage to the Commonwealth in every *ay. That it marks a new line of division I have not the slightest doubt. That friends of the past will no longer bepolitical friends is obvious. But, above all, I hope that whichever party may add to its numbers, and whichever party may diminish, the interests and the welfare of the people of Australia will not suffer.</para>
