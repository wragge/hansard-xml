                        <para>- By this morning's newspapers, the public are informed that the Railway Commissioners of New South Wales, presumably acting on the advice and with the consent of the Government of the State, refuse to carry coal except under certain conditions, one of which is that the Department shall take a percentage of the coal. In view of the fact that some of the coal may be under consignment for the completion of orders in other States, is not the action of the Government of New South Wales, in sanctioning this conduct, an infringement of the provisions of the Constitution prohibiting restraint of trade, and does not the Prime Minister think that the Commonwealth Government should take steps to put an end to an arrangement which is preventing coal supplies from Newcastle being obtained in the other States? </para>

                        <para>- The statements in the press as to the action of the Railway Department of New South Wales differ each day, and my perusal of the newspapers this morning has not made clear exactly what is being done. I do not know that any appreciable part of the Inter-State trade in coal is conducted by railway. If it were, no doubt the circumstances mentioned by the honorable member would call for, and immediately receive, the consideration of the Attorney-General. It is necessary to be guarded in these references, however, because, in the three past days, we have had three different versions of the action of the State Railway Department. </para>

                            <para>- It is somewhat dangerous to give, without consideration, opinions on questions which do not directly concern us. The action of the New South Wales Railway Commissioners appears to be one directly affecting the people of that State. As to whether there would be a breach of Inter-State law if the people of other States were affected is a question which I cannot answer without a knowledge of all the facts. There is a direct remedy, should there be interference with InterState trade. </para>

                            <para>- The Railway Department of New South Wales has refused to convey coal to ships at Newcastle. The position is most serious, though some honorable members seem to be somewhat impatient when questions are asked concerning it. As the Prime Minister is not satisfied with the newspaper reports regarding the attitude of the New South Wales Government, I ask him does he not think that the Commonwealth Government might ask to be informed exactly as to the position ? </para>

Our Constitution is not similar to that of the United States in all points; Very firm action has been taken in America at times, owing, in some cases, to the fact that the ownership of the land belongs to the Commonwealth rather than to the States.

The Prime Minister replied that it had not been considered, because of matters of greater importance, namely, the Financial Bills. </para>

                        <para>That this House approves of the new scheme of Naval Defence adopted at the recent Imperial Conference, and is of opinion that immediate steps should be taken to provide the proposed Australian Unit of the Eastern Fleet of the Empire. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The purpose of the Government in submitting this Bill is to carry out immediately, as directed, that resolution. Honorable members are aware that the proposal for the Commonwealth to provide a naval unit is with the object of that unit acting in concert with similar units on the China and East India stations. The three units are to consist of a minimum total of thirty-nine ships, namely, 3 armoured cruisers, 9 unarmoured cruisers, 18 destroyers, and 9 submarines, which are to constitute the Eastern Fleet" of the Empire. I. think that honorable members will agree with me that thirty-nine ships of the classes I have mentioned will make a formidable force, giving us a far greater sense of security in these southern seas than we have heretofore enjoyed. In the few words I intend to address to the House this morning I shall confine myself to explaining the ob-  ject in view in asking authority to raise £3,500,000 by loan for naval defence. It was agreed at the recent Imperial Defence Conference, subject to the approval of this Parliament, that the Commonwealth should provide a fleet unit to consist of one armoured cruiser of the new <inline font-style="italic">Indomitable</inline> type, at a cost of £2,000,000 ; three unarmoured cruisers of the <inline font-style="italic">Bristol</inline> type, at a cost of .£350,000 each ; six destroyers of the River class, at a cost of £80,000 each ; and three submarines of the " C " class, at a cost of £55,000 each ; making a total of £3,695,000. The £250,000 which was voted in 1908 and placed to a trust fund is being expended on the construction of three of the six destroyers. The total annual cost in connexion with the maintenance of the fleet unit, pay of <inline font-style="italic">-personnel</inline> at Australian rates, cost of training and subsidiary establishments, and interest, and sinking fund is estimated at £785,000. To this, the Imperial Government has offered to contribute £250,000 a year for a time. At present, we are contributing to the naval defence of the Empire £200,000 a year, and it is proposed that that subsidy shall merge in the new arrangement so soon as the new Australian fleet unit takes the place of the existing Australian Squadron, which, it is estimated, will be about the 1st July, 1912, or two and a half years hence. To those who have studied the financial position of the Commonwealth, it must be clear that, even with the immense increase of nearly £2,500,000 in the revenue for 1910-11, if the financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the States is approved by the people, the proposed expenditure of £3,500,000 on naval defence cannot be provided from current revenue unless by a large increase of taxation. Honorable members are aware that the expenditure for the present financial year is £1,800,000 more than the revenue, and that that immense difference has been caused by the introduction of a great beneficent law, having for its <inline font-style="italic">object</inline> the amelioration of the closing years of the aged and deserving poor. This year the expenditure under that humanitarian law will be at least £1,500,000, while next year it will be considerably greater. The Government, having carefully considered, this question in connexion with the financial obligations of the Commonwealth, have come to the conclusion that it is neither necessary nor desirable to find £3,500,000 for naval defence by  additional taxation. It was with very much regret that I listened yesterday to the taunt of honorable members opposite, that this Government and their supporters are desirous of placing the burden of the interest and sinking fund of this loan on the masses of the people, and relieving the wealthier classes. </para>

                            <para>- The one fact that the Old-age Pensions Act was introduced and passed by the present Prime Minister, and supported by every honorable member on this side, for the special benefit of the poorer members of the community, is an all-sufficient answer to what I may properly designate' an ungenerous accusation. The financial proposal which is now submitted for the approval of honorable members is to take power to raise by loan, and to expend for naval defence, £3,500,000, bearing interest at not more than 3 J per centum per annum. This, with the £250,000 already voted and placed to a trust fund, will make the total amount available for expenditure on the Australian unit £3,750,000. It is proposed to establish a sinking fund of 5 per cent, per annum - not 4 per cent., as stated in the Bill. The first payment of £175,000 per year is to begin on the 1st July, 1912, when the fleet will be completed. It is proposed to invest the sinking fund so that it will amount t!o the principal sum of £3,500,000 in about sixteen years. For the current financial year, it, is not expected that more than £500.000 will be expended, and the interest will therefore be little. For 1910-11, it is estimated that the interest will be about £70,000, and for 1911-12 about £123,000. When the fleet unit is completed, the annual interest and sinking fund will amount to about £298,000 a year, which sum is included in the total expenditure of £785.000. When the annual Imperial contribution of £250,000 is allowed for, it will be seen that the amount which the fleet unit will cost is £535,000 a year. And allowing for the present contribution of  £200,000  a year, it means  £335,000  a year more than is paid at present if we keep within the estimates. Besides, it is expected that the local naval expenditure, which amounts to  £80,000  a year, will be saved, so that the extra cost of the new naval scheme is estimated not to exceed  £255,000  a year more than we at present pay. It will be seen, therefore, that the financing of the expenditure on the fleet unit involves the provision of from  £20,000  to  £255,000  a year for interest and sinking fund, when the unit is completed and carrying on its duties. Such expenditure will not to any great extent inter fere with our finances, and there is no necessity to make special provision for it at present. As it is supposed that the present unit will not become obsolete foi" at least twenty years, the present proposal is that the cost of providing it shall be spread over sixteen years instead of being charged to one or two years only, as it would be if we endeavoured to provide funds from revenue exclusively. </para>

                            <para>- I am only dealing with the present proposal. It is not for me to say now what we may do in the future. The proposal to borrow  £3,500,000,  and repay it by annual instalments of  .£175,000,  instead of raising the whole capital at once by taxation, is based on the way in which financial business is ordinarily carried on throughout the world. There is nothing unusual, about it ; and, in my opinion, it is a far better and more economical plan, especially in a new country like Australia, with its immense undeveloped areas, than resorting to primitive methods, which would hamper progress by imposing unnecessarily high taxation on the people. It is, I know, argued sometimes that borrowing for defence is an unsound policy. </para>

It is argued that borrowing for defence is an unsound policy, because, it is said, defence is not reproductive. In my opinion, that is merely an assertion, the whole question being entirely governed by local conditions. Insurance of property and goods is not reproductive, except when disaster arises, but it is considered a sound policy. </para>

This proposal to provide  ,£3,500,000  to strengthen the fleet of the Empire is one that recognises to the full our Imperial responsibility.

                            <para>- He may be, but I am not now dealing with that matter. This arrangement recognises each unit as an integral part of the Eastern Fleet of the Empire. Further, when the Australian unit is placed by the Commonwealth Government at the disposal of the Imperial authorities in war time, the vessels are to be under the control of the Naval Commander-in-Chief. I have always urged, both here and in England - perhaps this may be news to some honorable members - that the retention of the power by the Commonwealth Government in time of war, to place their unit or units at the disposal of the Admiralty, was not only a fair and reasonable provision, but was taking no risk at all. Indeed, it was, in my opinion, the best way of insuring cooperation and cordiality ; and when the Naval Agreement was being considered in  1903,  I urged this on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> who was then Secretary of State for the Colonies. I believe that, if at that time it had then been found necessary to make such a provision, he would have supported it. I should like to quote here from an address delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> at the opening of the Colonial Conference, in 1902, on the defence of the Empire. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> said - </para>

                        <para>I point out to you that in the clash of nations, you have hitherto derived great advantage, even from a purely material stand-point, from being part of a great Empire. But the privileges which we enjoy involve corresponding obligations. The responsibility must be reciprocal, and must be shared in common ; and I do not think that any Empire may be said to be on a sure foundation, which is not based upon recognised community of sacrifices. </para>

I do not think that the opinion I then expressed differs materially from the proposal before us to establish the Eastern Fleet of the Empire. I have said all I desire to say on this occasion. I do not touch on the financial position further than in the few words I have already offered, because we shall shortly have the Estimates before us, and any information in regard to current finances or other matters that I am then in a position to give, will be gladly supplied. In conclusion, I rejoice that we are starting in real earnest to assist the Mother Land in maintaining the safety and integrity of the Empire.

                        <para>- It is now proposed to alter the Senate's amendment in such  a  way that even legal members on both sides of the House cannot tell what is the difference in the phraseology. In my opinion, the Government have other reasons for proposing the amendment, but they can take their own course, so far as I am concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Two words were put in by the Senate. The phrase originally read, " or hold any other office or employment." The Senate proposed to insert after the word' "hold" the words "or exercise," and to omit the words "office or." The phrase would then read, "hold or exercise any other employment." The Minister proposes to strike out the words " or exercise." I really can see no reason for doing so. Do I understand that it is also proposed to leave out the word " employment " ? </para>

                    <para>. - We do not propose to touch the word "employment." The proposal is to disagree with the Senate's amendment inserting the words " or exercise," and to add after the word "employment" the words "or engage in any business." We also propose to agree to the Senate's amendment omitting the words "office or." I have stated the reason for omitting the words " or exercise." The phrase is not technically correct, and the desire is to put the clause in strict legal phraseology. </para>

                    <para>.- It still seems to me that it is not necessary to dissent from the Senate's amendment. The clause as it now stands is sufficient to cover everything. All that the Senate has proposed is to insert the words "or exercise," whatever they mean, and to strike out the words "or office." The Government prefer to make the clause read, ' ' hold any other employment or engage in any other business." If the Government thought that the words with reference to engaging in business were necessary, I cannot understand why they were not inserted in the first instance. I still think that the matter is not serious enough to cause this Bill to be hung up by being sent back to the Senate, unless the reason be to save the Government from the necessity of making an announcement before the session closes. Indeed, that seems to me to be the real intention. I cannot imagine that the Minister of External Affairs can really believe that the amendment now proposed is vital. I venture to say that if this were the last day of the session, we should not hear of its being necessary to make such an amendment. </para>

                        <para>- If the god of Boodle is going to influence the exercise of an office of this description, I shall be very sorry. Surely the man who will be appointed High Commissioner - whether he be one or the other of those whose names have been suggested - will go to the Old Country with a desire to do his best for Australia, and will be content to devote the whole of his energies to promoting the interest of this country. But the Government have been holding this Bill back for a number of weeks. It has been an urgent matter for some years. The Opposition are prepared to dispose of the matter right away, provided the Bill is not to be sent back to another place to be hung up until the session closes. Some time ago, the Prime Minister made a statement to the effect that it was his desire to intimate to Parliament before the session closed the name of the High Commissioner. Am I correct in that statement <inline font-style="italic">'t</inline></para>

                        <para>- There is no justification for returning the Bill to the Senate on a matter of verbiage. The intention of Parliament is pronounced in definite terms, and I think that the phraseology of the Bill is sufficiently precise. Evidently the draftsman thought so too. But the Government take a different view1, and are prepared to do anything to cause delay. If no announcement is made before the end of the session, they must accept any odium that may come upon them in consequence. </para>

                    (Boothby [11.58].- This humbug is really too palpable. Why do not the Government accept the Senate's amendment? It is absolutely ridiculous to propose to dissent from it. There is really no difference between the Senate and this Committee. Yet we are asked to go through the foolery of sending the Bill back. It is the clear duty of the Government to have the Bill passed without delay, and to announce the appointment they have made. We have been told throughout the session that the Government were anxious to get on with business, and to pass certain measures, but that the Opposition has " stonewalled." Yet we are now asked to cause delay over a stupid disagreement that has no sense or meaning in it. We have the unabashed and unblushing pretence that we are in disagreement with the Senate. I hope the Minister will withdraw his opposition to the Senate's amendment, and let the Bill go through. If the Government are so determined that the Bill must not pass until the close of the session, so that they need not announce the name of the High Commissioner until it is too late for the House to express an opinion, why do they not put it at the bottom of the notice- paper ? Their present action is such an obvious piece of hypocrisy that I am surprised at their persisting in it.

                    <para>.- In view of the speech made by the honorable member for Gippsland last Friday, we were quite justified in asking the Government to accept the Senate's amendment. The honorable member for Gippsland challenged the Minister in charge of the Bill to state that there was any practical difference between the clause as amended by the Senate and his own proposal. The honorable member announced that, if the Minister would do so, he would withdraw all his opposition, but the Minister was not prepared to say on his own authority that there was any difference at all. It is strange that the Government should be "stone-walling" their own Bill, which at one time they considered so urgent that, during the second-reading debate, they applied the gag to the first member on this side of the House who spoke against it. The Committee is prepared to accept the Senate's amendment at once, whereupon the Bill will become law. The honorable member for Gippsland, who is a member of the legal profession, says there is absolutely no difference between what ' the Senate proposes and what the Government have now put forward. </para>

                        <para>- If the Minister has accepted the challenge of the honorable member for Gippsland, well and good, but on Friday he did not do so. The honorable member for Darling pointed out on Friday that it was absurd to think that any person who is to be appointed High Commissioner would take advantage of the wording of the Act in order to do something that the Government did not want him to do. What sort of person do the Government anticipate appointing as the first High Commissioner? Do they think that he would not obey the spirit of the Act under which he was appointed, but would take advantage of it in order to engage in business or become the director of a company? The Bill should have become law 6n Friday. I suppose the reason for what has happened is that the Government are not anxious to appoint any one just yet. If it had been intended to adopt my suggestion that some one outside of Parliament should be appointed, I suppose there would not have been the same trouble over it. </para>

Why does not the Minister take that course, if time is so valuable? I still believe that the Government are not anxious that the Bill should become law for a day or two. I suppose there is a bit of squabbling going on between one or two knights as to who is to be the High Commissioner. The Government propose to send the measure back to the Senate, which already has a great deal of work to do, merely for purposes of delay. I regret that the Bill, which is most important, should be further delayed. The High Commissioner should have been appointed long ago. I shall vote for accepting the Senate's amendment. </para>

The word " office " was in the original drafting, and if it was desirable to leave it out, and make the sentence read " shall not hold any employment or engage iri any other business," why was not the clause originally drafted in that way? </para>

The intention of the House was that the High Commissioner should not engage in any other occupation, whether on his own account or in the service of another. I explained that we wished to put in the words " or engage in any business " because we were advised, and considered it necessary, in order to carry out the intention of Parliament and to preclude the High Commissioner from carrying on business on his own account or as a member of a firm, that they should be put in. </para>

If we had let the Bill go through, and technical defects had been afterwards discovered, other motives would have .been at once attributed to us. When we tn to carry out the intention of Parliament, all sorts of stupid suggestions are made as to the reasons for our action. ' I do not apply that remark to the honorable member for Gippsland, who put his question fairly, and has received a fair reply. If honorable members opposite are in earnest, and desire to assist us to carry the measure through, why do they not do so? </para>

The Senate has endeavoured to strengthen the clause with an amendment which embodies a very necessary safeguard, and to which I can see no reasonable objection. A man may not legally hold an office of profit for his own private benefit, but still he may exercise all the duties of such an office. The Senate simply asks that the High Commissioner, when discharging important functions, on behalf of the Commonwealth,' shall be wholly and solely a Government representative and agent. </para>

The honorable gentleman might take the House into his confidence, and say when the appointment is to be made. When the Bill was introduced, I consented to assist its passage, and it was decided by all parties that it should be considered urgent. The Prime Minister knows that I am only stating a fact when </para>

                        <para>- When considering the Bill, we agreed, as a preliminary, that it would be necessary to lay down the conditions of this appointment quite apart from any personal consideration whatever. We ruled out any reference to any parson. No name was mentioned in the Cabinet or out of it during the consideration of the Bill. That attitude has been observed up till the present, and at the present moment I do not know the opinion of a single one of my colleagues as to the most appropriate appointment to be made under this measure. As soon as the Bill becomes an Act - as soon, that is to say, as the responsibility of making an appointment rests upon us - the first opportunity for considering it will be taken, and, if that be possible, before the House rises, which will be within the next few days. It is a matter which might well call for prolonged consideration. As I say, I am not aware of what opinions are entertained by other members of the Government, but, so far as I am concerned, shall make an effort to have this subject considered by the Cabinet before the House rises, and, if the Cabinet is agreed, to inform the House. </para>

This is a very technical Bill, and almost every clause contains two or three declarations of specific matters of law. Sometimes there is something underlying a clause which does not appear on the surface, and requires study rather than debate. The Bill is really based upon an English Act, to which much consideration was devoted, and which is now working very well. </para>

Under sub-clause  4,  the question arises as to what stamp should appear on such a paper, and I propose to ask the Committee to shorten that provision by leaving out all the words after "State," and inserting in lieu thereof the words " in which the instrument is issued, to be impressed on a b'.ll."_ The stamp must be that of the State in which the instrument is issued. </para>

                        <para>- I prefer not to deal with a matter that is not before us. As soon as we have a Commonwealth duty stamp, the Act providing for it, if this Bill does not apply, will make the necessary provision for its use. Many of these provisions are not contained in the English Bills of Exchange Act; several provisions in regard to cheques are to be found in Stamp Acts. The law as to stamping cheques and bills is not expressly embodied in the Bills of Exchange Act. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like the Attorney-General to explain why it is proposed to prescribe that only an impress stamp may be legally used in connexion with bills of exchange? I am informed that in some of the States adhesive stamps may be legally used. If the Attorney-General's proposal is adopted, many people in country districts will be seriously inconvenienced. It is sometimes very difficult for them to obtain bills of exchange bearing impress stamps, but there would be no difficulty in drawing up a form and attaching to it an adhesive stamp. Why should we not follow the practice in Queensland, where the public have the option of using either adhesive stamps or forms stamped with a duty stamp ? </para>

                    <para>. - It would be rather dangerous to provide that any stamp may be used. If a blank-stamped paper bearing a simple signature were handed to an individual, and filled up by him, the fact that it bore an impress stamp would afford good security that it was stamped when the signature was attached to it; but a person might obtain the signature of another to a blank sheet bearing no duty stamp, and fill it in for any amount. </para>

If it were not impressed, the signature might be all right, but the stamp might have been affixed after the signature was obtained. It was thought better not to follow what is the practice in England, and, I think, most of the States,, and require that impress-stamp documents shall be used. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not think the Attorney-General has made the position clear. I agree with the honorable member for Riverina that sometimes it is almost impossible for people in country districts to obtain impress-stamp forms. If one is foolish enough to accept a bill of exchange which does not have attached to it a duty stamp, one accepts something which is of no value, and must be trusting to the other party to place upon it, later on, the necessary stamp. Would not a person be foolish to accept a bill of exchange having no stamp upon it, as required by the law? The States in which stamp duties prevail issue adhesive stamps for  the convenience of the public, both adhesive and impress stamps being recognised, and there does not seem to be any justification for the proposal to compel people by law to use only forms bearing an impress stamp. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister proposes to recognise the law "of the States, and he ought to agree to recognise in the Bill the State practice of allowing adhesive stamps to be used. . The State law, whatever it may be, will be adopted in both cases. We must recollect that the people grow accustomed to the laws of their respective States, and, therefore, I do not think it would be wise for the Commonwealth to upset that law upon a detail of this kind. I should like to hear some discussion upon the matter. So far, no reason has-been assigned why we should refuse to recognise the use of an adhesive stamp in lieu of an impress stamp. </para>

                    <para>.- I would remind the Attorney-General that in South Australia a duty stamp has to be affixed to documents in connexion with almost every transaction with the Crown Lands Department. But in that S'ate it is optional for the parties to use either an impress stamp or a duty stamp. Frequently the adhesive stamp, which may be purchased at any post-office, is used. But in the city it frequently happens that men visit the Titles Office, and have the stamp impressed upon the documents. If this provision means that an impress stamp has to be attached to all inchoate instruments, country residents will be subjected to very great inconvenience. </para>

                    <para>. - I am very glad of the criticism to which honorable members have subjected this provision, but, on the whole, it has been thought wise to declare that where  a  blank sheet of paper has to be filled up, the stamp used shall be an impress stamp. Some honorable members have suggested that it is very foolish .to issue blank stamped papers at all. I quite agree with the honorable member for Riverina that it is foolish for business-men to hand over a blank piece of paper with an impress stamp upon it. The practice is the cause of a good many frauds. But where a man' does issue such a paper, I think it should bear an impress stamp, which will confer a guarantee that if there be anything informal in the document it must be in relation to the signature to it only. </para>

                        <para>- If a document bears an impress stamp it will be issued with more safety than it would otherwise be. If we provide that a blank paper may be filled up so long as any sort of stamp be attached to it, greater inconvenience in respect of negotiability will result. At present there is no inconvenience  experienced in regard to the stamping of bills in general. This clause does not provide that any bill which has not .an impress stamp upon it shall not be valid. All that it says is that blank or unfilled bills of exchange bearing a stamp shall, for the greater security of the public, bear an impress stamp. </para>

                        <para>- No, it will destroy the authority to fill up the paper. That is all. In the Queensland Act an adhesive stamp for general purposes - not this purpose - is provided for. I do not know that that is not really a limitation, because an impress stamp is not an adhesive stamp. Tn England the use of any stamp is sufficient. But we do not slavishly follow British precedent, and, on the whole, we think it better to provide that the stamp used in cases of this sort shall be an impress stamp. </para>

Seeing that we have already assented to that Bill, it does appear to me that we ought to make provision for the Territory.

We also say in sub-clause  4  that " duty stamp " includes a duty stamp, required by the law of the State. That does not derogate from the general position that the Commonwealth stamp will be applicable in any part of the Commonwealth for the purposes of this clause, including the Federal Territory, because the laws operating there will be Commonwealth laws, although their operation will be limited to that particular Territory.

                    <para>. - Of course, the Attorney-General is aware that if a promissory note issued in one State be placed in the hands of a bank in another State for collection, it has to pay duty in two States. Could not that difficulty be overcome? In America, one stamp is sufficient to pass a bill through the forty-eight States of the Federation, from San Francisco to New York. Only one stamp is used, and that is the national stamp. To require stamp duty to be paid in more than one State is, to my mind, an interference with Inter-State trade and commerce. I should like to know from the Attorney-General whether something cannot be done to overcome this difficulty ? </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot see the necessity for requiring an impress stamp to be attached to these inchoate instruments. It seems to me that if swindling is going to be perpetrated in connexion with bills of exchange, the party who has that purpose in view will, under this provision, be able to secure a blank paper already stamped just as readily as he will be able to obtain a blank paper which has not been stamped. On the other hand, where transactions are <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> this provision will place a difficulty in the way of honest traders by insisting that only an impress stamp shall be used instead of allowing them the option of using either an impress stamp or an ordinary stamp. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite aware of that. Can the Attorney-General tell us of any difficulties which have arisen in this connexion in States where an adhesive stamp is used? In Queensland, for example, a man is at liberty to use either an adhesive stamp or an impress stamp. It seems to me that there is no heed to amend the law in this connexion. </para>

                        <para>-  I think, but am not sure, that the Imperial Stamp Act of 1853 or 1 89 1 requires the use of an impress stamp, and, therefore, the Imperial "Bills of Exchange Act does not refer to impress stamps. Under section 40 of the Stamp Act of Queensland, it is optional for parties to. use either an adhesive stamp or an impress stamp for other purposes : but I think an impress stamp is required for this purpose. </para>

It must be remembered that, although the passing of the measure may convenience the commercial community, they are not now enduring any substantial wrongs, such as are being suffered by those whom the Seamen's Compensation Bill would benefit. </para>

I do not object to the facilitation of the business of merchants, but, in my opinion, this measure is hardly as important as the other to which I have referred. In connexion with the clause before the Committee, I wish to know from the Attorney-General why he has not adopted the provision in the Tasmanian Act, under which, if a drawee has an office, presentment may be made by leaving the bill at that office for acceptance. </para>

                    <para>. - Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of sub-clause 2, of clause 50, provides that a Bill may be  properly presented at the drawee's place of business, where no place of payment is specified and no address given. That is a presentation for payment. Presentations for acceptance are on a different footing, because, directly acceptance is made, the drawer of the bill becomes liable to be sued. A man might not attend at his office for three or four days, as he does not necessarily know when it will be presented for acceptance. </para>

                    <para>.- The Bill consolidates the laws of the States regarding bills of exchange, and is, to a certain extent, declaratory. Therefore it seems to me that the provision in the New South Wales Act to which the honorable member for Werriwa has referred might well have been adopted. Apparently it was originally drafted to define the common law. </para>

                    <para>.- The Attorney-General will remember that the South Australian Act provides that where interest may be recovered as damages, it may be withheld wholly or in part, or where a Bill is expressly payable with interest at a given date, interest as damages may or may not be paid at the same rate as interest proper, which is defined as interest at the rate of 10 per cent. In my opinion, we should provide for interest at the rate of 5 per cent., where a Bill is dishonoured. At the present time, there is no limitation. I submit that under present commercial conditions, which are likely to exist for some time, the rate of 4 per cent. or 5 per cent. per annum is a fair one. Unless we adopt some limitation, those who are under the necessity of giving bills may be required, especially when dealing with money-lenders, to agree to pay exorbitant rates. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that this is a matter for the Parliament. The fact is that a man, seeking accommodation under the circumstances contemplated by the Bill,  is buoyed up with the hope that, when it becomes due, he will be able to pay it, and he probably agrees that if he does not he will pay a good deal of interest for the time being. I am not particularly wedded to 5 per cent., but that seems to be a fair limit. None of the solid men of the commercial community would object, but only the worst class of money lenders. </para>

                    <para>. - Many a business man has found himself utterly bankrupt owing to there being no power to limit the interest that the owner of a promissory note may charge if it be not redeemed. The Commonwealth Parliament possesses the power to say what maximum interest shall be charged, and we should certainly not leave the matter to the Judge or the Court. One of the Judges of the Victorian County Court reduced interest claimed to 12 per cent. the other day, but, on appeal to the Supreme Court, it was held by the Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Madden, that interest was a matter of contract that it was what a man was able to obtain on a bad security. A lender is not obliged to take a bad security, but, having lent money, he has no right to penalize the unfortunate man who has the interest to. pay. I forget whether in the case I have mentioned there was an appeal to the High Court, and the Full Court's decision was upset; but it only shows what different opinions different Judges may hold in regard to interest. At 5 per cent., with the interest paid half-yearly, and re-loaned, money doubles itself in a trifle over fourteen years, and in twelve years at  6  per cent. I shall vote for the amendment of the honorable member for Werriwa, believing as I do that there should be no interest over 5 per cent. . If we had a system that would keep interest low, the industries of Australia would be stimulated all round, with much benefit to the people. I know business men in Melbourne, who, with lower interest, would enlarge their factories, employ more people, and increase production. The man who handles money and earns interest never " goes broke," while hundreds of business men who conduct their affairs on the most up-to-date principles are frequently forced into the bankruptcy court. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with a good deal that has been said about unfair rates of interest, but that is a matter which for all purposes is covered largely by State Acts, under which, in some cases, the interest charged is restricted ; while in others certain contracts are invalidated. The interest dealt with in this clause, however, is simply interest by way of damage, the other interest payable on the bill being provided for in an earlier clause. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Clause 14 provides that a bill may be payable with interest, but this clause deals, as I say, merely with interest by way of damages, and, therefore, will have no effect in regard to the interest on the bill, which may be at any rate. Even if we were to place a limitation in both clauses, there would be nothing to prevent a lender adding to the principal. I suggest that it would be better to leave the control of this matter to the State Acts. Bills of this kind have to be very carefully drawn, because the parent English Act, as to usurious interest on which they are modelled, has given rise to a good deal of litigation in regard to the meaning of the provision. Under the circumstances, I think it would be better for the honorable member not to press an amendment. The South Australian Act fixed the rate at 10 per cent, but, at that time, that was not very different from the ruling rate in the banks, and all that is recoverable is the ruling rate at the moment. </para>

                    <para>.- If it is good in South Australia to have a maximum of 10 per cent. when that is the ruling rate, it cannot be bad for the Commonwealth to fix a maximum of 5 per cent., seeing that that is about the ruling rate now. </para>

If a man agrees to pay 20 per cent., it has to be proved that he was almost a lunatic before the Court will ignore a solemn, written agreement. I know that the Courts are disposed, where there is no  written agreement, to limit the amount of interest, but I think there ought to be some limitation fixed in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I would rather say that the interest should not exceed 8 per cent. The honorable member for Darwin proposes to introduce a clause which will be much more effective in protecting people by dealing with the interest which forms the consideration for the bill itself ; but that, of course, is a different matter. I think the Attorney-General might well accept the limitation of 7 per cent. No commercial transaction is done on more than 7 per cent. ; indeed, the other day a case came under my notice in which one of the leading soft-goods firms of Melbourne charged a country retailer only 6 per cent. on a dishonoured bill.

                    <para>. - Laws are made to protect lambs from wolves, wild dogs, and other destructive animals; orchardists are compelled to protect their orchards from codlin moth and other vermin, and squatters are forced to dip their sheep to protect them from tick. What is there more helpless than a man who wants to preserve his little property against another man who has the conscience of a rattlesnake, the heart of an alligator, and the mind of a shark? The Attorney-General is a sympathetic man, and many a time has been in the Courts defending poor people against the ravages of human wolves. When a man's all is going, is it not ridiculous to say that he should not be protected ? No man will lend money even at from 15 to 30 per cent. unless the security is good, and, if the security is good, he has no right to charge such high rates. I have myself backed a bill for a man who afterwards got it discounted at 14 per cent., without my knowledge. I renewed it several times, until I suddenly discovered what he had done. Then I said to him : " Why didn't you let me know ? I could have let you have the money at less. I am doing that kind of business." The time has come to protect the unfortunate lambs in their myriads from the consolidated, concentrated, powerful wolves of society, whose teeth are sharp, and claws sharper, and so I ask that at every opportunity in this Bill we should reduce the rates of interest. Some day this Parliament will get courage, and have in it a few men with financial ability who will establish a banking system that will reduce interest rates. Meanwhile let us do everything we can in that direction. If we did what we ought to do to establish a national postal banking scheme, we should have the whole of the industries of Australia booming. </para>

British Consols are at only 82 or 84 now, not because they are not as good as ever, but because the owners have disposed of them in order to get the high rates of interest offering in the open market.

                    <para>. - The first sub-clause really declares what the general common law principle is, that any material alteration, no matter who made it, avoids the bill, except as against persons who are parties thereto. A man cannot obtain any benefit from his own fraud. . If he were a party to a material alteration he would be bound by that alteration, but it would not affect any one who was innocently connected with it. It was decided that people who subsequently bought a bill which had been materially altered, would be affected by the alteration - that a holder in' due course who has honestly bought up such a bill without any taint or fraud would be affected. It would be most unfair, however, to allow him to be affected by a material alteration which vitiated the bill as against others. This clause provides then, that a material alteration made in a bill will lie binding upon persons who are parties to it, but that any one who takes a bill from the indorser after the alteration has been made, is not to be affected, as against the indorser, who of course indorsed for the altered amount. An honest man buying the bill without any knowledge of an alteration is not, to the extent of the original amount, to be affected by an alteration made by some one else. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause really adopts what is the general law as regards contracts, and new contracts based upon them, where different countries are concerned. The honorable member who takes a great interest in marriage matters knows that several questions of jurisdiction arise in connexion with them. There is, first of all, the question of entering into the contract; secondly, we have the question of dissolution ; and, thirdly, questions as to rights arising out of the contract. And so in regard to bills of exchange we provide that the laws of the place of issue shall determine one part ; and further, in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> that such questions as the requisites of acceptance, indorsement, or acceptance <inline font-style="italic">supra</inline> protest, are determined by the law of the place where the contract was made. Each subsequent transaction becomes a new contract between certain parties, and its requisites are determined by the law of the country in which it takes place. As to that part of the clause which deals with the question of stamps, there has always been a dispute as to whether one country is bound to recognise the stamp laws of another. We have therefore provided that the fact that a bill of exchange ought to have been stamped in a place outside Australia is not to affect its validity within Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose to ask the Committee to omit sub-clause  2,  which deals with stale cheques. It was inserted by the Senate, but has, in reality, nothing to do with this clause. Moreover, as drafted, I do not think that it carries out the intention of another place. The clause deals with the right of the drawer and the holder of a cheque which has not been presented within reasonable time, where the drawer had funds to meet the cheque when he drew it, but where the bank on which it was drawn had suspended its payment on the date of presentation. Stale cheques, however, are quite another matter. I propose to omit this sub-clause, and, later on, to move the insertion of a new clause covering the same matter, but expressed in different terms. I move - </para>

                        <para>- - This is the clause which has, perhaps, teen most debated. I am sure that honorable members will not desire me to explain at length the principle involved, because on the motion for the second reading I endeavoured to give a fair explanation of the position from the point of view of both the banker and the drawer of the cheque. Up to about  1906  it was believed to be the law in Australia, and also in England, and probably it is the law in England at present - that the drawer of a cheque was under a duty to the bank so to draw it as not to afford facilities for forgery. That, I think, is the gist of a decision on the subject given in  1827,  in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Young</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Grote,</inline> and supposed to have decided the whole question until about  1916.  A bank is bound to pay a cheque, otherwise it is liable to an action, but it is not bound to pay a bill of exchange made payable there without arrangement, because that is a matter of agency. As to cheques, there is supposed to be between drawer and banker a contract that the banker will honour a cheque up to the amount of the funds of the drawer, or the extent of his overdraft limit. That was regarded as the law until 1906. It may still be the law in England, and I think that it is. We have had two decisions here - one by the High Court, and one by the Privy Council - both declaring that, whatever may be the duty cast on the customer of a bank, it does not include the obligation to so draw a cheque as not to give facilities for forgery. That was the decision given in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Marshall</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">The Colonial Bank of Australasia</inline> by the High Court, on appeal from the Full Court of "Victoria. The case, in the first place, came before Chief Justice Madden arid a jury. The learned Judge then gave a direction to the jury that the customer was under an obligation to the bank to so draw his cheque as not to facilitate forgery. The Full Court of Victoria upheld that direction, but the High Court, on appeal, decided, quoting Lord Watson in a case relating to bills of exchange, that whatever might be the duty as between customer and banker, it did not include the obligation of so drawing a cheque as not to afford facilities for forgery. The Privy Council indorsed that decision. I would remind honorable members, however, that the decisions of the Privy Council relate only to the British Dominions. The Privy Council does not decide what is law in England. So far as English cases are concerned, the House of Lords is the appellate tribunal. Hence, as <inline font-style="italic">X</inline> have paid,. it may be that if the matter comes before the House of Lords, .that tribunal will revert to what has been thought to be the law since 1827, and decide that a banker is protected against the negligent drawing of cheques by a customer. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but I think the House of Lords decided in a case relating to a bill of exchange that a banker was liable to pay on a bill the amount of which had been altered. When I was approached by members of the commercial community, including bankers and others, I pointed out that I have endeavoured to differentiate in this Bill - and I find that I am sustained by writers on the law relating to bills of exchange - between the obligation of a banker to pay a bill of exchange and his obligation to pay a cheque. A bank is bound by a contract implied from the relationship, to pay a cheque, but is not bound to meet a bill of exchange unless it is domiciled, or by arrangement with the bank, made payable there. </para>

                        <para>- No. The bankers desire more than they have got in the Bill. I do not say that they were not right in pressing certain views.. The commercial community is much interested in the measure, and we should be only too glad to hear the views of its representatives, which have been expressed by leading bankers and chambers of commerce. It was desired to obtain the same protection regarding bills of exchange as the clause gives regarding cheques. In regard to cheques, the relation between the parties is one of contract, as regards bills of exchange, it is one of agency, the liability depending on the terms of the agency. The clause attempts to declare that if a customer so draws a cheque as to afford facilities for forgery, the bank will not be liable ; that if the cheque is so drawn as to admit of the variation of the amount, the negligence of the customer shall protect the bank. I think, however, that the provision is capable of being better drafted. It was, I understand, inserted during the consideration of the measure in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps the honorable member is right. I was not responsible for (he drafting of the Bill before it was introduced into the Senate; that was done by the present Minister of External Affairs. Several honorable members - the honorable members for Brisbane, Oxley, Robertson, and others - and certain solicitors, have brought under my notice the views of the commercial community. Of course, one is not bound to accept such views, but they ought to be examined. While I declined several suggestions, I felt bound to consider one for the redrafting of this provision. The attempt is made to restore the law to what the best text-writers believed it to be down to 1906, and to what it may still be in England. The wording of the clause, however, has been strongly, and, I think, effectually criticised, it being contended that under it a double negligence would have to be proved : that the clause suggests that two acts of negligence must be performed by the customer ; that, although the cheque may have been drawn in such a form as to permit of a fraudulent alteration, some other act of negligence must be proved as well. My intention, therefore, is to ask the Committee to negative the clause. If that is done I shall move the insertion of the following provision in lieu of it : - </para>

                        <para>- There are, in addition to dishonest men, illiterate men, who may have difficulties in even drawing a cheque, and yet, under this clause, they may be held to have been negligent. In my opinion the duty and responsibility ought to be cast on the bank, which, as I say, is always able to protect itself. A man from the country may know nothing at all about bills of exchange, or be even aware that he has to make a special agreement in order to evade the responsibility cast on him by this clause, whereas every officer in the bank will know the law. If a man draws a cheque so carelessly as. to leave the way open for forgery the bank has always the remedy of telling him that it does not want his account. Our first and paramount duty, where there is a clash of interests, is to protect the customer - the public - and not the bank itself. I shall vote for the excision of this clause, but not for the proposed new clause. </para>

                    <para>. - This was a matter in which I refused to accept some suggestions from the bankers, because, in my opinion, they went beyond what is logically justifiable. The law has created a class of cheques known as " crossed," which can only be collected through any bank if generally crossed, or through the bank mentioned, if specially crossed. The State has in effect imposed an obligation on bankers to act as collectors in the case of crossed cheques, and it is only right that, in the discharge of the duty, they should be protected from responsibility. This clause only gives the banker who is acting as collector for a customer protection against loss. The bankers desired this protection extended not only to crossed cheques but to open cheques. As a bank, however, is not necessarily the collector for open cheques, which may be cashed at the counter or anywhere else, I refused the request. I mention this in order that honorable members may consider the matter in connexion with clause  81  which I propose to insert. </para>

Throughout the Bill it is provided, as in this clause, that in determining what is a reasonable time regard shall be had to the nature of the instrument, the usage of trade, and the facts of the particular case. In regard to stale cheques six months is held to be a reasonable time in some places, and twelve months in other places ; it all depends on the country, the facilities for intercourse, and so on, and these must be left to the Court. </para>

                    <para>.- Does not the Attorney -General propose to insert words requiring the attestation of a notary where he is available? I understand that when the Bill was first introduced in the Senate the then Government fought for the retention of the notary, but were defeated, and an amendment was introduced enabling any householder or substantial resident of the place to give a certificate. Will that certificate be accepted in other countries? How will it be proved that a, resident is a householder or substantial resident? Notaries are known to international law and are judicially recognised in every Court. They have a history extending through centuries, from the time that they were created by ecclesiastical law. </para>

The Attorney-General might as well say that the order may be signed by any person in the presence of two witnesses. The words " substantial resident or householder " do not carry the matter one whit further, and the difficulty of getting a certificate under this clause accepted abroad will have to be faced. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause is practically a copy of the English Act, which provides that in case a notary is not obtainable, a householder may be obtained. If there is a notary, a man can make his choice. So, under this clause, if the person who holds the bill has any doubt about the signature of a householder being accepted in any part of the world, all he will have to do will be to get that of a notary. </para>

                        <para>- I know that a notary proceeds with a great deal of formality. At the bottom it amounts to this, that we are still keeping up the old principle that there must be some notarial evidence; but we are trying to modernize it a little, as has been done in England, and so we allow an alternative. Where there is a notary the man concerned can go to him, and not be prejudiced. With regard to the suggestion of the honorable member for Corio that the certificate of a householder or substantial resident might be challenged abroad, on the ground that there was no evidence that he was what he purported to be, the principle that " everything is supposed to be rightfully done" will apply, especially as the form of notarial protest is given in the schedule. If that is filled up in accordance with the Act, it will be presumed, as there are two witnesses to it, that the householder was really one of the class mentioned in the Act. The whole matter of protest is a question of inference. When a notary signs, there is no question in any country as to whether he is really a notary or not, and the same principle will be followed in this case. </para>

                    <para>. - The signature of a notary has always been accepted as evidence of the existence of the notary, except in some of the American States, where it is necessary to prove by the certificate of a Consul that the notary does exist, and is authorized to practise as a notary. I can quite understand a provision like this in the English or any other Act being used to get over the difficulties that might arise where no notary was available; but where a notary is available he ought to be used, as his signature is everywhere accepted as evidence that the bill has been properly presented and duly dishonored. Under this clause it might happen that a bank official was a householder, and the whole business might be done in a hole-and-corner fashion in a bank, with two bank clerks as witnesses. In such a case the bill might not have been properly presented, and yet it would 'lie in the hands of the bank officials to say that it was presented within twenty-four hours of its becoming due, and was duly dishonored. The object is really the protection of the maker of the bill, in order that he mav be sure that the bill is properly presented. Even where no notary is available, the objection of the honorable member for Corio, that it would be necessary to prove the existence of the householder and witnesses, has considerable weight. The notarial protest applies only to foreign bills, and the law as to the evidence of due protest will be governed, not by this clause, but by. the Bills of Exchange Act of the particular country from which the bill came. In nearly every case I think the notary would be still necessary and the Attorney-General would be well advised to provide, as the English Act does, for the signature of a householder only where no notary is available. </para>

                    <para>.- This is a rather unusual procedure. When the Treasurer concluded his speech I invited the Prime Minister to consent to the adjournment of the debate until to-morrow. The honorable gentleman seemed to be of opinion, however, that the matter was one of urgency, but of little" importance. In my view, it is of the greatest importance, and will have to be seriously considered by the House. </para>

                        <para>- It is clear from the statement of the Treasurer - most of it carefully read from notes - that the Government have seriously considered the matter. The right honorable gentleman read that portion of his speech in which he declared that the Government had given full consideration to it, and had bound themselves to the proposition submitted in the Bill. Those who were in the first Parliament will remember the attempt of that careful Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, to augment his income by raising a loan of .£500,000 to meet Commonwealth expenditure, and particularly for reconstruction works. That proposal had the support of the Government of the day, but it met with serious opposition from the Labour party, and a few honorable members now sitting in the </para>

                <para class="block">Ministerial corner, who did not belong to the Labour party. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner fought strenuously for his Loan Bill, but was defeated. Speaking subsequently, both in this House and at a Conference of Premiers, he said that he was glad that he was defeated, and declared that those who opposed him in that effort had more information than he was able to obtain from the Treasury. I believe that the position is exactly the same to-day. What better tribute could we have to the action taken at that time by those who were opposed to a borrowing policy than this statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner? Notwithstanding that statement, . and notwithstanding the evidence before us as to the position in which the States have found themselves as the result of borrowing, the present Government, without any mandate from the electors, are deliberately proposing to inaugurate a policy more far-reaching iri its financial consequences than the financial agreement with which we dealt a few days ago. It is a matter for calm consideration on the part of the Government whether they should or should not proceed further with this proposal at the present time. They ought to consider whether in the closing hours of a dying Parliament they should try to thrust upon the people a policy as to which they have not been consulted. No responsible party leader has declared himself before the electors as being in favour of a borrowing policy. The Treasurer, in moving the second reading of this Bil}, quoted as his justification for it the resolution carried by this House in favour of an Australian naval unit, and seemed to indicate that that was the Government's justification for altering the settled policy of the Commonwealth. I do not think that it is. The Treasurer has entirely misunderstood the position, and the same may be said of the Government generally. They are not justified in altering the policy of the country because they find themselves 'in financial difficulty. If that were permissible, then, I presume, responsible government as we understand it would be at an end. The fact that the electors confirmed the action of the Parliament in 1902, in refusing to adopt a borrowing policy, was a direction to all Commonwealth Ministries that the settled policy of the Commonwealth should be to abstain from borrowing until a contrary direction had been given by the people. I hold the strongest views on this question, and am in no doubt regarding my own POS1-  tion as to the wisdom of a non-borrowing policy. We took a wise step in- refusing to borrow in the early days of Federation, and I hope that we shall continue to do so. I never thought that a Commonwealth Government would be ready to enter the money market while the six States remained in their present position as borrowers. I did not think that a Commonwealth Government would be prepared to become a seventh borrower from Australia, as a complement to the people who created this Parliament mainly with the idea that there should be but one Australian borrower, and one consolidated State debt. As I understand the Treasurer, the Government intend to justify their position on the ground that the money is to be used for defence purposes. That is no justification for their proposal. If I understand the position of Australia, it is that hitherto we have been depending largely, almost wholly, upon Great Britain for the sea defence of the Commonwealth, and our adjacent islands. Our contribution towards the expense incurred in that way by Great Britain has been ^200,000 per annum, but for all practical purposes that6 defence has been provided by British money, British ships, and British sailors. It is true that quite a number of young Australians have been trained on British vessels during the last few years, and that, according to Admiral Fawkes, and the present Admiral on the Australian station, they have acquitted themselves exceedingly well ; but for all practical purposes we may say that the sea defence of Australia has been pro0vided by British men, ships, and money. The position taken up, both at the Imperial Conference and in Australia, was that it was the intention of the Parliament to ask the people of Australia to provide the men, ships, and money necessary for our de-, fence. What is the Government proposing? That we shall establish a  naval  unit, but that our ships shall be built in Great  Britain,  that the money to provide for their construction shall be borrowed in Great Britain, and that we are to be a debtor to Great Britain in respect of both.  That is -a declaration to the world that in the height of our financial and commercial prosperity we are willing to go on with our defence, but will neither pay foi it nor provide the men necessary to it. It means either that or nothing. In seeking to launch this loan policy, we are making a declaration of our own impotence - of the impossibility of getting the youth and the statesmen of Australia to recognise the obligations of the Commonwealth. What a humiliating position we shall occupy in the eyes of Canada and the rest of the world if we adopt such a policy. 1 shall deal later on with the question of non-urgency ; I am dealing now only with the question of policy. I understood that whilst advocating the naval and military defence of Australia by Australians, and defraying the cost of that defence out of Australian money, we were going to ask the people to contribute the funds necessary for it ; but the Treasurer, in the course of his speech, read the following statement : - </para>

In February last, speaking at the General Council of the Australian Natives' Association - and the question of defence was then prominently before the people - I asked whether they were in favour of an Australian naval and military defence policy, and, if so, whether they were prepared to pay for it. To do them justice, they responded with an almost unanimous " yes." </para>

                        <para>- No; it does not provide for Australian naval and military defence. It provides for borrowing money for that purpose, and repaying it, according to the Treasurer, sixteen years hence. 1 understood from the debates in this House and the public platform utterances of honorable gentlemen now occupying the Treasury bench, and those supporting them, that the outcry was against Australia's action in not making a larger contribution to the cost of defending the Empire. It was pointed out that we in Australia are better off individually and collectively than the people of Great Britain, and yet have been content to enjoy the benefits of the protection of the Mother Country for the contribution of the paltry sum of ^200,000 per annum. It has been stated that the  cost of defending the Empire amounts to  23s.  per head, so far as the people of Great Britain are concerned, and to only  5s.  per head so far as the people of Australia are concerned. In my opinion, the contribution of  10s.  per head would be a fair thing, and an additional contribution of  6s.  per head for three years would pay for the proposed new ships, with their equipment. Is that more than the people of Australia should be asked to pay? This young nation having declared for a scheme of defence, should it not be. capable of contributing  6s.  per head to pay for the cost in three years ? To do so would be to declare to the Mother Country, and to the rest of the world, that in asking for a defence force of our own we were acting in good faith, understanding what we were doing, and were prepared to give effect to our wishes. As to the scheme of the Treasurer for the redemption of the loan in sixteen years, I ask : Is there any guarantee that the proposed vessels will last for that time, or even for five years? His scheme is based on the assumption that the vessels will not meet with accident of any kind, and will not get out-of-date, and, of course, 'takes no regard of the contingency of war. </para>

                        <para>- Experts estimate the life of a first class modern battleship at from five to eight years; but the Government expects its vessels to remain good for sixteen years. That, however, is only a detail. The question with me is not one of money. As I said in  1903,  when discussing the proposal for a naval subsidy to Great Britain, the contribution of a paltry  £200,000  was a mere nothing. What I objected to then was the suggestion that the defence of. Australia should be delegated to others than Australians. By taking from Australians the opportunity to defend themselves, you take from them the incentive to a national feeling. We should provide for our defence the men, the material, and the money. I said that I had no objection to our fleet being sent wherever it could strike the most effective blow, though I have always been strongly of the opinion that the Australian naval unit should be at all times under the control of the Commonwealth Government, subject to the condition that, in time of war, or emergency, it must co-operate under the Admiral of the nearest station for the defence of the Empire. The proposal of the Government is ostensibly to help the Mother Country. It rests upon the declaration of that hysterical period when so many honorable members opposite shouted for the gift of  a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to the Mother Country to protect her against a great European nation. </para>

                <para class="block">The right honorable member has borrowed a phrase from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier. That astute leader stated in regard to the offer of the Dominion of preferential trade to Great Britain that it was given out of love, without any hope of reward or return. The Treasurer paraphrases that in the words "of our own free will." Further on he states that what is proposed is only a very slight increase in our contribution to the defence of the Empire. It is proposed to discontinue the subsidy of £200,000 to the Imperial authorities, and, further, to claim from the latter £250,000 towards the expenses of the Australian unit. Does the Treasurer really mean what he says? Does he mean that Great Britain is to continue to pay £250,000 towards the upkeep of our Navy? The Prime Minister nods his head. Is this an Australian Navy - an Australian-owned, Australian-manned, and Australian-controlled Navy ? It will be seen that this proposal makes a difference to the Old Country of ,£450,000. </para>

                        <para>- We now see what is in the mind of the Government. Because the Imperial authorities are put to considerable expense in maintaining a Fleet here that is not very effective, this patriotic Government say that if the Mother Country practically gives us £450,000, we will borrow £3,500,000 to provide an effective Navy for our own defence. Is that patriotism? Is that the idea the Government have of helping to protect the Mother Country and the Empire? This £250,000 has'been very generously offered at the Imperial Conference, apparently as a means of smoothing the way for the proposal now before us. A more robust, Australian-minded Government would have said to the Mother Country, " You have difficulties and' trials enough in Great Britain, and, seeing that we were prepared to give £2,000,000 for a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> for you, we ask you to keep the £250.000 for your own defence, leaving us to provide the whole of the money for the defence of this part of the world." </para>

                        <para>- What I am saying is quite correct. It may be that some of the ammunition was re-sold; but, at any rate, I know that rifle ranges were made and replaced out of loan moneys in Queensland. We are not, I hope, going to revert to the old rotten method of financing, when money was borrowed for guns which became obsolete in two or three years, and then had to be renewed, again with borrowed money. Such a system would undoubtedly lead to inefficiency and disaster. The Australian people are either capable of providing money for their own defence or they are not. In my opinion, the people, if the\ are invited, will be found prepared to double their contributions towards the defence of Australia. If they are not, I can only say that they can never have thoroughly made up their minds to defend the country. If we borrow £3,500,000, and some of the ships become obsolete in, say, ten years, they will have to be renewed ; and how are they to be renewed on the lines proposed hy the Government ? In ten years' time, roughly speaking, only halt the redemption of the £3,500,000will have been provided, and the probability is that we shall then require a larger navy than now. Another loan will have to be raised; and it is quite clear that it will be much easier for the Government then to float a loan than it is for this Government to initiate the policy. The proposals of the Government were very lucidly set forth by the Treasurer. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps the Prime Minister, or whoever speaks on behalf of the Government, will show us where the urgency is for a loan this year. Is there any demand for  £500,000  for naval construction this year? Even if there be any such demand, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> presume there would be ample time when Parliament met after the el ctions, at the end of April, or the beginning of May, to pars a Bill of this kind, if the policy is confirmed by the electors. If the Government proposals have the approval of the electors, there will be no difficulty, and, consequently, there is no urgency. There is one part of the Treasurer's statement that is rather interesting. The Minister of Defence, when he was in the position of " greater freedom and less responsibility," stated to the press that the River class destroyers, ordered by the previous Government, were unsuitable, and that there was not a single one on the stocks in Great Britain - he ridiculed the idea that such a class should be ordered by any sane Government. The honorable gentleman is in the happy position of being a member of a Government which has, I presume, on the advice of the Admiralty, invited the Parliament to authorize the construction and purchase of these vessels. This shows how little reliance we can place on statements made by critics who are absolutely biased. </para>

                        <para>- An Admiral who occupies a high position in Australia to-day' differed from the Minister of Defence when he made his statement. That apparently does not matter to the honorable member, but the Admiral said that this class of vessel was undoubtedly the best for Australian defence, and that we should get better value for our money from them than from any other class. It is true that the Government have added to all previous proposals the idea of an <inline font-style="italic">Indomitable</inline> or an armoured cruiser. I shall obtain the quotation from the speech of the Minister of Defence. </para>

That, however, is an error which we all forgive him. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want to do the Minister an injustice, and so I have sent for the quotation. I trust the Government will refrain from pressing this measure at this time. I sincerely hope that they will not put up a signboard, which every nation in the world can see, to declare that we are a people not well enough off to find, or capable of finding, the men and money for our own defence. I hope they will take the manly course of appealing to the people for the necessary amount to provide ships and material, and ask every one to bear the burden according to his position and capacity to do so. The Treasurer said that he did not agree with those who said that defence expenditure should not be provided, like public works expenditure, out of borrowed money; but I do not believe there is any country in the world that can justify borrowing for ordinary defence purposes. I could understand a country borrowing when under special disadvantages, or in case of war or emergency ; but in those circumstances the people are always ready to pay an excessive amount of taxation in order to wipe off the indebtedness as early as possible. Great Britain in war time frequently has to increase its indebtedness largely by loans, but coincident with that increase it also increases the taxation on the wealthier portions of the community, until the national debt is brought down again to what is regarded as the ordinary level - an amount equivalent to no indebtedness at all in this country. </para>

                        <para>-  There is no .  doubt that Gladstone had something to do with that policy. Let me put my position again regarding taxation. In a matter of this kind we should face the fact that defence expenditure should be regarded as an annual matter. I admit at once that £3,500,000 is more than can be raised in any one year ; but two and a half years at the least will have passed before the <inline font-style="italic">Indomitable</inline> is launched and paid for. In fact, we may easily say that three years will have gone before a ship of that class is actually equipped and ready for the defence of Australia. In those three years we should be able to raise the total amount of  £3,500,000.  At any rate, it would be possible to do so in five years; although I hold to the three years. If we raised the contribution of the people by 5s. per head per annum, that would practically do it, because  £3,  500, 000 represents between 17s. and 18s. a head, and with an increasing population- </para>

They only add to it, and make it more difficult to free themselves. I quite agree with the Government that the amount of  £3,500,000  should not be raised in one year, but it would add to the spirit and energy, and strengthen the moral fibre of the people of the Commonwealth, if they would tackle their obligations and raise the money in three years, as they are quite capable of doing. </para>

                        <para>- I do not, but my objection is that sixteen years is far too long a period to allow. It is shifting the obligation on to posterity. Posterity will probably in ten years have ships which are practically useless for defence purposes, and only half of the £3,500,000 will then be in the sinking fund. At that time a new obligation will probably arise, because if other countries have improved vessels, it will be necessary for the Commonwealth to have an absolutely new and much larger and more costly navy. If so, the borrowing obligation will then be about  £5,000,000,  which will have to be added to the half of the £3,500,000 not then liquidated. We shall therefore get into the absurd position of not providing the money to pay for our own defence. . </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer explained that the  contribution  would amount to  5  per cent., and his words must be taken as indicating the policy of the Government. Let us assume, and it is not a rash assumption, that ten years hence the ships for which this loan is to provide will be obsolete. At the end of that period there would not be to the credit of the sinking fund more than about  £2,000,000,  so that it . would still be  £1,500,000  short of the amount that we had expended. In the meantime I presume that the electors of Australia would at the end of ten years have demanded that we should have an up-to-date navy like that of any other nation. Are we to ask young Australians to accept the navy now proposed as all that  will  be possible for the next sixteen years? Are we to ask the people to continue a navy that is out of date and obsolete? Does the Treasurer wish us to understand that we are not to do anything more until this sum shall have been paid off? That, at all events, is not my idea of defence, or of the way in which a defence scheme should be inaugurated. It is fundamentally bad from a financial point of view; it is even worse  in  the effect that it will have on the young Australian mind! I agree largely with the view of the Government regarding the owning and manning of the ships, and the position they have taken up in regard to the use of the vessels of our navy in time of war or emergency has been borrowed from their predecessors in office. The late Government communicated with the Imperial authorities in a clear and direct message which we refused to publish at the time. We clearly indicated in our message that these ships should be under the control of the responsible Commonwealth Minister in times of peace, but that in time of war or emergency they should be placed at the service of the Admiralty on the authority of the Commonwealth Ministry. That I think was a clear and distinct policy. With it I entirely agree. My complaint is, however, that the Government have no mandate from the people to put the credit of Australia  in  pawn. They have no mandate from the people to seek to borrow money for defence purposes of this kind,  and if  they succeed it will be a retrograde movement on the part of Australia. We have hitherto refrained from borrowing for any purpose. I should have thought that if we inaugurated a borrowing policy it would be to provide for great public reproductive works. But to enter upon a borrowing policy for defence purposes will be to humiliate the manhood of Australia. A Government that are afraid to ask the people to make, by way of taxation, the necessary provision for defence, may be afraid later on of their own shadows. The honorable member for Parramatta denied a statement. </para>

                        <para>- As the honorable member is not present I shall not read the quotation that I was about to make, but shall put it before him privately. I suppose that no appeal that I may make to honorable members opposite will have any serious effect. They may think that I am biased because of the position that I occupy. I may say at once, however, that the stand I take to-day is by no means new to me. In 1903 I took up the position that I now take up. I believed then as I believe now that the way to inculcate in the minds of a young community like ours right ideas in regard to defence is to tell them that they themselves must provide their own defence, and must provide also the money necessary to it. By borrowing, either here or in any other country, the money necessary for naval defence, we shall fail to inspire the youth of Australia with the idea that they are providing for their own defence. They will still think that the means are being provided by another country, and, in the first stages, at least, the men required to man the fleet will have to be recruited largely from the sailors of the Old Country. They will be joined I hope by young Australians who will take to the sea as they have hitherto taken to the bush. In this great insular continent of ours, lying as it does in the South Pacific, and separated from all the civilized nations of Europe and America, we have imposed upon us a great obligation to start upon right lines. The Government do not propose to recognise it, and they have been unfortunate in their action in regard to borrowing. As to the main policy I give them my support, but I think it was unfortunate that the question of the composition of the unit was not further discussed. Speaking generally, the holding of an Imperial Conference on naval defence was an excellent idea, and I hope that it is not the last that will take place. Indeed, I go further and say that the moire frequent the Conferences between the self-governing Dominions and1 the Mother Country the better for the Empire. </para>

                        <para>- The Imperial Conference on Naval Defence was alter all only a subsidiary one. lt was convened as a subsidiary and not as a main Conference to deal with principles of legislation. It was of necessity a secret Conference, be- . cause the details of the questions that had to be discussed ought not to be in the possession of other nations. We, as a Commonwealth, undoubtedly wish to live at peace with the rest of the world. Our nope is to develop this great continent of ours in peace and quietness ; but at the same time we should be unwise if we were to take the view of some people that  we  can safely relegate to other countries the question of providing a proper means of defence while we leave ourselves open to attack. That would be an unwise position for any Parliament, or Government, or people, to accept. I am therefore in entire agreement with the general line of policy which the Government have proposed, although I am entirely opposed to the position taken up by them with regard to the method of raising the money to carry out that policy. For that reason I hope that this Parliament will not accept the proposal of the Government to borrow. I trust that the Government's own followers will ask them to withdraw from their present position until they have consulted the electors on this point. The electors on the occasion of two distinct general elections have condemned the policy of borrowing, and I believe that they will not now indorse it, although the Government say that it is necessary for the purpose of naval defence. I believe that they are ready and willing to pay the taxation necessary for that purpose, and that until they have refused to do so we should refuse to believe that they hold any other opinion. It ' the people of Australia say that they are not prepared to make a contribution, by means of taxation, to cover the expenses of the fleet in at least five years, I shall take it as a declaration that they are not prepared to adopt that line of defence. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so j I am simply offering the honorable member my felicitations upon the way in which he has opened this debate. I hope to be even more brief than he, although it appears to me that the subject must be approached from a somewhat different angle. This is not the first step towards naval defence, although it is by far the longest and most decisive that we have attempted. The scheme comes before this House and the people of Australia with the sanction of a discussion extending over some years, increasing in the closeness of its criticism and in the extent of the knowledge available to us. The Trea-surer !s reference to the conscious acceptance by the Dominions of the Empire of a share of the responsibility of a defence, which is not only their own defence from a narrow point of view, but their own defence from every point of view - Imperial, national, and local - must commend itself to all. It has become impossible for self-governing and self-respecting communities to consent to be dependent even upon their own, nearest and dearest kinsmen for those acts of citizenship which, though they take place with arms in hand, are just as much a necessary part of their duties as any others essential to the daily maintenance of the community in which we live. We in Australia probably realize more than European countries are called upon to do, that failure to provide for our defence would mean not merely the loss of the old flag, of our place in the Empire, and of the freedom which they assure, but possibly the destruction of every social, religious, and political ideal that we now cherish. These being at stake, our people are justified in asking themselves, and still more in asking us, their representatives, how we stand prepared for a crisis which might break upon us with but brief warning. In these times of combinations, not only among classes and industrial interests, but also among nations, that crisis might well be a war which, so far as the Empire is concerned, would be waged on every ocean, and on more than one continent. I shall not attempt to develop further the all-important series of considerations which we must bear in mind when putting to ourselves the simple question, "Are we prepared for the defence of Australia, one of the largest, richest, least populated, and most distant of the dominions of the Empire ?' ' We have made this year a decided advance, having dealt with the requirements of land defence with greater liberality - and with greater efficiency - than ever before. It has been realized from the first thai its necessary complement must lie the most efficient naval defence we can provide. The remarks of the Treasurer this morning gave a sufficient sketch of the stages by which we have arrived at the conviction that upon the sea the future of the Empire lies, and there not in fleets owned and manned entirely by the Mother Country, but in a great Imperial Navy, embracing the fleets of the Mother Country and subsidiary fleets, built and manned, and, in times of peace, controlled by the Dominions which make them their care and charge. What we owe to the recent Naval Conference is, as the Leader of the Opposition very properly put it, the consummation and completion of the work of previous Conferences, and of a long though intermittent discussion. The advance at Home since  1907  is remarkable. In the first instance, our own proposals for local naval defence were of the most modest character. What is sometimes termed a mosquito fleet was proposed : small vessels available for the defence of harbors and for offensive operations at no great distance from the mainland, in association with the forts, and as auxiliaries to the British squadron in these seas. Gradually that skeleton scheme has enlarged and materialized. It was left for the Defence Conference to submit to the self-governing Dominions, after discussion with their representatives, proposals not merely for small auxiliary naval defences, but the creation and maintenance of what might be called self-dependent fleets, or more properly, "fleet units." These will be sufficiently strong and self-supporting to provide for the adequate training of the men and officers employed on them. That is an all-important consideration governing the size of the unit planned for Australia, and the other two units which are to be its companions in the great Eastern Fleet. Otherwise, unless there were perpetual transfers to distant squadrons of the Empire, perhaps on the other side of the world, which would involve great cost and loss of time, we should never be able to maintain the efficiency demanded by the British Navy. The crews of our vessels could not 'be kept abreast of the latest tactics, which in that progressive navy are always being amended. We must remain in a sense parasitic, until each dominion possesses a unit which in itself suffices for the training of almost all engaged on it. To-day, at comparatively small expense and with little delay we are to have what may fairly be termed an Australian squadron, a unit constituting one-third of the great fleet which will protect the Imperial flag, Australia, and other British possessions in the eastern Pacific. At the late Conference the Government were represented by one of its members, to whom we owe a debt of gratitude for the thorough, patient, and untiring manner in which he successfully accomplished his work. No one is in a better position than I to appreciate all that we owe to him. Our departure is important, both to us and to the Empire. -We are offered, by the expert advisers of the Admiralty, the best heads the world possesses to advise on naval affairs, not merely a political device to gratify the public spirit of this country, but a scheme of real defence with its conditions of employment and control in peace and war denned for us in the printed documents which have been presented to Parliament with the reports of the Conference. It is this remarkable stride, our entrance into a new sphere of practical naval defence, that brings us face to face with the necessity for making an entirely new departure, if we are to be true to the aspirations we have previously expressed, and worthy of the responsibility given to us and the other Dominions by the Mother Country. The House has, I am happy to say, assented to a resolution which, though carried under unfavorable circumstances - I should have liked the discussion to be fuller - is in some respects the more significant because it shows that, subject to the qualifications of one sort and another which individual members might have wished to make, it expresses the unanimous conviction of this Chamber. That is a very important thing, and deserving of notice. The manner in which the motion was agreed to demonstrated, as by a touchstone, how far the mind of this House has developed. The proposal of the Admiralty for this Australian unit has been cordially adopted, and that at once. The Leader'of the Opposition - and I am, for the sake of brevity, grouping remarks which he made in various parts of his speech - said truly that the points of difference between his party and ours begin, not in respect to the construction of the proposed Australian unit, or the conditions of its manning or control, but in respect to the question how the fleet is to be financially provided for. This being a financial Bill, that question must bulk largely in our minds at the present time. The honorable member expressed the sense of the House when he said that up to this point we march side by side, that there is no party division, and, we believe, there is no division in the country either. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Happily there has been a great growth of national, Australian, or as some would prefer to term it, Imperial sentiment, a general sense of the unity of Australia, distinguished from the old sectional feeling which, prevailed for a time. It is felt that Australia has a great future, if we are worthy of it, full of great opportunities which require to be seized. That feeling strengthens year by year. Witness the support given today to what a few years ago would have been termed ambitious schemes of land and sea defence, not then treated as serious or practical proposals. In this House we are apt to unduly magnify our disagreements, and I rejoice, therefore, that so far we are in harmony. Our paths divide when we come to the question, " How is the fleet to be provided for?" Before touching upon that, may I indicate a point in which our attitude may. differ from that of our honorable friends, though I am not sure that it does. The Leader of trie Opposition conveyed to me an impression that he enjoys a leisurely and comfortable expectation of an immediate future of international peace. Claiming in this respect no more information than any other honorable member, I have formed an opposite opinion which may or may not be snared by my colleagues. No man who reads the cable messages which are published every week, and almost every day, describing the increasing naval expenditure of one or other of the great nations of the world, can entertain much confidence that the peace of the world will be maintained, even amongst civilized communities, for more than a relatively short period. God grant it may; and for a long period. But no assurance is being supplied while many circumstances, extremely disquieting to the thoughtful, are presented in the most open fashion. We may be sure that if there be in the mind of a statesman or a nation an intent to provoke or commence war, earlier or later, the most serious preparations which they make will not appear in the cable columns of the daily press. What appears there is what cannot be concealed - what is known to everybody. I trust there may be nothing to conceal, but of that we know nothing. I approach this question from the stand-point of one who believes that the relations between the great Powers may "be fairly described as critical, and, within a few years, are likely to be still more critical. At the present moment, as every one may see, even the most civilized powers are arming with something like frantic haste, especially for naval defence. Under the circumstances, if we in  Australia  are to be prepared to meet the possible shock, and, if needs he, do our share in assisting to make the risk less attractive and render it more undesirable far aggressive peoples to enter on the combat, I do not think any of us will say - and certainly the Leader of the Opposition did not - that, while agreeing with and cordially indorsing this particular proposal for naval defence, we can afford to postpone the construction of our unit. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that is so; but my point is that we not only need our fleet unit, but we need it now - we need it without delay. When the honorable member admits that borrowing may be necessary in time of war and emergency, there is the obvious reply that, if we have good reason to suspect the need is coming, it is bad business to delay borrowing until war or emergency come, if only because we have then to pay much more dearly for what we want. If we can foresee an inevitable expenditure, the sooner we face it in times of- quiet, before the disturbance is close at hand, the better. Then again, there are many things in modern society which even money cannot buy on the instant, and one thing above all others, which the richest nation in the world cannot buy in a moment, is naval strength. That includes, of course, naval training and general efficiency. Let me call attention to the building of vessels of war, by what might be termed without offence minor Powers, not very likely to need them, which they may be persuaded to sell for a consideration. These are always watched and reckoned with by nations able to purchase in an emergency. It is perfectly clear now, even to the most uninformed, that to obtain the simple unit, proposed at the Imperial Conference, and indorsed by the advisers of the Admiralty, will take two years and a half, and mean an expenditure of  £3,500,000.  In our opinion, this is not a matter which ought to be postponed. The answer I make to my honorable friend's plea that we should put this aside until after we have consulted the people at the elections is that such a course would mean a delay of at least six months. In my opinion, we have not six months to spare - we have not six months to throw away. In the meantime, in the present condition of affairs, having regard to the fact that our new unit has to be built up from the beginning, and that we have much other organization to accomplish in connexion with it, we could not calmly look forward to delaying another six months, even to have an opportunity for consulting the people. If we could consult the electors it would, from a Ministerial point of view, be a distinct advantage, seeing that it would relieve us from a serious responsibility we are now assuming. We gain nothing Ministerially from a purely electoral point of view bv taking our present course. When the Leader of the Opposition, in criticising our proposed action, asked where was responsible government. I was sorely tempted to interject that this was responsible government if anything was, because we were seeking to act first, taking our responsibility for acting within a few weeks afterwards at the hands of the electors. I do not think we have anything electorally to gain, but I believe Australia has something to gain by the saving of six months. </para>

                        <para>- I put the saving at the lowest estimate. Two courses, and only two, are open to us. If we propose to commence at once, we must either tax or borrow sufficiently to find  £3,500,000  in two years and a half. I think that some portion of my honorable friend's speech might have been taken to imply an oversight of the fact that, in the case of this unit, we require to give our orders early in order that they may be attended to, and that we must make heavy progress payments regularly as the structure proceeds. </para>

                        <para>- Let me press this part of my argument. What taxation have honorable members in their minds which would give us £500,000 in addition to the £600,000 provided under the financial agreement during this financial year, and a sum from the same source calculated to be at least £1,000,000 for the next financial year? We should need it all. Then we should also have to find out of taxation £2,500,000 more' within the next two years. Even a -rich and prosperous community like Australia would find that no inconsiderable burden.' To that must be added, of course, the cost of the machinery and means of raising it. As my honorable friends opposite, when in office, realized, Federal land taxation involves a prolonged series of investigations and valuations, occupying a considerable period before there could even be a basis for the levy. I fancy that if the Leader of the Opposi-tion still had control of the Commonwealth Treasury, and was presented with a problem of this character, even he, with his dislike of borrowing - which to a considerable extent I myself share - could not refuse to give the Commonwealth its unit fleet. If he gave that, he could not refuse to adopt the means which the Government are now proposing for providing its cost. It seems to me that to propose such extra taxation at the present time, or during the next two and a half years, is really not practical politics. The money could hot be obtained. The crisis at the coming election would be keen indeed if such a proposal were submitted; personally I have very little doubt as to what the response would be. The people of Australia, while perfectly willing to face all their responsibilities for land and sea defence and local development, would say they were not prepared within the next two or three years to endeavour to anticipate payments that are fairly spread over the next fifteen or sixteen years. They would say that this was a demand out of reason, and that they were entitled to be considered by a gradual adjustment to their backs of the new burden about to be imposed. Personally, I come to a proposal for borrowing in connexion with naval defence, or defence of any kind, with a great deal of reluctance. I am not enamoured of borrowing, even for reproductive works, when borrowing can be avoided ; but I am unable to dispute the undoubted fact that, borrowing can be best justified in a young progressive community which is still unfurnished with a great many of the means of development required. Although rich in resources and prospects, we ought not to discourage those prospects by heavy taxation. As a mere matter of business, we shall find the investment cheaper if we resort to the means to which every great enterprise is obliged to resort, so that the burden may be more evenly and fairly distributed over the people. But. above all, we shall then be in a position, as soon as conveniently practicable, to enable the country to take its share of Imperial defence. I do not wish to press too far calculations, which, though the Leader of the Opposition has indicated them vaguely, are not limited to his 5s. a head, or to £1,000,000 a year. Taking into account the heavy cost of the old-age pensions and allowing for the £2,500,000 a year we hope to gain under the financial agreement, the Treasurer had no other resource but to follow the road we have taken, unless the unit had to be postponed. The Leader of the Opposition, has repeated several times his apprehension that this borrowing policy is all the graver, because he believes that, once commenced, it wil.l continue. Indicating that a whetted appetite will seek for gratification, he insisted that extra demands would be encouraged fer larger and more costly navies. He insisted that within ten years at least we might expect the navy to be renewed or enlarged, and claimed that consequently we could not look upon  £3,500,000  as the limit of our borrowing even in this regard. We must be prepared for a still larger expenditure. I do not know that it is necessary at this stage to follow the honorable member in that line of argument sufficiently to determine whether from our point of view his opinion is justified or not. I will only say that, accepting his own foreboding, he supplies us with another and still stronger argument for the necessity of the step we are now taking.  If we shall need a stronger and more costly navy in ten years, it shows that we badly need the navy now proposed. No one will forecast a stronger and more costly navy within, the next ten years, unless the present expenditure is believed insufficient. If my honorable friend's forecast is correct, it proves that we are not too lavish, but, if anything, rather mean today. He holds that even  £3,500,000  is not going to give us an adequate defence. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly ; and if we are going to need more than we now ask within the next few years, it will mean that even the million or million and a half per year of new taxation involved in the alternative proposal of the Opposition will be insufficient. In addition to putting on at once new taxation to that amount, we should have to look forward to increasing it within a few years bv another half-million or million. What would the people of Australia say to us if we asked them within the next seven or ten years to build up out of taxation a fleet for the defence of Australia which, without regard to the growth of land defence, was going to cost us millions a year all out of new taxes? 1 could not understand this view, or attach greater weight to it if our fleet unit were to be really the only defence of Australia, but, as a matter of fact, it will be but a part of a great Eastern Fleet of thirty, nine vessels. It is upon that fleet Australia will depend for her naval defence. Whatever naval battles may be fought for the protection of Australia, the invader will ,be faced by those three units in combination. Until any mass power brought into these waters is dispersed, that fleet will operate, as its name implies and as is intended, as one fleet, under one flag, and one control, thus dealing with the one grave danger which the British Dominions in this part of the world have to face. Consequently, although even the thirty-nine vessels may in time be found insufficient for all the needs of these great waters, I do not at present look with much apprehension to greatly increasing needs for the next few years. Of course, in prophesying, we are all equal. We all start from scratch, and our achievements are taken with great reservations. The Leader of the Opposition, at one part of his speech, appeared to define an Australian Navy as one of which all the ships must be built in Australia, manned only by .Australians, and the money spent upon them raised in Australia. To take the last first, it might be the unkindest thing to Australian industries and interests if the money for an Australian Fleet were withdrawn from here. I quite' admit that in the case of the third destroyer, which we hope to see successfully put together in Australia, and of the three others which the Minister of Defence hopes, as he said, to see built in Australia, the money might well be raised in Australia, instead of being transmitted from England, but in the present special circumstances, the naval resources of Australia are barely sufficient to build the destroyers. I fear they are not yet sufficient to attempt the cruisers, and are certainly not capable of the construction in any reasonable time of the <inline font-style="italic">Indefatigable</inline> armoured cruiser, which will represent the real heart and force of our unit. Australian building being impossible, that vessel will have to be' obtained from the greatest, shipbuilding yards in the world, under the most skilled supervision - that of the Admiralty itself. We shall have the assurance that the vessel that we get will be one of the best and most recent types, and thoroughly up-to-date, from the fact that it will be built under those conditions. Although built in England, it will be none the less Australian in its operation when it arrives in. these waters under the old flag, and none the less Australian if it is paid for by money not raised in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree. It applies only to forms of production in which the Mother Country has a monopoly so far as we are concerned, and in some respects a monopoly so far as the world is concerned. She has few if any rivals. In these special circumstances we have the great guarantee that we shall get the best article. The building  of that vessel in Great Britain, and the paying for it by money raised in Great Britain, does not, in the sense in which the honorable member for Wide Bay used the term, really place us under a further obligation to the Mother Country. London is still the money market of the world, not perhaps unchallengeable in supremacy-, but still deserving the title better than any other city. To London all nations, or most . of them, resort when they desire to obtain money, and if we resort there in preference to anywhere else we are only taking a course which is wise and prudent, and, at the same time, patriotic. . It is certainly a course which would be welcomed there, since the British lender is always seeking for securities of the high class which, fortunately, Australia is able to offer. So far as Australian money and Australian ships are concerned, I am in many respects largely with my honorable friend. There is nothing in the Bill which prevents the raising of all or any part of the money in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- No, not by taxation. But if, without unduly depleting the money market, and injuring local development - the danger of that has always to be borne in mind in a new country - we could obtain the money in Australia at as reasonable a price as in London, we should cer.tainly be inclined to take it. If we could obtain it at a lower price, we should certainly take it. There is no restriction in the Bill upon the obtaining of the money, except that the Treasurer must secure the best possible terms. So with the building of the ships. The idea will be, if .possible, to undertake the building of the destroyers there, and so pave the way for the building of cruisers, which, having regard to the extent of our coast-line and the work to be undertaken, will naturally form a considerable arm of any naval force that Australia will maintain. I fear that the days when we can look forward to the construction in Australia of armoured cruisers of the highest type are sufficiently beyond the probable duration of the present Administration to render it unnecessary for me to refer to them. Might I also remind the Leader of the Opposition of two points criticised, and which are not necessarily confused, as he appeared to suppose? He will find in the official papers of the Conference that the statement in regard to the £250,000 per annum is as follows - </para>

As I interjected at the time, even allowing for both amounts, for the fact that the new-armoured cruiser alone, in weight of metal, strength, speed, and efficiency, will outclass, and could destroy, the whole of the existing squadron, and that the new squadron, therefore, will be far superior in variety of ships, completeness, character, and weight of metal, yet that new fleet unit is put at the service of the Empire at a cost of half-a-million pounds a year less than is paid by the Admiralty for the present inadequate and unsatisfactory squadron. Surely we are entitled to derive some gratification from the fact that not only will Australia be better protected by this fleet unit, but that we are building up not merely a separate squadron, but a new fleet, known as the Eastern Fleet, which will maintain the interests of the whole Empire in these seas. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that it will be. It will fall on the Customs revenue only until this .Parliament, with the sanction of the people, thinks fit to widen the area of its taxation, and when that may be will not depend upon any individuals or majority here. The Leader of the Opposition alluded to the insufficiency of a sinking fund of £175,000 a year. On that point, again, I am not inclined to disagree with him. On the contrary, it will be wise, and we shall be fortunate if we are able, to put aside a larger sum, and provide a sinking fund which will equal the debt we are now incurring before the sixteen years are over, and, if possible, in about half that period, or, at any rate, in ten years. That question was considered by the Cabinet. The 4 per cent, appears in the Bill on the recommendation of the Admiralty ; that being the reserve fund which they would establish if they were providing out of loan moneys for the cost of vessels  of  this type and character. The provision for an annual contribution to the sinking fund of an amount equal to 4 per cent,  of  the sum raised was inserted in the Bill on expert advice. On consideration in Cabinet we decided to go farther, making it obligatory to pay into the sinking fund every year an amount equal to 5 per cent, of the amount borrowed. We also took into consideration how far it would be wise to increase that amount. On the whole, having in view the uncertainties of the next few years in regard to the expenditure that must be incurred if the untoward events which these preparations are designed to meet should -happen, we thought the wisest course to pursue was to make provision for a fixed payment, and allow the Treasurer of the day to set apart from year to year such a sum as Parliament may think fit. The proposed contribution of £175,000 a year to the sinking fund, so far as we can foresee, can be increased without much difficulty by another £75,000 per annum. That will mean a very considerable difference in the period to run according to present prospects. We deemed it wise to follow the line of prudence and safety, and whilst we have provided for a higher contribution to a sinking fund than, so far as I know, has. been thought of in Australia, in connexion with loans of this character, we confidently expect the Parliaments of the future to face this obligation with at least as much courage as we feel to-day, putting aside a sufficient sum to reduce considerably the term of that sinking fund. </para>

                        <para>- The sinking funds  of  one or two of the States - and particularly of Western Australia - are very considerable. If I have made these few points with any clearness, I have trespassed sufficiently on the patience of the House. There are only two questions to be considered. The first, that briefly alluded to at the outset, is as to what we need, and when we need it. In my opinion we need at least this unit, and need it now. That being so, we have to consider the second question how the funds to provide for that unit shall be raised. Could any scheme be suggested which would allow the cost to fall more evenly and lightly on the Commonwealth? Having regard to the fact that this is the first occasion on which any of the Dominions oversea have faced the necessities of their situation, and have undertaken to create a fleet which, in peace time, will be under their control, and both in peace and in war at their charge and cost, I am reluctant to believe that we shall fail to find in the money market of England a very cordial welcome from those who have not only their own sovereigns in mind, but the future of the Empire at heart. </para>

                        <para>- I believe so. We propose to put it to the test within the next two or three months by asking the people of Australia to indorse the action which this Government has taken. If the Government were unable now to obtain the assent of Parliament to this proposal, we should go to the people with the same proposition and ask for their authority. If the necessary authority were refused by Parliament we should ask it from the people. We are convinced that the national emergency has made itself plain to the great bulk of the Australian people; that the future of this continent is much in their regard, that deep in their hearts they realize that the time for sacrifice has come, and that without sacrifice no nation can be built up. The sacrifices they are asked to make to-day for land and sea defence are but the first that they will make for the sake of their own manhood, their own country, and their own Empire. The Government run an unnecessary electoral risk" in facing the electors immediately after taking upon themselves a responsibility that they might have left on the shoulders of their constituents, but they do so without fear, and in all confidence. For my own part, rather than accept the responsibility of postponing the defence of Australia's needs, I would prefer to be beaten at the elections, and to leave the responsibility of the neglect of our greatest national interests to some other Government. </para>

                    <para>.- I was extremely pleased to hear the cheers that greeted the last phrase which fell from the lips of the Prime Minister, because I happen to be a member of a party which six years ago stood almost alone in this Parliament in the expression of such sentiments, and was prepared then to put its policy before the country. It is a matter for congratulation on the' part of the Labour party, that the Prime Minister should now declare that it is the duty of the people of Australia to provide for their own defence and to pay for it, and that he would rather be beaten at the polls than go back upon the policy that he has put forward. One may be pardoned for referring with some pride to the fact that six years ago the Labour party in the face of strong criticism, and notwithstanding the accusation that they were bringing forward chimerical projects and Utopian proposals impossible nf accomplishment, stood by their proposals, and that they are indorsed to-day by the people. We were opposed by the Government of which the present Prime Minister was a member, when we submitted the very proposal- </para>

                        <para>- The Minister of Defence, who is leaving the Chamber, was not then prepared to vote for an expenditure of even  £80,000  to provide for an Australian Navy. Nothing but a continuance or an increase of the subsidy paid by Australia to Great Britain, and which meant the annihilation of the proposal to create an Australian Navy, would satisfy him. There were then before the country two propositions in respect of naval defence. One was that we should increase the naval subsidy paid to Great Britain, and the other was that we should establish an Australian Navy. </para>

                        <para>- I think not ; if I am the honorable member is entitled to correct me. He may perhaps be able to bring forward evidence that he was of a different opinion, and I admit that some honorable members now supporting the Government held that we should increase the naval subsidy to Great Britain, and also gradually build up an Australian Navy. Generally speaking, however, there were two antagonistic policies, one being that we should adopt at the earliest possible moment a system of building up a navy for ourselves, and the other a proposal to increase the naval subsidy to Great Britain. I think that on such an occasion as this I am justified in drawing attention to the fact that although this naval project some six years ago was held by the Conservative press and many so-called Liberal newspapers in Australia to be utterly impracticable and chimerical, it is approved to-day almost unanimously by the people of Australia. At the time to which I refer it was supported only by the Labour party, the honorable member for Dallev. and one or two other honorable members of this House. Then, again. T cannot help feeling some satisfaction in thp knowledge that whilst the proposals that have now been submitted bv the Government are more complete - as they should be - than any which have previously been submitted it was the Fisher Government which forced the situation and brought the matter to a head by placing an order for the construction of three torpedo boats of the River class. That proposal was adversely criticised by the then Leader of the Opposition - the present Minister of Defence ; but, as a matter of fact. I understand that the Prime Minister's scheme of an earlier date included proposals for the construction of vessels of the River type, and submarines. </para>

The Labour Administration were under no such pledge, and we laid violent hands on the money which had been placed to the credit of a fund for the specific purpose of providing for naval defence, with the result that we were not only the first to proceed with' a complete scheme, but forced our successors to go on with that scheme to create an Australian Navy to co-operate with the Mother Country and the other Dominions in the defence of the Empire. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> scare had a great deal to do with the advertising of the need for Australian defence, and helped to bring about the unanimity on the subject which now exists, but anything more foreign to the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> proposal than the scheme under consideration is hardly conceivable. The objection to the proposal that Australia should provide <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> for the Old Country was that it would prevent the creation of an Australian Navy to co-operate with the British Navy, and would be no part of the scheme which the supporters of an Australian Navy favour. It is satisfactory to know that the Imperial naval authorities are now in absolute agreement. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to. criticise Canada. Her stand was somewhat different from ours, and perhaps had the effect of bringing the Imperial naval authorities to see the advantage of co- operation with a certain degree of local autonomy. Their agreement is a very great gain to the defence of the Empire. I believe with the Prime Minister that the people are with us. I think, too, that they  are  generally agreed as to the need for compulsory training. Certainly, all those who think, and many who do not think much, believe that defence is a national duty, and are prepared to make sacrifices for it. I should like to see a method adopted for testing the genuineness of this feeling. My opinion is that the people are prepared to pay taxes directly for the defence of the country. One of the chief reasons why I object to the Bill is that the Government does not provide for direct contributions for defence. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It was not so a few years ago. The Government propose a course which will prevent the electors from being heard on this matter. If it obtains authority to borrow 500,000, proposals for providing for the expense of the scheme cannot be put before the electors. I presume that the money will be raised at the first favourable opportunity. </para>

                        <para>- How does the honorable member know that? The Northern Territory railway may be constructed in portions that will enable it to be reproductive. I do not know that the present Government have been conspicuously in favour of continuing the no-borrowing policy. We heard rumours of borrowing, and later we found the Treasurer proposing to raise money by loan in order to meet a temporary shortage of funds during the present year. That idea, however, was knocked on the head or dropped, and we then had the financial agreement with the Premiers. </para>

                        <para>- In any case, the present policy is as far removed from that previously followed as any policy could be. It is not now a question of borrowing for reproductive works or for works that might possibly be reproductive in time. We are, on the contrary, invited to sanction borrowing for works which cannot possibly be reproductive, or even permanent, but which must in a few years become obsolete, and will  leave us absolutely nothing to show for our money. No form of defence becomes obsolete so quickly as ships of war. By the time it is expected that the loan will be repaid with a sinking fund of 5 per cent., I suppose that not one of the ships will be considered serviceable. I do not think that there is a single ship in the fighting line of the British Navy to-day which was there sixteen years ago; indeed, as a matter of fact, the developments in naval architecture are such that the tendency now is to place vessels on the scrap heap even earlier than formerly. The whole naval fighting strength of Great Britain has been made up since the launching of the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> which is now considered the basis of the two-power standard. </para>

                        <para>- Lord Charles Beresford takes the view that some of the old ships are still serviceable, but it must be admitted that he stands alone amongst naval experts, and we know him to bc a fighting Admiral rather than a naval architect. Defence, and especially naval defence, ought to be the last work for which we should borrow. The ground which the Prime Minister gives for departing from our previous policy is that we cannot otherwise raise £1,500,000 in a year, or  £3,500,000  in the next three years. I am not so sure that we could not raise the money by other means if we so desired. The burden of the Prime Minister's remarks this afternoon was that we are in a position of extreme danger, or that, at an \ rate, the outlook is ominous ; and I* am quite sure that if that be so, and the necessity for raising money were put seriously to the people, they would respond. </para>

                        <para>- It is very questionable whether the money would come out of that fund, seeing that the bulk of the work would be done here, and it would be returned in wages. I am very sorry that the Government have not given the electors an opportunity to express their views on this matter ; and this forms one of the most serious accusations that can- be brought against the Government in connexion with the proposed borrowing. This Bill is introduced on' the eve of the close of Parliament, thus preventing any expression of opinion by the people at the general election. </para>

                        <para>- The people have had no opportunity of expressing an opinion as to the inauguration of a loan policy. As a matter of fact, they have never had an opportunity of agreeing to a policy of large expenditure on naval defence. I am prepared to take the responsibility of agreeing to that policy, because I am certain that the people are in favour of it. On questions of national defence Parliament is entitled to take risks, and is not expected to wait for a general election in order to consult the electors when the country is in jeopardy. It is necessary to take early steps to guard against danger. I do not think there is the smallest doubt that the electors will indorse what this Parliament has done in passing the Naval Defence and Military Defence Bills, but it was wholly unnecessary for the Government to propose to borrow money to provide for the expenditure for some three years hence. There was no need for them to ask for authority to float£3,500,000 when a good deal of the money will not be required for about two and a half years. At the very outside not more than £500,000 will be required during the next twelve months. </para>

                        <para>- That would be only a subterfuge. Is it necessary on the eve of an election to pass this measure without giving the people an opportunity to decide whether defence in all its forms should be paid for out of direct taxation, or whether we should resort to a borrowing policy? There will be ample time after the elections to deal with the question. In authorizing this loan, we are at the beginning of what is admitted everywhere to be a pernicious system. I do not mean that borrowing in itself is necessarily pernicious ; but to borrow for what is wholly unproductive, for works which are not only not permanent, but which will shortly be obsolete, is to institute a new and pernicious system. </para>

                        <para>- Is it necessary to borrow for our protection ? Honorable members opposite want to borrow because they wish to avoid their absolute duty of asking the people to find the money out of their own pockets. The public are not afraid to take up this burden. If it is necessary for us to find £3,500,000 in the next three years, the people, when called upon, will do it, and there is no necessity to go to the bond-holder. We have not reached a stage at which we have to borrow for our protection. We can pay for our own protection, and the people are quite ready to do it. Honorable members opposite are anxious to avoid paying a land tax, and that wealth should escape paying its just share. They want the burden of defence to be thrown on the masses of the people. They would put the heaviest burdens on those least able to bear them, as is the case with all Customs taxation. The burden of protecting the rich man's property and goods is to be thrown on to the backs of those least able to bear it - the people with the largest families - because the interest on this money will all come out of Customs taxation. True, that is protection, but it is protection of the wealthy at the expense of the poor. </para>

All the wealthy classes, all those whose interests are specially looked after by the House of Lords, all those whose representatives in this country are behind the Fusion party opposite, all the great commercial and banking concerns, all the great land-owners of the Old Country, are banded together in order to prevent the just taxation of wealth to provide for the proper protection! of the. nation. So here, the party opposite will adopt any scheme to avoid asking the wealthy classes to pay their fair share of the burden of defence. Honorable members opposite prate about patriotism, and about the duty of every man to do his best to protect the country.

I do not cafe very much what system of taxation is adopted in order to provide the money. Every honorable member opposite knows that the people are ready to find the necessary funds. Notwithstanding the humbug talked, they know that there is a serious possibility of menace to Australia unless we properly protect ourselves. I believe also that those who have the money, those behind the Fusion party, will be prepared if called upon to contribute their fair share. I believe that land taxation, income taxation, or any other form of direct taxation which this or any ether Government introduced, would find a ready acceptance at the hands of the electors, if the Government only had the pluck to put it before them. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that there is a natural tendency for everybody to load the other fellow with the burden, but there is in the Australian community to-day  a  spirit which is genuinely in favour of making some sacrifice in order to provide the funds necessary to place this country in a position to properly maintain its integrity.  I  believe that in saying that I am speaking for the wealthy classes as well as for those who are poor. ' The poorer classes must always pay their share by means of Customs taxation. To those below the line of comfortable existence, every penny that they have to pay in taxation means actual deprivation of some of the minor luxuries or even the necessaries of life. There are thousands of men out of work to-day owing to the coal miners1 strike. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. I was not in the South Australian Parliament when the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> was constructed, and, therefore, I do not hold myself responsible for what was done bv it in that regard. But the question of whether South Australia did or did not provide for the cost of the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> out of loan money has nothing whatever tb do with the matter now before us. What we have to consider is whether it is true, as the Government allege, that Australia could not, within the next three years, raise  , £3,500,000  to pay for these vessels. The people have never been put to the test, and the Government are not giving them an opportunity to say whether or not they themselves are willing to provide for the cost of these vessels. I am convinced that if any reasonable proposal for raising this money during the next three years were submitted to the people, it would be carried, and that the party who opposed it would be annihilated. I should not hesitate to put before the electors of South Australia a proposal to raise the necessary money within that period. I admit that the amount is somewhat large, but I would remind honorable members that the circumstances are unusual. We are assured by the Prime Minister that the present situation is distinctly ominous and menacing. Only a few years ago the Treasurer asked, "What is a million? A pint of beer all round, and you have it." Do honorable members think that the people would not be prepared to provide even more than that? </para>

                        <para>- I think that they would. I should be sorry to have so poor an opinion of the people of Australia as to believe that they would not be prepared to raise , £1,000,000 per annum for this purpose during the next three years. On the contrary, I feel that they would readily do so, and that the Government, in seeking to carry this proposal, on the eve of a general election, are endeavouring to prevent the people from expressing their views with regard to it, and are laying the foundation of a system which will do lasting damage to the Commonwealth. Throughout their career, the Government have been most reactionary, and one of the most reactionary measures which they have introduced is that now before us. I hope that it will be rejected. </para>

                    <para>.-The Prime Minister, in speaking to this question, delivered one of the most eloquent speeches that he has made in this Chamber, and in his concluding remarks, metaphorically speaking, drew about him the mantle of Imperialism. I have no objection to his doing so, but this newly-awakened cry of Imperialism is by no means new to me. </para>

                <para class="block">Ever since I have had an opportunity to vote, and to take part in public affairs, I have, in season and out of season, been a stubborn and robust advocate of Imperialism and Imperialistic thought. As an Australian, I do not associate Imperialism with Chamberlainism, or any other "ism," or with any party that may happen to have charge of the public affairs of the Motherland. I read into the principle that which I am sure Australians generally read into it. To my mind, it means the maintenance of our own nation, the supremacy of the British Empire in the Pacific and elsewhere - in other words the paramountcy, of the Power to which we belong. As the Prime Minister has said, . there have been in connexion with the question of defence rapid strides, and in many cases speedy changes of opinion. We are told not only in this Parliament, but in the Parliaments of the Empire, that the question of defence - the question of the maintenance of the supremacy of our own race - is far above party considerations, and free from any "isms." The Prime Minister, together with his colleagues, in approaching this question, has said from the very inception, that it is a non-party one, and I am sure that the House was thoroughly in accord with five-sixths of the powerful address which he delivered. Indeed, we agreed last week to the naval proposals of the Government. We are unanimous in our approval of the decision of the Imperial Defence Committee which met only a few months- ago. We are willing to give credit, not only to the representative of the Commonwealth Government at that Conference, but to the authors of the innovation of a national Conference to mould for the time being a system of naval defence for the whole Empire. We have to deal only with the civil side of the Question : so far as the naval and military sides are concerned, we have to rely upon the opinions of experts. The Imperial Defence Conference consisted of delegates from all parts of the Empire, who met to confer with the central authorities in Great Britain, assisted by their expert advisers, and to arrive at some common line of action for the defence of the Empire. So far as that is concerned, the House and the country are unanimous.. Australia is not only prepared, but is willing and anxious to play her part earnestly and effectively in the work of naval defence. It was quite unnecessary for the Prime </para>
                <para class="block">Minister to call to his aid the power of rhetoric in dealing with this question. It was unnecessary for him  to use his skilful powers of declamation, and to appeal through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and the press, to the people of Australia, as if this Parliament were wanting in its true duty in respect of matters of defence. The section in Australia opposed to a naval policy is infinitesimally small. There may <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> in the Commonwealth, as there are in the heart of the Empire, a few individuals who are opposed to national defence, but we aro swayed to-day by national aspirations - bv a desire not to get away from the Motherland, but to strengthen the tie which binds us to her - the strongest of all bonds - the bond of race and kin. There was no necessity for an appeal such as has been made by the Prime Minister, and I was astounded when I heard him rise to such heights of eloquence in his closing remarks, and saw him gathering about him, so to speak, the folds of the Union Jack. I am pleased to think that the Prime Minister, an Australian born, is to-day an ardent and powerful advocate of the Imperial idea. It is not long since he was not so strongly in favour of it. lt is not long since he was rather in favour of a distinctly Australian Navy. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to put the position unfairly, hut I think it will be admitted that at one time the Prime Minister was not an outstanding advocate of Imperialism. He was always a loyal citizen of the Empire, always proud of his own country, and no one' is more pleased than I am to find him now adding the great weight of his influence to the advocacy of an Imperial sentiment. Since the Prime Minister jaw fit to make a powerful appeal of this character to the House, it is well for those who are opposed to him so far as the details of the Government's scheme are concerned, to place their views before the public, and to point out that they  aTe  in reality in entire agreement with five-sixths of the views thai the Prime Minister expressed. The difference of opinion that exists in this House relates only to the way in which it is proposed to finance the naval scheme, and there is not the slightest tittle of disloyalty associated with that difference of opinion. All that we claim is that the payment should be equitably adjusted. Although this Bill relates merely to a loan for naval purposes, we have to discuss in connexion with it the whole question of the Naval Agreement. Both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have done so. Last week, unfortunately, the Minister of Defence, when explaining the Naval Agreement, was silenced by the application of a certain standing order, and I certainly think that the honorable member who availed himself of that standing order to silence the Minister at a time when the country desired to have clearly put before it the facts relating to the Naval Agreement- </para>

                        <para>- Strictly speaking, I presume that it is not in order in discussing this Bill to refer to the general question of naval defence, but under- cover of this motion, the Treasurer was allowed to describe in his own language - and he had taken care to prepare his speech - what is to be known as " the Australian unit" He was allowed to go into details as to the fleet to be created. The Prime Minister defended his colleague's proposals. He went further, and pointed out the need for properly defending Australia. Under a rigid application of the rules of the House, the discussion of neither subject would be permitted during the consideration of a Loan Bill. I shall not abuse the liberty which has been given to us, but I wish to reply to those who have addressed you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> The Treasurer said this morning, in reference to my speech of yesterday, that it was most ungenerous to contend that the masses of the community will be unjustly dealt with if we raise a loan to finance our naval policy. What I am chiefly concerned about is not whether the statement was ungenerous, but whether it was true. As to its want of generosity, that is a matter of personal opinion. If it is alleged to be untrue, let me examine the position. The Treasurer excused his proposal by stating that this Government have placed on the statute-book the most humane piece of legislation that the Commonwealth has yet passed, that providing for pensions for the aged poor. He thus tried to prove that my remarks were ungenerous: instead of doing so, he demonstrated their truth. The Commonwealth has now only one source of revenue, Customs and Excise taxation. The humane measure to which he referred is financed from that source. The pensions that are given, to the aged poor are provided, not by the wealthy as compensation for the dis- tresses suffered by those who have been less fortunate than themselves, but by the whole community. To the Customs and Excise taxation the masses contribute most heavily, it being proportionately greater in their case than in that of those who are better off. Furthermore, the Government, to provide for old-age pensions, had to secure the assistance of the House. Honorable members generally voted for the measure. But it is financed by means of Customs and Excise revenue, the poor contributing most largely to the assistance of the poor. I have nothing against the proposal to establish a naval unit; but I object to the manner in which it is to be financed. The Prime Minister admitted that he was not enamoured of the system of borrowing, and was not very desirous of paying for naval construction from Customs and Excise revenue. Yet he wishes the country to believe that money should be borrowed to build the proposed vessels. We are all desirous of having a navy. Australia and her Parliament are tardily awakening from a lethargic sleep. We have been aroused by our sense of the danger of the Empire, and consequently feel compelled to concern ourselves with our part of the national responsibility for defence. But the Government propose to borrow £3,500,000 to pay for the first instalment of a navy which it will take two and a half years to complete. It does not propose to impose fresh taxation for the purpose. Hitherto the Commonwealth Parliament has not sanctioned borrowing, even for reproductive and developmental works. The people have not to pay interest on any Commonwealth loan. While borrowing for reproductive works may be justified, borrowing for defence purposes cannot be excused. The Mother Country has never borrowed to pay for naval construction ; she has always built her fleets out of revenue. At the present time a struggle is going on in Great Britain to determine how taxation should be distributed amongst the community. The Prime Minister led us to believe that he would like direct taxation. Not only would I like it, but I want it. If we borrow money now, this will be only the first loan of a series. The thirteen vessels which it is proposed to construct will be only a beginning, and within ten years will be obsolete. That is the experience of the great naval Powers of the world. The nations we fear are not at the ends of the earth, but our next door neighbours. Our possible enemies are China and Japan. It is that which causes us to consider so seriously the requirements of naval defence. The proposed unit is to replace the existing Squadron, which has never been an effective naval force. It has merely furnished surveying ships, and vessels to patrol the Islands. Even the <inline font-style="italic">Powerful</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Challenger,</inline> the strongest ships in the Squadron, are not fit to go into an engagement. Under the Naval Agreement, Australia contributed £200,000 to the cost of her defence by Great Britain. The Mother Country spent between £700,000 and £800,000 per annum in defending our shores. We allowed her to carry that burden too long. Why should the 40,000,000 inhabitants of Great Britain, who are so heavily taxed for the administration of their internal affairs and the defence of the Empire, be burdened by Australian defence? The Imperial Defence Conference has reversed the position. Great Britain is to pay £250,000 in future, while we are to pay £780,000 for the upkeep of the proposed fleet. My contention is that this money should not be provided by Customs and Excise taxation. If the Government said that it needed a temporary loan, and would pay interest charges out of direct taxation, promising not to borrow again, I would not object to its proposal. I do not say that all the money required should be obtained by direct taxation ; but the interest and sinking fund in connexion with the proposed loan should be provided by other than indirect taxation. The Customs revenue pays for land defence and all the other services of government, and it would be unjust and cruel to draw upon it for naval defence as well. It is simply a scare on the part of the Prime Minister to say that the raising of this loan is urgent. According to his own statement, the vessels cannot be on a warlike establishment under two years and a half. Even if war were declared to-morrow, there would be no effective naval defence available by the fleet of Australia. The honorable member for Brisbane, who was the representative of Australia at the Conference in Lon don, interjected that the money will be required within six months. </para>

Here I should like to say that the country would be pleased to hear  the honorable member address himself to this question, seeing that he was in the councils of the Empire as the representative of Australia, and, while there are certain matters he cannot make public, there is much on which he could furnish interesting information. If even  tomorrow  morning ^£500,000 were provided, we should be no nearer any effective defence; indeed, if the whole loan of £3,500,000 were floated in Collins-street within the next  twenty-four  hours, we should be no nearer a fleet, though we should commence at once to pay interest. </para>

                        <para>- On whatever portion is floated, interest will at once have to be paid. The Prime Minister says that if he could see any other means he would not  apply to the loan market ; and I am trying to show that there is no necessity to borrow, and that, even if we did so successfully to-morrow, we should still for a long time to come be without effective naval defence. I am proud of the fact that Australia is to have a navy ; but if we hope to be a self-contained portion of the Empire, the mere building of the ships in Great Britain will not tend to that end. If we desire to help the Empire, we should be able to build and equip the vessels here ; and though at present we have not facilities for constructing a battleship, there is no reason why we should not be getting ready to do the work. The ship-building yards of Great Britain have as much work as they can do, and we should be in a position to construct as well as establish a Navy. If the Government are determined that there shall be a loan, I ask that some system be devised by which the interest may be met out of direct taxation. I am opposed to the proposed lam, because I am afraid that the £3.500,000 will have to be added to in the near future. We cannot suppose that thirteen vessels is the limit of the Australian Navy, and the 5 per cent, proposed will not be sufficient to meet depreciation. Battleships are obsolete in ten years; and we have to remember that Japan achieved her naval victories because she keeps thoroughly up-to-date in construction, equipment, and training. As a matter of fact, the Japanese Navy in the recent war was simply a replica of the British Navy, composed of, the same class of vessel, and under the same system of training. It is essential to have naval defence, but it is also essential that that defence shall be effective. To keep a vessel sixteen years in commission is to keep it six years longer than it can be useful. Our idea is not to have a fleet to sail round Australia and; make a display, but one to defend not  only  this country, but also, in part, the Empire. The Prime Minister told us that, if needs be, we must sell all we posses in the hour of danger, thus admitting that in an emergency he would not wait for a loan. In case of war, the wealth of the country would be at the command of the Government, as in Great Britain and elsewhere. The remark of the Prime Minister reminds me of a Scriptural quotation, which tells us to sell all we possess and give it to the poor ; but, in the present instance, it would appear that we are told to sell all we possess, and, at the same time, to take from the poor and keep on taking from the poor in the shape of Customs and Excise duties. The man at Footscray, with his wife and family, pays more to the Customs and Excise revenue than does the manat Toorak, even if he does not indulge in liquor or stimulants. Taking the contribution to the Customs and Excise revenue at £2 10s. per head, and the average family at six persons, the working man who is married, pays about 6s. per week, and he is to be asked to pay more in order to meet the charges of naval defence, while the resident of Toorak - the business man or successful speculator - absolutely escapes under this Loan Bill, the whole of the interest charges, depreciation, and sinking fund being met' out of Customs and Excise. The present Government, is composed of men some or whom. have been known as Radicals. Indeed, the Prime Minister was only yesterday, as it were, the foremost Radical in Australia, and his political traditions were dead against a loan policy, the payment of interest out of Customs and Excise, ot the taxation of food and wearing materials for defence. Our legislation in regard to the land forces calls upon the masses of the community to send their sons to defend the country, and it is most unjust and unfair that they should now be called upon to pay this further cost of defence. In resisting to the utmost the flotation of a loan for such a purpose, no honorable member can be charged with disregarding either Australian or Imperial interests. The proposal to establish an Australian Navy shows a wonderful growth and unanimity of opinion in this connexion ; and Australia, as years roll  by, will be compelled to give more and more attention to naval defence and less to land defence. </para>

To her credit, the Old Country builds her Navy out of current revenue, while other powers resort to loans. I think Australia is not so poor that she could not finance  £3,500,000.  If the fortunate people of Australia, who have surplus capital, lend to the Government,they -are paid liberal interest ; and we must not forget that this is a country which has been made by the masses, and is protected by the -masses, and that the more fortunate ones reap the benefit of that defence. Defence is not only for the humbler portion of the community, but also for those with property and wealth. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not go into that side of the question, but one would think from the remark of the honorable member for Indi that the well-to-do were a body of philanthropic individuals who were keeping the millions of Australia. The position is really the reverse. Those people could not have become wealthy if there had not been a population whose demands had to be supplied. No man lives to himself, whether he be rich or poor. There is an interdependence between the two classes that no one can destroy. It is disgraceful for any one to suggest that the humbler classes should approach the wealthy as though they were tribute mongers, or that the wealthy should approach the poorer classes as though granting them a charity or a dole. That doctrine has never yet lived in Australia, and never will. Fortunately, we have neither a very rich nor a very poor class. We have a large middle class who are doing fairly well. In fact, in nearly all cases our wealthy men are only removed by a short space of time from the period when they were workers... I know of no true merino in Australia in the shape of the real aristocrat. The true merino and aristocrat in Great Britain would resent any accusation that he desired to escape his fair burden of taxation. It is the true aristocrat of the Old Land who to-day is fighting to help the masses to place the burden of taxation on the shoulders of a certain class who are well able to bear it. The aristocrats of Great Britain have never tried to escape their contributions for naval defence purposes. It is only the plutocrat and the parvenu who try to evade their proper responsibilities for national necessities. I regret that I did not catch the interjection which the honorable member for Indi has just made. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. If I were clever I should probably be fighting for my own personal advantage with those on the Opposition side. My position in politics is that I am not only compelled to fight the Labour party, but also find myself frequently out of touch with members on this side. But I would much sooner fight for all time with honorable members on that side in regard to the question now before us than fight for any time with those who wish to assist certain classes of the community to escape their proper share of taxation. I can choose my own course, and in this instance I have chosen the one I have indicated. It is preposterous for the party on this side to call themselves Liberals. A Liberalism that desires to allow the burden of defence to be financed by the poorer classes of the community is not Liberalism to my ears. It sounds to me like Toryism of the deepest dye. At the same time, when an honorable member remarks, " You are awfully clever," it is just as well to be prepared for what that means. We are warned to beware of the Greeks when they bring presents, and I am afraid that the honorable member is acting the part of a political Greek. No matter can be put more effectively on the platforms of Australia than a just and proper system of defence. The people of Australia are more earnest and serious over it than the </para>

                <para class="block">Commonwealth Parliament has been up to date. This Parliament stands disgraced before the people, because the solemn and serious question of defence was not taken in hand many years ago. The people of Australia have awakened, and look to their representative men to insure the proper protection of themselves and families. But when a question of this character is before the people, the Prime Minister, with his powerful eloquence, can easily cloud the issue. Although there is no difference of opinion in the House regarding the necessity for naval defence - and I am even more earnest upon that question than most members, because I think the scheme now proposed is only a small instalment, which will have to be increased within five years - yet the public may be misled into believing that those who are against a loan are against effective naval defence. It will have to be explained to the people that to vote against a loan does not mean voting against effective defence. One of the cutest and most cunning devices adopted in modern politics is to try to submerge a great issue by means of small side issues. If one differs in method, it is said that one differs in object, but to differ in method or manner is not necessarily to differ in matter. The object of defence is a sound, a glorious, and even a solemn one, and as such, I am as earnestly with it as am member or supporter of the Government. The mere fact of my resisting a loan does not proclaim that I am disloyal. There is no disloyalty in fighting for a just distribution of the burdens of taxation. Loyalty, on the other hand, consists not only in seeing that the Empire is effectively defended, and that Australia does her duty, but also in seeing that the cost of defence is not placed on the wrong shoulders. I should not be such a miserable recreant as to say that only one class of the community should pay for it. I am prepared to advocate that the masses shall pay their fair and just share of the burden, but they should pay no more. The masses of the community do not require any apologist to ask that they shall escape their obligations. Even the humblest worker does not desire to be freed like a pauper from his responsibilities, but the masses do desire that their public men in apportioning the cost shall see that the burden is properly and equitably ddistributed. That is all I am fighting for, and all that I believe most members of the House are fighting for. I regret exceedingly that the Government should have introduced this Loan Bill, because the  £3,500,000  is only a first instalment, and, even if a Labour Government succeed the present Government, once the policy of approaching the loan market for purposes of defence has been resorted to they - will have to continue that policy. It is not sufficient simply to buy a navy, and place it on Australian waters for the protection of the land of the Southern Cross. Unless it is kept effective and strengthened as the years roll by it will become useless. We do not want to have in 1915 vessels which are only fit for the scrap-heap. We want our vessels replaced when they are obsolete by others that will do the work. No one desires that they should be put to the test of battle. We all hope that the mere fact of our having a navy will be the insurance against attack that we require. We are not an aggressive people. We have a large territory of our own to develop, and have no desire to extend it, but it is absolutely necessary that we should be allowed to do our work of development along the lines of humane treatment and the higher civilization. I am glad that the House is in a frame of mind to assist the Mother Land in the defence of the 'Commonwealth,  r  am pleased that there is so strong an Imperialistic spirit abroad in Australia. Only a few years ago one section of the community desired to cut the painter. - a foolish policy. As an Australian  1  am proud to think that public men, who read the barometer of public affairs pretty accurately, are unanimous in their desire not to cut t the painter, but to bring Empire ideas and Empire interests closer together. For that reason we do not require the strong appeal which the Prime Minister made this afternoon. When he made it. it was only natural that an innocent member like myself should think, " This is not intended for home consumption ; it is for export." It is to be used not in this House, but at election time. I am not the man to be caught in a cleft stick, or to be told that in fighting against a loan I am fighting against the Empire. That would not be believed in mv own district, where T have been known" from m,hood. 1 I advocated the Imperial idea and assistance to the British Navy long before many on the Ministerial bench ever uttered Imperialistic thoughts. I am glad to think that, with their greater command of language and their clarion notes, they are ringing out such strong Imperialistic tones as they have done to-day, but I fear that their sentiments are for use only on the hustings. I warn them that those of us who oppose a loan policy are not to be called the enemies of the Empire or of Australia. We all know the weapons that are used in political warfare, and the most successful, but at the same time the most dangerous weapon is the distortion of statements. The attempt will doubtless be made to lead the people to believe that opposition to a Loan Bill, because it has the word "navy" on the top of it, is an indication of antagonism to the Imperial spirit. I know the battle that is before us, and if ever there was a righteous cause, it is to be found in this question of direct taxation for defence. If a loan for this purpose is inevitable, will the Minister of Defence be prepared to see that the interest on the loan is obtained from the channels of direct taxation? The Minister was, many years ago, a close acquaintance of mine, and took a foremost part in fighting the Radical battles in New South Wales. He fought the battle of the proper apportionment of taxation, and of placing the burden on the backs of those best able to bear it He and the Prime Minister now assert that, in order to obtain a navy speedily, it is absolutely essential to undertake a loan. Will he then undertake to see that in the next Parliament the interest charges upon that loan are obtained from direct taxation? That is a simple question. If he is not prepared to answer it, it is an admission to me that the Government look only to the one class - the masses of the community - not only to pay the interest, but to  repay  the loan. </para>

                        <para>- I am a member of the Fusion party, and no whip has been applied to me. I may deserve the whip, but if the Ministry were only as generous to the general public as they are to me,.- I should be satisfied. I do not wish this question to be made a matter of party warfare. There are on this side of the House many honorable members who are as stoutly opposed to direct taxation as I am in favour of it. They are entitled to their own opinions; but my only fear is that the Conservative section of this party have captured the ablest Radical in Australia, Alfred Deakin. I could not have believed six months ago that the Prime Minister would submit a Loan Bill for defence purposes and propose that the taxation to pay interest on and redeem that loan should be borne by the masses. He said today most apologetically that, personally, he did not like it; and I wish to know whether I am to draw from that statement the inference that the Conservative section of the Fusion party have gained their end, and are opposed to direct taxation of any kind. </para>

                        <para>- I shall connect my remarks with the question immediately before the Chair. As a loyal Fusionist, I had hoped that the Government would subject its supporters to as few handicaps as possible before the next general election. Was there ever a more severe handicap placed upon a party than this, proposal on the part of the Government to float a naval loan, the interest on and the redemption of which is to be borne by the poor? The wealthy sections of the community are not called upon to bear any special proportion of the cost. Was a more severe handicap ever placed upon a Liberal party? </para>

                        <para>- Here we. have party feeling again being introduced. I am not playing the game of the Labour party. They will not play mine. They will fight me, and good luck to them. But as a loyal Fusionist, I certainly cannot fight on the public platform for a loan policy in connexion with naval defence. This may be unpleasant and inconvenient for the Government, but surely, they must appreciate a man who tells them before the footlights, fairly ,md squarely, what his opinions are. </para>

                        <para>- It is something more than <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> political umbrella : it is a political circus tent. I have a recollection, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> or your being a Radical. T cannot deal with the matter ; but" I regret that you are unable to stand with me on the floor of the House and help me to fight this battle. If you were not in your present exalted position. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> am. sure you would be found fighting with the Radical wing of the Fusion party. We are both Australians, and are glad of the growth of the Imperial spirit; but we cannot be pleased with the proposal to call upon the masses to bear the whole burden of taxation. I had hoped that the Government would not persist with this loan proposal at the present juncture. Let us take it first of all to the electors. If they say that they are prepared to accept a loan policy in respect of naval defence, and to provide for it out of Customs and Excise, they must have their way ; but I do not think that the Government are called upon to spring on the people this most dangerous policy. The speech made to-day by the Prime Minister was an astute move on the part of a powerful leader of men. It indicated to me that he intends at the coming elections to make use of his powerful' command of rhetoric to appeal to the sentiment of the people, and there is no subject on which one could appeal more powerfully to the sentiment .of the people than* that of Imperial unity. The Prime Minister regrets that he has to fly to the loan market in connexion with his naval defence scheme. There is an easy way out of the difficulty. We have not exhausted all the? means of taxation open to us. The working classes have been taxed- </para>

                        <para>- 1 believe that the honorable member for Yarra is correct. Ninety-five out of every hundred people in the community are not millionaires; they do not own motor cars, live in Toorak, have more than half-a-million invested in the banks, or more than £20,000 invested in consols. They have to work . for their living, and 95 per cent, of the revenue derived from Customs and Excise is paid by them. That is my answer to the honorable member for Wilmot. The farmers' in his own electorate do not belong to the wealthy class, and I think it is unfair to ask them to carry more than their fair share of defence taxation. I am grieved that the Minister of Defence, who holds a high position in the Commonwealth Parliament, and holds it well, should be a party to a proposal to allow the wealthy class to escape their fair share of taxation. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the honorable member for his interjection. Our revenue to-day is obtained from Customs and Excise, and is more than sufficient to cover the ordinary cost of government. The Minister of Defence believes that the Government will be able to pay the interest on this loan and the contributions to the sinking fund for its redemption out of the present revenue. That is the position. My answer to his contention is that the Commonwealth Government have not yet exercised all the powers that they are able to exercise under the Constitution. They have not yet fulfilled all their ordinary duties under the Constitution. They have yet to construct railways, take over light-houses, and carry out various works which will make demands on the general revenue. Every £1 that is taken out of the Customs and Excise revenue to pay interest on this naval loan will mean £1 less for expenditure on civil administration. </para>

                        <para>- There was a time when the Minister would not have objected to my company on a platform, but as things are going, I do not think that he will have me within forty miles of him, and will not give me the opportunity to have him with me. The Prime Minister told us that the British money lender would be only too pleased to lend us what we require. All money lenders are only too pleased to lend their money to those who will pay them interest and repay the principal when it becomes due. What do the moneylenders care about Imperialism, patriotism, or anything else, except the return which they will get from their investment? Are we so foolish as to believe that moneylenders make advances for charitable or benevolent purposes, or because they ''knew our father." I apologize for having detained the House so long. I have been carried away with my subject. To my mind, it is most dangerous to borrow for defence purposes. For that there is no excuse, whatever may be said about borrowing for reproductive works, while to pay the interest out of Customs and Excise revenue would be monstrous. I hope that the measure will be defeated, though I am afraid that it will not. In any case, the position will be put clearly before the people. I hope that the new Parliament will repeal the measure, pay off any loan which may have been contracted, and provide for the expenditure on our naval system out of some source other than Customs and Excise revenue. </para>

                    O'MALLEY (Darwin [9.39] - The honorable member for Dalley has given us a grand exposition of the whole situation, showing the Government in a clear light and in its true colours. The idol of the Fusion Government is Mammon, the god of gold, and its trinity coin, credit, and boodle. We have recently been fighting a great fight to save the Constitution, and have lost. Now, on the eve of a dissolution, and before taking the electors into our confidence, we are asked to borrow £3,500,000. The National Parliament is to float a loan at the worst time in the History of finance for doing so. Europe will watch the flotation of this loan very closely, and whatever price our securities bring now will fix the standard for future stock. We can offer only half the Customs and Excise revenue as security ; the other half has already been mortgaged by the States.

                        <para>- It is fair ; but posterity should not pay for the bungling of its ancestors. Is it fair for the owner of a big estate to mortgage the whole to the detriment of his children? I seriously object to our starting borrowing for the purpose. of buying a little fleet of tin-pot ships. If I had dreamt, as a member of the Labour party, that this is what the Australian Navy would mean, nothing would have prevented my voting for the continuance of the subsidy to Great Britain. The <inline font-style="italic">Brooklyn,</inline> which was here at the opening of the Federal Parliament and was then only a year or two old, was put on the scrap-heap long ago. The <inline font-style="italic">Oregon</inline> - the ship that made the wonderful trip round the Horn, and took part in the battle of Santiago, is also there. As a matter of fact, the great fleet of American warships which were here only a year ago is being placed on the scrap-heap now ; and yet we are asked to go into debt in order to provide a little fleet to defend, I suppose, the entrance to the Yarra. We are told that there is to be a Big sinking ' fund, but no steps are taken to establish a trust. Apparently this sinking fund is to be conducted in the same haphazard way as have the sinking funds of the States, in which case the Treasurer, at any time he is a bit short, will not be able to resist the temptation to grab. With the exception of those of Western Australia, the sinking funds in the various States are not worth considering. Who is to watch over the sinking fund and invest it? The Commonwealth Treasurer. No matter how honest a Treasurer may be, if he is impecunious, he pursues the line of least resistance, and grabs what is at hand - the sinking fund. The loan to be raised is one of £3,500,000, and in the calculations I have made, I have placed the interest at 3^ pex cent., and the issue at 98 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent., which is the highest that. any loan at 3J per cent, has reached in New South Wales. At 98J, the realization will be £3,447,500. "The underwriting at <inline font-style="italic">r\</inline> per cent, is £43,750; inscription charge, £8,750 ; brokerage, £8,750; stamp duty, at § per cent., £21,875 j advertising, postage, &amp;c, £1,000; or a total of £84,125. Deducting this from the £3,447,500, we get cash available,  £31363,375  ; and here we have the first great loss. If this House had listened to me and established a national postal banking system, all this could have been saved. I could not then have conscientiously objected to a loan, because we could have financed it ; but we now have offered to us the same slipshod method of thu plunger, the bronco steerer, and the touter. Fancy a Government allowing themselves to be put in the bag of the London Hebrew ! The cash available' will fall short of par bv £136,625. The interest payable annually will be £123,500, and, in addition, the sinking fund, payable annually at 5 ner cent., will represent £175,000. This afternoon the Treasurer said the term would bc sixteen years, and I said it would be fifteen ; but I now find that it will be fifteen and a half years before the loan can be redeemed if the 5 per cent, is constantly invested. The Treasurer told us to-day that the interest and sinking fund would be £298,000 annually, but he said not one word about renewals, repairs, and upkeep generally, the cost of which must be added. </para>

                    <para>It has been announced that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest proposes to ask the Federal Parliament next week for authority to float the first Commonwealth loan. This loan will be for 3J mil lions sterling, the sum estimated to be necessary for the construction of the Australian Navy. Further details have not been vouchsafed us so far beyond the statement that the money will not be required at once, nor will it be expended immediately. As a matter of fact, it is much to be regretted that the Commonwealth should require to borrow for this purpose at all. Indeed, borrowing money on which interest will have to be paid in perpetuity for the construction of vessels that must be " scrapped " in a very few years can only be justified on the ground either of urgent necessity or as a temporary expedient, pending the more satisfactory readjustment of the financial relationship of States and Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>Despite her heavy annual expenditure on war vessels, Great Britain has never yet borrowed money either for construction and equipment or maintenance. The cost of the navy has been an annual charge that has fallen year by year upon the finances of the particular year in which the expenditure has been made. In the case of Germany a very different system has been pursued. There loan moneys have been freely bor.rowed for naval purposes, and year by year the interest charge is being more heavily felt by the people of the Fatherland. Some believe that before long the strain will prove too great. Whether this be so or not it is not possible to say with any certainty, but this much is sure, that had the German Empire done as Great Britain has done, and paid its way as it went, its navy would not to-day be anything like the present proportions. </para>
                    <para>Is it a fact that we in Australia are justified in following the German- rather than the British example?- -  f want again to urge the Government to copy Great Britain. In adopting the German system of finance as against the old and tried system of the Mother Country, they are not only anti-nationalists, but anti-Britishers, and pro- Germans - </para>
                    <para>Perhaps we are for the present, if only because the immediate financial circumstances of the Commonwealth leave no option. But that does not say that we should take a second step along the same- lines. When the Commonwealth has more money at command the whole of the defence expenditure, whatever the form it may take, should, be drawn from revenues. As it is, the cost of the first ships might well be spread over a comparatively short period, say, 10 years. Were that done, the immediate burden would not be too great, while at the same time the burden on the department would not b'e of a permanent character. The currency of the loan would thus bear some relation to the life of the asset, if war vessels may be so described.  1 think war vessels are always a liability - </para>
                    <para>Doubtless, when the Treasurer unfolds his proposals, it  will  be found that he has some such scheme as this in his mind. Meanwhile it is scarcely idle to note that the London money market is still adverse, though somewhat less so than it was a few weeks ago. </para>

That is why I have urged the House to establish a bank of its own, with headquarters in London, where we could have Australian Commonwealth consols on tap. A country like Australia can always use 3  or  4 per cent, money, and with such a bank, there would be no necessity for the Ministry to run to the London market with their hats off and their knees bent to plead for an advance on their securities. They would be able to obtain the money in Australia through their own Department.

When a nation borrows three or four million pounds to build a railway or a canal, te clear land, or to lay out a township, it is embarking upon a reproductive work. Every time you make a spade or a plough you make a useful instrument, of industry. ' Ail these things have a specific value, and help to create great productive industries, but when you borrow money to build a navy, you create an institution which is not' reproductive, and in which even the fighting men are not assets. The soldier on land, and the " Jacky " at sen, although great in their way, are not national assets.

                        <para>- I tried to show them at Brisbane the way to salvation. If we used £3, 500,000 to place immigrants in the Northern Territory, which is to be our own land, we could settle there 35,000 healthy male adults. Assuming that there was in each family an average of three persons - man, wife, and child - we should thus have a total of 105,000 persons in the Northern Territory,- as compared with its present population of 3,000, exclusive of aboriginals. If we further assume that the wealth production of the Northern Territory would, like the rest of the Commonwealth, average £40 per head per annum, we should have an annual production of wealth amounting to £4,200,000, while the annual contribution of the Territory to the Customs and Excise revenue on the basis of the average of 1908-9 would amount to £260,000. That is the kind of defence for which we ought to fight. I would vote to-morrow for a Bill to provide for a loan of ,£3,500,000 for immigration purposes - to settle people in the Northern Territory, to build a railway, or to be devoted to some other reproductive purpose. But the money is to be borrowed merely to enable us to go about looking for war  -  for the spilling of human blood. It is an absolute contradiction of Christianity. War is inseparable from a low state of civilization. There is nothing in the New Testament to warrant our raising a loan to enable us to shed the "blood of Christians. Who is threatening </para>

                <para class="block">Australia? No one. It is unsound to borrow money for war purposes. It is not right for a Christian country to be setting itself up in open defiance of modern civilization. In "the Old Testament we are told, that " The Lord is a man of war," and I am afraid that Ministers have been reading the Old Testament and neglecting the New. I referred the other night to a meeting of an Englishman and an American, both Quakers, in Washington, about the year 1817. They were a British Minister and an American Under-Secretary, and they signed a little bit of a contract which led to the abolition of the warships that were on the lakes and the forts that were on the frontier. Since then there has been no trouble between America and Canada. Had chose ships continued to sail the lakes, had those forts on the frontier been allowed to grow, what would have happened? Not far from the place of my birth there was on the Canadian frontier a fort which was ultimately abandoned, and to-day one cannot tell whether one is -on. the American or the Canadian side of the border until one meets a Customs officer. That is the result of the peaceful relations between those two countries. I have no hesitation in saying that, had the system of building forts on the frontier and constructing warship's on the lake3 been allowed to continue, there would have been a great war between England and America many years ago. Our flag might not have been flying over Canada to-day, for, after all, 6,000,000 of people cannot fight 90,000,000. In Australia' we have had peace, prosperity, and comfort, but suddenly a fighting spirit has been aroused. The people want to kill somebody. In Isaiah we have the passage, " Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat " ? I am- afraid that that is what the Ministry are doing. Men can become intoxicated without touching liquor. They became excited, and, so to speak, live in the air. I wish to draw honorable members away from the mad desire for militarism. T opposed militarism at the Brisbane Labour Conference, and shall always do so. I am a man of peace. After every war representatives of the contending parties have to meet round a table and talk over their differences, and I would sooner talk for twenty years than fight for twenty minutes. ' There was a neighbour of mine in America who was a great bully. In 1863 he was drafted into the army and sent to the front, but as soon as the first shot was fired he ran away. The commanding officer, seeing him running, cried, "Where are you going?" The man replied, "I am trying- to get away. I am not a coward, but I am scared." " Well," said the officer, " do not be a baby." " Ah !" replied the man, "I wish I were a baby, and a girl at that, for if I were 1 should not be here." He was a man of peace. The nations are now engaged in trading with each other. At one time they used to build walls to keep out people; now they build ships to bring them in. We ought to proceed on lines that will enable us to build up the great industries of the country. It is wrong for us as a Christian people to borrow money to build little warships which will sail along our coasts manned by " roosters " wearing feathers. I heard one honorable member say to-day that Imperial officers would take charge of our navy. I am opposed to anything of the kind. If Imperial officers in time of war are going to take charge of our navy we shall have no navy at all to defend us. If that is to be the position why not rescind the whole scheme and vote  £500,000  a year to the British Navy ? I was led to believe at the Brisbane Labour Conference that in time of war the proposed Australian fleet would be commanded by Australian officers, and that it would remain here to defend our ports. It would appear that I was deceived, for the Treasurer said to-day that Imperial officers would take charge of our navy on the outbreak of hostilities. They might take away our fleet and leave our shores unprotected. This means misdirected energy. Many great cities - Vienna, Paris, Antwerp, and "the rest - have fallen in spite of their enormous defence expenditure. But it is useless to speak further on the subject. The Government cannot leave the old fines. Their only proposition is more borrowing. If the money were to be borrowed to assist in the settlement of immigrants, or in the development of territory by the construction of canals for a great irrigation scheme, such as the cutting of a tunnel by President Roosevelt through the Arizona Mountains, to water  200,000  or  300,000  acres of arid land, I would be behind the Treasurer, even without the national postal banking system. As it is,I can only say sorrowfully that the Government are making a great and expensive mistake. This loan will prove a dismal curse, blackening, impoverishing, barbarizing, and corrupting the country. . But of what use is it to discuss the matter further? The honorable member for Dalley, like a modern Demosthenes, placed the gospel before the' House, and not one honorable member repented. They are all lost souls. </para>
