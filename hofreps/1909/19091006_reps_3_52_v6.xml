                        <para>- Yesterday a large number of my electors were greatly inconvenienced because I was unable to take the chair at an important meeting, over which they desired me to preside. I could not do so, because I had to remain here in the expectation of a division being taken on the measure then under discussion. My case is a typical one. In many of the constituencies electors are inconvenienced by the fact that honorable members cannot meet them, owing to their presence being required in the House in expectation of divisions. I therefore ask the Prime Minister if he will endeavour to arrange with the Leader of the Opposition that honorable members shall be informed, within a day or two, of the time at which it is intended to take important divisions? </para>

                        Is the Premier aware that there is a Bill before the Commonwealth Parliament to amend the Constitution, in order to take over the States&#39; debts, not only as they exist to-day, but those debts which may be incurred in the future; and, if the honorable gentleman is aware of it, what attitude does the Government intend to take so far as this State is concerned?

                        It will be sufficient time to answer that question when the Bill becomes law, and is before the people for indorsement. At present the Bill is in a very early stage before only one House.

                    <para>- The arrangement with regard to the debts is embodied In the first paragraph of the agreement. It is there recognised that the fulfilment of the Constitution requires the transfer of the debts to the Commonwealth, and means are suggested for giving effect to the intention. The question was considered at the Conference, so far as time permitted, and -the Premiers were aware that it was the intention of the Government to introduce the measure of which I have moved the second reading. Neither then new . later did they oppose the proposal, which they appear well content to see brought forward. </para>

                    <para>. - I have already dealt with most of the points I had in view, but there is one to which I should like to draw special attention, namely, the relationship of the problem to the development and progress of the Commonwealth generally. That is a phase which has very largely been lost sight of, but which should receive some consideration at the hands of honorable members. It has been presented to us by the honorable member for Darwin, in dealing with his proposal to establish a National Postal Bank for the arrangement of the proper financing of Government business, both here and in the Old World; and though it is of vital concern to the welfare of the Commonwealth, it has been, as I say, largely lost sight of in the negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States, and in the agreement placed before us. I do not intend to deal with the matter as fully as I at the outset proposed ; but I desire to emphasize the fact that at present, and for some considerable time past, the Commonwealth has been at a standstill in regard to population. It matters not what the mineral wealth or other natural productiveness of the country may be, there must be population for the development of that wealth and for the purposes of defence, so that we may be able to take our stand amongst the peoples of the world. It would help very much to make my remarks clear, and save time, if I had permission to insert in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> some tabulated statements bearing on this phase of the question, without the necessity of reading them. </para>

                        <para>- The first tabulated statement relates to settlement and agricultural development in New South Wales; and it shows that 49,901,837 acres of alienated rural lands are held by 81,732 settlers, but that of that total acreage only 2,362,590 acres are actually under cultivation, the rest being simply held for grazing purposes. If we desire to determine the extent of agricultural development we must have regard to the small holders. Of small holdings, from 1 acre up to 1,000 acres of rural land, there are in New South Wales 74,824, representing 91.54 per cent. of the total holders, and of the 12,120,462 acres out of the 49,000,000 odd, held by these settlers, 1,379,739 acres, or 44.29 per cent. are cultivated. </para>

                <para class="block">That is the present position, and those who look the problem fairly and squarely in the face will see that the present tendencies are not in the direction of promoting rural settlement. The reasons for that may be the desire of the large land-owner to acquire vested interests in properties originally leased, and the methods adopted by him to secure that end, and, further, the desire of persons to acquire land, not for developmental purposes, but as a commercial transaction. A large proportion of this land was originally acquired quite legitimately, with the sole desire of developing it, and establishing homes thereon ; but, owing to adverse circumstances well known to honorable members, the efforts of many persons in that direction have failed. The establishment of a national banking system of the character proposed by the honorable member for Darwin would provide for a permanent settlement of the land in small holdings. In times of drought and disaster, struggling landholders often get into monetary difficulties, and large monopolists and private banking institutions interested in this form of monopoly avail themselves of the opportunity which is thus presented to them to acquire more land. The result is practically the annihilation of settlement, to the detriment of those primarily engaged in the industry. The States have endeavoured to meet the difficulty by the establishment of banking institutions, either directly under the control of the Government, or on the  Cr&#233;dit  Foncier system. One of the main objects of such institutions is to meet the difficulty that I have indicated, and, so far as they have operated, they have certainly achieved that object. The following table shows the operation of these government institutions in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. It sets forth the number of applications received for loans, the number approved of, the amount applied for, and the amount granted during the year 1907. It also gives the totals of such transactions for the whole Commonwealth : - </para>

                    <graphic href="052331190910062_4_1.jpg" />
                </para>
                <para class="block">The honorable member for Darwin set out to draft a scheme to deal with the transfer of the State debts, but found, as he proceeded, that by departing from the antiquated methods of dealing through private banking institutions and syndicates, and establishing a national banking system, the Government could make a substantial gain for the Commonwealth. That led him to devise his present scheme for a national postal bank. In that scheme we have also a means of overcoming the land settlement problem, which lies at the very basis of all these arrangements. I commend the honorable member for the able manner in which he has dealt with the subject. Throughout my political career I have been a strong advocate of State banking institutions as a means of settling the land problem, but confess that I failed to see how it would be possible to harmonize State and Federal interests in this connexion. The honorable member for Darwin has supplied a key that will- unlock this intricate problem, inasmuch as his proposal practically means the merging of all State banks into a national banking institution, in which the States and the Commonwealth would have a direct interest - an interest which would meet the needs of the people by means of a central and more efficient control than is possible under the existing system. The popularity of these State banking institutions is shown by the number of applications to which I have referred. The pity is that those institutions have not been able to deal with many more applications, that a large percentage has been disallowed, and that in a still larger percentage of cases the amount applied for has been reduced. That is a phase of the question which deserves the earnest consideration of the House, because it lies behind the problem which we have before us, and its settlement will mean a better solution of that problem. In conclusion I wish to summarize my position with respect to the matter now under review. In doing so I wish to state first, that the Braddon section is opposed to sound principles of governmental finance, in that it either makes the Federal Parliament the taxing machine for the States, or it makes the States dependent upon, and suppliant to the Federal Parliament for a large share of its income. Both alternatives are objectionable, both are opposed to the best interests of the taxpayers, and both are inimical to sound finance &#34;and sound economic government. In the second place, the Government proposal is a modification of the Braddon section, and to that extent it is in the direction of a more satisfactory settlement of the financial relations, of the Commonwealth and the States. But it is unsatisfactory in- that it stops midway between the more extreme position involved in the Braddon section, as at present operating, and a complete and satisfactory solution of the problems involved in that relationship. Thirdly, the Braddon section was finally placed in the Constitution as a temporary expedient only, to assist the States to adjust themselves to the altered financial conditions brought about by Federation. Ten years&#39; participation in Customs and Excise taxation was guaranteed to them for this purpose. Whatever may .have been the original intentions of the framers of the Constitution, that section was limited in its operation to ten years, and it was provided that thereafter the National Parliament should be clothed with supreme power to deal with the matter, and be left free to make such arrangements from time to time as would best meet the varying and changing conditions of the Commonwealth and the States. The Government proposal is a negation of that right, and that principle, inasmuch as the Government ask that it shall become embedded iri &#39;the Constitutution </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that point forthwith. Fourthly, the Government proposal, whilst it is a colorable imitation of the scheme devised by the Brisbane Labour Conference in  1908,  departs from it in some vital respects, and to that extent is objectionable and much less acceptable to the taxpayers and to all patriotic Australians. The Brisbane Conference proposals placed the National Parliament first, and provided for &#34;State needs after national requirements had been reasonably met. The Government proposal places the States first, and guarantees their revenues from Federal taxing sources to the extent of  25s.  per head of their population, irrespective of Commonwealth requirements. Does not the honorable member for Lang think that that indicates a very vital departure from the determination of the Brisbane Conference Fifthly, the proposals of that Conference respected the requirement of the Constitution that, at the termination of the first ten years of Federation, the financial relationship of the Commonwealth and the States shall be a matter of mutual arrangement from time to time as. the changing conditions and varying needs of both may. suggest. The Government scheme eliminates this elasticity, and clothes their proposals with, the extreme rigidity of embodiment in the Constitution. </para>

                <para class="block">Sixthly, the Constitution provides for the Commonwealth taking over, consolidating, and handling the State debts as a national concern. The advantages of such a scheme are evident and far-reaching. The debts problem can best be dealt with by making the distribution of Federal surpluses a factor in its solution, but the Government proposals are in the nature of a divorcement between the disposal of the Federal surplus and the treatment of the State debts. In view of the fact that the States have maturing loans totalling ,&#163;79,868,450 to meet within the next ten years, or ^127,607,243 within the next fifteen years, the urgency of Federal treatment of these allied questions, and the unwisdom of the Government&#39;s proposals, is manifest. Seventhly, the Brisbane Labour Conference contemplated the establishment of a national bank under joint Federal and State control to conserve the people&#39;s earnings, to deal with Government financial arrangements, including the handling of national debts, and to provide for the development of the agricultural and industrial life of the community. For this purpose it expressed approval of the national postal banking scheme proposed by one of its members, the honorable member for Darwin. The Government proposals contemplate no change in present antiquated methods of handling financial arrangements, nor do they appear to favour the establishment of a national bank. Eighthly, the proposal for the embodiment in the Constitution of the Government&#39;s scheme is open to very strong objections. We have a total population of 4,275,306 souls in the Commonwealth, and under the Government proposals, if this scheme were afterwards to come, up for modification or reconsideration, it would be possible, under the referendum provisions of the Constitution, for 213,271 persons out of that total to nullify the wishes of the majority. In other words, 2,096,357 voters in the Commonwealth would have to submit to the will of 213,271 of their brethren. And finally, the Government proposals are a negation of Australian nationhood in that they sacrifice the Commonwealth interests to State advantages, which can be equally well provided for in other directions. The great national questions of Defence, an adequate system of old-age pensions, Northern Territory acquisition and development, trans-continental railways, &#34;All Red &#34; cable services within the reach of the people, post and telegraph development, and a Commonwealth system of penny postage, the establishment and equipment of the Federal Capital site as provided for in the Constitution, and the hundred-and-one avenues of national activities committed to the Commonwealth, these are all sacrificed by this Fusion Government on the&#39; shrine of State needs, and only come, in for consideration after the States have drawn from Commonwealth taxation sources 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> of their population for purely State purposes. I desire the fair and equitable distribution of any surplus revenue that the Commonwealth may have. But the solution- of this question requires the consideration of the State indebtedness, and the important banking scheme of the honorable member for Darwin should not be left out of account. The House will make a very grave mistake if it votes for the insertion of the proposed amendment in the Constitution. The interests of both the Commonwealth and States will best be met by leaving the Constitution unaltered. Then, at the end of 1910, the matter will come up for review by this Parliament. The Senate is specially charged with the safeguarding of the interests of the States, and the Premiers of the States have to a large extent usurped the functions of that Chamber, which has thereby suffered in the eyes of the electors. The taxpayers can wisely leave it to the Senate to protect the special interests of the States. Of course, the representations of the Premiers will have fair consideration. In the end, both the Commonwealth and the State Parliaments have to. appeal to the same set of electors. If we provide for &#39;an elastic adjustment of the finances, much friction, trouble, and difficulty will be avoided, and therefore, while I shall be prepared to reasonably meet State needs, the proposal to embody the agreement in the Constitution will have my strongest opposition. </para>

                    <para>. - I thank honorable &#39; members for my reception. I still feel physically unequal to the task of dealing with this great question as its importance deserves, but with the indulgence of the House I shall say a few words, more to indicate my own attitude regarding it than to attempt to traverse the splendid speeches which have been made from all parts of the Chamber, both for and against it, most of which I have endeavoured to read. At the outset I tender to the Prime Minister and Treasurer my congratulations on their success in obtaining the agreement of the Premiers to a proposal which will, at least, form a starting point for a final arrangement. In that respect the last Conference was an advance on its predecessors. There appears to be little difference of opinion in this Chamber as to the advisability of returning to the States  25s. <inline font-style="italic">percapita,</inline> though many honorable members have expressed opposition to the proposal to make the payments perpetual, feeling that, in view of the increase of population,&#34; there should be some period of .review. While I am prepared to support the Government in giving effect to the agreement, I should much prefer, either the limitation of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments to a fixed period, or the fixing of a lump maximum or minimum which should not be exceeded. A considerable change of opinion has taken place since proposals were first submitted by Treasurers and private members for the settlement of this question. That justifies me in thinking that the matter may again require consideration before any arrangement can be embodied in the Constitution. In a memorandum which I submitted on the&#39;  5th  October,  1906,  no altera-* tion of the Constitution was contemplated. It seems to me to be possible to make art agreement with the States which would be as binding on us as any other, and I still adhere to that view. </para>

                        <para>- The same people elects both the Commonwealth and the State Parliaments. That is one of the reasons why I say that if the Government, with the better knowledge which it possesses, feels-  that  it must adhere to the agreement without modification, its loyal supporters should follow it. But I trust that it  will  be felt that the time is not yet ripe for embodying any proposal in the Constitution.  lt  has been said that the machinery for altering the Constitution to embody in it an agreement can, if necessary, be employed subsequently for altering the Constitution to rescind it. But the general opinion is that it would be much more difficult to get rid of the arrangement than to make it, just as it is much more difficult to obtain money than to pay it. In my opinion, the pro-; posed arrangement, subject to what I have said about the alteration of the Constitu-tion, is a fair one in the interests of both Commonwealth and States, and, as I have&#39; said, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer did excellent work in bringing it about. I recall to the memory of honorable mem-&#39;  hers  who have been here as long as I myself have, and of others who have not the same knowledge, that I have presumed on two occasions to submit to the House papers,  which  the House was pleased to accept as embodying a scheme for the solu-tion of this question. </para>

The figures vary, but that is in consequence, chiefly,&#39; of the increase in population, and of the fact that we have taken over the obligation to pay practically &#163;&#34;1,500,000 for old-age pensions - a very proper thing for us to do. </para>

This would closely represent the amount now being returned to the States under the Braddon clause (Constitution, Sec. 87), as the sum returned to the States for the year ending 30th June, 1906, was actually  &#163;7,385,731 </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. I never contemplated any change in the Constitution, but regarded it as a matter of trust between the representatives of the ;States and the representatives of the Commonwealth, holding the opinion that it is quite competent for us to enter into an obligation for a period of years that will be as binding as any Constitutional enactment. I have not yet seen or discovered any reason for a referendum on. the question. The proposal for the taking oyer of the State debts is quite a different matter ; but, in regard to the Braddon section, I consider a referendum as unnecessary at present. In insisting that it is necessary to have the arrangement in black and white, we are practically taking up the position that. we cannot trust ourselves. </para>

                        <para>- And also a want of confidence in the State Parliaments. The gentlemen elected to control the affairs of the States have, I think, equally with us, ideas of what is right and just. I know what my own feelings were when I was a State  member; any obligation, implied or written, would have been respected to the fullest extent, and no one would have ever attempted, directly or indirectly, to repudiate an honorable understanding. The Ministry, with their wider knowledge, may feel that a referendum is absolutely necessary, seeing that they are in possession of the&#39; views of the various State Premiers; but I think there is a middle course which would relieve much of the existing difficulty, and enable the whole of this House - because it is not a party question, but rather a family matter, concerning our own brothers and sisters - to come to an agreement universally acceptable. So far as I can gather, the amount of 25s. per head is not a serious matter of contention, but only the period for which the payment shall last. I think the Prime Minister succeeded in making a very excellent agreement in the interests of the Commonwealth, so far as the amount is concerned. I do not say that I can follow or admit the arguments in support of the general objections to the perpetuity of the agreement, based on certain inferences from what the Tariff is likely to produce in the future. These inferences may or may not be correct; but, after having been in intimate touch with a number of gentlemen, who have come from the Old Land and various parts of the Empire, to confer on matters commercial, I think that we are on the eve of an entirely new development. The great newspapers of Great Britain are taking a closer interest in our affairs, and, for the first time, those at Home are enabled, from personal contact, to understand our position. The representatives at the Conference of the Chambers of Commerce are going Home full of hope for the future of Australia, ready to tell every one that we really do not understand the possibilities of the country . I think that if the agreement were limited to, say, the next ten years, we shall in that period have a development which will &#39;surprise us all. There is much more that I should like to say, but I feel that I am unequal to the task. I repeat that if the Government insist on their scheme, I have so little apprehension that eventually the fair thing will. not be done, that, whatever the consequences, I am prepared to follow them; but, honestly, I think it would be a good thing if we could present a united front to the States. </para>

                    <para>. - At this stage of a most interesting debate, there is but little new that can be added, and I should not have spoken but for the fact that, as a former Treasurer, I naturally took a great interest in the financial question, and submitted a scheme which the then Prime Minister regarded as equitable, and which I thought would have been accepted by the States. I shall not, I think, take&#39; more than an hour in placing before honorable ( members reasons why I formed that opinion. I went with the then Prime Minister to the Premiers&#39; Conference in full expectation of good results. First, let me say that, in my opinion, it is an unfortunate coincidence that this question should be discussed on the eve of an election, because I know that that fact, whether intentionally or not, has had some effect on the minds of some honorable members. It is not wise to have a matter of this kind made a party question, but, in view of its importance, not only to the Commonwealth, but to the States, unhesitatingly say that it would be little&#39; short of criminal if the question were decided on party lines, because it is one that should be disposed of in a fair and reasonable way. </para>

                <para class="block">Conference should be open to the public, and I considered that it was a reasonable one. The Conference which took place in August last ought also to have been open to the public. A great deal of the discussion which has taken place on this motion has been due to the fact that honorable members are largely in the dark as to what took place. It must be admitted that the question has been ably debated, and that honorable members generally have given thoughtful consideration to it. It is surprising, however, that such a debate should have taken place on a motion for leave to introduce the Bill. If ever there was a measure which should have been discussed on a motion not for leave to introduce, but for the second reading, it is this, and probably when the Bill is submitted, honorable members will find that it &#34;contains provisions that will heed to be further debated at the second-reading stage. When I, as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, first took into consideration the question of the settlement of the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth, the honorable member for Ballarat, as my leader, undertook to help me in the preparation of a scheme, and he certainly gave me material assistance. I looked first of all at the whole of the schemes that had then been submitted. It will be remembered that at that time there had been presented to the House schemes prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, the right honorable member for Swan, the honorable member for Mernda, and the honorable member for Kooyong. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Darwin&#39;s scheme was presented at a later stage. It seemed to me that the best course to adopt in dealing with a question of such importance was first of all to carefully read and digest those schemes, and to select from them any proposals which would assist in bringing about a fair and definite settlement of the problem. Ultimately, the present Prime Minister and I came to the conclusion that the best that we could adopt as a basis for our scheme of settlement was that submitted by the honorable member for Mernda. With the consent of the Prime Minister, I altered that proposal in several unimportant particulars, arid I think it well to say at this stage that I also received great assistance from the honorable member for Mernda himself. On one occasion, when I suggested to him the elimination from it of a certain proposal which I did not think was likely to meet with the approval of the Premiers, he expressed astonishment, and said that it was so liberal that he felt sure that the States would readily accept it. The proposal which I, with the Prime Minister, submitted to the Premiers, was that we should allot to the various States &#163;6, 000, 000 per annum. The difference between the amount allotted to each State and the interest and expenses due on its transferred debts was to be paid annually by the State to the Commonwealth Government for five years, and was to be used in payment of interest to the bondholders. At the end of the five years&#39; period, the amount payable by the States was to be reduced to the extent of one-thirtieth per annum for thirty years, and the Commonwealth was then to accept the responsibility for the payment of interest on the debts, amounting now to nearly &#163;9,000,000. The Premiers did not consider that a fair proposal. They desired a larger return to the States, one proposition made being that we should return to them, not &#163;6,000,000, but&#163;7,500,000 per annum. I have no notes as to the figures, but the whole of the details are so stamped on my memory that I can readily recall them. I was proud of the robust attitude adopted by the Prime Minister in his defence of the Commonwealth at the Conference which we attended. I never thought more of him, or trusted him more implicitly, than I did then. Quotations have already been made from the report of the proceedings of the Conference, but there are one or two that I intend to place before honorable members as showing the attitude which the Prime Minister then took up. At the outset, we were met by a series of resolutions, the effect of one of which was such that, if adopted, it would have destroyed the power of the Commonwealth, inasmuch as it would have allotted to us a too small proportion of the Customs and Excise revenue. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to tell tales out of school, but I may sav that although there was a difference of opinion, I do not think that the proceedings were stormy. The State Premiers again and again returned to the resolution to which I have referred, and to which the Prime Minister and I strongly objected. Here is a quotation from a speech made at the Melbourne Conference in 1908 by the honorable gentleman in defence of the position taken up by the Commonwealth  in reference to the questions always considered together at the Convention - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>One was the revenue derived from the Customs in the Commonwealth and the other was the interest on the debts which had been incurred by the States of the Commonwealth. Even before that Convention, if I remember aright, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith had dwelt upon the necessity of considering these two factors together. </para>
                    <para class="block">That has formed the foundation of the present discussion. To show how strongly the Prime Minister felt on this question, I would point out that when at the Melbourne Conference, he was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Evans,</inline> Premier of Tasmania - </para>
                    <para>We clearly understand then that the scheme of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest is that in taking over the State debts we cannot deal with one part without the other? </para>

                    <para>I do not think it was ever intended to be really optional. </para>
                    <para>That was a significant and most emphatic statement - </para>
                    <para>That is to say, it was expected that the option should be exercised in one way - by taking over the debts. </para>
                    <para>The honorable gentleman was then fighting strongly for the rights of the Commonwealth. He said further on that there would be -  useful objects achieved by considering once, more the two questions together. </para>
                    <para>Then,again, at page 245 of the Report of the Proceedings of the Conference of Premiers, held in Melbourne, in 1908, it is set forth that he said - </para>
                    <para>We are not called upon at this stage to attempt to make an arrangement for all time. </para>
                    <para>If this agreement is embodied in the Constitution, however, it will exist really for all time. It is not likely that it will be easy to secure an amendment of the Constitution in respect of so important a matter. The Prime Minister went on to say - </para>
                    <para>For us to attempt to prophecy what the conditions of Australia will be in the next century is so obviously beyond us that no one makes any calculation concerning it. </para>
                    <para>Addressing the  President  of the Conference, he said - </para>
                    <para>In your paper, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> you publish an illustrative table, in which you estimate the revenue of the Commonwealth for the next thirty or forty years. That is extremely problematical. It is very useful, no doubt, as a mere estimate, but no one would dream of relying on it to make any definite financial proposal which would be binding. </para>
                    <para class="block">These quotations from the speeches made by the Prime Minister at that time are, to my mind, very important. </para>

                    Swinburne.  Let us give another instance about railway freights. ... In order that our people may compete we must reduce freights enormously, yet if we have no margin to go on, where are we?
                </para>
                <para>That was a most extraordinary statement to make.  A  State Minister actually wanted the Commonwealth to give the State enough money to allow it to reduce freights, possibly to a nominal sum. We know that in New South Wales nearly all the income tax and the stamp duties were taken off, and the Commonwealth was expected to  pay  for everything. The same thing seems to have been in the minds of some of the members of that Conference. </para>

                    <para>In regard to the State debts, I hope it will be agreed that the Commonwealth shall take over the whole. I notice that some one has taken some exception to the words &#34; take over.&#34; Those are the words of the Constitution. It says that the Commonwealth may take over from the States their debts as existing at the time of the establishment of the Commonwealth. Although I am quite willing, and anxious, too, that the Commonwealth Government should take over the &#39; whole of the debts as they exist at the present time, I have never been, personally, a very strong advocate of that course. I have personally thought that if we carried out the Constitution we would have quite enough to do. There is, however, a decided opinion against that view from those I have consulted in London, and those I have consulted here. They all think we should take over the whole of the State debts. I am almost singular in my opinion that we might go on our way carrying out the Constitution, and leaving the forty odd millions in the hands of the States. If we should fail to come to some arrangement in regard to taking over the debts as a whole at this Conference, it is, however, the intention of the Commonwealth to proceed to carry out its powers, and take over the ^202,000,000 which it has the right to do under the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>They are really not mixed up at all. In the case of the debts, the State is liable for interest, and the only advantage I can see to a State would be the removal of the responsibility of providing for the debt as it became due, and also the management of the debt. . . . The two things could of course conveniently go together, but not necessarily under the Constitution. </para>

                <para class="block">What I have quoted shows the opinions expressed by the right honorable member at the Brisbane Conference, and I shall show presently what his opinion is now regarding the State debts. I have a great objection to a scheme which alters absolutely and finally what has previously been in the minds of the Commonwealth Ministry, and I venture, to think in the minds of the majority of. the members of this House. What was proposed then was a good arrangement, and I object to the Government turning round upon it and putting forward the present proposal. Since those Conferences were held, the Fusion party has been formed. I have tried hard to find out what sort of fusion it is, and how long it has been arranged for. Statements have been made that it is to last for five years. On a question of this kind, the&#39; House and the country have a right to know if any arrangement has been agreed upon, and for how long. We are told that the Fusion party have agreed to sink the Tariff question for five years. That is a serious matter, because very shortly we shall have to look very seriously to the question of revenue. However, for the present, I suppose we can only wait. We are now . asked to alter the Constitution by way of a referendum, and to bring about a new order of things. First of all, it must strike anyone who thinks calmly upon the question that two or three of the State Premiers who entered into the agreement now before us were very shaky in their positions, commanding majorities of only one or two votes in their Parliaments. I do not think, therefore, that they constitute a stable party to put forward such an important alteration of the Constitution as is now proposed. </para>

                <para class="block">Tasmania has a majority of only two or three. As a whole, the Premiers who entered into the agreement do not constitute a very strong combination as representing the opinions of the various States. We have to look at the matter, in that light. I do not think that there is any need for an alteration of. the Constitution. It is competent for the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and of the States to make an arrangement which will be binding upon&#39; and respected by all parties. I do not think any one who read the debate on this motion could find evidence of strong opposition here to State interests, though honorable members are strongly opposed to the tying up of the Commonwealth by a proposal which will make it subservient to the States. In my opinion, the Commonwealth will treat the States even more liberally than it might be expected to do. A little while back, when I instituted two Trust Funds, I was attacked by the State authorities. What <inline font-style="italic">T</inline> did should have been done five or six years earlier, had it been possible, though, as a matter of fact, it could not be done under the Constitution until 1905. The result of my action was to accumulate a fund for the payment of old-age pensions. The estimated expenditure on old-age pensions for this year is about &#163;&#34;1,500,000, which is as much as I thought it would be. Incidentally, I would remark that many of the pensions which have been granted have been fixed almost at starvation point. I have received a large number of complaints, some of which I have brought before the Minister. I cannot understand why pensions should be lower under Commonwealth than under State administration. Probably, this expenditure will eventually increase to &#163;&#34;2,000,000. Of course, the Government is not paying invalid pensions. This and other likely expenditure must be taken into consideration in forecasting the future. The Prime Minister, speaking on the present motion - the passage will be found on page 3156 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record for this session - said - </para>
                <para>Beyond the limitation of the Commonwealth to its one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue for ten years, the question of finance was left open in all phases. It is open to-day, or will be under the Constitution itself eighteen months hence. It is significant that the other great financial problem involving the Commonwealth and the States, which has always been, and must always be, read in relation to the partnership, that of the State debts, is treated, speaking generally, in exactly the same fashion. </para>
                <para class="block">If we entered into the proposed arrangement, we should not be free. We should have to pay 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to the States for all time, and, under certain conditions, the Commonwealth would not be able to do it, unless it obtained an increased revenue. The Treasurer stated that he attended all the meetings of the Convention. So did I, and most of us who were members of it. He said, too, that he took a prominent part in its deliberations, which is true. I believe, too, that he took a prominent part in the secret Conference of Premiers which was held afterwards, to whose methods I was opposed. He says that the Braddon section was intended by the Convention to be permanent, but I join issue with him there. During the Adelaide session, I made a proposal in the Finance Committee, which was discussed, its object being to protect the Treasurers of the States, though its form differed from that of the amendment afterwards proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon in Melbourne. It has been asked, &#34; Why do I not stand up for the States now as I did when Premier?&#34; My reply is that I stand up for all their just claims, and am prepared to give them even more than they should reasonably have. It must not be forgotten that one State has received over &#163;20,000,000 from the Commonwealth, while all the States have received more than .. &#163;60,000,000, and over &#163;6,000,000 more than their constitutional three-fourths. </para>

We must not allow the Commonwealth to become so short of money that the Treasurer will not know how to find funds for paying the public servants. We have already got very close to the wind once or twice. The Constitution requires the Commonwealth to pay away every penny in the Treasury on the last day of the month; and had not the law been broken by the present Treasurer and myself, the&#39; public servants could not have been paid on one or two occasions. </para>

In my opinion, the right honorable member is under a wrong impression. I hope to be able to show, presently, that before  1920  the Commonwealth will have no surplus revenue from Customs and Excise.

They made a compact which is embodied in the Constitution, and, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, after  19 10,  the Commonwealth will have full control of the finances. I do not like to hear it suggested that the Commonwealth will act dishonorably towards the States. During the past nine years, it has returned to them more money than it was compelled by the Constitution to return. In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner was wrong in starving the Departments to have money to return to the States, and I fought out the matter in Cabinet many times. The Governments of the States do not know what it is to be pinched. They have had more money from the Commonwealth than they have known what to do with.- </para>

                        <para>- If that be so, the Senate is where this question should have been dealt with. I should like to say that, when the Braddon clause was under discussion in the Convention, and when it was passed, I was confined to my bed in Sydney; but, as soon as I was able to get about again, I called a meeting in the New Masonic Hall, and showed what the effects would be. The speech I made on that occasion has, I think, been more than once quoted with approval by the Minister of Defence. </para>

                        <para>- I am as great a State Rights champion to-day as I was then, always provided there is no undue interference with the Federation. I have travelled about these States as much as most people, from the years 1864-5, when I took part in a long exploring journey in Northern Queensland; and I think I know the trend of public opinion. We have to keep in view the consideration that there may be a curtailment of the States governmental machinery. This is a matter, of course, which the people will have to think seriously over; but I feel satisfied that seven Governors and fourteen Houses of Parliament, with all their attendant expense, will not be tolerated very long. If there should be a reduction such as I have indicated, how is the arrangement for the payment of 25s. per head to be carried out? </para>

                        <para>- I said that there will be a reduction - that seven Governors and fourteen Houses of Parliament will not long be tolerated by the people, though what the result of any change would be I cannot say. The States would still have certain details left to them; but what form their future local government would take I do not know, except that it must be very much cheaper than the present system. Another very probable event is that there may be a large influx of people into one State or into the Commonwealth generally ; and I ask what would the position be, supposing the revenue from the Customs and Excise did not increase in proportion ? My own opinion is that the revenue will not increase very much in the next ten or fifteen years. In reference to the Treasurer&#39;s statement that I at one time regarded the proposed payment to the States as permanent, I happen to know that, when the Constitution was under consideration by the Premiers in conference, the right honorable gentleman was being courted like a girl ; indeed, as the price of his coming into Federation he could have got almost anything he liked, and he did drive a pretty strong financial bargain. </para>

                        <para>- At that time the States might have flattered themselves into the belief that the arrangement was to be permanent, because promises had been made, and particularly to Western Australia - not in the &#39;Conference, but previously - that were not justifiable. In the case of New South Wales every effort was made to induce the State to join the Union ; but, at the same time, there was no promise of any permanent repayment. I was astonished the other day when the honorable member for Boothby drew attention to the fact that, according to the Treasurer, the Commonwealth will have to go On paying  ^7,000,006  or  ^8,000,000  to the States for all time, even after the debts have been paid. Are we going to find and exploit Commonwealth gold mines? We cannot carry out the agreement proposed, much less the extraordinary arrangement foreshadowed by the Treasurer.

But when we see the States reducing their revenue from other sources ; when we see New South Wales, for instance, reducing her stamp duties and the revenue derived from other directions, we may fairly ask ourselves, &#34; What right have the States to take this action and at the same time to ask the Commonwealth to make good the losses of revenue they are thus incurring?&#34;- Although we have no desire to injure the States in the slightest degree, these are questions that we must consider. The Commonwealth has enormous responsibilities. The Government now invite us to pass the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, and if we do. can any one say . the development of the Territory will involve? </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid to form an estimate. Before long, we may also be called upon to incur additional expenditure in Papua; although I hope that such a demand will not be made upon us. Then, again, several great lines of railways are projected. Perhaps I am even more anxious than is the Treasurer that the projected line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie should be laid down. When in Western Australia, I promised that I would do all in my power to promote the . construction of that line ; and I recognise that we&#39; shall never have true Federal sympathy as between the western State and the eastern States until a speedy means of communication is established. That can be secured only by the construction of this railway. If wc take over the Northern Territory, proposals will also be submitted for the construction of railway lines there, and are we to pinch ourselves for all time in order- that we may make a big return to the States? I should like the Commonwealth to be able to give the States more than they want ; but as it cannot do so, we must have regard, first of all, to the demands of the National Parliament.

                <para class="block">If the States have received too much in the days gone by, it does not follow that the same course should be pursued in the future. The Treasurer&#39;s statement serves to show how useless is any calculation based on the data at present available, and that, therefore, we ought not to enter into any arrangement with the States that will have a duration of more than four or five years. There is an evolution taking place. Information having an important bearing on the relations of the Commonwealth and the States is being obtained year after year ; and, although we may theorize as much as we please, only experience can afford us any criterion of what the future is likely to be. That is a strong argument in opposition to a long-continued agreement between the Commonwealth and the States. I commend the attitude taken up by the Age : in regard to this question. That newspaper has been supporting the present Government; but it has certainly taken a calm and deliberate view of this grave and important question., which should commend itself to the House. I trust, at all events, that the suggestions which it has made will commend themselves to the Government. &#39; Recognising that they are unlikely to carry the proposals which  they  have submitted, and knowing that the question will not be made a party one, they should make a proposition which the people may Fairly 1 be expected to  say is  a reasonable one. .The Treasurer, in the course of his speech, referred to the Tariffs of various countries, and particularly to that of New Zealand, as showing what we were likely to derive from Customs and Excise during the next ten years. I am sorry that the right honorable gentleman did <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> examine the New Zealand Tariff. Had he done so, he would have found that it is not a Protectionist, but a revenue-producing one. With the exception of. Western Australia, whose circumstances have been abnormal, no country derives so much from Customs and  Excise as  does New Zealand ; and its returns cannot be accepted as a guide to what is likely to happen in the Commonwealth. In a paper which has been presented to the House, the Treasurer estimates the amount which would be returnable to the States in 1&#39;920-r under the Braddon section on the assumption that the- Commonwealth Customs and Excise returns per head of the population in that year will be &#163;2 8s. 6d. Neither the Secretary to the Treasury, nor the Commonwealth Statistician, could inform me,  however, how that computation was arrived at. </para>

                        <para>- I am not making any imputation against the Treasury officials; and I repeat that I know of no country, with the exception of the State of Western Australia, where the returns from Customs and Excise are so large <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> as are those of New Zealand. That State, at the inception of the Federation, had a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> return from Customs and Excise of &#163;6 per head, which was due to the great influx of males, and to the fact that the State was not then producing largely for itself. It also had the benefit of a special Tariff, which was reduced by a sliding scale extending over a period of five years ; and, being the first port of call for the oversea mail steamers, and other vessels, it obtained a great deal from abroad. New Zealand has obtained an average return of &#163;3 5s. rod. per head from a revenue, and not from a Protective Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- The return per head in 1904 was &#163;3 5s. 2d., while, when this return was prepared, it was &#163;3 5s. rod., se that there has been a slight increase. However, that is a great deal more than &#163;2 8s. 6d. per head. The population of the Commonwealth in 1907 was 4,197,037, an increase of 77,556 over the previous year. The estimated population for 1908 is 4,275,306, or an increase of 78,269 over 1907. Taking these two years as a basis, the total estimated increase for the twenty-four months was 155,825&#39;, and the total increase by 1920 would be 935&#62;I5&#176;) giving a total population in that year of 5,210,456. I may say that that does not quite tally with the figures given by the Treasurer, but it very nearly does. The Customs and Excise receipts for 1908-9 totalled &#163;10,843,985, or a decrease of &#163;4OI&#62;367 from 1907-8. The estimated receipts from the same source in 1910 are &#163;10,800,000, or a decrease of .&#163;43,985 over 1908-9. That means that, in the two years which I have taken, there was a decrease of &#163;445,352, or nearly .&#163;500,000, in the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth. Taking that as a basis, the Customs and Excise receipts in 1920 will have decreased instead of increased from their present total, and there will be a net return from that source of only between &#163;8,000,000 and &#163;9,000,000. With an estimated total population in that year of 5,210,456, I arrive at a probable Customs and Excise return of only 32s. IOC&#91;., or, say, 33s., per head, and I cannot make it more. I think it is very likely that the Customs and Excise receipts will decrease to that extent. I may perhaps have taken an extreme case in the last two years, and the result may be altered somewhat by various factors. It does not seem to be quite a fair computation, although it is certainly a possible result. Having looked through the figures for various countries, I cannot  Avoid  coming to the conclusion that there  will,  at any rate, not be any great increase in Customs and Excise revenue. There will certainly not be in Customs revenue, and we may fairly consider that there will be no serious increase over the figures for 1908-9 or 1909-10, because, in a country such as ours, where internal development, manufacture, and production are so rapidly on the increase, the people are being supplied gradually, and will be supplied greatly, if the Tariff is as effective as it is intended to be, with our own productions instead of with imported manufactures. With a country like this, one cannot make a proper comparison by means of the figures that I have quoted from other countries, because they are old countries, and their manufactures and production are not increasing in the. same way as ours are! For many years, the manufacturing industries in most of our States have been, so to speak,&#39; latent. I have been through a great many of the factories in Victoria, and I know that they are increasing in number, and that their output is increasing; and, as a&#39; natural result&#39;, imports and Customs revenue must decrease. I have also visited all the large factories in New South Wales lately. I know what they are doing, and I think that there will be in that State a great reduction in imports of various kinds, as the people become supplied with goods of local manufacture. What, then, will be the result if a hard and fast division of the Customs and Excise revenue between the Commonwealth and the States is made permanent in the Constitution, in the way proposed by the Government? The result will  De  that ultimately there will have to be an immense increase of revenue duties, or the imposition of direct taxation, or both. I do not accuse the Prime Minister, or any other Minister, of knowing or foreseeing this; but I warn the people that if this agreement takes effect for any considerable time, it means saying good-bye to a protective Tariff. That is another reason why we should look very jealously at the proposals that are put before us. As I stated, I arrive at a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> return from Customs and Excise revenue for 1920 of about 33s. per head, which means, if the States receive 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> that the Commonwealth will have only about 8s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to carry on with. </para>

                        <para>- I have not, but I can assure the right honorable member that I am not making this criticism in any carping spirit. When I looked at the figures from other countries, it struck me that there must have been a mistake in the calculation, and that it probably lay in estimating that there would be a large increase in Customs revenue. I have held all through that there will not be. There may perhaps be a Customs revenue equal to what we have now, or it may even go up to the figure for the first year in which the present Tariff operated, but I do not think that it will increase in any appreciable degree for the next four or five years; and I am sure it will only have increased very slightly, if at all, by 1920. Some time ago I&#39; quoted from memory the totals of a return showing the estimated expenditure in 1920, as prepared for me when Treasurer by my officers, and laid by me upon the table of the House. The honorable member for Parkes took exception to my estimate. At that time, I had not seen the estimate of revenue, which I since obtained from the Under-Treasurer. I find that I was, to some extent, wrong in regard to the estimated expenditure, and that the honorable member for Parkes was, to some extent, right, but not to the extent which he claimed. I have gone through the figures again, and in quoting them now, I wish to point out that this can only be regarded, like any .other similar computation, as an estimate in the dark. I said at that particular time that it was estimated that the expenditure in 1920 would <inline font-style="italic">be &#163;9,500,000.</inline> Since then, I understand that further increases of &#39;expenditure have been proposed. For instance, the Post Office expenditure will be increased by nearly ,&#163;500,000 over the amount which I first gave. It is absurd to put down only ;&#163;5&#176;j&#176;oo for advertising and immigration for 1920. If we are going to do that work properly, it will cost &#163;150,000 or ^&#163;200,000. When I was in London with the Prime Minister, Canada was paying from ,&#163;200,000 to ,&#163;250,000, or more, for advertising. </para>

                        <para>- My officers put down &#163;50,000. I felt very keenly when I was in England that we ought to advertise a great deal more, and, after a struggle, I got &#163;20,000 provided on the Estimates, although only a part of that was spent. 1 am sure that in ten years&#39; time our advertising will cost &#163;200,000, and,_therefore, we must add another &#163;150,000 to the estimate. Then, again, only &#163;50,000 is set down for further State services to be taken over. I have since tried to estimate what the lighthouses and other services that have been taken over will cost us. . I am sure that it will come to more than double &#163;50,000. That brings the increase over my first estimate up to about &#163;700,000. 1 also see that a statement is made that &#163;2,000,000 will have to be found for the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. It was suggested that we should borrow for that purpose, but I strongly object to borrowing for matters of that kind. We have, therefore, &#163;2,000,000 more to provide in the way of increased expenditure by 1920. I also read in the press a statement by the Minister of Defence that the Naval proposals of the Government would cost nearly &#163;4,000,000. Where is that money to come from? The items I have mentioned would mean an expenditure of between &#163;16,000,000 and &#163;17,000,000 in 1920, when the revenue from Customs and Excise duties will not exceed &#163;11,000,000. How, then, can we pay 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to the States for all time? There are one or two other matters to which I should like to refer; but I am suffering from a bad throat, and do not wish to make it worse. This question should not be considered from the stand-point of party. We should all do our best to bring about an arrangement which will benefit the whole people. Theories are all very well, but practical results must be &#39; given first consideration ; and I think I have shown that we shall not be able to continue to pay the States 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> until 1920. If the Government deal fairly and liberally in this matter, it will give greater satisfaction to the people than will be given by the leg-roping of the Commonwealth for all time. I do not think any arrangement should be made for a longer period than five years. No one knows what will happen within that time, and at the end of it we shall be better able to arrange for the future than we are now. </para>

                    <para>.- I rise with great diffidence to speak on this subject. Unlike some honorable members, I have not a scheme of my own to propound. I do not fear that we shall unduly hamper the Commonwealth by adopting the agreement. Whatever arrangement is come to must be fair to both parties. Judging from the debate, honorable members do not find fault with the proposal to return 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to the States; but the Opposition seems to be of the opinion that we should not embody the agreement in the Constitution, so that the State authorities may know exactly what they will receive from the Common wealth until the arrangement is altered by a similar constitutional amendment. To my mind, there ought to be something amounting to permanency in the arrangement-. The State authorities will always have very large financial responsibilities in connexion with the development of their territories. The Commonwealth, too, will have large expenditure to make. Therefore, under any agreement, there should be a fair sharing of the revenue between the Commonwealth and the States. Various estimates have been made of the revenue of the Commonwealth in certain future years, but I do not pay much attention to them. So many condition* affect the revenue that it is impossible to make a reasonably accurate estimate for a time even five or six years hence. When the draft Constitution Bill was being discussed in New South Wales, the financial authorities of the State said that it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to raise from Customs and Excise duties more than about &#163;6,000,000 a year ten or fifteen years after Federation ; but nine years afterwards we are raising nearly double that amount. It will be possible, without affecting the protective incidence of the Tariff, to obtain by means of it more revenue than we are now getting. Therefore it is absurd to say that the adoption of the agreement will make the Commonwealth subservient to the States. The Commonwealth has at its disposal unlimited sources of taxation, direct and indirect, of which it can avail itself at need. I admit that  the States desire to be the sole authorities to levy direct taxation, and I am prepared to leave the levying of such taxation to them; though, if the Commonwealth were in need of money, I should not consider it bound to refrain from levying direct taxation. At some distant date it may need to levy direct taxation to pay for defence, but I do not think that that will be necessary in the immediate future. The Commonwealth possesses every source of taxation. </para>

                        <para>- We shall have to pay 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to the States, but, inasmuch as the Commonwealth will be able to raise as much revenue as it likes, it cannot be argued that it will not be able to fill its purse. The honorable member for Hume contended that the Parliaments of the States could lessen their needs by decreasing their expenditure. No doubt the pre-Federation promises of economy have not been kept. Were they carried out, there would . be a considerable saving in the cost of government in the States, though that is a small factor in the present equation. The saving &#176;f  &#163;40.000 &#176;r  &#163;50,000 a .y.ear ky the State Parliaments is a trifle in comparison with the large issues with which we are dealing. I hope that the anticipated saving will be effected ; but, in any ease, the States will need as much money as they can get to develop their resources by means of irrigation schemes, railways, and other public works. I join issue with the honorable member regarding the statement that the Parliament of New South Wales has been extravagant. It has spent a great deal of money, but the expenditure has been mainly on railways and tramways, and other reproductive works of permanent benefit to the State. The contention of the honorable member that a large increase of population will decrease the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> should not carry much weight. If our population is increased by immigration, it will be increased by the arrival here of persons whose expenditure will increase rather than decrease the Customs and Excise revenue <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> Most of them will be men and women in the prime of life ; the increase in the number of the children will be smaller than the ordinary natural increase by excess of births over deaths. The only other question is whether the taking over of the debts should be incorporated in this agreement; and there is no reason why the debts should not be dealt with separately, or after this agreement -is passed. The constitutional right of this Parliament to take over the debts, as existing at the time of Federation, is not in any way altered by the agreement, and the proposed alteration of the Constitution would give us even greater power than we have at present. </para>

                        <para>- My reading of the Constitution is that the Commonwealth Parliament can take over the debts without the consent of the States, if it so desire - that is, the debts as existing at the time of Federation - and, under the proposed amendment of the Constitution, the whole of the debts. The moment we do take over the debts, we alter altogether the incidence of the financial agreement. Instead of the Commonwealth paying the States money, the States will have to pay the Commonwealth money - the States will have to pay the difference between the amount represented by 25s. per head and the amount actually paid by the Commonwealth in respect of the State debts. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but that is altogether a. different question. We could at any time we chose turn our debit balance into a credit balance by taking over the State debts, and financing them. The honorable member for Hume rather unfairly &#34; took exception to the payment to the States going on after this Parliament had taken over the debts. r If the Commonwealth takes over the debts under the Constitution, it acts merely as a sort of agent for the States, debiting them with the money paid, and, of course, the payment to the States will go on. If, however, while taking over the debts and paying the interest on behalf of the States, this Parliament at the same time creates a sinking fund out of its own money, the States will be liable to the Commonwealth for the amount so paid in respect of the debts, and to that extent the payment to the States would be decreased. On the other hand, if we create the sinking fund out of the  25s.  per head due to the States, then the State debts are merely being paid out of the States&#39; money, and we must, therefore, go on paying the  25s.  There seems to me to be nothing unfair in such a proposal. </para>

                        <para>- The only difference will be that, instead of paying in London, the States will pay to the Commonwealth. I do not claim to be in any sense a financial authority ; but I am guided to a great extent by the speeches during this debate ; and it seems to me that the agreement is a fair one, and that we run no risk by incorporating it in the Constitution. We may alter the Constitution again, if necessary ; and we always have the whip hand on the States to the extent that we can, if necessary, duplicate their direct taxation ; and if we were to threaten to take such a step, I think the States would always be ready to meet us in a fairly reasonable way. I do not anticipate any danger to the Commonwealth by the incorporation of this agreement in the Constitution, and, as that seems to be the question at issue, I shall vote for the agreement as it stands. </para>

                    <para>.- It might be concluded from the remarks of the honorable member for Hume, that it was intended to construct trans-continental railways, take over the Northern Territory, and carry out other expensive administrative works-, and acts entirely out of current revenue. It is deceiving the public to permit such an impression to go forth uncontradicted. Quite a number of figures have been quoted in proof of various contentions. It has been said that figures cannot lie; but that, I suppose, is only because figures cannot .speak. Judging from the conclusions arrived at by those who quoted figures, it would appear that they can be made to prove almost anything. Speaking on the Budget T intimated that I would oppose short-dated loans, and I am pleased that I did so, because I think that, owing to the attitude then adopted by some honorable members and myself, a beneficial influence was exerted on the Premiers&#39; Conference held shortly afterwards. The States, I think, recognise that the Commonwealth has incurred liabilities which will relieve them of certain obligations; and, perhaps, a better agreement was arrived at than would have been the case, had the States representatives been under the impression that the Government could force any proposal through this Parliament, and might, therefore, be careless in regard to the revenue required to meet this year&#39;s obligations. One satisfactory feature of the Conference is that, for the first time since the inception of Federation, the States and the Commonwealth have been able to come to an agreement - to reach finality. It is now for this House to ratify or reject the agreement ; and, personally, 1 shall support it. I am prepared .to go even further and say that, if we cannot get this agreement, we should go to the people as soon as possible and ask them to ratify or reject it. This is a vital question ; we cannot afford to treat it lightly ; and, being of a Democratic turn of mind, I shall be glad to submit either myself or the agreement to the people. The unrest in regard to our financial relations, which has existed for some time, cannot be permitted to continue. Up to the present the Commonwealth and the States have been like two dogs fighting for one bone; and to this position there ought to be an end. It is only fair that the States should ask to be placed in a position of security where they may know, as they did before Federation, what they are to expect to receive from Customs and Excise revenue. The proposed arrangement will achieve that end. and also enable the Commonwealth Treasurer to know where he stand&#39;s. He will have no trouble in estimating his obligations, and will have unhampered control of the balance of the revenue. The agreement may be regarded as a fair compromise, although I am rather disappointed that the sum agreed upon is not at least  28s.  - a payment which, I think, the Commonwealth could have afforded, at any rate for a time. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly it would be better if the payment had been arranged on a sliding scale. A payment of  28s.  is  8s. 3d.  less than the present average, and would give the Treasurer an extra  &#163;1,829,450.  On page  117  of the Budget </para>

                <para class="block">Papers it is stated that the estimated revenue is &#163;3 12s. 4&#188;d. per head, and the gross estimated expenditure &#163;1 16s. 1&#189;d. showing a balance of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 16s. 2fd., or just about the average now being paid back to the States ; in fact, I think the average .last year was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 16s. 3d. If the Treasurer&#39;s estimates of income and expenditure are realized the proposed capitation allowance of 25s. per annum will make available to the Commonwealth next year an additional sum of &#163;2, 438,440, provided that this agreement be ratified. That will not be the only gain. A still more important fact is that the Treasurer will be relieved of the obligation to return to the States&#39; three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, and that if we decided to increase taxation in any way, we should be able to do so, knowing that the Commonwealth would reap the whole benefit. It is desirable that there should be an element of permanency associated with the agreement. It should have at least that stability which is proposed. It should be embodied in the Constitution, so that it may be varied only by the consent of the people. We have at our disposal all the sources of taxation, if we find it is necessary at any time to increase our revenue. </para>

                        <para>- I do not ; but I would favour the imposition of a duty on cotton piece-goods. We are entitled, not only to receive some revenue from that source, but to secure a modicum of Protection in regard to it. If Protection is, as I believe it is, the policy of Australia, it should have an all-round application. If this agreement is ratified, the present Government of the Commonwealth, and its successors, will hesitate to resort to extravagant expenditure, since that would necessitate direct taxation, which is not favoured in the country, and should not be resorted to unless it is absolutely necessary. I, therefore, think that it will have a steadying influence on the Commonwealth Parliament. The honorable member for Darwin has given this question considerable attention. I noticed that his proposals were favorably mentioned at the Brisbane </para>

                <para class="block">Labour Conference, but the members of his party have apparently deserted him, since his proposals have not been very favorably reviewed by them during this debate. He considers that the proposed return to the States,&#39; under this agreement, would be a first mortgage over our resources. If it were, it would be a lien that would make the security of our stocks much better than it is. We are not proposing to mortgage our resources to some foreign Power ; we are simply undertaking to return to the States money which will enable them to meet their obligations in the way of interest. The honorable member for Wide Bay took the right honorable member for East Sydney to task for having dared to hesitate to allow the Federal Parliament to settle this question. To my mind, however, the right honorable member for East Sydney deserves all the credit, if there is any to be taken in this connexion, for having made it possible for the Federal Parliament to deal with this problem at the present time, since he was instrumental in having inserted in the Constitution the ten years&#39; limitation of the Braddon section. Apart from that, I would remind the honorable member for Wide Bay that there are two parties interested in this question - the States and the Commonwealth - and that an agreement was arrived at by the people before they federated. The Constitution, which was framed by the people&#39;s representatives, and submitted to the people, was certainly accepted with the Braddon section in it, but it was only after considerable thought, and as the outcome of many Conferences, that the financial arrangements were settled, and when they were, the settlement was described as a blot on the Constitution. This has always been a difficult and complex question to determine, but it was never intended by the people or their representatives at the Convention that 1he Commonwealth Parliament should have control of the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue. Whether the agreement is a good or a bad one for the States, the amount returnable under it will be a known quantity, and the State Treasurers will thus be enabled to more accurately estimate their revenue. At the same time, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth will be able to estimate his liabilities to the States,, and those liabilities will vary only with the population. I have no intention of supporting any proposition to give the Commonwealth Government more  power in respect of the State debts than they have at the present time. I wish it to be clearly understood that I do not think it. would be to the benefit of the people of Australia that the Commonwealth should take over the State debts. Under the Constitution, we have power to take over a certain proportion, and I shall not vote to extend that power. </para>

                        <para>-I do not know that that is a relevant interjection ; but let me say that I shall be satisfied to return to my constituents with my pledges fulfilled. The proposal to extend the power of the Commonwealth to take over the debts of the States has not been very prominently before the electors, and as the Bill providing for that extension is linked with that now under consideration, I think it only fair to intimate the course that I intend to take when it is submitted to us. I shall certainly oppose it, and I have only to say, in conclusion, that I am pleased that the agreement which has been arrived at has relieved the Commonwealth of the necessity of issuing short-dated Treasury bonds, as proposed by the Treasurer. I trust that we have heard the last of that proposition, and am glad, if any remarks made by me, during the debate on the Budget, have had the effect of inducing the Government to drop it. </para>

                        <para>.- It is proposed by this Bill to amend section  105  of the Constitution which gives the Commonwealth Parliament power to take over the debts of the States as existing at the inception of Federation. One of the mistakes made by the framers of the Constitution lay in thinking that the Federal Parliament would, as soon as it was constituted, proceed to deal with the great financial questions which it was primarily created to settle. Unfortunately, the unexpected often happens, and in this instance, the intention of the people was not given effect to. In the meantime, instead of the debts being taken over by the Commonwealth to the advantage of the people, they have remained in the hands of the States, and have increased in the aggregate by  &#163;50,000,000,  or about  25  per cent. The Commonwealth has no power to take over the whole of the debts as they now exist, and to become the principal in negotiating with the financiers of the Old World for renewals, conversions, or new loans. That is most unfortunate, and I am entirely in accord with the Government in the proposal in the Bill now before us. I think it is a proposition that ought to go to the people; but where I differ from the Government is with regard to their attitude towards this and the other Bill with which we have just been dealing. Let us assume that both Bills are passed bv this Parliament, and are referred to the people, and that the one determining the return of a fixed sum to the States from the Commonwealth revenue is carried, while the other dealing with the State debts is rejected by the people. What position would the Commonwealth Parliament be in then ? The difficulty which this Bill seeks to remedy will remain as it was; and the Commonwealth Parliament will have no power to prevent the constant loss of interest to the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- That is no news to the public or to this House ; because that amount of the State debts could have been taken over by the Commonwealth from the first. That has not been done, however, and in the meantime, the whole of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth has been returned to the States. The Treasurer knows that the  &#163;200,000,000  worth of State debts have not been taken over, because we should not have been able to deal with the whole of the debts, and in all probability, we should have had no well-considered scheme to enable the Commonwealth to start out as the negotiator for new loans, and the controller of the whole question of Australian borrowing. </para>

                            <para>- Many things are matters of opinion. The Treasurer has very definite opinions about certain matters, and frequently has the courage to express them. In fact, he sometimes shows a reckless courage in expressing opinions about other people&#39;s opinions. I believe that an enormous advantage would at once be gained by the Commonwealth dealing with the State debts - that as soon as one Commonwealth stock was created, the credit of the whole of the States would improve, and that as time went on, perhaps even the advantage of J per cent., indicated by the honorable member for Mernda, would be obtained. I have been unable to discover, from all the authorities I have read, <inline font-style="italic">how</inline> a gain of \ per cent, would be possible, but I have always assumed that at least &#163; per cent, in the aggregate could be saved by the Commonwealth within a reasonable time. That saving will amount to an enormous sum in the course of half a century, and, on that ground alone, action by the Commonwealth is urgently necessary. I am anxious to press on with this Bill, but may I suggest to the Government that they should first submit it by referendum to the people, and ascertain whether they desire the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with the State debts question, and so save money for them, before they submit to a referendum the proposal in the other Bill, which cannot save money for the people? If this Bill is passed, and the people agree to give us die powers asked for with regard to the State debts, we can immediately begin to save money for them, which they cannot now save ; but if the Prime Minister submits a complicated question to the people- the dual question involved in this and the other Bill - that most desirable result may not be achieved. The right honorable member for Swan says there is a difference of opinion as to whether the Commonwealth can save money by taking over the debts.  </para>

                            <para>- I admit that; and  1  do not think, as a layman, that we can prevent the States from borrowing; but we do not need plenary powers in a matter of that kind. If the Commonwealth improved the aggregate credit of the States, the people would soon demand that the State Governments should negotiate their loans through .the cheapest medium, which would be the Commonwealth. I am not one of those who declare that the States should be prevented from doing what they can do better than the Commonwealth. A little experience would soon show that the Commonwealth is the best authority to manage the renewal and conversion of the State debts, and the issue of future loans; and then the common sense of the electors will speedily compel the States to borrow only through the Commonwealth, or through the body which the Commonwealth sets up. Does not that support my argument that the first duty of the Government is to proceed with this amendment of the Constitution before they put before the people the question of the distribution of the revenue? </para>

                            <para>- Then I differ entirely from the Treasurer. The honorable member for Moreton, one of the Treasurer&#39;s own followers, lauds the action of the Government in proposing to fix in the Constitution for all time a return of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to the States, but he also says: &#34; I tell the Government at once that they will not have my vote in this House, or my help in the country, to amend the Constitution with regard to the control of the State debts.&#34; If that attitude is taken up by honorable members opposite, what position will the Commonwealth be placed in? The Government proposal, therefore, is to entrench the States as much as they can, and to prevent the Commonwealth, as far as possible, from taking power to save money to the people. </para>

                            <para>- The interjection of the Minister of Defence throws no light on the question. I see no deep-laid plots. 1 simply quote a statement made by a supporter of the Fusion Government - a name which I use only because the Government use it themselves. With one exception,_ 1 know of no State Government or Premier favorable to the Commonwealth taking over the debts. As a matter of fact, the first clause in the Premiers&#39; agreement - and in that I would almost stake my life that I can recognise the language of the Prime Minister - sets out that there shall be an investigation into the important question of taking over the State debts. That is very different from the mandatory clauses of the agreement with regard to amending the Constitution by providing for the payment to the States of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">-per capita,</inline> as I say,&#39; for all time, although some people say that there is no ground for believing that that is to be put into the Constitution in perpetuity. At every election the people have been told of the urgency for transferring the State debts to the Commonwealth, whereas the re-distribution of the revenue has not been largely dealt with. The Government, however, have placed the cart before the horse, and arranged to dispose of the Commonwealth revenue before providing for the best use of it. I am surprised that the drafting of these Bills took so long. The proposed arrangement of the Conference could have been tarried out by one measure. The Government have decided to deal with it by two measures, which puts the position more clearly, but makes possible the defeat of the object which all well-wishers of the Commonwealth have in view. Ministers are to have with them, so far as the proposal for the distribution of the revenue is concerned, the whole of the State Governments, and, therefore, that proposal may be carried, but they have not the support of any of the State Governments for the proposal regarding the transfer of the &#39;debts. </para>

                            <para>- The Premier of Western Australia is the only one who has said that it would be an advantage to the Commonwealth to take control of the State debts. With that qualification, my statement holds good. It is certainly a mistake to think that the Queensland Government wishes to transfer its debts to the Commonwealth, while the Government of New South Wales has not agreed to the transfer. Of course, all the Premiers are in favour of the investigation of the subject. I do not propose to discuss now the advisability of transferring the State debts to the Commonwealth. The advantages of that course are admitted by all authorities. In my opinion, each year&#39;s delay means loss to the country. The framers of the Constitution thought that the Commonwealth Parliament would at once proceed to deal with the debts question ; but they were mistaken. We have not discussed the matter ap fully as we should have done. As the  Braddon  section is terminable in 1910, the States are now more apprehensive regarding their financial relations with the Commonwealth than they need be, and we are compelled to deal with the question in some way. I supported the Braddon section when the draft Bill was before the country, thinking it unwise to make any final arrangement until the Parliament of the Commonwealth had had some years&#39; experience. We know more now than we did then, but it still behoves us to be very cautious. We shall proceed on wrong lines if we make a permanent arrangement. If, in the  early  years of Federation, a measure providing for the amendment of the Constitution in the manner now proposed had been passed by this Parliament, the subject could have been put before the people at every election, and. in mv opinion, it should be repeatedly brought under their notice  until they become sufficiently appreciative of the -advantages which will flow from the transfer of the debts to the Commonwealth to agree to it. This Bill has been delayed too long. Its introduction should have preceded the twin proposal of the Government which we have Recently been discussing. </para>

But, by subclause  2,  a time policy foi any period exceeding twelve months is invalid. I desire to insert a new sub-clause to enable <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> time policy in some cases to be available for a period exceeding twelve months.

                    <para>. - There is a wide distinction between the provision under discussion and clause  90.  Under the latter clause, the ground for the return of the premium is that there has been a failure of the consideration which is not due to the fault  of one of the parties. The money is returned as paid under circumstances that have proved futile. In clause 48, however, there is something not done by the person that is insured; and it would be contrary to all the principles of commercial morality if a man guilty of default were to have his premium returned. Besides, it might go against his interests in many cases, because the question whether the policy should be voided might be one of evidence. This is a very technical Bill, and one cannot see at once the bearing of the words. For instance, this clause speaks of a voyage policy &#34;at and from&#34; a particular place, and that means that the risk has been incurred before the voyage started, and that, as the risk has been running for some time, the party would be returning the consideration for which the risk was taken. This Bill was carefully drafted by English experts, notably <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chalmers,</inline> who is celebrated in this connexion ; and I hope the amendment will not be pressed. </para>

A delay of fourteen, or of even seven, days makes a great difference to the shipper. This Bill is being rushed through at a great rate, and no. one seems to be giving much attention to it. The Attorney-General ought to provide as far as possible for the assured.

                    <para>. - This Bill will not do away with the stamp duty collected by a State. There is a section in the Act which protects the States. The actual contract is what is known as the slip-note. An underwriter prepares a memorandum, which is sent to the insurers, and is regarded as a binding contract, although it is not the real policy ; but there is a declaration in the Act that that memorandum cannot be produced in Court. The policy itself must be produced, the object of this declaration being to prevent the evasion of the stamp laws. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to draw the attention of the Attorney-General to a difficulty which has been experienced in at least one case to our knowledge, and possibly in more, in securing payment of insurance in respect of a policy issued by a company having an office but no assets within the Commonwealth. In one instance, after a claim had been sustained by an action in a State Court, the amount of the policy was not paid, and the office of the company was removed from Australia. I allude to the case of a Japanese company having an office in Australia which refused, on some technical grounds, to acknowledge a liability, and had no assets in the Commonwealth that could be attached. After a judgment had been given against it, it removed any sign of its presence in Australia by shutting up its office- It is important that companies having business in Australia, wherever their head office may be, should have some attachable assets within the Commonwealth, This Bill may not, perhaps, be the one in which to introduce such a provision ; it may be better, perhaps, to provide for it in a Companies Bill, as the Commonwealth Parliament is going to deal with that subject. </para>

                        <para>- The question relates to other than marine insurance cases. We should not encourage a repetition within our borders of a. happening such as that I have mentioned ; but it may be repeated unless we make provision against it in our laws. Some of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> State laws have made  provision in connexion with some insurance companies, and other countries have enacted that where a company is seeking business, such as insurance, under which there are  large liabilities, there shall be&#39; some security for the payment of those liabilities in the event of a loss. I think that is a reasonable provision to make ; and I should like to ask the Attorney-General if the Government are aware of the facts, and intend to meet the situation by a remedy, and, if so, in what way ? </para>

                    <para>. - I have looked very carefully into the matter referred to by the honorable member for North Sydney ; and yesterday morning I considered whether something could not be done to protect the Australian public against such happenings. &#34; I believe the company referred to has already withdrawn, its office from Australia. I do not think there are many other companies of that class trading here. A great number are well-established British companies, and in these matters the word &#34;British&#34; is almost synonymous with. &#34; security.&#34; However, to prevent the possibility of a recurrence of anything: of that sort, the matter will be considered in connexion with the Companies Bill. I could not meet it in this Bill ; an.d, in any case, it would be inadvisable to deal with the question of companies piecemeal. I Jo not think the provisions in the State Acts are sufficient, because the amount of security stipulated for by them would not meet such large losses as were sustained by those victimized in this particular case. I assure the honorable member that the matter has received attention, and will not be allowed to rest at the stage which it has reached. </para>

                <para class="block">The practice in regard to the matter seems to have been very varied. Sometimes the slip itself was regarded as the policy, sometimes the Judges held that they could look at it, and sometimes that they could not. As the aim in this Bill appears to have been to secure uniformity with the English legislation, this seems an unnecessary departure, although not a large one. </para>

The section in the English Marine Insurance Act starts off with a reference to &#34;a duly stamped policy,&#34; showing that what is wanted is to get the stamp. It is provided, in an earlier portion of the English Act, that the evidence is not to be admitted in Court, unless the policy is produced. Clause  28  of this Bill provides that - </para>

                <para>But the phraseology has been altered, in my opinion, needlessly, and the words &#34;or other customary memorandum of a contract of marine insurance&#34; added. It is most undesirable, unless for exceptionally good cause, to depart from the wording of the English Act, and, when we were dealing with a previous clause, which I thought somewhat ambiguous and unfair in its incidence, I allowed it to pass on the assurance of the Minister that it adopted the English phraseology. I assume that the English Act of  1906,  in codifying the existing law, reduced the common law on this subject to statutory form, and that the words &#34; slip or covering note &#34; were taken to include, or expressly to exclude, &#34; other customary memorandum of a contract of marine insurance.&#34; In an early case, reference is made to the legal status of the &#34;slip.&#34; In  1803,  the Court declined to look at an unstamped &#34;slip.&#34; I feel sure that here it will not be held that a policy which has complied with the law of the country in which it was issued is void. In the case to which I refer, there had not been such compliance, because a Stamp Act was then in force in England. </para>

                        <para>- No; it is merely a memorandum, but is obligatory on the brokers. If a man goes into Court, he must produce the contract, which is the policy itself. It is the policy which, under the laws of the States, must be stamped, but we do not refer to the stamping, because there is no Commonwealth Stamp Act. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree that there should be no unnecessary departure from the wording of the English Act. There is reason, however, for making no reference to stamping, because, while some of the States may require the stamping of policies, others may not. But clauses  27, 28,  and  95  seem to involve a contradiction. Clause  27  says that- </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that they apply to the measure under consideration. A contract is completed by the issue of a covering note. Goods so insured might be put on board a vessel which might sink while at the wharf, and when the insurer claimed damages, he might be met by the objection that no policy had been issued, and that, therefore, the contract of insurance was inadmissible.  His  remedy would be to sue for specific performance, but that might involve him in great expense. If the covering note is to create a contract, why should, it not be sued upon? The reason for clause 28 seems to be to protect the stamp duties of the States; but that should be done in another way. I think that there is need for some amendment, to prevent insurers having to take action, not merely for loss, but to obtain specific performance of the contract. </para>

                    <para>.- Clause 27 is exactly the same as section 21 of the English Act except for the words in the latter &#34; although it be unstamped,&#34; and our clause 95 goes beyond section 89 of the English Act inasmuch as it contains the words &#34; or other customary memorandum of a contract of marine insurance.&#34; I take it that in 1906, in the greatest country in the world, so far as marine insurance is concerned there must have been literally thousands of cases, many of which came before the Courts, and in which .it was necessary to show a slip or covering note or other memorandum of a contract. The words &#34; slip or covering note &#34; were evidently considered sufficient. I conclude, therefore, that the words are quite sufficient for the purposes of this Bill ; and if we add anything it will only confuse the law and lead to the belief that there is some departure from the English Act, thus placing on the. Courts here the onus of determining what is a customary memorandum of a contract of marine insurance. The status of the slip note has been established after literally scores of cases ; and I venture to say we shall gain nothing by any departure from the English statute, while it is highly desirable in commercial circles that there should be one law throughout the British Dominions. </para>

                    <para>- I have not the slightest objection to adopt the suggestion made, because the words are only used for greater caution. &#34; Slip or covering note,&#34; in clause 27, are synonymous with &#34;memorandum,&#34; and according to the English Act they are the memorandum of the contract. If anything the words are tautology ; but we thought it more correct to make the two sections refer to the memorandum ; and my opinion is our drafting is the better. There is the right in England to sue for specific performance of the contract, and the memorandum or slip would be regarded as the basis; and if a person cannot sue without the policy, he is entitled to sue the company for a policy. Under the circumstances we, in effect, say that nothing in the Bill shall be deemed tq take away the right to do that. The English Act is more limited than ours, because, in England, they always think of the stamp and the revenue; a litigant may have a perfect right here against an agent or insurer on the slip. But he is barred in England in an action to recover for loss because the condition there is that there must be a stamped policy. That is, J think, a limitation of rights, because, as I say, in England what they first look to is the revenue from the stamp, while here we have no Commonwealth Stamp Act. </para>

                        <para>- I know that certain words in insurance circles have a meaning of which laymen have no knowledge; and when men enter into contracts upon the basis of the technical meaning, one ought to be very loath to interfere in any way, because it opens the door to undesirable vagueness. I have not the slightest doubt that the covering note is the customary memorandum, though it may be that a customary memorandum is not a covering note. I can see no reference in the cases to anything except the slip; and, therefore, we must assume that it is the slip that is looked to, and that recourse to the covering note is very rare. For my part,  1  prefer to follow the English Act. </para>

                        <para>. - After a considerable interval we again approach the consideration of this measure, and I think that we should first of all ask ourselves whether we are in earnest in this proposal, and, secondly, whether we ought not, in connexion . with it, to seriously consider the financial question. At the last general election many of us. dwelt upon the importance of the proposed transfer, because we recognised that under existing conditions the Federal Government had no opportunity to encourage immigration. The States reserve to themselves the right to look after their own lands, and any attempt on the part of the Commonwealth to encourage immigration would be thwarted by the action of the States Parliaments. We told the electors that the Commonwealth should take over the Northern Territory, and offer not only our own citizens, but white people from other parts of the world, an opportunity to settle upon and improve it. We had in mind, not only the natural resources of the Territory, but the necessity of having it adequately occupied, in order that we might be able to resist an attack on that part of Australia by any Asiatic race. It seems to be. assumed that an attack upon Australia would be made at that point, although, to my mind, an invader who sought to permanently occupy the country would come further south than Port Darwin. I believe that the Prime Minister and the late Premier of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Price, had the interests of Australia at heart when they entered into this agreement. No doubt the Premier of South Australia endeavoured to make the best possible bargain for his State, and the Prime Minister sought to do the best possible for the Commonwealth. As to whether the Government of South Australia were really in earnest in their professed desire that the Territory should be settled, or merely wished to make the best possible bargain for themselves from a financial stand-point, I am unable to say. I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lindsay</inline> make the assertion, which has been borne out by several honorable members, that South Australia was not very keen as to the proposed transfer, and that if the Federation would not take over and develop the Territory, she would proceed to improve it. South Australia is in a much better position to do that than she was a few years ago. Fortunately for the Commonwealth, South Australia has experienced some successful years.  Her  finances are now in good order, and she may be able to do more in the direction of! developing the Territory than she has hitherto found possible. Let us hope that if this Bill be rejected, the State will take action, and that her efforts; to improve the Territory will be more successful than they have hitherto been. I am not quite certain that the people of the Commonwealth are willing that we should take over the Territory and expend upon it a lot of money. In respect of all these great questions the electors trust their representatives. They are also largely guided by the views expressed by newspaper writers, and the instructions they give through the ballot-box to their representatives, as to what course should be pursued, are not always complete. I am not quite satisfied that those who have already spoken to this motion are earnest in the desire that we should come to a decision at the present time. If they are not, it would be better to allow the Bill to stand over, and not to waste further time in its consideration. The end of the session is rapidly approaching, and unless we intend to come to a decision now, it is useless for us to go further. There are a number of Bills on the notice-paper, and honorable members cheered loudly when we passed one this evening, which, since it did not raise party considerations, was expeditiously dealt with. We have recently been considering a measure which, dealing as it does with the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, is of great importance to Australia. During the discussion of that Bill it has been made clear that the Commonwealth, although it has not exhausted all its means of raising revenue, has no money to cast to the winds. </para>

                    <para class="block">It will take us all our time to finance other undertakings&#39;, apart altogether from the transfer of the Northern Territory. The State Governments feel that they are in the same position, and, having regard to the enormous expenditure which the development of the Territory must involve, we must seriously consider whether it would be possible for us to finance. this project. We talk lightly of millions, although we find it very difficult to finance many necessary undertakings. </para>

                            <para>- That has caused me to ask whether we are in earnest with regard to it. Under the agreement we shall take over from the States a liability amounting to about &#163;4,000,000. I shall not say that the Northern Territory is not worth that amount, but there is not &#163;4,000,000 worth of improvements in sight there. South Australia has certainly held up her end of the stick very well ; she has done good service to the Commonwealth in keeping the Territory white, and in preserving it from the &#34; land sharks.&#34; It may be said that the fact that the &#34;land sharks&#34; have not monopolized the Territory is not a good advertisement for it, since, if the land were of first-class- quality, they would have devised some means of monopolizing- it. </para>

In order that it may be opened up, it will be necessary to construct a railway line through it. It would be useless to take it over unless we determined to construct such a railway within a reasonable time. </para>

                            <para>- Within the next ten years tangible action will have to be taken in that direction. Several routes have been proposed, South Australia claiming that a railway should be constructed from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. Queensland, New South Wales, and, to some extent, Victoria are also interested in this phase of the question, and I am convinced that before it is settled we shall have some fighting from the stand-point of State interests. The desire of South Australia as to the route to be followed will, doubtless, be strongly contested. I rather question the action of that State in endeavouring to dictate to the Commonwealth the route to be followed, although it might reasonably have declared that such a route should be selected as would open up the Territory. I admit that the route suggested by South Australia is really a central one, and also that there is some force in the contention of that State that no railway can- open up the Territory properly unless it passes through, or close to, the MacDonnell Ranges. It is evident that, if there is any portion of Central Australia which is of any use for agricultural or pastoral purposes, it is the MacDonnell Range country ; but, at the same time, the route suggested by South Australia is rather isolated. I do not know whether there are any very great engineering difficulties to be overcome to the north of Hergott Springs. I know it is a great lake district, and I am told that much of it is below the level of the sea, so that it may be difficult to take the railway to the north from Hergott Springs. </para>

                            <para>- That is the great trouble. But for that, I think we could have arranged a reasonable compromise by continuing the line in an almost northerly direction from Hergott Springs to touch the western portion of Queensland, and then going across through the MacDonnell Range country. To a certain extent, that would have satisfied the eastern States by providing for the possibility of the railway opening up their territory as well as that of South Australia. </para>

My answer is that the railway is intended to open up the Northern Territory, but if the route can possibly be made to give access to the outlying districts of other States without interfering with the original idea of the Commonwealth taking over the Territory, a great advantage will be conferred. </para>

                            <para>- I quite recognise that difficulty. Some honorable members  who  are agitating for other routes seem to want to take the line right on to the eastern coast of Australia, which would in no sense be opening up the Territory. I have great respect for the opinion of the honorable member for Kennedy, but his speech on this measure &#39;was certainly coloured by the interests of the district that he represents, although there was something in his contention that the most fertile portion of the Territory was that stretching from Port Darwin in a south-easterly direction, into Queensland. Still, my idea of opening up the Northern Territory is not to tap that portion only, and, therefore, I could not vote for an alteration of route in that direction. South Australia might overcome a good deal of the opposition to -the agreement by not insisting on the railway going direct from Oodnadatta north to Pine Creek*. If Australia is willing to spend money in opening up the Territory, the line ought, &#171;if possible, to be so constructed as to be of some utility to the other States, at the same time carrying out the original intention of opening up the Northern Territory itself. The line, however, must certainly tap the MacDonnell Range country, or it will not be a Northern Territory railway in any sense of the word. Some of the alternative routes suggested are rather peculiar. I can hardly think, for instance, that the individual who suggested  a line from Bourke north to Cloncurry, and thence across to Port Darwin, through the country which the honorable member for Kennedy mentioned, was in earnest about opening up the Northern Territory. Another route which is of no use is that almost north from Hergott Springs, touching the south-western portion of Queensland, and following the meridian almost straight up ; but if the railway, could be taken to the point where South Australia, the Northern Territory, arid Queensland meet, and thence across the MacDonnell Ranges, and on to Pine Creek, it ought to satisfy the eastern States, and certainly ought to satisfy South Australia. If we were all explorers, like the right honorable member for Swan, we might be able to form -a better judgment on these matters ; but, as it is, we can only be guided by the information put before us by the experts, and they, like doctors, differ so much that unfortunate beings like myself find  it hard to determine what would really be the best route. I do not want to be too hard upon South Australia, but I believe the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta is very light, and not now worth anything like the money expended upon it. </para>

                            <para>- Even if it does not pay for axle grease now, I am willing to believe that it can be made payable in the course of time by continuing it to the north. It would be better if South Australia agreed to keep that portion of the railway and open up the district with it, while allowing the Federal Government to make it sufficiently strong, and so continue it as to enable it to carry fast trains across the continent. If the line is to be used for carrying mails, a fast service will be necessary ; but, from .all I have heard, the existing line would not stand trains- travelling over it at more than 25 miles an hour. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard statements to the contrary, but I accept the honorable member&#39;s assurance. The service on the existing line is very infrequent&#39; at present, and necessarily a &#39;line which is seldom used is not kept in the best state of repair. I admit that South Australia intended it to open up the country, and did not expect it to be immediately payable. It is evident that, whatever agreement is come to, South Australia will have to keep, at any rate, that portion of the railway .between &#39; Hergott Springs and Oodnadatta. </para>

                            <para>- I know that South Australia takes up that attitude, but, with all the advances that she has made in the last few years, I doubt if she can open up that country, and make the line payable; within the next thirty years. I quite expect that, if it is taken over by the Commonwealth, it will be a non-paying line for many years to come. Railways will not pay unless people are settled upon the land, and it will be a long time before there is any great settlement in that district, because it must be admitted that it contains a large amount of desert. Possibly Central Australia may be made a paradise in time to come, just as the Salt Lake district in America has been made to blossom like the rose by half a century of untiring effort on the part of the Mormons. If South Australia insists on the agreement and nothing but the agreement, this debate might just as well be abandoned at once, because I am sure that the representatives of that State recognise that, in the present temper of the House, some other arrangement will have to be made. </para>

                            <para>- I have spoken more favorably regarding this project than any other honorable member, excluding the representatives of South Australia, and, I think, am the only one to contend that the line should go through the MacDonnell Ranges. But if South Australia means business she will not stick to the hard and fast terms of the agreement. The Prime Minister has not addressed the House on this question, although he made the agreement with the late Honorable Thomas Price.  No doubt, in its discussion, there must be a good deal of giving and taking. South Australia really wishes to take more than she offers to give. But while her representatives declare that the railway must follow a certain route, others favour other routes, and until some agreement is come to it will be impossible&#39; for the proposed transfer to be effected. I regret this, because the possibilities of the Territory are very great, though a large expenditure will be necessary to develop its resources. </para>

                            <para>- The line should keep more to the east than is proposed, though it should go through the MacDonnell Range country. Unless it taps that country it will be useless. In my opinion, the transfer, together with the construction of the railway, will involve the Commonwealth in an expenditure of  ^10,000,000.  or an annual charge of  &#163;400,000,  while there must be a further large expenditure on development. It may be ten years before the whole burden falls upon the Commonwealth, but it must be remembered that, up to the present time, our great financial experts have been unable to formulate a scheme foi the raising of sufficient revenue to pay for this and other big projects. I am opposed to public borrowing, except for reproductive works ; but it would be impossible to build the proposed railway out of revenue, and for thirty years to come there would be a loss on its working. I do not think that South Australia can develop the Territory unaided No doubt it has done its best in the past, and while I should probably differ from the politicians who framed the laws which now govern the Territory, I am willing to believe that they did what they thought best. 1 have read thirteen pamphlets and books relating to the Territory, but the views they express are so conflicting that I find it difficult to form a clear&#34; opinion regarding its possibilities. My reason for desiring its transfer to the Commonwealth is that we may be able to offer proper inducements to immigrants, instead of being content with the ineffectiveness -of the State arrangements. </para>

                        <para>.- It is very gratifying to South Australians to hear honorable members commend the State for having kept the Territory white. Her pioneer politicians were far-seeing men, and did what they could for the proper government of the Territory, though at a loss to the State. Honorable members ask why it is not developed. No part of Australia is yet properly developed, not even Victoria. South Australia, however, has kept the Territory free from an objectionable population, and if the Commonwealth takes it over, it will have nothing to do but develop it. A railway from Oodnadatta direct to the Territory would do more to develop the continent than any other line that could be made. Port Darwin! would be nearer to Melbourne by that route than by any other, and the railway would pass through friendly country the whole way. </para>

Unfortunately no definite route was included in the agreement to transfer as drawn up by the late Premier and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> It was, therefore, quite possible that provincialism would assert itself and that each State would make an effort to have the line diverge into its own territory. By deviating towards the Queensland border the railway would simply get out of the Territory as quickly as possible, and would not be of much assistance in its development. That was not what was intended by the agreement. </para>

Besides that, the railway would, in such a case, have to cross plains which are flooded in the wet season by the overflow of the Cooper, Diamantina, and other rivers, and would have to be supported on trestle-bridges constructed at enormous expense. The line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta was the shortest and cheapest route to the southern States, and would open up a vast amount of country, rich in mineral, agricultural, and pastoral wealth. All the country from the MacDonnell Ranges to Pine Creek was equal to any country in Australia for cattle and horse-breeding. At present it was lying idle, because there was no provision for water supply, although it had been proved that water exists at very shallow depths, and only requires artesian boring to find a vent. Whichever direction the line ultimately took, it must be continued beyond Pine Creek to the Katherine, a distance of 60 miles, traversing as rich a belt of country as any in Australia. Minerals had been found in the whole length of it - gold, silver, copper, tin, wolfram, thorium, and other metals - and the land lay idle for want of a railway. The line would pass through the Cullen district, which had produced gold for several years. </para>

And&#39; I should like to point out that this great unoccupied country presents an eminently suitable field for the establishment of a military station in a healthy, productive climate, where the youth of Australia could be adequately trained for defence purposes. So valuable are the areas that, if either South Australia or the Commonwealth desired to sell them at any time, they could at once reimburse their expenditure ; but I hope that the Commonwealth will take over the Territory and develop it on proper lines. I have no doubt that, if the measure be passed, we shall have honorable members advocating the establishment of a temporary Seat of Government in the Territory. </para>

It is the railways that made possible the utilization of the great wheat lands of Canada, and enabled the wastelands of that great country to become quickly settled.

An examination of the Roper River may show that water carriage to the shipping point can be made available, doing away with the necessity of -a railway line. But if it is found necessary to build the railway we find a distance of 130- miles will connect the trunk line with the head of navigation, through easy country, with no engineering difficulties, and abundance of timber for sleepers.

As to the rivers, we are told that the Victoria is, perhaps, the most important, and that, 26 miles wide at the mouth, it empties into the Indian Ocean, near the Western Australian border. The proposed railway will benefit Western Australia as much as, if not more, than it will South Australia. It seems strange that the Western Australian gold-fields should be only just across the border, and we. hope that when some of the smart men from the West go into the Territory we may have some great mining developments.. We are also told that the Victoria River is an outlet for an immense tract of splendid pastoral and agricultural country, approximating 100,000 square miles, at a very modest estimate. </para>

                            <para>- There is in Victoria a large tract of country, north of the town in which the honorable member resides, which is only now being developed, so that the honorable member cannot well complain of the lack of development in the Northern Territory. I hope to have the pleasure of seeing a railway line constructed between Oodnadatta and Pine Creek within a very short time. Such a line would be in the interests of Australia. We should then have a railway extending from the north to the south of Australia - from the Great Australian Bight right across to the Northern Territory. I am sure that the Commonwealth would not object to Queensland tapping the trunk line with feeders, nor to the construction of similar lines by Western Australia. This is the mother Parliament -of Australia, and I am confident that it will be kind&#39; to the whole of its children. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened with the utmost pleasure to the speech of the honorable member who has just resumed his seat. He approached the question with a breezy optimism, which shows that the new recruits of our Chamber are going to revivify our national sentiment, and help us in our national aspirations in a way that some of our older members are, I am afraid, almost now forgetting to do. The fact that this agreement is before us is a curious tribute to our Federal spirit. It is really instructive to see the honorable member for Fremantle, and the right honorable and gallant member for&#39; Swan loyally standing by while a proposal for a transcontinental railway from Port Augusta northwards is allowed to take precedence over that from Port Augusta to the West. I do not wish at present to trench upon that subject; but I can realize the great sacrifices my . honorable friends have made in withholding their claim for the time being. I wish simply to address myself to the agreement as it stands - to the points which make it unacceptable, and to the direction in which, with the concurrence of South Australia, it might be amended. Our difficulty is that, since it is an agreement, we cannot amend it with the hope of doing any good thereby, unless we have the approval of the other party to it, South Australia. </para>

                            <para>-  I venture to think that we have a hope of making another agreement with South Australia. All the time that he has been in this House, realizing, the utter futility of endeavouring to pass this agreement in its present form, the honorable member for Hindmarsh has not been able to think out alternatives. We have, again, to thank another new member for a most valuable suggestion in this regard. I refer to the honorable member for Wakefield, who, in his recent campaign, drew attention to the possibility, if this agreement is not ratified, of South Australia retaining all that rich country, including the MacDonnell Ranges, up to about the 22nd parallel, and then transferring the rest of the Territory to the Commonwealth on mutually satisfactory terms, while giving the Commonwealth the right to make what railway it chooses over the route that seems best to it. That &#39;is the most statesmanlike and sensible solution of the difficulty that we have yet heard. The weaknesses of the present agreement lie in the following facts : In the first place we have to accept a long, non-paying railway in a territory which is not our own - the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. I think honorable members generally will realize that it is not desirable for the Commonwealth to own railways &#39;in State territories. In the second place, we are a business House, and yet this agreement ties us down as to the choice of the route of the overland line. I shall not canvass any particular route. I hope that if the Government eventually make an arrangement with South Australia which will give us the right to construct the overland line through whatever country we please, the House will address itself to the question in a business-like spirit, obtaining the opinions of experts as to the most&#39; hopeful country, and then acting with all the evidence before it. So far we have had nothing but a few pamphlets, written in such perfervid language that even the most friendly critic is apt to become suspicious. </para>

If expert advice shows that the most fruitful territory through which to build the line lies in western Queensland, we ought, as sensible men, to build the line through that part, unless we are so blinded by provincialism as to be dead to nationalism. If, on the other hand, it is found that the country between the MacDonnell Ranges and Adelaide is richer, we ought to build the line south of the MacDonnell Ranges. If honorable members representing South Australia really believed the extraordinary literature that we have been reading on the subject, they would be the first to submit their case to expert advice. </para>

It is so flattering that it produces that effect upon even the most unsuspicious and perhaps the youngest member of the House. I hope the Government will not persist in the agreement, because it is obvious that the great majority of the House are not prepared to accept the transfer on those terms. I think that certain good was to be derived from submitting the agreement to the House and allowing the House to discuss it, as it will enable the Government to find out on what terms . the House is prepared to do business. </para>

                            <para>- If it can be done in this Parliament, I shall be prepared to help. I can assure the honorable member that nobody recognises more than I do the needs of South Australia, and the obligation resting upon the Commonwealth in this regard ; but this argument is not business-like or fair. Moreover, the vast majority of the House is of the same opinion as myself;,, and it has no chance of passing in its present form. Therefore the sooner matters are brought to a head, by the agreement being withdrawn and a new agreement being sought to be instituted, the better it will be for South  Australia and for the Commonwealth.&#34; The figures show that the total liability upon the Commonwealth under the agreement would be about &#163;10,000,000, with future profits of a very doubtful character. </para>

                            <para>- One might almost be led to believe that the honorable member was a company promoter from Adelaide. I am beginning to understand why there are so many rich people in Adelaide, and why South Australia is so prosperous, and has managed to get money from all over Australia. It must be the result of the laudable enterprise and company promoting skill of its citizens. I hope that when a new arrangement is sought to be entered into, the suggestions put forward by the honorable member for Wakefield will receive the earnest consideration of both Governments. If they are adopted, South Australia will not lose any possible future benefit from the line already built from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, and the Commonwealth will be able to reap the benefit of constructing a transcontinental line through the country best suited to Australian interests. I am sure that if such a course is pursued, it will meet with the hearty approbation of the people. </para>

                        <para>.- As I understand that the Government desire to complete the debate on the second! reading to-night, I shall condense my remarks as much as possible; but, having visited the Northern Territory and taken a great interest in the proposal that the Commonwealth should take it over, I am anxious to offer some observations upon the question. The Minister of External Affairs is to be congratulated upon the way in which he introduced the measure, and upon the general tone of the debate which has followed. We all admit that South Australia is entitled to great credit for the way in which she has grappled with the problem of settling the Territory ; but any one who reads the lamentable -history of the attempts made by her in that direction must come; to the conclusion that she is not financially strong enough for the task. It is necessary that the Territory should be developed for the purpose of peopling the continent and for defence purposes. The management of the Territory by South Australia has continued since 1863, and after nearly fifty years of attempts made by that State to grapple with the problem, the country is really in a worse condition than it was when the South Australian Parliament assumed the responsibility. According to the memorandum of agreement placed before honorable members by the Government, the annual loss upon the Territory will amount to about &#163;235,000, without any further expenditure; while the total annual loss if the agreement is carried out to the full will be about &#163;435,000. To take over the debt, develop the Territory, and construct railways as proposed, will cost over &#163;10,000,000. The total gold production of the Territory since South Australia took charge of it has been about &#163;2,500,000. There are at present only 1,176 wage-earners there, whose average wages amount to only &#163;76 6s. per annum. There has been a gradual decline in population and production, and a continual accumulation of debt. That is the position we have to face. There has been a good deal of discussion of the proposition that the Commonwealth should not only take over the existing debt, but also build a railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. My view is that in the development of this country, up to a certain point, the consideration of a through railway should be deferred. All the States have been developed by running railways from the seaboard into the interior, and I can see no reason why, if we take over the Territory, it should not be developed in the same way. Western&#39; Australia, for instance, has so far developed very rapidly. It has spent a considerable amount in developmental works. It had a population in 1889 of 167,000, which increased to 263,000 in 1-907. Its lines of railway total 2,000 miles, running from the sea as far inland as, respectively, 353 miles, 379 miles, 604. miles, 186 miles, and 240 miles. The public railways have cost &#163;&#34;11,000,000; &#163;&#34;300,000 has been spent in postal conveniences, &#163;3,000,000 in harbor works, and &#163;3,000,000 in water supply, &#163;1,000,600 on the development of goldfields, &#163;150,000 in constructing roads and bridges, &#163;755.000 in the development of agriculture, arid &#163;&#34;30,000 upon immigration, or &#163;&#34;18,000,000 in all, the whole of which was borrowed. That State is not yet connected by railway with the eastern States, so that in that respect the Northern Territory is no worse off. Neither is it worse off in respect to development than the northern part of Queensland. If the Territory be transferred to the Commonwealth, many millions will have to be expended in developing it. Instead of making a railway across the continent, we should run a number of railways inland from the coast. The Territory contains 531,600 square miles, and lies wholly within the tropics. It is about one-third the size of India, which contains 1,766,000 square miles, and can produce many of the products with which India supports a population of 300,000,000, some of the Indian States having as many as 436 persons to the square mile. India produces chiefly rice, wheat, sugar, tea, cotton, oil seeds, tobacco, and jute goods. The area irrigated there with river water is 23,000,000 acres, 7 per cent, being returned on the money invested in the irrigation works. Very large areas are also watered from wells. As the water supply of the Northern Territory is less than that of India, it could not be expected to carry so large a population, but it could supply Australia with most of the productions which are now grown in India. We import over &#163;&#34;6,000,000 worth of goods, the raw material for which could be grown in the Northern Territory. These imports include &#163;64,000 worth of cotton ; cordage and twine, &#163;&#34;522,000; &#163;&#34;248,000 worth of rice; &#163;344,000 worth of indiarubber goods; &#163;&#34;67,000 worth of wicker goods; &#163;199,000 worth of cotton goods, such as socks and stockings, towels and handkerchiefs, and .&#163;3)309,000 worth of cotton piece goods and linen. Among jute goods we import bran, chaff, and fodder bags, valued at &#163;188,198 ; corn and flour sacks valued at &#163;&#34;617,866; onion and coal bags valued at &#163;12,038; ore bags valued at &#163;17,154; second-hand bags and sacks valued at &#163;2,487 ; and other bags valued at &#163;28,983. The tropical plants which grow in India could be successfully cultivated in the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- Experiments were made in the Ipswich district, under the stimulus of a bonus, but not on a sufficiently extensive scale to justify the use of labour-saving machinery which would allow the employment of white labour for cultivation and harvesting. In the United States the growing and picking of cotton by white labour has been a success, and it would be a success in Australia if the area cultivated were large enough to justify the use of machinery. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bottomley,</inline> an expert who has visited the Northern Territory, and knows every district in the world where cotton is grown, says that it is&#39; the home of the cotton plant, and that nowhere can cotton be grown more cheaply than there. </para>

                            <para>- They were not on a commercial scale, and subject to disabilities which will be removed by the proper development of the Territory. Not only is the Territory capable of producing such goods as I have referred to, but it could be used largely for dairying and stock-raising. I travelled through the Territory, and saw the natural herbage, which is too rank for the fattening of stock. To make dairying and stock-raising a success, irrigation is needed, and artificial fodder must be grown,&#34; and to bring that about a large expenditure will be required. We know that a market is awaiting us in the Old Country, which will permit of an unlimited expansion of stock raising and dairying in the Northern Territory. The value of the imports of grain into Great Britain is &#163;72,000,000 per annum, of which only .&#163;6,250,000 is grown in Australia. The imports of milk products are valued at .&#163;32,315,949, and of this amount, Australia, contributes only &#163;&#34;3,000,000. The imports of pig products are valued at &#163;24,000,000, of which Australia contributes only &#163;54,539- The imports of poultry are valued at &#163;8,236,411, of which Australia supplies &#163;11,977. The imports of meat, rabbits, fruit, and wine, into Great Britain are valued at &#163;50,000,000 annually, and of this amount Australia contributes &#163;2,827,817. Under this heading of importations into Great Britain, the total value per annum represents &#163;187,000,000, of which amount Australia contributes only &#163;10,319,000, or only 6 per cent, of the total importations referred to. These figures show that we have an unlimited market in the Old Country for our products. They should encourage us to devote our best energies to the settlement of our southern districts by means of irrigation, and the development of agriculture generally; and they show that there will be an outlet for our best energies in the development of our northern districts in the production of tropical products, which we require for ourselves, and for which we might find an export market ; and also in the development there of the dairying, poultry, and meat industries. It is scarcely the time now to discuss how far it is possible to open up the Northern Territory by means of irrigation, and large storages of water ; but I am satisfied, from my perhaps limited opportunity of viewing the country, that it will not be possible to bring about anything like an extensive settlement of the Northern Territory unless a .very large amount of money is expended in the first instance on the construction of railways from the seaboard into the interior, and, simultaneously, in the construction of very large irrigation works and water storage works on the rivers. This heavy expenditure must be considered apart &#39; altogether from the financial obligations involved in the proposed agreement. We should be making a huge mistake if we took over the Northern Territory saddled with such impossible railway conditions as are included in the agreement, requiring the expenditure of &#163;7,000,000 or &#163;8,000,000 on the construction of a trans-Australian railway in a Territory which is so far practically undeveloped- I hope that the provisions of the agreement with respect to railway construction will not be varied in any way, but that they will be struck out altogether, and that when the proper time comes, this Parliament will itself decide the proper routes for the construction of railways necessary for the development of the Territory. When I consider the history of Australian development, and observe that Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia, have been independently  developed by running railways from the seaboard into the interior, I see no reason why the Northern Territory should not be developed in a similar manner, up to the point at which we should be warranted in connecting populous settlements in the Territory with the large centres of population on the eastern and western coasts. The northern portion of the Territory, from the coast to about ibo miles south, is the part which has the heaviest rainfall. It is mineral country with flats on which rice and cotton could be grown successfully. The Northern Territory differs from our southern districts, inasmuch as tropical plants can be grown on what in this part of the Commonwealth would be regarded as very inferior soil. Owing to the fertilizing effects of the sun on what we should consider poor country, tropical plants can be grown in abundance. There are flats in the district to which I refer along the Adelaide and Roper Rivers, where rice, cotton, and jute, could be successfully grown. The belt of country extending from 100 miles south of the sea-board for another 200 miles may be considered the middle of the Territory, and i.t is in this district that the rivers have their source. I consider that this is the part of the Northern Territory which will in future carry the densest population, because it is there that dairying could be most successfully carried on. Further south for 100 or 150 miles, we have country with a limited rainfall ; and it is in this part of the Territory that the successful graziers are established. Here the natural grasses are more nutritious and fattening, and the bulk of the cattle are produced. It is in this country that the cattle-owners hold land on very long leases. It is the most productive part of the Northern Territory at the present time, but, in my opinion, must always be held in fairly large areas.  1  refer to the country about the source of the Victoria River, and extending in the direction of Cammoweal, in Queensland, the Barclay tableland. The rainfall is limited, and the district is subject to occasional droughts. Water1 has to be obtained from wells; but the natural grasses are sweet and abundant; and, as I have said, the bulk of the cattle raised in the </para>

                    <para class="block">Northern Territory are raised in this part of the country ; though it will probably be found,- in the&#34; future, to be the least valuable from an agricultural point of view. I hope that some agreement may be found possible, under which the Commonwealth will take over the Northern Territory, and that South Australia will prove amenable to reason in a matter fraught with such vital interest to the future of Australia. It is impossible that one State can deal with a Territory situated at such a distance from its centre of government, especially when the attendant expenditure is so great as to more than try the limited resources at her command. South Australia should be prepared, at the proper time, to amend the agreement and hand over to the Commonwealth the administration of the Territory, not only in the interests&#34; of defence, but for the furtherance of the general development of- the Continent. </para>
