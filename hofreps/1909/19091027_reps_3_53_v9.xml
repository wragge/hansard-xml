                            <para>- The conduct of the domestic affairs of the House is in the hands of Committees appointed from and by honorable members, and it would be better, if honorable members will permit me to say so, that all such matters should be brought before the Committees concerned, rather than before the House. The principal object for which those Committees are appointed is that the House may be saved the necessity of going into details of that character. I do not know exactly what the honorable member desires to learn, but I suggest that he should address his communication to the House Committee, which meets to-morrow morning. I can assure him that it will be dealt with at once. </para>

Therefore, measures which have been received from the Senate, and which, being of a non-party character, need to be considered chiefly from technical points of view, have been given precedence. I hope that next week we shall be able to resume the consideration of the Bill mentioned. </para>

                <para>So far as this House is aware, no provision has been made by the Government to finance this measure. It has been shown in the debate on the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill that the Government cannot possibly finance it from the proceeds of present Customs and Excise revenue that will remain after the amount which it is proposed to return to the States shall have been allocated. It is very desirable, generally speaking, that a Government, in submitting a Bill for the consideration of the House, should also bring forward a proposal to provide Ways and Means to finance it. We are drifting into a most lamentable procedure in this regard. Time after time measures are submitted without any proposal being made to find the money necessary to administer them. Many proposals are brought before the House, the fate of which might be materially altered if honorable members knew that Ways and Means to finance them were to be provided from certain sources. It is unfair to provide Ways and Means for financing this measure by means of Customs taxation. Customs taxation is borne largely by the working classes, and is almost entirely a class tax. Unless duties are levied to a large extent on the necessaries of life, the yield from Customs taxation is very small. To raise a large Customs revenue, duties have to be imposed on articles in general consumption by the working classes. Whilst the Constitution under which we are governed provides for the defence of the hearths and homes of the people, those who hold large properties - the wealthy of the community - do not contribute adequately to the defence of such properties by merely submitting themselves to compulsory training. A large number of men are called upon to train to assist in safeguarding them, and it is only fair that something in the nature of a direct insurance should be paid by such properties for the provision of defence made very largely on their behalf. The principle of providing for defence by means of direct taxation is accepted in Great Britain. The cost of preparation for both military and naval defence there is largely provided by means of death and succession duties, and the income tax. I need not, however, refer in detail to that phase of the subject, for the honorable member for Coolgardie dealt with it very effectively in a notable speech which he made in this House last session. </para>

                        <para>- We ought to know whether the cost of defence is to be met by Customs or direct taxation, or whether the Government propose to borrow for that purpose. Direct taxation would be the best system to adopt. Customs taxation for such a purpose is objectionable, and borrowing would be even worse, since it would mean saddling future generations with a permanent debt in respect of the defence of the Commonwealth at the present time. </para>

                <para>I have no desire to speak at length. The issue that I put before honorable' members is a simple one, and I hope that the Government will agree to the recommittal of the clause, so that we may provide that the coming into operation of the Act shall be preceded by provision for direct taxation. I trust that, in the absence of a specific understanding to that effect, the Government will state how they propose to find the money necessary to finance it. </para>
                <para>Dr.MALONEY (Melbourne) [3.0].- It is not my desire to take up much time, or to retard the passing of the Bill. The honorable member for Cook has moved in accordance with a motion which the honorable member for Coolgardie has had on the notice-paper in more than one session, with the object of defraying the whole cost of defence from land revenues. I remind honorable members that we are merely parasites, clinging to a ball which is whirling through space, and that, while ours is only a life tenure, the earth is here for always. In the Old Land the revenue was at one time divided into three portions, one for the civil list, one for the clergy, charity, and hospitals, and a third for defence; and we. know that in one hundred consecutive years of warfare not one penny-piece of debt was incurred. It was only unfortunately under the Hanoverian succession that the National Debt grew - and I do not mean unfortunately in view of that succession, because as between the Stuarts and the Georges, God knows which was worst ! It was in the reign of Charles II. that there was created that huge incubus known as the National Debt of England. It would be simplicity itself if the revenues of the land were devoted to the purposes of defence. If twenty ironclads were required, all the Minister of the day would have to do, if supported by the taxpayers, would be to increase the taxation in order to obtain sufficient money. I cannot understand how any one, knowing our short tenure of life, can combat the idea that the land only should be the basis for raising the necessary money for defence. With our untold millions of acres, we have resources that would impress nationalities more than, perhaps, the few thousand soldiers we could place in the field. On the other hand, if we have recourse to the Customs House, then our policy cannot be protective, because, as we know, the more revenue a Tariff produces the less protective it is. To raise money in this way for defence would mean an infamous system  of revenue tariffism, which any decent Free Trader would regard with contempt and loathing. An an uncompromising Protectionist, I have every respect for the true Free Trader, but I have nothing but dislike for the revenue tariff man. I understand the difficulty of the Government, but now is the time to grasp the nettle and set an example which every other country would wish to follow. I repeat that the land which has to be defended, and which will always be here, should provide the means of defence. In view of the evils of a national debt, I look forward with some trepidation to our obtaining the necessary revenue from the Customs House. The majority of honorable members are adverse to borrowing ; and the State of Victoria alone, which has paid over ^50,000,000 in principal and interest, and still owes ^54,000,000, furnishes what ought to be a sufficient warning. I have restrained myself during the whole time this Bill has been before us, but I enter my protest now. If the House fails to recognise the necessity of ear-marking the land revenues for defence, it will show that it is not wise enough to read the future. The example of England which I have already cited is the best that any historian could produce in favour of making the lands bear the burden; and in that case, although there was fifty years of civil war, only one-third of the revenue was used in the way I advocate. I support the recommittal of the Bill ; and if the motion be carried, I shall be content with the decision at which the House may arrive, even though it does not meet the view of the honorable member for Cook. </para>

                    <para>.- The feeble response of "Aye" when you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> formally put the motion, prompts" me to say a few words. After the honorable member for Cook had taken a rather unusual course in introducing this question, I think that we might have been given some indication of the intentions of the Government. We have to thank the honorable member for Melbourne for his historical researches, which remind us of Ha Ham's <inline font-style="italic">Middle Ages,</inline> and, in view of the expressions of opinion we have heard on various occasions, particularly when the Budget and the Defence Estimates have been before us, we should have some statement from the Government. Under this Defence Bill" the expenditure will be £1,750,000 or ,£2,000,000 per annum; and it is only right that we should know the direction in which the Government intend to look for this money. Australia has been singularly fortunate, inasmuch as none of the loan moneys have been used for war purposes. Whatever may be said against the loan system, it cannot bt denied that we have assets for our expenditure. The money has been used in the useful work of developing the country, the portion spent in defence being insignificant ; and we ought to know whether it is the intention of the Government to meet the forthcoming large expenditure from current revenue. If it is intended to borrow for defence purposes, we are entering a downward path, and are' not dealing fairly with the people. The Bill provides for compulsory training, and our expenditure on naval and military defence will be very large. At the present time, we have only Customs and Excise revenue from which to defray it. Neither Free Traders nor Protectionists desire to have their Tariff burdens increased. The main sources of the Commonwealth revenue now, apart from the duties on intoxicants and narcotics, are the duties on food supplies, apparel, and so on, which bear heavily upon the masses. It would not be fair to increase or extend those duties to provide additional revenue for defence purposes. But if the Customs and* Excise revenue is not increased, we shalT either not have a sufficient sum to pay for defence, or shall have to go short in regard to necessary developmental works.' We are considering legislation concerning large projects which will have to be put' on one side altogether, if the expense is to be paid for out of the existing revenue. The Government must have a policy, and should say whether it is intended to pay for defence out of revenue, or out of loan money, and whether, if it is intended to pay for it out of revenue, the revenue will be increased by direct taxation or by an alteration of the Tariff. Personally, I favour an income tax rather than a land tax in this connexion, because I think that it would give the larger return, and would call upon those possessing property, whose safety had been guaranteed, to pay the cost. </para>

I feel strongly' that ' the masses on whom the Bill imposes military service should not have to bear the extra cost) which it will involve. It would be scandalous if the first Commonwealth loan was floated to obtain money for purposes of defence. Should a division be taken on the proposal of the honorable member for Cook, I will vote for it with greater delight than I have yet voted for a motion. I trust, however, that a Minister will indicate the intentions of the Government in regard to effectively financing the defence scheme. In any case, we should see that those whose wealth is safeguarded do not escape fair taxation. If the Government refuse to agree to that, we must vote for the recommittal of the Bill to place our opinion in the matter on record. </para>

                    <para>.- It affords me satisfaction to note that the idea of levying direct taxation to provide funds for the defence of Australia is making headway. When the matter was first mooted by me in this chamber, it was considered that we should not ear-mark any revenue for a specific purpose, but it is now seen - and will appear clearer in future - that the cost of defence should be provided by the wealth of the country. The underlying principle is that, just as the owner of a house pays premiums to an insurance company to recoup him his loss from fire, and as the ship-owner insures against disaster at sea, so property owners generally should pay for the defence of their belongings from confiscation by a foreign foe. In proceeding on those lines, we are on sound and unassailable ground. So that there may be no misunderstanding because of the remark, of the honorable member for Melbourne, that we propose to tax land solely to provide for national defence, I wish to read a motion which I submitted to the House on the5th November,  1908.  It is this - </para>

Why should the workers pay  80  per cent. of the cost of protecting private property, which belongs to about  20  per cent. of the people? </para>

                        <para>- My figures, which are admittedly only approximate, are based on the official statistics for Victoria, whose circumstances differ only slightly from those of the other States. The Savings Bank returns do not furnish a wholly reliable guide, because many persons are in the habit of opening small accounts for their children. This, of course, enormously increases the number of depository. Probably the number of breadwinners who have accounts in the Savings Bank is not much larger in Australia than elsewhere. However, I am prepared to stand by the figures which I gave last November, and which I submit for the in- formation of the honorable members for Balaclava and Fawkner. I hope we shall take a straight-out vote on this proposal, so that the public may know who are prepared to face the defence problem in a practical manner, and without perpetuating injustice on the unpropertied masses. We ought to know who are resolved to go on making poverty pay for the protection of wealth ; and who, on the other hand, are prepared to place the burden of the cost of defending this country on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. </para>

                        <para>- I should be content to follow the English example in this matter. From the earliest times down to the present the cost of defending England and carrying on her wars abroad has been borne by property. The kings had vast estates in those days, and whenever it was necessary to raise money for war purposes, property in towns and cities was levied upon, so all that the workers had to find were the men to fight the battles. If Australia ever has to fight an invader, it will be the masses of Australia that must defend the country, and it is grossly unfair to expect them also to provide the munitions of war and the cost of maintenance in times of peace. I therefore hope that the honorable member who introduced this proposal will persevere with and carry it to a vote, and that we shall get some intimation from the Government of how they are going to finance the increasing burden of defence. That phase of the question has never been properly placed before the community. In the various estimates of the cost of defence furnished in the Budget papers from time to time, I have found that no interest has been charged on the capital sunk in forts and guns. Although those forts and guns are continually depreciating they are being charged at their original value as if they were still worth the money first expended upon them. The expenditure on defence has also been continually under-estimated. I believe that if the matter were gone into thoroughly it would be found that we are really spending fully£2,000,000 per annum on defence, and that the money is coming almost exclusively from the pockets of those who possess little or no property. That fact constitutes a grievance against which the people of this country have a right to revolt. This proposal will be resisted by those honorable members who have vast possessions and " flocks on many hills." Payment by the community of an assurance premium for the protection of their wealth is a very comfortable arrangement for them. But I venture to hope that the masses will wake up to the fact that for them it is an evil and iniquitous arrangement. It should be enough that the manhood of the nation is drilled and disciplined for any conflict, that it should risk existence for the preservation of our independence, without being required also to shoulder the financial burden which should be borne by the accumulated wealth of the country. </para>

                    <para>.- In view of the fact that this Bill will not come into operation until the year 191 1, there is no necessity for this proposal at the present stage. In the course of the next two years the questions connected with the matter can be fought out, both at the general election and in this Parliament. The necessity for making provision for defence is of vital importance, and must be faced whatever source the money is to come from. But at present debate upon this most important subject, regarding which I admit there is a great deal to be said, will be an unjustifiable call upon the very short period which we have for the transaction of the remaining pressing business of the session. </para>

We have been engaged in pushing through a defence scheme practically irrespective of its probable cost, and without any consideration of who is to pay for the upkeep of this big machine. It seems a very pertinent question to put to the Government from what source they intend to raise the necessary taxation. The people are to-day paying through the Customs House about 48s. per head. That, for an average family of six, is over£14 per annum. </para>

Compulsion in defence has never been very palatable, to me, but if it is to be adopted, and the cost of it is to be borne by the Customs revenue, it will be one of the cruellest pieces of work that this Parliament has ever perpetrated on the masses. Although wages have been slightly increased during the last few years, the increased cost of living, chiefly as the result of the Customs duties imposed by this Parliament, has in all the States practically counterbalanced that increase. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has only just awakened. I moved about 300 amendments on the Tariff, all in the direction of reducing duties. If it is the intention of the Government to make the Customs revenue bear the additional burden of defence, it will be cruel to the masses of the people. Another suggestion is that the cost should be met from loan money, but God forbid that we should start a compulsory defence scheme and couple it with a loan proposition. Even if that policy were temporarily adopted, the interest would still have to come from Customs revenue, and the masses would have to pay it. I do not say that the land should bear the whole of the burden. Such a proposition would be as unfair as that the Customs revenue should bear the whole of it. But 110 honorable member can object to land and income bearing their proportion of the cost of defence. It is all very well to put off the evil day. We are reminded that the Bill does not come into operation until 19 1 1, and because of that we are, forsooth, asked blindly to accept a compulsory enrolment and training policy, with an expensive Defence Force, and leave to the future the question of devising methods to find the money for it. I do not feel inclined to take that course. I admit that we have not a great deal of time this session, but no question has come before the House that deserves more consideration than this. It is due to the House that the Government should give some indication, if they have a policy on the subject, of what that policy is. If the money is to be found through Customs taxation, the country is entitled to know it. If the masses supply the bone and sinew for the standing Army which we are about to create, wealth should contribute something towards its upkeep. We should not ask the people, not only to make sacrifices by submitting to compulsory training, but also to find the necessary funds.. There will be some heart-burnings when the Bill, as it stands, is put into operation, because many lads will be taken away from their work, and will find their billets filled when they come back. At the same time, it is generally admitted and approved that we should do something substantial to establish an effective Defence Force. I cannot credit that the land-owners and others who possess wealth are not sufficiently patriotic to contribute their share towards the upkeep of the new force. </para>

                        <para>- I am talking, not of providing for the cost of constructing warships, but of the annual defence expenditure, amounting to about £2,250,000, and increasing ultimately to about £2,500,000. We hope to provide for that expenditure without resorting to further taxation. I therefore ask honorable members to allow this question to be determined without any prolongation of the debate. No good purpose can be served by it except in relation to the interesting object that we all have in view, and which must be met before many months elapse. </para>

                        <para>- Well, then, the honorable member meant to say that in connexion with the defence proposals of the Government it is estimated that we shall have an annual expenditure of about £2,250,000, increasing ultimately perhaps to , £2,500,000. If this Bill is to be effective it will soon be brought into operation, and expenditure must be incurred in connexion with it within a very short period. When the Minister of Defence was moving the second reading of the Bill he was asked several times to state how the Government proposed to finance it, but he made no response. He now assures the House that the Government hope, without imposing any increased taxation, to meet the demands which it will make upon them. </para>

He could not be induced, however, to do so, and we have not had since any information from the Ministry as to the methods by which it is to be financed. The Minister has said, in a way that may carry conviction to the minds of some people, that the Government hope to be able to finance it without imposing additional taxation. If they do, why do they anticipate a shortage of  £600,000  this year in connexion with the payment of old-age pensions? </para>

According to the Budget Statement, the Government anticipate this year a deficiency of  £1,200,000,  and under this Bill they will probably incur this year a further expenditure of£500,000, for which no provision has been made. Will the Minister say that my estimate of  £500,000  is correct? </para>

                        <para>- The Minister of Defence should have made a statement as to the financial proposals of the Government, but he has given us nothing but the bald assertion that they will be able to provide the necessary money. A short time ago, the Minister of Defence said that the Government would have plenty of money to finance every proposal ; but, as a matter of fact, they refused to provide £250,000 in order to relieve the invalid poor of Australia. I refer to that incident merely to show the necessity of adopting a system of taxation, so that money may be provided for defence, leaving current revenue for such humanitarian purposes as I have indicated. The desire of the honorable member for Cook is to tax the wealth of the country which is to be insured by a more effective defence system. </para>

                    <para>.- As the Minister of Defence has said, we dp not desire to have a second Budget debate, and I shall not say 'more than a few words. As a matter of fact, no ruling has yet been given on the point whether it is in order to introduce a financial proposal of this kind without a message. The contention of honorable members opposite is that wealthy ought to bear its share of taxation", and with that view we all agree, the only question being as to the adjustment of the incidence of taxation to secure that result. It is suggested that the greater part of the Customs revenue, amounting to about 80 per cent., comes out of _ the pockets of the masses. A little while ago, when we were discussing the Tariff, one of the chief arguments of the Protectionists, who form a large majority, was that Protection reduces prices, and I know that in several industries with which I was connected that was its first effect. If the people get their goods cheaper under Protection, it cannot be said that they pay the greater part of the revenue, because it must be really the importer who pays. I cannot agree, however, that 80 per cent, of the Customs revenue is contributed by the masses; and, with the honorable member for Coolgardie, I think it would be much more satisfactory if we had before us thoroughly reliable statistics on the question. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member, as a Free Trader, takes that view, or, at any rate, it is a Free Trade view that he is expressing. But the argument that was used throughout the Tariff debate was that Protection not only gives us the advantage of having the goods manufactured here, but also makes the goods cheaper to the people. At any rate, I merely rose to make the,, suggestion that, perhaps, our Statistical Department could give us some reliable figures on the point. I see that the Customs revenue amounts to £2 10s. 8fd. per head, and that, of this amount, 17s. represents taxation upon luxuries. No doubt a fair proportion of the burden falls on the trades unionists ; but there are other classes of employes, who are provided for by their employers, and who, therefore, have not to pay the duties. However, this is not the time to discuss such a question. The Bill will not come into operation until July, 1911, and I suggest that there will be time in the next Parliament to adjust the taxation. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the clause will be recommitted. It is true that the Bill does not come into operation until 191 1; but it will be a question placed before the electors at the forthcoming election, and, therefore, it is essential that we should be able to say how the money is to be raised. If the Government have in view a scheme of direct taxation, the necessary measure could not be passed . before the middle of 1910; and, if we allow another six months before it can be put into operation, we art within a few months of the Bill coming into force. Under the circumstances, the desire that the financial proposals shall go with the Bill is not at all unreasonable. The debate leads me to the conclusion that the Government have in mind two proposals for finance and defence, and one of these is an increased revenue Tariff. If that be so, it is unworthy of those who have in the past supported Protection. I had hoped to see the revenue from our so-called Protective Tariff diminishing, and I think every thorough Protectionist had a similar anticipation. Am I to understand that the Prime Minister and others have totally abandoned the principle of effective Protection? I cannot believe that the Government are irrevocably committed to borrowing ; at any rate, I deprecate any attempt at defraying the cost of our defence by means of money raised in Great Britain ; and it seems to me folly to deal with the question of defence without having before us proposals for the necessary financing of the scheme. The Minister of Defence may be tactically clever in his attempt to burk the question; but the people outside ought to be considered, seeing that they have to bear the cost. After all, defence really means the insurance of property held in Australia. It is surely not unreasonable for us to ask that the owners of property shall be called upon to pay for its defence in proportion to their wealth. That is practically what the honorable member for Cook asks us to affirm. Like other honorable members, I think that to put the whole burden on our land-holders would be unfair ; we should tax all incomes, whether from land or from other forms of investment. I refrained as much as possible from speaking on the Defence Bill, because I very much desire the establishment of a proper defence system. Every man who has the good of the Commonwealth at heart must desire that. But Ministers are not as enthusiastic about it as they should be, if they will not make a reasonable proposal for financing this measure, which I regard as only temporary. I cannot believe that it will prove permanently sufficient. Besides  £2,500,000,  we shall have to find a much larger sum before our defence arrangements can be wholly effective. I ask honorable members to support the motion for the recommittal of clause  2,  so that they may draw from Ministers a reasonable statement of their intention with regard to the financial side of this great question. </para>

                    <para>. - The House would not do justice to itself if it refused to consider how the Defence Bill is to be financed. We are making very radical changes in our de fence system, greatly enlarging our naval and military expenditure. In the Territorial Forces we propose to enlist a great many of our youths, and have provided, not merely for voluntary, but also for compulsory, service, to secure the widest training possible. In past years, many complaints have been voiced in this Chamber about the inability of the Department to meet the demands made upon it for the establishment of companies of the Australian Light Horse in country centres, the institution of civilian rifle clubs, and other necessary expenditure ; but the cry has always been, not that the proposals were not desirable, but that the Commonwealth could not finance them. Now a new scheme of defence is being provided for which will greatly increase our expenditure, and we ask for definite information as to how the necessary money is to be found. No proposal has as yet been submitted. </para>

                        <para>- It is not proposed to levy taxation by means of the Bill ; the amendment merely indicates' a source whence revenue may be looked for. The honorable member only asks that provision for getting revenue from that source shall be made in the Bill. There should be no objection to that. If the Minister believes that the wealthy should contribute towards the cost of defence - that there is a special claim on accumulated wealth in this connexion - he should not object to the insertion of the proposed provision in the Bill. Even should his interpretation of the amendment be correct, it is open for him to ask the House to amend it. But, adopting that interpretation, he opposes the vital underlying principle of the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- The question before the Chair is primarily whether a certain report shall be adopted. Upon that the honorable member for Cook has moved for the recommittal of clause 2 of the Bill. He proceeded to give reasons for his proposal, and I felt at the time that there was difficulty in defining exactly the proper scope of the discussion. The usual, though not invariable, practice is for mo-' tions for recommittal to be made without debate. It is necessary, in order that an honorable member may place before the House the reasons why he supports a recommittal, that he should be allowed a certain amount of latitude, but it would be improper to permit a debate in the House which would more properly take place in Committee should the Bill be recommitted. I feel that I must trust largely to honorable members to confine themselves to giving reasons for the recommittal. Incident ally they may mention the position which they would take up should the recommittal be granted, but it would hardly be in order to anticipate in detail the discussion of the proposal in Committee. I ask honorable members, with a view to conserving time, and to proceeding with business with despatch, to confine their remarks to the question before the Chair, so as to make it unnecessary for me to intervene. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that your lucid ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> will illuminate the understanding of the Minister of Defence regarding this proposal. He has contended that a definite proposal has been made. You suggest that that is not so, but that the honorable member for Cook is merely moving for the recommittal of a clause to make provision in it whereby a part of the cost of giving effect to the measure may be met by direct taxation. The honorable member is stating an abstract proposition. He lays down no hard-and-fast conditions, but simply asks for a recommittal of a clause with a view to amending it in a certain direction. If the House agrees to the recommittal, as I hope it will, then the honorable member, when he moves his amendment, will disclose to the Committee in what direction he proposes to move with regard to direct taxation. It has been admitted on the Ministerial side of the House that it is fair to ask accumulated wealth to contribute its share of the cost of defence, but so far as the House knows, the Minister proposed to meet the whole of the defence burden from indirect taxation. We on this side contend that such a policy would distribute the burden of defence most unevenly. The major portion of Customs and Excise revenue is derived from the poorer, or wage-earning, classes. </para>

                        <para>- I was simply' answering an interjection. It is generally agreed by competent authorities that Customs and Excise taxation presses most heavily upon the wage-earning and poorer sections of the community, and that wealth  does not contribute its fair share by that means. Therefore, to provide the cost of defence wholly from Customs and Excise revenue will enable accumulated wealth, which is vitally concerned in defence, to escape a large part of its just obligations. The honorable member for Cook simply asks that the Bill may be recommitted with a view to the insertion of a provision which, while it would not impose taxation, would indicate to the Government the feeling of the House that a considerable portion of the defence burden should be borne by accumulated wealth rather than by the wage-earning sections of the community. When the honorable member for Cook submits a concrete proposition in Committee, the Minister will be able to criticise it from the stand-point from which he has endeavoured to criticise the abstract proposal now before the House. If the amendment, when submitted, is not satisfactory, it will be open to honorable members to move to amend it so as to achieve the object aimed at in a more effective way. If, however, honorable members refuse to grant a recommittal, they will show that they are not prepared to ask the wealthy section of the community by means of direct taxation to contribute its fair share towards the cost of the defence scheme embodied in the Bill. </para>

It produces no bread, increases no national wealth, reduces no taxation, but robs the millions to protect the property of the few.

                    O'Malley wondered if the Labour party had gone mad on militarism. Labour had been fighting and " warring " for justice and freedom, and now they proposed to adopt the most diabolical methods of Europe, and give the gilt-spurred roosters power to blow a bugle and snatch farmers' sons, business men's sons, and Labour men's sons, and send them to the front.

                        <para>- What else can I do? I am a. party man, and when the majority of the party say that I must fight with them I have to do so. The clause ought to be recommitted in order to secure direct taxation, because this is extraordinary expenditure. It goes beyond anything that 4,000,000 of people ever did in the history of the world, except when engaged in actual war. It is without example that 4,000,000 of people, a part of a great nation, which is the Mother of Nations, the Mother of Parliaments, and the Queen of the Seas, should enter into an unparalleled expenditure of this sort without making any provision for ways and means. Any man, whether a business man or three parts foolish and one part business, would get his plans and specifications for any expenditure that he was entering upon. Yet seventy-five members, chosen for their intellect and knowledge, day after day vote away millions of the people's money, and make no provision whatever to ascertain where it is coming from.I  thought that we were responsible trustees of the national estate, and would no more attempt to levy or vote or spend one penny of the people's money than we would to spend our own money. If we are not good trustees in the national sense, we are certainly not fit to be trustees in the private sense. It is admitted by the best military thinkers of the twentieth century that fortifications are useless. Yet every penny of this expenditure may be spent upon building torts in which men may be imprisoned to be shot down, just as Bazaine was at Metz. Our generals and colonels have had no experience outside Australia, and yet they go in for forts. Take the example of Port Arthur, where the Russians were shut up and starved out by the Japanese. That army might have retired and fought in the open, as Washington did. </para>

                        <para>- I desire merely to enter my protest. I know that the Government have the numbers, and that they will push the Bill through, but I de sire to show why this clause should be recommitted. It has been shown during this debate that if the cost of defence is to be provided for by means of Customs and Excise taxation, the poorest man with the largest family will have to pay as much towards the cost of the system as will the richest man with the smallest family. Lloyd George has shown' that in Great Britain the burden of taxation has fallen hitherto on the multitude of the workers and the battlers on whom we have lived. Why should we provide for the cost of this Bill by Customs taxation, which must be borne by the poor in the proportion of ten to nine? The Labour party are the missionaries of the twentieth century. We are trying to carry the gospel to the heathen. We feel that the wealthy ought: to pay their fair share towards the cost of defence, and we hope to convert the Ministry to our way of thinking. They have gone on the wrong track, and we desire to draw them from it. We wish to save the Government from themselves, but apparently it is useless to discuss this question further. The Government intend to expend large sums of money in the purchase of big guns that will be obsolete or worn out after two or three years' service. I read quite recently that some of the great guns on warships in the American Navy die, so to speak, from corrosion, after fifty shots have been fired from them. All this money is to be wasted, while we make no provision to improve the lot of hundreds of our own people who are in a state of semi-starvation, and live in hovels. We ought to insist that every Defence Bill shall have attached to it national provisions for financing it. We ought, in short, to say that there shall be attached to every such Bill a national postal banking system. </para>

It is a taxation proposal, and I submit, sir, that it cannot be held by any process of reasoning to be relevant to the Defence Bill, which does not contain even one financial provision. </para>

It was certainly open to debate, if the Bill had been recommitted, whether such a proposal would have been in order ; but the  Speaker  would not then give a ruling. As a matter of fact, the  Chairman  of Committees had previously decided that such a proposal would not be in order; so that there was reasonable ground for strong difference of opinion. The essence of the proposal was to recommit a certain clause ; and I submit that the ruling I have quoted governs the present case. </para>

Therefore, in my opinion, the objection taken by the Minister does not hold good. It is quite possible for the House to recommit a clause for a specific purpose, and it may be found in Committee that that specific purpose cannot be dealt with by the Committee. It is quite competent for the House, if it pleases, to send the clause to the Committee for reconsideration. </para>

                <para>Section one hundred and forty-eight, one hundred and forty-nine, and one hundred and fifty shall not disqualify any existing officer of the Commonwealth Military Forces for the rank he holds on the date on which the Act comes into operation. </para>
                <para class="block">If the provision means anything, it means that no Government, in the future, can do anything whatsoever to endeavour to make existing militia officers of field rank and over efficient for the work they are now performing. I hope, sincerely, that such an interpretation is not to be placed on the proposed new section, because it means that each officer will be able to say that he has a statutory right to be there to exercise his privileges, and to continue to lead his men in time of action, and that nothing the Minister may care to do can interfere with that statutory right, however inefficient the officer may be. When I was beaten on this matter in Committee, I immediately urged the Government to throw out the whole provision, so as to leave themselves a free hand. They did not do so; and now we have a proposed new section which may give incompetency a statutory right to remain incompetent and risk the lives of men. I move - </para>

                <para>I merely move the recommittal, leaving honorable members, inCommittee, to decide whether the proposed new section shall be struck out, or whether there shall be an amendment. An honorable member can only be against the recommittal because he has not taken the trouble to read the provision, or because he wishes the field officers to have greater rights than have the men. Surely when we are considering the efficiency of officers, we ought to take into account possible risks and dangers to which inefficiency may subject the men? </para>

                    <para>.- This proposed new section was originally introduced for quite a different purpose from that which will be achieved if it remains in the Bill in its present form. The Minister the other night was opposed altogether to the provision. He stated that it was not desirable to have it in the Bill in any form. It was sought to provide that officers should not be disqualified if they passed the examination of the Military College for the rank which they held, or within two years of its establishment obtained certificates of efficiency. The words " within two years of the establishment of the college "were struck out, so that now incompetent officers will have a statutory right to retain their positions. </para>

If it does not mean that all existing officers shall have a statutory right to retain their positions, the Minister should say what its effect is. As originally drafted, it was a good' provision, but the amendment which was made in it has destroyed its original purpose, and now it cannot have any force at all, unless it be an evil one.

                <para class="block">How could those sections disqualify, even if section  151  were omitted? Perhaps the Minister of Home Affairs, who is a lawyer, will answer the question. But, no ; honorable members on that side will not say anything. Apparently they have a bad attack of lock-jaw. All that section  150  does is to declare that no officer shall be promoted above the rank of major until he has passed a prescribed course of instruction. That provision could not be interpreted to disqualify any officer now holding a position. The Minister should justify the inclusion of section  151,  or agree to its omission; but apparently he knows that the numbers are with him, and, no doubt, if he insists, his supporters will follow him in this matter. Still a Minister will never lose by treating his fellow members reasonably. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not object to the recommittal of the Bill for the consideration of the clauses as read, but I foresee difficulties from the present mode of procedure. If the motion is carried in its present form, it will be an instruction to the Committee to deal with the new clauses as you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have read them out, and with nothing more. If a further new clause is necessitated, I do not see how the Committee will be able to deal with it in the circumstances. The Minister is trying to avoid a recommittal of the whole Bill in such a way that endless amendments may be moved, and from his point of view he is quite right, but he ought to see that, in view of the previous decisions of the House, the recommittal of the Bill would not reopen the question of the clauses with which the House has already dealt. If, however, the Bill is to be recommitted in the way which is now being adopted, I can foresee endless trouble, and I would advise the Minister, in the interests of the proper conduct of business, not to insist on the motion being put in that form. </para>

It does open up vistas of possibilities so far as delaying the Bill is concerned, although I am not suggesting that that is my honorable friend's intention. The honorable member for Corio has been away sick, and consequently has had no opportunity to bring these matters before the Committee. In the circumstances it will be only common fairness to allow him to put his case. </para>

I find it not only a skeleton, but a mortuary of all our hopes, and I sincerely trust that every opportunity will be given to add to its usefulness, or perhaps I had better say to broaden the scope of the measure. </para>

                        <para>- I think it could be made very useful, but the whole thing is in the blue clouds of the Minister's intentions. I know that the Minister is enthusiastic on the subject, and I do not doubt his capacity to grapple with the question when it is placed before him, but the measure as it now stands will, I am afraid, be a very severe disappointment to all persons who have seriously considered the defence question. I have no doubt, however, that the Minister will succeed in weaving something efficient out of the present unsatisfactory web of clauses and powers to prescribe. I can sincerely hope so, at any rate, for I have great trust in my honorable friend. </para>

                <para class="block">Section  36  of the principal Act reads - </para>
                <para>Persons voluntarily enlisting as members  of  the Permanent and Militia Forces shall engage to serve for a prescribed period of not less than three years, and as members of the Volunteer Forces and Reserves for a prescribed period of not less than two years. </para>
                <para>That provision will be affected only by the omission of the words "of not less than three years"; but a consequential amendment of the form of the motion will have to be moved in the Senate. There is, in force a regulation made under this section by which every warrant officer, non-commissioned officer, and soldier, and also every petty officer and sailor have to be re-enlisted and medically examined at the end of five years after their enlistment, and thereafter every three years, irrespective of whether or not such an examination is necessary. In  1907  the Military Board tried to overcome the difficulty by issuing with the approval of the Minister of the day a regulation which avoided the necessity of that triennial reenlistment and medical examination. That regulation was put in  force  for a little while, but it was found apparently to be contrary to the provisions of the section, and an order was then issued that pending the alteration of section  36  of the Defence Act and the form of oath laid down in the third schedule to the Act, the old period of re-enlistment for a period of three years in the Permanent Forces should be adhered to. That order was signed by the then Assistant Adjutant-General of Victoria, and applied to this State, but it was applied by other order to the whole of Australia. This proposed new clause is necessary, and I trust that it will be carried. </para>

                    <para>.- I cordially agree with the' Minister of Defence that it is well to have power to prescribe certain matters. We cannot be sure, however, that some chance Ministry of the future would not in any way interfere with the duration of the service of the Permanent Forces and the Militia under section 36 of the principal Act as proposed now to be amended. . The position would be serious if the length of service were suddenly altered, but I am glad that the Minister is realizing that it is right that he should have the power to prescribe certain matters. I failed last night to obtain from him the welcome response that I expected to a suggestion that questions in regard to canteens in barracks might be left to the power of prescription. I should like to see some safeguard adopted in this case to meet future action on the part of a Minister who might desire to do away with the Military Forces. If, for instance, the honorable member for Darwin, who is opposed to all armaments and warlike preparations, were Minister of Defence, he could declare under this provision by a stroke of the pen that the period of enlistment should be not three years, but three hours. </para>

                <para class="block">I am sorry that I was unable to be present to assist the honorable member for Hindmarsh when he moved a day or two ago for the insertion in the Bill of a provision under which all future promotions in the Citizen Forces must be made from those who have served in the ranks. That provision was agreed to ; but it may be necessary to amend it in another place. I would remind the honorable member for Hindmarsh that in connexion with the British Army men have been put into the ranks for a day in order that advantage might be taken of the rankers' section with regard to promotions. It will be necessary to fix a specified term of service in the ranks in order to meet those who may try to defeat legislation of this kind. In 1903 I was able by a small majority to secure the insertion in the Defence Bill of the provision that in the first appointment of officers preference should be given to those who had served in the Defence Force for three years without a commission, but against my wish were inserted the words " in the case of equality of qualifications." I am now proposing to substitute for that section a provision from which the words " in the case of equality of qualifications" are omitted. Section11. of the principal Act has been applied in a remarkable manner, and every effort has been made to defeat it. One of the first matters on which I have interviewed each successive Minister of Defence has been my desire that it should be made a little easier for men in the ranks to obtain promotion, and until the coming into power of the last Minister, who appeared to me to be to a certain extent under the control of officers, the position was certainly being improved. Whilst the ex-Minister of Defence was in office a new examination syllabus was published. As a matter of fact, in the opinion of some people, too many rankers were passing the examinations. . Men who have been working hard on the guns or performing other similar duties are now asked to pass an examination in English, which is quite proper, and also in the following - </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and there would not be such subjects if it were not to help the outsider as against the ranker. If it were only ranker against ranker, it would not matter how hard the competitive examination was; but the injustice arises when we have men from the ranks put in competition with university men, who have received a much better education, and have been specially trained for the examination. If A. B., who is a university man, gets  375  marks, while C. D., who may have been a sergeant-major, gets  374  marks, the latter gets no show at all at the hands of the examiners ; and unless we make some provision in the Bill we shall find that men in the ranks will absolutely stop offering themselves for examination. To show how the ranker is blocked, I may say that the qualifying and educational examination is put first; that is, the examination in which the ranker could do best does not count first as part of the competitive work. The Minister of Defence has been very good to afford me this opportunity, and I ask him to accept this new clause ? </para>

Thank goodness the terrible war in South Africa, for which the moneychangers of Europe were responsible, is now. over, and the British race has paid its obeisance and homage to the rough country farmers who fought so well for their hearths and homes ; but I ask whether one per cent. of the Boers who were so successful when matched against trained British soldiers could pass examinations of this nature. Is it not impertinent to set such subjects for the examination of candidates for the lowest rank of commissioned officer ? I am as certain that an attempt is being made to build up a military caste, as I am sure that day follows night. The Minister cannot desire this. We must see, therefore, that opportunities are given for the ranker to rise. The examinations must be made fairly easy, like those for boys who are entering the Navy. Speaking to the captain of one of our great ironclads, I asked, as I had an idea that my boy might join the Navy, what the Examination was, and he replied, " We merely wish to discover whether the boys have ordinary common sense, and to that end ask a few leading questions. We do not make the examination severe. Such examinations come later, when boys are candidates for promotion." Let me read a little more from this syllabus - </para>

                        <para>- I know how hard it is for one to qualify to pass examinations after he has left school, because I commenced my medical studies at the age of twenty-five, when a bank clerk. The year in which I was preparing for matriculation was the hardest in my life, as I was studying and working at the bank at the same time. I had to get up early in the morning, and to attend night school, and would not ask any human being to do what I did. If we provided teachers for these men, it would be different. How do they obtain tuition in these subjects? </para>

                        <para>- Why are not the officers compelled to lecture on military subjects, as university professors lecture to students? Frequently there are two or three ways of answering a question, but where the students are permitted to take notes of a professor's lectures, they knowhow he will require his questions to be answered. The officers should be the teachers of the men, who should be like the members of a family, We should offer the strongest incentives to improvement. The feeling that every recruit had a marshal's baton in his knapsack so stimulated Napoleon's army that France was able to stand against the rest of the world. Australia has the widest franchise that is known, and her people, no matter what political party they may belong to, are pervaded with the democratic sentiment. Are we then to allow a military caste to be established ? These examinations are intended to frighten rankers from applying for commissions. Those who doubt it should read the syllabus, and ask themselves whether, with their matured intellects, they would care to face such examinations. I could not do so. I have quoted from Professor Luff, one of the greatest authorities on analytical chemistry in England, to show that the analysis of water is a most difficult matter. These men are examined on that subject, and particularly regarding the analysis of mineral waters. But a battalion of soldiers passing through unknown country ought to be accompanied by an analytical chemist, possessing a laboratory. The pharmaceutical chemist could not do this work. I appeal to the Minister to provide for a more sensible system of examination, and should have spoken in the same way had a member of my party occupied his position. </para>

He says they are not quite as stiff as the entrance examination for the professional side of the Public Service. After all, it is not a question of whether the examinations are stiff or not. It is a question of whether abundant facilities are provided for instruction in those subjects. </para>

                        <para>- No. I do not pretend that the examination is not still pretty stiff, but our examinations must be stiff for the officers of the Permanent Forces. We cannot have an efficient force unless the examinations are made what they ought to be, particularly in the technical arms. A man must know something of chemistry, and of advanced mathematics, if he is to have anything to do with the higher branches of the science of artillery. Our officers must be educated men if they are to be efficient in the art of modern war. </para>

                        <para>- That may be, but for two days we have been saying that a much higher standard must be set up and maintained. We have also insisted that the fullest possible opportunities shall be given to all persons in the forces to qualify for the examinations, and we have provided means for conveying this education to the ranker wherever he may be, and making it as easy for him as possible to take advantage of it. Now we have before us a proposal which, I am afraid, will, if carried, have a tendency to weaken the standard we have set up. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member's proposal will rule out the man in the back country who has never served in the ranks. The area and range of training as proposed in the Bill will be limited. The honorable member's case will be absolutely met by the elaborate set of provisions which have already been placed in the Bill. We provide the fullest facilities. We stipulate that the standard shall be the same for all, and be prescribed by the Director. We are providing schools of instruction and a Military College for the higher branches of the service for those who can afford to take the course. There will be the fullest possible opportunity for both the ranker and the officer to obtain promotion under the provisions as they already exist ; and I am sure that in a little while all the trouble which the honorable member alludes to will be obviated. </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing now, not with the Estimates, but with the principles of the Bill. As his case will be met in the fairest and most impartial way, is it worth the honorable member's while to persevere with this proposal ? It is an obvious limitation upon the area from which officers may be drawn. It ties us up to those who have put in three years in the ranks, and have served without a commission. It will, therefore rule out all those who live in the back country, although we might naturally expect to obtain from there some of our most expert cavalry leaders. They will not be permitted by the honorable member to qualify as officers, simply because they have not passed through the ranks. </para>

                        <para>- That proposal provided nothing of the sort. The officers were not to be deprived of their rank. My trouble was that the test was to be too simple. Now, however, the Minister wants to adhere to a most rigid examination, although he admits that the Department now considers that the examinations have been unnecessarily severe. He says they have been modified. They require to be modified still further. It is absurd to ask a private or non-commissioned officer applying for the position of second lieutenant to pass an examination even half as severe as is laid down in the tests that have been read to the Committee this afternoon. </para>

                        <para>- Machinery has nothing to do with the matter. The Minister was asked by the honorable member for Corio to show how those severe examinations had been modified, but he has not done so. The Minister last week secured the omission from an amendment which I proposed, and which he partially accepted, of a provision that " the competitive examinations shall be of a practical character, and no written work shall be demanded other than of the nature required for the rank concerned in the field and in the ordinary exercise of duties." </para>

He will not agree to apply a simple test to existing officers, some of whom, although not many, we know are not efficient and could not pass an examination half as severe as is now demanded of those applying for commissions; but so soon as we try to do something for the ranker, to place him on an equal footing with the man whose father is able to give him a more liberal education, we meet with the Minister's strongest opposition. </para>

I am absolutely in accord with the proposed new clause which goes in the direction that I asked the Committee to take yesterday. It seems, however, that every time that we desire to test the efficiency of those already in the forces the Government object, and assisted by their supporters they defeat us. The moment we propose to give a poor young man a chance we are blocked. </para>

I hope that the honorable member for Corio will stand by his proposal, although I do not altogether agree with the three years limitation. If a young man after his recruit drills puts in a 12 months' course, shows special aptitude for military work, and is able to pass a reasonable examination in theoretical subjects, he ought to be given a commission, especially as we have now a difficulty in obtaining officers. The honorable member for Corio proposes to make the period of service too long. </para>

                        <para>- But we are now making a new departure. We shall need a great many more officers almost at once, and we ought certainly to prescribe a simple examination for the position of second lieutenant. I could well understand a second lieutenant being required to pass an examination in the subjects set out in the syllabus in order to secure promotion to the position of lieutenant or captain. Having secured a commission he would have some encouragement to study such as aspirants for commissions at the present time do not receive. I hope that the honorable member for Corio will press his amendment, but that he will substitute one year for the three years period. </para>

                        <para>- Then we have to consider the nature of the examinations. The list of subjects read to the Committee by the honorable member for Melbourne suggests that the examination is fairly severe. We cannot tell until we see the examination papers issued under the regulation whether it is as severe as it would appear to be ; but the whole question that we have to ask ourselves is what examination is necessary. We have also to remember that the examination test is applied not merely to candidates from the ranks, but to all candidates fora commission as second lieutenant. </para>

                        <para>- I am not sufficiently versed in these matters to say whether or not the examination as applied is too extensive and intricate, but the list of subjects certainly seems to be very wide. If it is too severe at present it may be equally severe under the proposed new clause. This is, after all, really a matter of administration. There is nothing in the original Act that fixes the character of the examination, and if that now prescribed is found to be beyond what is necessary, it may be altered by administration. </para>

                        <para>- Then on the face of it the amendment of the section in the principal Act can mean nothing.. These words will have no effect, because there is no compulsion to appoint any particular person, and equality of qualifications must always be taken into consideration whether a stiff or an easy examination has to be passed or no examination at all. Some qualifications may be entirely physical, while others may be those inherent in character. Even if we struck out the words in section  11  of the principal Act " in the case of equality of qualifications " the right to appoint one man rather than another would not be affected. Under section  14  of the principal Act a candidate has to pass " the prescribed examination," and there are only two courses open to us. The first of these is to prescribe the examination in the Bill itself. That, I think, is most undesirable. We could not even indicate what kind of examination should be passed. There should be a literary examination, which ought to be fairly simple, and there must be a mathematical examination of some kind, but we could not declare its details in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>-Of course. The requirements, particularly in the Artillery, are varying and becoming more severe from time to time as greater precision in arms is secured. I understand from the honorable member for Hindmarsh that the Minister says that he has modified the syllabus, and he would be doing the Committee no more than justice if he explained as far as possible in what direction he has modified it. I notice that to qualify for the position of second lieutenant a candidate must pass in each of the three subjects in Part I., and in one of the three subjects in Part II. In Part I., section  1,  an examination in English is provided for. No one can take any exception to that. But in section II. of Part I. provision is made for an examination in physics. Under that section a comparatively easy examination could be set, but I do not hesitate to say that there could also be set an examination that would " plough " a man who was going up for matriculation. Speaking with experience of the law examination I assert that a paper could be set on physics that would " plough "  95  per cent. of the men who went up for the Bar examination. In section III. we have elementary mathematics. We get there quadratic equations, which is precisely the point to which a man who reads for the Bar is required to go - and the examination may lie easy or most difficult, according to the way in which the papers are set. I take no exception to mathematics for candidates for the Royal Artillery. I am not in a position to say to what extent artillerymen are compelled by virtue of their profession to go; but for an infantryman, there is not the slightest necessity to go so far in mathematics. A man has to take either history and geography, a modern language, or chemistry, and I regard the chemistry subjects as quite unnecessarily severe, while  1  fail to see their utility. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but I do not see why there should be a choice of the sort. History and geography may be all right, though, perhaps, history tends to confuse and to hamper one's judgment. I have no objection to a modern language, but if the idea is to utilize the man as an intelligence officer, I do not see any use in his passing an examination, including easy translation, and easy composition and grammar. The Minister would remove most of the objections by simply stating to what extent he has modified or intends to modify the regulations. We may assume that a man who has served three years will be reasonably familiar with the duties, for unless he is quite competent, he ought not to be appointed. No doubt, he ought to have other qualifications. A man who has to lead ought to have some grounding in education, because, other things being equal, he' is all the better officer for it. After all, there are very few men who could pass this examination. I know that neither the Minister of Defence nor myself would admit incompetency, and yet I think we should fail, and there are hundreds and thousands of very excellent men, who by reason, perhaps, of their not having been educated in the particular subjects when young, find it almost impossible to read the subjects up for examination. The Minister does not desire it to be said that the men in the ranks cannot rise if they possess ability, and, therefore, he should inform us as to how far he is prepared to modify the examinations. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for West Sydney was net present when I moved the amendment, bat he has noticed section 11, which was intended to give men at present in the ranks the right to rise. This is a working man's question, and the man who has to go into the ranks young, and work hard at his ordinary duties, may thereby lose the capacity for studying such subjects as are set down. The fact is that section 11 has been altogether nugatory. When a ranker becomes an officer, the service {,ets the advantage of years of experience in dealing with and obeying men. </para>

                        <para>- No; but I desire preference to be given to the rankers, with a standard of qualification for all, when we should find no such ridiculous regulations as have been read. Those regulations were made simply because, while in 1907 there were only six applications for commissions from inside and thirteen from outside, there were in 1908 twenty-four from inside and nineteen from outside the service.- It was thought that the examination ought , to be stiffened ; and the severe form will continue as long as there is the necessity for what is called " equality of qualification." However, as soon as preference is given to rankers, there will be none of these regulations designed to keep practical men out </para>

                <para class="block">Forces got through, and not one of the outsiders. I desire the Committee to realize what a number of men are killed at the first gate; and 1 should like to see military ability reckoned first, as only fair to the ranker. Men do not like to undergo examinations when they are made stiffer and stiffer; and if the military examination stood first, very few outsiders would try. At present, however, everything is in favour of the outsider. Would the Minister be surprised to hear that, wide, these regulations, no man in the Engineer Forces can become an officer? For appointment as an officer in this branch of the service, a man must have served three years in an engineering workshop, including one year in the drafting office, served for three years as an articled pupil to a reputable civil engineer, 01 have completed a three years' course for bachelor of engineering. A man, before he can join the Engineers, must be an artisan- an electrician, smith, carpenter, or fitter - and, although he may serve for a good many years, he has no right, in this democratic community, to become an officer, whatever his professional ability may be. If the Minister of Defence is honestly advised, he will be told that those who instruct the officers are really the senior warrant and noncommissioned officers in the Artillery and Engineers. Men who are not good enough to be officers teach the officers their work. </para>

What I ask is, first, that the rankers' right to qualify for pro motion shall be recognised - that the men from whom officers shall first be selected to be trained at the College so instituted shall be those who have served in the ranks. I desire that those who have spent years in the defence of the Commonwealth, who have learned its secrets, and done its work, shall be given preference. A soldier is not made in a day. or two. The military spirit cannot be acquired in less than four or five years. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that he will accept this. No doubt he wishes to do his best for the forces. I have brought this matter up on the Estimates year after year, and have been promised, and sometimes obtained, reforms by Minister after Minister, but during the last six months there has been retrogression, of which I think the cause is the increase in the number of rankers applying for commissions. In my opinion, certain subjects are set for examination merely to prevent rankers from rising. I desire that my amendment shall be read with proposed new section .148. Then it would not matter what the examination was, because those who were  competing  would all be rankers. The present examinations are designed to give privileges to a class, and to take rights away from another and more deserving class. Had the Minister had some one at his elbow to advise him, he would not have agreed to the syllabus which has been quoted from. The Act is being administered by unsympathetic persons, who do not like to see rankers' obtaining commissions. I have tried to devise other methods for attaining my object", but I cannot propose any better one than that now before the Committee, and I ask honorable members to assist me in giving effect to it. </para>

                    (Hindmarsh) [8.32L - I suggest the withdrawal of the amendment, because, as was pointed out by the honorable member for North Sydney, it will not accomplish the end in view. Proposed new section 148 provides that no officer shall be appointed to, or receive promotion in, the Administrative or Instructional Staff until he has passed the prescribed course at the Military College. The honorable member for Macquarie wished to give the same facilities to privates and non-commissioned officers as are to be given to commissioned officers. The Minister would not accept that.

                        <para>- The Minister was fair enough to say that the same facilities would be given to all applying for commissions. If proposed new section 148 were amended by the insertion of the words "applicant or" before "officer," it would get over the difficulty so far as applicants for positions in the Administrative and Instructional Staff are concerned, because then even a private seeking promotion could go to the College for the necessary instruction. The honorable member for Corio might look into the matter, and try to draft an amendment, to be moved in another place, which would carry out what he desires to have done. What I have suggested would, I think, be sufficient in regard to the Administrative and Instructional Staff, and it should be easy to make the provision apply also to other candidates for promotion. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the provision which the honorable member for Corio wishes to insert would carry out his object. Only recently two men were examined in South Australia for promotion. As they were practical men, all who knew them thought that they would pass the drill tests easily; but, as a matter of fact, although they did well in the theoretical examination, they failed in the drill tests. How would the honorable member prevent an occurrence like that? The examinations must be as . prescribed by the Director of the Military College, and our object should be, not to lower the standard of education, but to multiply the facilities for acquiring it.  1  promise the honorable member for Corio that I shall look into this matter very thoroughly, and that no effort of mine will be wanting to secure for the ranker every opportunity which he should possess for qualifying for a commission. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Corio does not wish to make the examinations easier. He is ready to accept the stiff examinations prescribed in the syllabus. What he wishes to do is to give the ranker the opportunity to obtain the necessary qualifications. A man who has been in the Royal Artillery or Engineers for a number of years must know more about practical work than the lad who has just left the grammar school or college, and who would pass the educational test with flying colours. There are not many in Australia who can afford to keep their sons at school until they reach the age of seventeen or eighteen years. No doubt, a smart boy of fifteen can work quadratic equations, and knows a little about mensuration, including logarithms, but the average lad has to leave school when he has passed the standard of the sixth class, and, unless exceptionally brilliant, has not then acquired a sufficient knowledge of mathematics to be able to pass an examination based on this syllabus. The lad whose parents can afford to send him to a college will be able, when he reaches eighteen, if there is anything in him at all, to master the matters referred to in the syllabus, but there is in Australia only a limited number of lads of that class who can get commissions. On the other hand, the ranker who left school at fourteen, and is perhaps a bright lad, and gets a training in the engineering shops, finds, if he desires to secure a commission, that under the present regulations he cannot in normal circumstances go higher than the position of a noncommissioned officer. The honorable member for Corio does not ask that the fortunate college lad shall be shut out. All he wants is that the ranker should, if he passes the same examination, all things being equal, have priority in the granting of a commission. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and he might lose that one mark in a subject like " Essay on a limited number of subjects," as set out in the syllabus, although that would be the very part of the course in which he might reasonably be expected to be less proficient. . In my younger days I often met men in the ranks of the Permanent Forces in New South Wales, and was very much surprised at the high educational qualifications which many of them possessed. In mathematics many of them were better qualified than the average university student. In those days Professor Wilson, of the Sydney University, held a lieutenancy in the Scottish Rifles. He was teaching mathematics at the University  at the time, and was astounded at the mathematical knowledge of many of the rank and file of the New South Wales Permanent Forces. I hope- the .Minister will understand that the honorable member for Corio and those who are supporting him in this matter do not desire to officer the Australian Army with incompetents so far as educational requirements are concerned. All we want is to remove the obstacles that prevent a ranker from ever going higher than the position of a noncommissioned officer. As the honorable member for Corio points out, the ranker will have an opportunity of going to the Military College when it is established, to supply the deficiencies in his early education. Many of us were misunderstood in our attitude towards the Military College proposal. Our desire was simply to test the practical knowledge and fitness of officers. After all, in all the professions, the sooner a man forgets his early examinations the better it is for him. The object of an examination such as this is only to run the rule over men ; not to see whether they are . educated, but whether they are instructed, which is a very different thing. Education is supplied in the forces by seven or eight years' practical experience in the use of arms, field organization, and command. The test of a good officer is not how much he can remember on the field of battle of his hydrostatics or his dynamic syntheses, but his knowledge of handling troops, and the power of his arm. Scholastic examinations are no more than tests of retentiveness of memory. As things are now the lad whose parents can afford to send him to college can at the age of eighteen or nineteen walk into the commissioned ranks. I do not say that he should not be admitted, but certainly the obstacles in the way of the ranker should be removed. Even if the Minister is right in saying that the honorable member for Corio's desire is already met by the Bill, the carrying of the amendment will make assurance doubly sure. An interesting instance is to be found in. the career of  Colonel Owen,  now a highly-placed officer in the Department of Home Affairs. He obtained his training in Mort's Dock Engineering Company. He learnt his trade with the origin.il intention of being a mechanic or artificer in connexion with engineering work, but he had an aptitude and desire for engineering and joined the Volunteer Engineers. He became an officer of high standing in the Engineer Forces of Australia, but is no longer on the active list. That is the class of officer that should have been retained in the forces. He is a practical man. He was not college fed or college bred. I am not making an attack on college men, but, now that we are creating an army of about 300,000 strong, the door should be thrown wide open to the average young man te obtain a commission if qualified. </para>

                        <para>- It applies only .to admissions 01 first appointments. It does not apply to militia officers who have got their rank.  1  can refer the Minister to  a  case which he will recognise without my specifying the name. It is that of  a  young man who is now studying architecture and civil engineering. He is of an age to go into the forces, and is the sort of young man who, if he is capable, the Minister ought to wish to have a chance of obtaining a. commission. Neither the honorable member for Corio nor any other honorable member desires to harass or trouble the Minister in regard to the Bill. All our suggestions are made to improve the measure, not to load it. If the honorable member for Corio has made a mistake he has made it with some experience, whereas the Minister has not had experience. He has to rely simply upon the advice of his Central Administration. I have much pleasure in supporting the honorable member for Corio. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister alluded to two officers in South Australia who failed in their examinations on the practical and not the theoretical side. I am glad that the Minister has brought that case before the Committee, for there is a great deal of dissatisfaction in regard to it. In the theoretical tests, where everything, was in black and white, they passed with honours, but in the practical test, in connexion with which there was nothing in black and white, they failed. No one could say, apart from the examiners, whether the candidates did right or wrong. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and in that respect I think that the examination is very, unfair. In Victoria three men failed at the same time, but they have since been re-examined and have passed. The two South Australians,  on the other hand, have not been given a chance to pass. Such occurrences will be detrimental to the defence system. I hope that the Minister will see that these two men are afforded an opportunity to undergo a thoroughly practical examination, and that a record is kept of the marks secured by them. </para>

                    <para>.- It would appear that whilst a record is kept of the marks secured by candidates in the theoretical examinations, no record is kept of those secured in the practical tests. I think that the fairest course to pursue would be to have a record of the marks secured by .candidates in both the scholastic and practical tests, and that that record should be open to inspection .by the candidates and others. Applicants for commissions who had failed would then have an opportunity to learn what their shortcomings were. I have heard a good deal of talk as to the failures in practical tests, and those who have failed have received no satisfactory information as to the grounds on which they were rejected. In all these matters, everything should be open and above board. It is not right that a man who gets within one or two marks of the number necessary for a pass should be deprived of an opportunity to be re-examined. The marks secured in each division should be recorded, and those who obtain the highest aggregate should win. That is the practice followed in connexion with rifle competitions, and indeed, in connexion with the election of members of Parliament. The returning officer, in determining the choice of the people, takes' into account the returns, not from only one polling booth, but from the whole electorate. If the course I suggest were pursued, there would be no cause for complaint. As one who sympathizes with the ranker, knowing how difficult he has found it to secure a commission, I shall support the proposed new clause. As a humble volunteer in Tasmania, a good many years ago, I found that people from outside could secure commissions, while men in the ranks were denied well-deserved promotion, although they had sometimes to tell the officers who marched .beside them what they had to do. </para>

If he allows to be prescribed qualifications that have the effect of deliberately shutting out men who, in accordance with section 11, have served in subordinate positions for three years, he is not fit for his position. The duty of a Minister is surely to guide his Department on questions of policy. We have in the principal Act a broad statement of the policy laid down by Parliament. ' It is there declared in effect that in the event of two candidates being equal in practical fitness for a vacant position, that position is to be given to the candidate who has served in a subordinate rank in the Defence Force for three years without a commission.

He has to take the responsibility for the method upon which marks are awarded in the examination, and if, as the honorable member alleges, there has grown up a system under which men who have served in the ranks without a commission for three years are deliberately " jockeyed " out of the opportunities which their physical fitness entitles them to secure, in connexion with a vacancy, then the Minister of the day is responsible to Parliament, and the Parliament should see that the section is carried out. </para>

                        <para>- That is surely the fault of the Minister. If the reference to equality of qualifications in section n of the principal Act means anything, it means practical fitness. What is the qualification most desirable in a subaltern or captain? Practical fitness for his work. Reference has been made to a number of mathematical terms in the syllabus. The theoretical examinations after all are not a test of practical fitness. The syllabus is copied from syllabi in European countries, where officers are recruited almost entirely from people of means, whose youth has given them <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> opportunity of acquiring practical knowledge. They are, therefore, required to submit to an examination to determine if they are up to a general mental average. If the Directorate or Commune in France before the Napoleonic wars, instead of selecting its officers from the troops serving in the front, had selected them only from gentlemen who could pass such an examination as that for which this syllabus provides, could any of Napoleon's marshals have acquired a commission? But there they had a finer school : the school of practical experience and fitness. </para>

                        <para>- That does not necessarily mean a prescribed examination in theoretical subjects. The Minister can prescribe the examination. If a warrant officer in the permanent Garrison Artillery were a candidate for a commission, the Minister could prescribe an examination to determine his practical fitness to take charge, say, of a battery, if he desired to appoint him to a field battery of militia.  1  am afraid that if the reference to equality of qualifications lie omitted, the Minister will be compelled to promote any man in the ranks who makes application, whether he is competent or incompetent, to a commission. That would be most undesirable. </para>

If the Minister allows that to be done, he is not loyally abiding by the decision of Parliament. Now that the matter has been brought under the 'attention of the Minister of Defence, I hope that he will see that the spirit of the section is loyally observed. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is in this Bill no departure in principle from the original Act, but amendments are introduced with a view to meeting defects , and making the machinery and the administration work more easily and smoothly. Some of the amendments are intended to remove doubts as to the interpretation of various sections, and make clearer the intention of the provisions. There are several series of amendments, the first of which is intended to prevent an election being upset on a purely technical ground, when there is no doubt as to the expressed will of the electors. Instances will occur to honorable members where difficulties of the kind suggested have been created. One occurred in connexion with the Senate election in South Australia, when the election was declared void, simply because the ballot-papers had not been initialed, though the counterfoils had been signed by the returning officer, and it was perfectly evident what was the wish of the electors. The Bill also provides that all ballot-papers shall bear a secret watermark, and provision has been made for their manufacture under the greatest safeguards. Hitherto, ballot-papers which did not bear the initials of the returning officer have been held to be informal ; and, though it is not proposed to do away with the  initialing, in the absence of evidence of fraud, any oversight by a presiding officer in failing to initial a ballot-paper will be remedied by the official mark. I may say that an official mark is relied on in the Old Country. If honorable members turn to clause 19, they will find, on comparing it with the section in the original Act, that at present an elector who desires to vote, must not only have his name on the electoral roll of the division for which he seeks to vote, but must also reside in the' division. An amendment is proposed providing that the appearance of the name on the roll shall be absolute proof of the elector's title to vote, subject, of course, to his answering the statutory questions as to whether he has voted previously, and so on. Hitherto, it has been held to be possible to upset an election if it could be shown that an elector, at the time be voted, did not reside in the electorate. </para>

                            <para>-  I do not see how any one can do that. The elector will be compelled to declare his- place of residence, and will be entitled to vote in the division in which it is situated. We have endeavoured to simplify procedure by reducing the number of forms which now have to be used in connexion with registration and postal voting. There are now three forms in use for applications for enrolment. The first of these is for applications for original enrolment, the second for applications for transfer from one electoral division to another, and the third for applications to change from one subdivision to another within the same division. This is confusing to electors, and, in their interests, and to prevent the inflation of the rolls, it is proposed to substitute for these three forms a card, upon which the elector will declare: first, that he is an inhabitant of Australia, and has lived here for six months continuously, which is necessary to entitle him to original enrolment ; secondly, that he claims to have his name placed on the roll for the subdivision in which he lives, and has been living, for not less than a month preceding the date of the claim j thirdly, that he is not under twenty-one years of age; fourthly, that he is a natural-born or naturalized subject of the King ; fifthly, that he is not disqualified ; and sixthly - in the case of an applicant for transfer or change - that his name is on the electoral roll for a certain subdivision. If' the claim is an original one, he adds the words " no other " before the word " subdivision," to indicate that his name is not previously enrolled. In Western Australia the card system is already in existence, but two cards, original and duplicate, are being used. We intend to adopt the card index system, and to utilize a single card only. On the cards being received by a registrar, he will make entries in his register, and then forward them to the Commonwealth Electoral Officer of the State, who will ascertain whether the applications are for original enrolment, transfer, or change. It is hoped that by this system the rolls will be kept purer, and made more complete, and that it will be easier to trace electors than it is at present. The present forms will be accepted until the card system has come into complete operation, because they have been distributed all over the Commonwealth, and it would be unfair to refuse applications on them. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that matter later. We propose to strike out the provisions in the Act which deal with postal voting, and to substitute new provisions, but the actual alterations in substance are not important. The substitution of new provisions is proposed, because so many verbal and small alterations were necessary to effect our object. We thought that it would be clearer to substitute an entirely new set of provisions, although the alterations are not material. </para>

                            <para>- In some respects; but we have increased the number of persons who may witness postal vote certificates. The form now in use requires the signature of the elector and of a witness on the counterfoil for each vote given at. an election for a member of the House of Representatives, or a senator, or in connexion with a referendum. It is proposed to substitute for that a form which will enable the certificate to be printed on the back of an envelope, to be forwarded to the returning officer. The witness will sign that certificate, and one signature is all that will be required from the elector and the witness where now three are needed. This will simplify procedure, and, I hope, insure more satisfactory administration. Under the present Act the elector who has reason to believe that he will not, on polling day, be within seven miles of the polling place for which he is enrolled, or of a prescribed polling place for the division in which he is enrolled, may obtain a postal voting certificate ; but we propose to restrict the right to vote by post to electors who have reason to believe they will not, during the hours of polling on polling day' be within seven miles- of any polling place for the division in which they are enrolled. Under the present Act a large number of persons' are competent to witness postal votes, but it has been found necessary to add to their number lighthouse-keepers, stationmasters, and others, to give additional facilities to electors who have hitherto found it impossible or inconvenient to obtain witnesses to their signatures. </para>

                            <para>- That is more a matter for me than for the officers to express an opinion upon. The postal voting system was brought into operation to give all the electors of the Commonwealth an opportunity . of exercising the franchise. A number of people are unable on polling day for various reasons, such as sickness and other causes, to go to a polling booth. That applies particularly to the female population. In order that they should not lose the chance of voting once in three years or as often as an election happens to occur, the postal vote was introduced. </para>

                            <para>- That may have been the honorable member's experience. Honorable members will see in other clauses dealing with the postal vote, especially proposed new section  190b,  that full directions are given, and the duties of authorized witnesses stated. I hope honorable members will agree that the directions are set out so clearly that it is almost impossible for anybody to misunderstand them. There are a large number of authorized witnesses. In fact, their numbers have been increased to a considerable extent. Another class of amendment is introduced with the object of permitting an effective recount of votes in certain circumstances without resort being necessarily had to a Court of Disputed Returns, although that Court will still be the final Court of appeal. Under the existing law a divisional returning officer has not the same powers in regard to a recount as his junior officer has in connexion with the scrutiny. It is thought advisable to give him the power to reject or admit ballot papers, but after he has done that there will still be the opportunity, in the event of any dispute occurring, of referring the matter to the Court of Disputed Returns. The object of this new provision is simply to enable an independent judgment to be given by the superior officer in connexion with each division of the Commonwealth. </para>

Another class of amendment is introduced with the object of making the law in certain particulars clear to returning officers and the public generally. Some of these provisions refer to the right of an elector to receive ballot-papers. No limitations are proposed in connexion with the method. They refer merely to the directions which are given. Clause 13 provides that, in the case of objections lodged by officers, if, in the opinion of the returning officer, they are not valid or of sufficient account to take notice of, .the returning officer shall have the power to dismiss them, and there will bs no necessity to give notice to the persons who have been objected to. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Clause 13, however, does not apply to objections lodged by private individuals. In that case the objector has to lodge a deposit with each objection, and those objections will be dealt with in the same manner as they now are under the principal Act. No alteration is proposed in that respect, because it is thought that when any member of the public thinks it worth while to make an objection and lodge a deposit, he should "get a run for his money" and have an opportunity of being heard. Another class of amendment has for its object further co-operation with the States in relation to the preparation, maintenance and printing of rolls in all cases where common registration areas can be agreed upon. Those matters are dealt with in sub-clause 5 of proposed new section 56, and also sub-clause 3 of proposed new section 61  b.  One of the principal objects of these proposals is to bring about cooperation between the States and the Commonwealth as far as is possible. This will save a considerable expense to both States and Commonwealth by having the same rolls to work upon, and practically the same officers to conduct elections. In order to bring about this uniformity there must be some elasticity in connexion with the legislation proposed. The legislation of the States in this connexion is not always the same. It differs in the case of different States, and the State* legislation also differs from that of the Commonwealth. Tasmania has practically co-operated with  the Commonwealth in electoral matters. We have a joint roll, the same officers conduct the elections, and they are jointly paid by the State and the Commonwealth. That system has been found to work very satisfactorily. It is proposed that in the matters of enrolment, change, and transfer we shall have in each .case a uniform time of residence in order to secure uniformity. . Six months' residence is now necessary in the Commonwealth before any elector can obtain original . enrolment. A month's residence in the new division is necessary in order to obtain a transfer from one division to another; but in order to obtain a change from one subdivision- to another within the same division, a qualifying period of residence is not necessary. So that we may have complete uniformity and prevent electors becoming confused as they do now with regard to the forms for enrolment, change, and transfer, it is proposed to' make a month's residence uniform in the two latter cases. </para>

" <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FULLER.-</inline> No; he has to put in a month's residence. He can now go from one subdivision to another of the same division and apply to have his enrolment changed without a qualifying period of residence, but we propose in future to require a month's residence. </para>

                        <para>- I think it would be better if honorable members allowed the Minister to make his statement, and asked for explanations of details at a later stage. Of course I realize that when a Minister is making a statement a pertinent question may sometimes remove a good deal of misapprehension ; but I ask honorable members not to enter into conversations with the Minister with regard to particular points. </para>

                            <para>- I was endeavouring to show that an applicant for an original enrolment must prove residence in Australia for six months. If an elector wishes to transfer from one electorate to another, one month's residence in the new electorate must be shown, just as under the existing law. An elector wishing to change from one subdivision of an electorate to another must prove the same period of residence in the subdivision in respect of which he desires to be enrolled. The object of securing uniformity in this respect is to enable the card system to be brought into full operation, and to avoid confusion. Electors in moving from one district to another are frequently at a loss to know whether they should apply for original enrolment or for a transfer, and it has been found in practice that they often apply for original enrolment when they ought to apply only for a transfer. In this way the rolls are largely inflated. </para>

This is a purely machinery Bill, in which there are no departures in principle from the Electoral Act. If honorable members desire to submit any amendments I should like them to let me have- them as early as possible so that I may have an opportunity to confer in regard to them with the officers of the Department who have had in their hands for some years the working of the electoral laws. My sole desire in submitting this Bill is to make our electoral machinery as complete as possible, so that the elections may be carried out in the purest and most satisfactory manner throughout Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- 1  congratulate the Minister of Home Affairs on the provisions of the Bill which will enable additional polling places to be established in the various divisions. That is a step in the right direction. The old practice used to be to have only one polling place in each subdivision, and that method of grouping electorates prevented thousands of electors from recording their votes. The change proposed is very necessary, more particularly in mining centres, where settlements grow up rapidly and consist of men from all parts of the Commonwealth. In one corner of my electorate, within a few months, over 1,400 men gathered. They had come from mining fields all over Northern Queensland, and at the last general election the majority of those men1 were disfranchised. They did not have time to secure postal votes, as they were far removed from the returning officer. The- same experience fell to the lot of men in other parts of Queensland. I rose, how-' ever, to deal more particularly with that portion of the Bill which relates to postal1 voting. To my mind it opens the door to the most flagrant violation of the secrecy of the ballot. At the last by-election for Echuca no less than 1,800 postal votes were recorded. This Bill provides that - </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member ought to know what occurred in Queensland at the State election before last. A more disgraceful state of affairs could not be imagined. Under the system of voting by post there the secrecy of the ballot was violated in the worst possible way. Any man may say that he has reason to believe that on polling day he will be more than  7  miles from a polling booth, and will, therefore, be able under this Bill to vote by post. </para>

                            <para>- The then Government of Queensland appointed 300 justices of the peace of their way of thinking, so that their party might ' have their services in witnessing postal votes. In many cases these justices of the peace were canvassers and paid agents of the very party that had conferred upon them the commission of the peace. I know of cases in which women were asked by these canvassers to record their voles by. post, but refused to do so. In one case' the manager of a mine at which the husbands of some of these women were employed was taken to their houses, and practically demanded that they should  vote by post. In some instances the canvassers went so far as to tell the women that if they did not vote 'by post their husbands would suffer, and in certain cases their husbands were actually discharged from their employment. I know something of the facts. . The secrecy of the ballot was violated in a way which no honorable member of this House would approve. As a justice of the peace I went round collecting postal votes in the ordinary way, and do not hesitate to say that I knew how every person voted whose postal vote I witnessed. </para>

                            <para>- One could not help seeing how they voted. A woman must be pretty brave if she refuses to record her vote by post or to vote in a certain way when requested to do so by a justice of the peace who is manager of a mine in which her husband is employed. Some <inline font-style="italic">ni</inline> these justices of the peace went even further than I have mentioned." They carried with them small pieces of blotting paper to blot the signatures of the voters, and in that way ascertained for whom they were voting. Further, the vote of every " corpse " on the roll may be recorded. There is nothing to prevent any person applying for, and obtaining, a postal vote. The schoolmasters and other people, who are authorized to witness signatures', must do so, and the result is that papers may' be issued for Bill Jones or Tom Smith, whose names appear on the roll ; and when the real men turn up their votes are refused. It is idle for the officers of the Department to say that there is no abuse of this system in Queensland; and such a statement can only arise from gross ignorance or wilful misrepresentation. In the second election for the Federal Parliament an election was declared invalid, and the country and the parties were put to great expense, owing' to the abuse of the postal votes. It was proved in Court that such' votes had been obtained in an illegal' manner; and we remember that when the election was  recontested  the present member for Melbourne defeated <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEacharn. </para>

                            <para>- But the Echuca election presented a worse case, because then there were 1,800 postal votes recorded. If the postal vote is allowed as prescribed, how can a man depend on its proper use, especially in view of the manipulation of the women's vote in Queensland? An employer may go to a man, and tell him that he will be sent away on business on the day of election; and the postal vote can be recorded as the boss desires. All persons familiar with elections know the old method, under which a man would go into a polling booth, put a blank piece of paper into the ballot-box, and then come outside and say to another, " Here, you take this in and bring  your  ballot-paper out." </para>

So far as corrupt practices are concerned the present law is simply useless. The Department makes no attempt to mend matters; and the present. Bill certainly affords no assistance. The expenses were limited to £100, in order to prevent lavish expenditure of money; but, as a matter of fact, I have known over £300 spent in one little centre, not because there was any hope of winning the seat, but merely to test the strength of the party for a subsequent State election. Every cabman in the town was supposed to have volunteered his services for that side, although it was well known and openly stated that they were paid. I brought the case before the Department,' but was informed there was no law under which action could be taken, although any detective could have found grounds for aprosecution. </para>

Such practices as I have indicated are indulged in; and if our elections are to be pure, the law ought to be made stringent. If the expen.diture is to be confined to <inline font-style="italic">£,100</inline> the Government ought to compel, not only the successful candidate, but the unsuccessful candidate, to present accounts. Unfortunately, however, there is no method by which an unsuccessful candidate can be brought to book ; and it is in this connexion that some action should be taken. I hope that the Government will accept an amendment intended to make the law perfect, and will especially take seriously into consideration the question of the postal vote. In Queensland the evils of the postal vote were found to be so great that the first act of the new Government was to abolish it. What was done to permit men aw,ay from home to record their votes? The Act was so framed that men could record their votes at the polling place nearest to where they might be on the day of polling, voting for the division in which they were enrolled. That provision has worked very satisfactorily. </para>

When the postal votes are sent in, the returning officer verifies them by comparison with the names and numbers on the roll for the division to which they apply. If three votes have been recorded, two must be those of personators. Of course, a heavy penalty is imposed for personation, but the offence is practically impossible to detect. A person may say to a medical practitioner, or to any one else who may be competent to witness a postal vote, "I wish to vote by post, and ask you to witness my. signature." The signature is accordingly witnessed, but the witness may not know the voter, and might he unable to recognise him again. He must be content to accept the affidavit contained in the declaration. </para>

                            <para>- Do those who are qualified to witness a signature know every one of the 24,000 electors in my division? That would be necessary if the voter must be personally known to the witness. If personal knowledge of the voter were required of the witness, large numbers of voters would be prevented from exercising the franchise, because of the political bias of those competent to act as witnesses. Queensland representatives know that in connexion with residence certificates, justices of the peace have declared that they did not know men who wished to vote, and have thus disfranchised them. </para>

                            <para>- Any of these persons may be politically biased, and this may cause them to decline to witness a postal vote on the ground that the elector is not personally known to them. . In my opinion, it would be better to enact that postal votes must be witnessed by electors other than the voters, or, if you like, by two electors. There are camps in Queensland, containing, perhaps, forty or fifty men, in which there is no one who would be competent to witness the signature to a postal vote. Probably a competent witness could not be found within 40 'or 50 miles. </para>

I understand that they are to have the advantage of a polling booth at the next election. But at the last election they were 50 miles from the nearest polling booth, and every man who recorded his vote had to travel that distance. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer is a past master in using the votes of dead men. At one time there were only forty-five electors in his constituency, and I believe that he boasted that he had the whole of them in his pocket. Personally, I am of opinion that the postal voting provisions should be wiped out altogether. They are liable to lead to a violation of the secrecy of the ballot. If the method prescribed is not to be amended, I can see a danger of the evil system which pertains in America being introduced into this country. I hope that the Government will think over the matter carefully, with a view- of providing greater safeguards. </para>

It is proposed to prescribe the form of postal and absent voters ballot papers, as in the case of the Electoral Bill ; to provide that the referendum' shall be taken on the day of the general election ; to require that each elector shall make one declaration only, and so forth. The provisions in connexion with the referendum are similar to those which I have previously described in connexion with the system of voting for the House of Representatives and the Senate. There are also provisions to give, the divisional returning officers power to conduct the scrutiny in connexion with the referendum just as we glv£ a similar power in connexion with elections. Indeed, this measure is a necessary corollary to the amendments in the law proposed by the Electoral Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- Clause 5 deals incidentally with postal ballot papers. I should like to know whether, if we pass the clause, we shall be in some way bound to pass the postal ballot provisions of the Electoral Bill. It seems possible, in view of the speech made by the honorable member for Kennedy upon that Bill, that the postal ballot provisions will either be rejected or modified. By passing this clause, therefore, we shall be fixing the principle of the postal ballot system upon our electoral law. I have had an opportunity of glancing at a return furnished by the Electoral Branch of the Home Affairs Department in regard to postal ballot papers. It shows that the system was more largely used in the most densely populated State of the group than in the more sparsely settled States. The Minister will see, if he looks at the return, that at the last election 6,725 postal ballot papers were used in Victoria, whilst only' about 14,000 were used, in the whole Commonwealth. They were used more in Victoria than in the other States, because the electors had just found out the value of them. They were used more in the by-elections for Melbourne and Echuca than in any other electorates throughout the Commonwealth. I desire to know whether, if we agree to this provision, we are likely to be told that it will be impossible to amend the postal voting provisions in the Electoral Bill? I admit that honorable members generally did not know that this Bill was likely to be brought on tonight, and therefore have not had an opportunity of studying its provisions. </para>

                    <para>.- This afternoon I gave notice of my intention to move to-morrow a motion to abolish the sale or consumption of spirituous or intoxicating liquors within the precincts of Parliament. I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the Government will allow the motion to go on the notice-paper as an unopposed motion ? I am not taking this course because I think that there is any abuse of this service, but the House and the Government unanimously signified their belief in the principle that no spirituous or intoxicating liquors should be used in the forces under the control of Parliament, and consequently I think that Parliament might well set an example to all bodies throughout Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I -desire to call attention to a proposal by the Minister of Defence in regard to flying machines for military purposes.  1  wish to know whether he has received any applications in regard to flying machines, and to make a suggestion to him. I find that he proposes to give a prize of £5,000 for a flying machine for military purposes, under certain conditions, and that applications must be lodged by the 31st March next. According to the conditions - - </para>

                    <para> The machine must be able to rise from the ground without appreciable delay under its own power and without the aid of special starting apparatus, and must be able to alight without damage to its machinery or gear. It must be capable of " poising " or remaining over a given area for what would in the opinion of the Minister be sufficient time to enable such observations to be taken as may be necessary for military purposes. </para>
                    <para class="block">Flying machines are of quite recent invention ; in fact, they were the butt of comic papers until recently. What the Minister asks for is an invention which would realize from  ,£500,000  to  £1,000,000  if it could do what is required. I ask the Minister whether he should not only relax the conditions, but have an alternative proposal to give a prize, but not necessarily of  £5,000,  for the best model of a machine likely to accomplish the purposes he has in view. The difficulty with many of our inventors is to find the cash to perfect the machine. To ask them within a few months, and for  £5,000,  to do something that none of the great "inventors of the world have been able to accomplish* is .to ask altogether too much. Will the Minister state whether he has received any applications, whether he will consider the desirableness of relaxing the stringent conditions in regard to poising and alighting, and also whether he will give a prize for the best model ? </para>

                    <para>. - It is too early yet to talk about relaxing conditions until we see whether the prize is likely to be claimed under the present conditions. We have had a large number of applications and inquiries of all sorts. We want, if possible, to get some novelty in the machine which is to win the prize. Tt is of no use to offer a prize if there is to be no novelty . over and .above what has already been accomplished in the case of inventions now on the market and doing service. . The idea is to stimulate Australian inventors, and I venture to say that the inventive faculty is quite as strong in this country as elsewhere. I am sure the honorable member is taking a broad Australian view of the matter. </para>

                        <para>- These regulations were suggested and framed by people who are intensely interested in the scientific side of the question, and by known experts in the science. After a careful review, the 'present conditions were adopted. If the honorable member will point out where he thinks they are wrong, I shall be glad to consider the matter and modify them if I must. Our main object in offering the prize is to get something which will be useful for military purposes,, and that cannot be said of a machine unless it will poise and rise from rest. I admit that the conditions are stringent, but let us wait to see what comes of them. If afterwards we have to relax them, of course, that must be done. At present they might be allowed to stand until we see what inventions are placed at our disposal. </para>

                    <para>, - When honorable members receive the notice-paper to-morrow morning, they will see that the Defence Bill comes first in Government business, then the two Electoral Bills introduced to-night, the High Commissioner Bill, the Post and Telegraph (Recording Machines) Bill, and Bills of Exchange Bill, and afterwards the Patents Bill, Lighthouses Bill, and Seamen's Compensation Bill-. The measures appear on the notice-paper in that order, because it is recognised that a number of honorable members may be leaving tomorrow 'afternoon for Oodnadatta, and will be absent for the next two sitting days. It is proposed to take those measures which have no party application, but which are either practical or technical, as that course will probably meet the convenience of honorable members. With regard to the suggestion of the honorable member for Wentworth, that his notice of motion with reference to the bar at Parliament House is being opposed by the Government, it is not opposed in the strict sense of the term, but we have the responsibility of securing to the House an opportunity to consider such propositions. This is couched in rather sweeping terms. </para>
