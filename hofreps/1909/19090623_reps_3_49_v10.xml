But does not the Postmaster-General know it to be a fact that, whereas Australian telephone attendants receive <inline font-style="italic">£110</inline> per annum, the wages of similar employe's in Switzerland amount to only <inline font-style="italic">£36</inline> per annum? Does the honorable gentleman intend to reduce the salaries of the attendants here so that the commercial classes in our large cities may have a cheaper telephone service? </para>

I also wish to ask whether, in the course of the interview, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Berry,</inline> a member of the deputation, said that they insisted that no extra rate should be charged until a balance-sheet had been prepared. Further, did the permanent officers of the Department recommend the appointment of an expert Committee to prepare a balance sheet, or did the honorable gentleman take action at the direction of the Victorian Chamber of Commerce, and, if so, does he not think it is flagrantly unconstitutional for a Minister to act at the dictation of an outside body. </para>

                        <para>- Is the Postmaster-General aware that in many recent applications for the erection of post-offices his Department has required the payment of small sums as guarantees? In one recent case the sum of£2 was required for a guarantee for a postal service. Does the Postmaster-General think it is fair to continue a system which deprives country districts of proper postal arrangements? </para>

One of these suggestions must be carried out if that part of the Commonwealth is to remain settled. </para>

Also whether the Government expects from the Admiralty at the coming Conference on Naval and Military Defence a frank exposition of the Admiralty's views of Australia's naval necessities? If so, is it expected that such candour will be encouraged by sending to the Conference as "expert " an officer whose proposals it has already characterized as being " based upon an imperfect conception of the requirements of naval strategy at the present day and of the proper application of naval force?" </para>

                        <para>- It is proposed to send Captain Creswell to London, and, in fact, he is now on his way. He is the principal naval officer of the Commonwealth. He has, I believe, differed from even the Lords of the Admiralty on certain questions. The honorable member will recollect that the Conference is called, among other things, for technical discussion. That technical discussion could not take place without the presence of a naval officer. Captain Creswell as the principal naval officer of the Commonwealth was necessarily the proper officer for that post. I have no doubt he will render good service in the Mother Country. </para>

Since our delegation to the Defence Conference is charged with the duty of enabling that Conference to deal with the defence question in the full light of Australian conditions, would the Government consider the advisableness of asking to join it the Chief of our Intelligence Department, Colonel McCay, whose knowledge of our citizen forces' intelligence work would enable him to render most valuable assistance? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member's question may be divided into two parts. To the first the answer is " Yes." A principal object of the representation is that Australian conditions may be laid before the Admiralty. A second object was that the representative of the Government should go prepared for various contingencies that might or might not be advised at the Conference. This will decrease as far as possible the necessary communications that would otherwise have been - and, if necessary, will now be - cabled by him to the Government here in respect to particular proposals laid before the Conference involving action on the part of the Commonwealth. </para>

Will the Minister tell the House which statement is the more reliable? </para>

                        <para>- That is a question of which notice should be given, if, indeed, opinions should be made the subject of a question. Moreover, the honorable member, in putting one, should not - as he has,I hope unintentionally, managed to do - convey a serious misapprehension. I have been for years in favour of substituting for our subsidy in coin a contribution in kind. I did place that view before the late Conference, and expressed the opinion that, in my judgment, a contribution in kind would be preferred by the great majority of the people of Australia. Personally, I still hold that view. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite satisfied that the House will grant the same permission to the leader of the Opposition or of any other party as has been granted to the Prime Minister. I have always desired that a Ministerial statement should be made on a motion for the printing of a paper so as to afford the widest possible opportunity for discussion, but the Prime Minister asked 'leave to make a statement, and when  I  put the question to the House there was no objection. The matter is, therefore, entirely in his hands. </para>

                            <para>-  In this case, fortunately, no difficulty can arise. The next business on the notice-paper is the resumption of the debate on the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's speech, and that will allow the fullest possible opportunity for debate to any honorable member who has not already spoken on that subject. The statement I propose to make relates to a set of circumstances similar to that which is contained in the Governor-General's speech. It is, in fact, the policy of the Government expressed in the same brief fashion. When the debate on the Governor-General's speech is resumed there will be the utmost liberty of discussion. </para>

                            <para>-  I understood you, sir, to say that honorable members were not giving sufficient attention to business a few moments ago, when they, by courtesy, granted leave to the Prime Minister to make a statement. I was listening to what was going on, and would not for a moment desire to prevent the Prime Minister from making a statement such as any member could discuss if he so desired. But I had absolutely no idea that so important a statement was to be made as we are now given to understand is to be made. I certainly had no idea that it was to be made in such a manner as to completely prevent discussion on these important subjects; and at the same time, notwithstanding that an entirely different position is before us, to completely prevent certain honorable members who spoke on the Address-in-Reply from again speaking. I wish to ask you, sir, in connexion with the ruling you practically gave a moment ago, when you intimated that possibly the House would not refuse a like privilege to other members, whether you can say that definitely, or whether any guarantee to that effect can be given; if so, we might, perhaps, be able to proceed. </para>

Leave was given to the Prime Minister without question; therefore I have already ruled, and must again rule, that the Prime Minister has the right to proceed. I need only say, further, that, if he desired to initiate a debate, it was not necessary for the Prime Minister to ask for leave from the House at all. He might simply have proposed such a motion as the printing of a paper, and might then have gone on with the debate. The very fact that the honorable gentleman asked for leave should have been a sufficient indication to the House- </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps I shall be allowed to say that I did not wish to make my statement in any fashion which might foreshadow, even by implication, events which may not happen. But we are faced to-day with this difficult position - that the statement about to be made, though different in form, will be in substance and character a duplicate of the Governor-General's speech already before us. If we are to have a full debate on the statement now to be made, there will still remain on the paper an Order of the Day for a discussion of the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's speech. On that will arise a full discussion over again by every member of the House, with the exception of three, of whom I am one. I have no objection, and have not had any objection from the first, to formally submitting a motion in order that a full debate may take place on my statement. I am perfectly willing to agree to that, provided that it is now agreed amongst us that a further continuance of the debate on the Governor-General's speech, which would be merely a duplicate discussion of the same subject, will not be asked for. The adoption of this course will give every member of the House the fullest opportunity to express his opinion on the statement now to be made, and, if he so desires, on all that is contained in the Governor-General's speech. The course I suggested was that the leader of the Opposition, who has already spoken on the Address-in-Reply, might follow me upon my statement, and that we should then pass to the next matter on the business-paper, when every member of the House would have the fullest opportunity to debate the whole of the questions involved in it and in the Governor-General's speech. </para>

                            <para>- That is not the point. When I rose to take this course, I did so in the belief that our practice would justify the leader of the Opposition in claiming to follow my statement as a right. It appears that was an error, but when I rose I was certainly under that apprehension. However, it is easy for us to arrive at an agreement which will place us on the same footing. If the leader of the Opposition, on behalf of his following, will agree that the debate on both policies shall be taken on my statement now, instead of on the Address-in-Reply, that would involve no limitation and no loss of opportunity. </para>

I propose to put myself in the hands of the House, and to rest content with making a request that honorable members shall confine themselves to one discussion. To give them that opportunity, I shall conclude by moving that the paper which I hold in my hand be printed. I shall trust honorable members to give effect to the reasonable and fair suggestion I have made without prejudice to any of their rights under practice. A brief statement of the business which Ministers are about to submit to Parliament is due to both Houses, though, since the time at our disposal is limited, the references to its particulars must be condensed to the utmost. To simplify the synopsis proposals are grouped according to subjects, and not to their relative importance. The statement is as follows: - </para>

Correspondence is now proceeding with the State Governments in respect to the procedure to be followed in order to endow the Commission with this power. </para><para>An Agricultural Bureau, associated with the Commission, will be established in order to employ the latest scientific means of co-ordinating and extending the good work of the State Departments. </para><para>An active policy of immigration will be undertaken, and will be expanded in the light of the knowledge made available by  the Commission and the bureau, and with, it is hoped, the co-operation of all the States. </para><para>The appointment of a High Commissioner in London with a well-equipped office will be necessary for, among other purposes, our financial interests, the supervision of immigration, and co-operation with the Inter-State Commission in fostering trade and commerce. </para><para>In this connexion an endeavour will be made to cheapen the cable charges between Australia and the Mother Country, to extend the mail services, and to fully utilize in a federal spirit the new facilities provided under the contract about to come into force. </para><para>To permit a better discharge of the national responsibilities of the Commonwealth, your authorization will be sought for the acceptance of the Northern Territory. </para><para>Among the first proposals of the Commonwealth Treasurer is that embodied in the Bill, of which notice has been given, for amendments of the Old-Age Pensions Act. </para><para>This measure, by temporarily suspending the requirements as to naturalization, will permit all old residents of Australia, otherwise qualified, to secure a pension by obtaining letters of naturalization prior to the end of the year. </para><para>The second important feature of the measure is a reduction of the minimum qualifying period of residence in Australia from  25  to,  20  years - a concession which will no doubt be highly appreciated by the old residents whom it affects. </para><para>Bills providing for the compensation of seamen, the prohibition of inequitable rebates by trusts and combines, for the amendment of the Post 'and Telegraph Act 1 90 1, and the Patents Act, together with measures consolidating on a federal basis the laws relating to bills of exchange, bankruptcy, and marine insurance, all of great value to the' business community, will be brought forward. </para><para>The negotiations in London, in 1907, concluded early last ,year, allowing the coinage for the Commonwealth of an Australian silver currency, have been completed. In order to avoid further delay in securing the considerable profits thence accruing, a requisition for the new coinage has been despatched. </para></speech>

                        <para>- A Minister of the Crown ought to know better. We had today one of the most disgraceful exhibitions I have ever seen from a man in a responsible position. What it means is this - If what the Prime Minister desired to do had been done, no Minister of the Crown in this House would ever have an opportunity to make a Ministerial statement. A Prime Minister ought to know that neither he nor the leader of the Opposition has any privilege in this House which is not enjoyed by any other honorable member. Under these circumstances, what right had he to attempt to make a bargain with the Opposition that if the leader of the Opposition allowed something to be done, he, the Prime Minister, would endeavour to persuade his supporters to do something else? </para>

I have as much right to do so as has any other honorable member. The occupancy of the position of  Chairman  of Committees will not stifle me.

                        <para>- But the House is in rather a peculiar position. We have had a speech delivered by the Governor- General which has not been considered by the House. We are, therefore, dealing now with the Address-in-Reply to a speech delivered on behalf of a Government that does not exist. I am entitled to ask why the debate on the speech then put into  His  Excellency's mouth is not to be proceeded with. But when we ask that question, we are confronted with peculiar tactics, of which, however, I suppose, we have no right to complain, because we all know that once a man gets on the down-grade there is no telling where he will stop. He is like a criminal who, when he starts on his career of wrong-doing, does not commit very serious offences, but who, before he has completed his course, probably reaches the lowest depths to which it is possible for a man to fall. Politically, the leader of the Government seems to be tending to such a condition. The late Government foreshadowed proposals for dealing effectively with the question of the New Protection. Those proposals, in my opinion, embodied the only method by which it is possible effectively to carry out that policy. When the New Protection policy was first introduced, it was thought that the method adopted by this Parliament would be successful in securing to the workers of this country a fair share of the protection afforded to industries under the Tariff. The honorable gentleman who is now at the head of the Government obtained support for his protective tariff on the ground not only that the workers themselves should receive a fair share of the protection assured, but also that the general public who purchased the commodities produced in the protected industries should receive a share of the protection. But a. certain firm in this State sought to evade the New Protection policy. And by the way, I may say, that this was not the first occasion on which that particular firm attempted to evade legislation which was aimed at improving the industrial life of the workers. The proprietors of that very firm on a previous occasion moved their works out of an area in which the Wages Board system of Victoria was effective. </para>

                        <para>- The firm of Joshua, I venture to say, will play a great part in connexion with the affairs of this Government before long. The "spiritual' ' effect will be very great. The firm to which I was alluding, however, has consistently tried to evade industrial legislation in order to deprive those working in the industry in question of the beneficent effects of laws that have been passed. What action did they take? They told Parliament that certain machines were being dumped in Australia, and sold at prices which made it impossible for local manufacturers to compete with their oversea rivals. Inquiry proved that the low cost of production elsewhere made it necessary to protect our workers by insuring to them fair and reasonable wages, and to protect the farmers by preventing them from having to pay too much for their machinery. Our legislation, however, was defeated by means of a constitutional technicality, and this House, therefore appointed a Select Committee to ascertain the local cost of making these machines, and the rates at which they were being sold. Every obstacle was placed in the way of that Committee, so that it was a difficult matter to obtain evidence in pursuance of its inquiry. Indeed, the action taken by witnesses amounted to a deliberate insult to the House, and the question was raised whether there was a power outside stronger than the House itself. Accordingly, the </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue><para>Committee was converted into a Royal Commission, empowered to inflict a fine of no less than  £50  upon persons refusing to give evidence. But, although the Commission used all the powers conferred upon it, it has not yet teen able to get from a particular firm the information which it was directed to obtain. Had Parliament known that this and other firms would not pay reasonable wages to those whom they employ, and that their prices would be unreasonable, it would not have given them the protection which they enjoy. The honorable member for Hume will bear out my statement that the Government of which he was a member, declared that reasonable wages, must be paid by those to whom protection was given, and that if there was any doubt as to the constitutionality of the measures passed to that end, the amendment of the Constitution would be proposed to give such legislation the fullest scope. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Yes. Both documents dealt with the same question, the need for the amendment' of the Constitution to provide for the effective protection of workers and consumers. But, judging by the newspaper accounts, of the past few days, the honorable gentleman who is nominally Prime Minister has abandoned that proposal, and now suggests a course which he and every other honorable member must know will not carry us any further. He suggests the appointment of an Inter- State Commission to deal with these matters. He knows that such an appointment would be unconstitutional. The honorable gentleman, who for months held office on the distinct understanding that something practical would be done, is now trying to shelve the whole question. He does this because he dare not proceed on the course on which he first set out. </para>

Even if the request relates to a proposal to establish the Federal Capital in a district devoid of an adequate water supply, the Prime Minister will say, "Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,"</inline> and will keep on saying so. If the Employers' Federation desired any special legislation, I believe that, with the influence of the honorable member for Echuca behind it, it would obtain, from the Prime Minister the answer, " Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Palmer."</inline> I say, unhesitatingly, that the proposal of the late Government for carrying out the policy of the New Protection - a policy of which this Parliament has approved over and over again - is the only effective one that has been submitted. We are now informed by the press that the Government do not intend to propose an amendment of the Constitution. The very fact that the Federated Employers' Union and the Chamber of Manufactures approve of the course to be taken by the Government is sufficient to show that they practically have the Government in hand. If I wanted a case to justify the remarks which I have made, I need only mention what has happened within the last few days. We have a Minister of the Crown who declares emphatically to the press and the country that the toll telephone rates have come to stay. Then what happens? The Chamber of Manufactures and the Federated Employers' Union come along and demand from that Minister the removal of those rates and the restoration of the old rates. Whereupon the honorable gentleman says," Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Manufacturer;</inline> Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamber</inline> of Commerce," and withdraws the provisional proposals made by the late Postmaster-General. </para>

If the action which the Minister has taken is correct, then all the heads in that Department ought to be sacked for not being competent to carry out their duties. The Minister has all the information which the late Postmaster-General had, and if he has made any inquiry into the matter at all he must know that for years past it has been recognised by the Department that some such course as that taken by the late Postmaster-General would have to be followed. The Minister, however, could not withstand the strain of the pressure from the Employers' Federation. Like the Prime Minister, he was nothing but a piece of putty in the hands of those people. </para>

Another question is the necessity of an amendment of the Old-age Pensions Act. Without going into details regarding that matter, I hope that the Government will come down with some proposals to deal with it as expeditiously as possible. Another important matter that must be dealt with is touched upon in the sixth paragraph of the Governor-General's speech, in these words :  - </para>

                </quote><para class="block">I quite agree that something should be done. I recognise that, the States and the Commonwealth have certain functions which each can best perform in its own sphere of action for the good of the people. At the same time the Commonwealth has immense financial obligations facing it. The Northern Territory must be taken over, there is talk of building a transcontinental railway, and the cost of old-age pensions has to be met. All these will mean the expenditure of a considerable sum. The transfer of the Northern Territory does not involve merely the  £3,000,000  odd of the State debts which the Commonwealth will have to take over from South Australia in relation to it. There is also an annual deficit of upwards of  £60,000,  but a greater outlay will still be required, because the development of that enormous Territory will cost a vast sum of money. First of all, a railway must be run through it, and that work alone will cost a large amount. It must be constructed in such a way as will give the greatest facilities for communication between Port Darwin in the north, and the great centres of population in the south. If the line is to be used for defence purposes it must be laid down on the universal gauge, as a narrow-gauge line would be absolutely useless, and if the Territory is to be properly developed there must be established a fast line of steamers running from there to the older countries of the world. Those are some of the details that must be taken into consideration in dealing with the transfer of the Territory. The railway line alone will probably cost  £4,000,000,  and then there are the problems of getting the people there, settling them on the soil, and inducing them to remain in that part of Australia. Enormous sums of money must be expended in connexion with that one phase alone of the financial problem. </para><interjection>

                </continue><para class="block">Minister absent from the chamber. Even when he was leading a previous Government we could never " lay salt on his tail," and we are now having a similar experience. I was pointing out that a considerable sum of money will be required to carry out the various proposals before us ; and this means that at an early date the Commonwealth will have to get additional moneys. There is the proposal so dear to the heart of the right honorable member for Swan - the" desert" railway, or the railway to Western Australia. The estimated cost of that line is admitted to be about £5,000,000 ; and if the Commonwealth make a seventh borrower in Australia, we shall be saddled with an enormous interest bill. In whichever way the Government may try to shelve the question, considerable sums of money must be obtained to enable the business of the country to be carried on in a financially sound way. Then £250,000 or £260,000 is required for the bonus to the iron industry, and some £50,000 for bounties to certain agricultural industries, in addition to the expenditure necessary to perfect the lighthouse system around Australia. To all who have travelled, it is well known that the coasts of Australia are, perhaps, the worst lighted there are ; and, if we desire to improve our commerce, one of our first duties is to remedy this defect, so that shipping which comes to our shores may be insured the safest means of entering port. We have been repeatedly told that to put our Post and Telegraph Department into thoroughly up-to-date working order will require an expenditure of something like £2,000,000 ; and I regret very much that the Department should have been allowed to get into such a state. In this connexion Parliament is to a large extent to blame for the manner in which it has dealt with the finances. Although under the Constitution the Commonwealth is entitled to retain one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue, that one-fourth has never yet been wholly retained ; on the contrary, we have foolishly returned to the States upwards of £6,000,000 beyond the three-fourths of the revenue to which they are entitled. That I regard as a great blunder. Had we put the Post and Telegraph Department into thorough working order, we should not have heard the present growling, or be faced with the financial burden to which I have referred. We have received nothing but blame from the States, but we must not forget that this excess of revenue was returned in a time of drought, when a number of the States were not so prosperous as they are at present. I admit that pressure was brought to bear upon various Commonwealth Governments to return as much as possible to the States, in view of their necessitous circumstances, and I am not blaming any particular Government, but rather the whole Parliament, for acting, as I think, so stupidly in allowing a great Public Department to sink into such a state of disorganization and disrepair. All this means that we are going headlong to financial disaster if something is not done. I find, however, that when I begin to discuss these matters I have not a quorum. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I regret these frequent interruptions, but it is necessary that we should have the Prime Minister and Treasurer in the House, even if only occasionally. I know that the Prime Minister finds it difficult to attend to his duties in the House for even five minutes, while the Treasurer is so overburdened that it takes him all his time to reach his place when the bells ring. In my humble way I am dealing with matters of great importance, and  I  think that the Treasurer ought to be here, although I know that he does not care whether the Transcontinental railway be built or not. </para>

                        <para>- I have no hope of getting in what I want to say when the Budget papers are under consideration. I have regretted that we are compelled to expend a considerably larger sum than we did previously. I have pointed out the various matters which call for the expenditure of large sums. It is necessary that the money should be forthcoming from some source at the earliest possible moment. It  is idle for us to say that this Parliament has been brought into existence at considerable cost to the taxpayers, if it is to merely echo the dictates and the will of the State Parliaments. In my opinion, the proposal of the late Government would have met the demands fairly well. They recognised that the demands of the Commonwealth were such as to require additional expenditure to the extent of several millions of pounds, and in order to provide the funds, they proposed to take a certain proportion of the States' three-fourths share of the Customs and Excise revenue, and to institute a land tax. A land tax must come. May I suggest that the defeat of the late Government was due to one clause in their programme? </para>

                        <para>- We fell into the stupid mistake of raising revenue for somebody else to spend, and' it should be rectified at the earliest possible moment. No matter what the financial proposals of the Government may be, they should provide methods by which the finances of the States and the Commonwealth may be separated for ever. I learn, from the press, that we are not to be allowed to deal with the matter in that way, and that the Government intend to adopt quite a different method. I do not know whether that is so or not. The Treasurer is very profuse in his interviews. Probably he makes statements which he does not intend to carry out, or, perhaps, they are the usual fireworks which he throws off when he wants to cover up something of a more important nature. We are told by the press that the Government do not intend to sever the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth, but propose to shelve the whole matter for a few years. A proposal of that kind is unworthy of any Government of the Commonwealth. We want additional revenue, and the question is, " Where is it to come from? " In the famous Gympie speech, the late Prime Minister told us where the money was to come from, namely, from the States' three-fourths share of the Customs and Excise revenue, and from land taxation. The land tax proposal of the late Government was, to my mind, one of the fairest methods by which the revenue could be obtained. It certainly did not go so far as I would like, but I was merely one of a number, and was prepared to accept that which was offered. Probably if the principle had been affirmed we might have been in a position hereafter to deal with the matter more effectively. The adoption of that policy would have the effect of assisting to break up large estates in this community. Is it not an extraordinary thing that in Australia where, as we know, millions of acres of land are unalienated, the Crown is purchasing private estates? In Queensland, where less than 5 per cent. of the land is alienated, the Crown has spent over £1,500,000 in purchasing private estates. Is it not a remarkable thing that out of the 124,000,000 acres, which have been alienated in this community only 11,000,000 acres are under cultivation, including lands under artificial grasses? To my mind, that is clear proof that the time has arrived when some action should be taken to compel owners either to use their land to the fullest possible capacity, or to allow somebody else to do so. Is it not reasonable to suppose that the alienated portions contain some of the best, if not the very best, lands in Australia, and that the unalienated portions must be second or third class lands? I submit that the time has arrived when a land tax should be imposed in order to assist in compelling land-owners to cut up their estates. Any person who travels from Melbourne to Geelong, or to Kilmore, or to Woodend, is bound to ask himself this question, ' ' Why is not this enormous area of good land under cultivation? Why is this valuable land held by one man for merely depasturing a few sheep, when thousands of families could be settled thereon? " Every State is compelled to repurchase land for closer settlement, not because there is not ample land for people to settle on. for in Australia we have ample land for millions of settlers, but because, unfortunately, the great bulk of the land  is held for speculative purposes, and not in the best interests of the community. In these circumstances, we contend that the imposition of a land tax as proposed by the late Government is the correct policy to adopt. I regret very much indeed that it was not permitted an opportunity to institute a land tax. Any one who has studied political events in Victoria and other portions' of Australia must realize the position. At a meeting of the Employers' Federation, presided over by the honorable member for Fawkner, the organizer of the party on the other side told those present that the whole matter was merely a class struggle. I do not regret that he made that statement, because I have always looked upon it as a class struggle, and I hope that the struggle will go on. It is because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> described it as a class struggle that those opposed to us realized that what was proposed by the late Government in the introduction of a land tax was an attempt to invade the privileges and vested interests which they hold so dear. If we required proof that they were prepared to make it a class fight from that moment, we have only to look at the composition of the present Government, in which we find men who have sacrificed every political principle they previously professed. The beginning and end of the political career of the Prime Minister has depended on his advocacy of the principle of protection, but the honorable gentleman has had to abandon every principle of protection. Why? Because the pressure of those engaged in the class struggle on the other side has compelled him to swallow his principles or to sacrifice and desert them just as it has compelled the honorable member for Parramatta to sacrifice his free-trade principles, so that the vested interests of certain persons shall not be interfered with. In the circumstances we regret very much that the late Government were not permitted to introduce their land taxation proposals. They were of more importance to the defence of this country than all the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> that could possibly be built. The possession of <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> will not enable us to hold this country unless it is populated, and if we permit millions of acres to remain in the hands of a few men, we can never have it populated in such a way as to secure its defence. I hear men talking about this country who really know so little about it that I marvel at their impudence in expressing an opinion as to the means of its defence. It is only by travelling over the greater portion of the country that one can have any conception of what the defence of Australia really involves. Unless we compel people to break up their large estates, and settle tens of thousands on the lands now held by a few, all the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> that can be built will be of little use in the defence of this country. I hope that the time is not far distant when we shall deal with this matter. I regret very much that the late Government were not permitted to do so, because I am sure they would have dealt with it effectively. I have tried to show the various obligations which have fallen upon the Commonwealth, and which will require large sums of money to finance them. I have said that the late Government proposed direct taxation for this purpose. There are two methods by which Government expenditure can be carried on - by taxation, whether direct or indirect, and by borrowing. It appears to me that the Labour Government adopted the wisest course possible in deciding to impose a land tax to provide the necessary, funds with which to carry out the various obligations of the Commonwealth. They took the right course for this reason : that if they required£1,000,000 for public expenditure and taxed the people to the extent of £500,000, in two years they would have secured the funds they required, and the obligation of the taxpayer in that particular would be at an end. . From press reports we learn that . the present Government propose to take another course. It seems now that we are to have nothing new in the Federal Parliament, but are to be asked to adopt the old methods of boom and burst, which have so long been pursued by the various States Governments. One of the great drawbacks in Australia to-day arises from the fact that sufficient provision was not made to meet the obligations of the States Governments when their various loans became due. While money was being borrowed and expended, everything boomed, but then came a time when the borrowed money had to be repaid, and then the boom was found not to be so satisfactory as it was thought to be. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; the bubble was pricked. Apparently, the present Government intend to obtain funds for public expenditure by borrowing. Under that system, if  £1,000,000  is required for public expenditure, presuming that the Commonwealth can borrow at a cheaper rate than the States, at  3  per cent., instead of  3  J per cent., for the usual term of fifty years, the result would be that at the end of fifty years we should have paid  £1,500,000  in interest, and still owe the  £1,000,000  originally borrowed. It is estimated that an expenditure of  £2,000,000  is required to meet the demands of the Post and Telegraph Department, and if the course proposed by the present Government were followed, the people would have to pay no less than  £3,000,000  in interest during the period of the loan, and would still owe the  £2,000,000  originally borrowed, so that they would lose by that system of finance no less than  £3,000,000.  If we may judge the proposals of the present Government by what has appeared in the press, I say that they are not in the interests of the community,, or of the future generation, who must bear the burden of paying off the debts it is proposed now to contract. Speaking particularly of the State from which I come, I can well remember the days when political parties going before the electors used to say that what the people required was a vigorous works policy, an extension of railways, and that they were prepared to borrow money to carry on public works. One or other of the parties was returned to power, and in order to placate their particular followers the Government immediately went on the loan market, and got up what might be termed a glorious public works "drunk," spending money lavishly in every part of the State. One may travel through almost any part of Australia to-day, and see railways which do not only fail to pay interest on the money invested in their construction, but which, owing to the very small amount of traffic over them, do not earn axle grease. That has been the policy which has obtained in the past, and it "seems to be that which the Government favour at the present time. I extremely regret that it is so. But can we wonder at it, seeing that the Federated Employers' Union and others have merely to tell the Prime Minister what they want in order to induce him to answer " Yes." He dare not move one way or the other without their consent. He is practically in their hands to do just what they dictate. Coming to the question of the adjustment of the future financial relations' of the States and the Commonwealth, I learn from the press that the States Premiers and the Prime Minister have agreed to meet shortly in yet another conference. As a member of this House I object to the Prime Minister - irrespective of whether he be a Labour or a fusionist Prime Minister - delegating the powers of this Chamber to any Premiers' Conference. I maintain that any such action is a violation of the Constitution and of the parliamentary principles about which the honorable gentleman boasts so much from time to time. The operation of the Braddon section of the Constitution was limited to a period of ten years for a specific purpose. The object was that within that term the Commonwealth Government might acquire the fullest information in regard to the financial needs of the Commonwealth, so that it would be in a position to satisfactorily deal with (this intricate problem. But the State Premiers appear to think that they are the persons who should settle it. I claim that this Parliament alone is empowered to deal with it, and that it can solve the problem just as effectually and equitably as can any body of State Premiers. I think, sir," it is just as well that we should have a quorum present. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> I repeat that the proper tribunal to deal with this important problem is the Commonwealth Parliament, and I do hope that better counsels will prevail with the Ministry, and that they will decline to allow the States Premiers to dictate to them in this matter. I congratulate the late Prime Minister upon the stand which he took at the last Conference of Premiers. Upon that occasion the Premiers evidently thought that they could browbeat the Prime Minister in a manner that would have been degrading to him and humiliating to the community at large. I am. pleased, indeed, that he took up the correct attitude towards that body by stating that whilst he was prepared to listen to any proposals which it had to make, he did not intend to be dictated to. Honorable members will doubtless recollect that a good deal was at the time said in the press about that Conference. The newspapers in the different States made a great deal of the fact that the Premiers intended to uphold a scheme of their own for the settlement of the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth, and that they intended to stump the country in opposition to the re-election of members of this Parliament who were antagonistic to it. They threatened that they would adopt that course on every possible occasion. I do not object to them stumping the country,  but I do object to them using the powers of the State in that undertaking. It seems to me that the time has arrived when members of this Parliament should have some regard for their own dignity and honour. It is the bounden duty of every honorable member to fight for the Commonwealth Constitution upon all occasions. But it seems to me that there are a number of honorable members - particularly amongst those who sit upon the opposite side of the chamber - who are prepared to pander at all times to the parochial wishes of the petty Josses of the various States, in order that they may gain a little favour at their hands and score a little party triumph. I maintain that they ought to be above that sort of conduct. Honorable members opposite, who talk so much about dictation, know perfectly well that there is no party which has pandered more to the dictation of the States Premiers than they have. Even the Prime Minister himself has to do exactly what he is told in that connexion. I think, sir, that we ought to have a quorum present. </para>

                        <para>- Paragraph No. 8 of the speech deals with a proposal for establishing a Commonwealth silver and paper, currency. Financial institutions and the representatives of various vested interests in this country immediately put up their backs when the late Government made that proposal. Exactly the same arguments were used against the paper currency in Queensland. When the financial crisis of 1893 occurred, and the country from one end to another was thrown into a state of chaos, what was the cause ? It was not that the country was not prosperous, because any one who studies the statistics will find that productivity was greater at that period than it had been at any previous time. But the trouble arose from the fact that the captains of industry throughout the Commonwealth were unable to control the very machine that they themselves had created, with the result that a crisis occurred which landed the whole industrial organization of the country in chaos. At that time to what authority did the financial institutions look to relieve them from their difficulty ? Did they look to their brother speculators? No. They looked for relief to the Government. The Governments of the States, after heroic efforts, did an enormous amount to stay the chaos that our industrial rulers had produced. Queensland went a step further than did the other States in making the paper currency a currency backed by the Government, and controlled by it. Notes were issued to the various banks on their depositing gold with the Treasury to the amount of 25 per cent., which is a greater percentage than is kept by any bank for backing its own note issue. The banks make a large profit out of their note issues at the present time, not only through the handling of the notes themselves, but through the profits accruing in consequence of notes being destroyed by flood or fire, or through being worn out, the whole of this profit going into the coffers of the financial institutions. </para>

                        <para>- It does. Under these circumstances, why should not the Government have the profit? Does it belong to the individuals who control the financial institutions? Certainly not. It should belong to the State. In Queensland alone, where the note issue is necessarily small, a large profit is made from this source every year. And there is another feature which, in my opinion, constitutes a stronger argument than the mere saving of a sum of money. It is a well-known fact that in all well regulated and financially sound communities the proportion of note issue to the volume of trade is one-fourth. There is a tendency in times of stress and trouble for the financial institutions to be led away by the desire of people to borrow, to issue more notes than are absolutely necessary. In issuing more notes than the community can consume - that is to say, than are demanded by the community - for every additional note issued, the financial institutions should, for safety's sake, keep a sovereign. Otherwise a crash must take place. There is proof that the cause of every one of the world's financial crises during the last one hundred years was not a falling off in production. The people were producing more good things then than at other times. The cause can be traced to a very large extent to the fact that a great deal more paper money was issued than ought to have been issued, with the  result that a run on various banks took place, and crises were created. That is one of the reasons, apart from merely monetary considerations, why the currency should be controlled by the State. But interested parties, in the shape of financial institutions, say : " No ; you must not allow the paper money to be issued by the State; that is Socialism." But they are not frightened because it is Socialism. Their real grievance is that the proposal would take from them some of the privileges that they now enjoy, and some of the profit which ought to be held in trust by the Government for the good of the people. But until the Government controls the note issue, we shall never have a sound financial position, because there is clear proof that in  1893,in  every State in Australia, the Government had to guarantee the notes issued by the various banks. Another question is that of the Commonwealth coining silver. It is a question that ought to be settled at the earliest possible moment. I regret very much that successive Governments, since Federation, have not taken the matter in hand seriously, and dealt with it in a way that would be beneficial to Australia. The Commonwealth is being deprived of a large amount of revenue by reason of the fact that its silver coinage is minted elsewhere. Were the work done in Australia, employment would be found for more people, and the profit gained in the transaction could be spent for the benefit of the community. I regret that past Governments have not successfully concluded negotiations with the British Government in this matter. We should mint all the coins circulating in Australia, and enjoy the profits therefrom, of course, making provision for the loss on worn and defaced coins. I come now to an all-important matter, the question of defence. We must realize that Australia is a territory twice as large as India, whose population exceeds  300,000,000;  half the size of China, whose population is more than  400,000,000,  and about thirty times the size of Japan, whose population is over  40,000,000.  Even Java, a mere speck in comparison with this continent, has a population of  30,000,000.  Within fourteen days' sail of our northern shores are  800,000,000  Asiatics, or about half the human family. The honorable member for Parramatta has told us that, according to a great scientist, the Asiatic population of the world doubles every fifty years, so that half a century hence it will be  1,600,000,000,  while, should our population increase at the same rate, which is much greater than its present rate of increase, it would number only  9,000,000.  Is it unreasonable to suppose that these  1,600,000,000  of coloured persons will cast envious eyes upon any sparsely populated territory which may be adjacent to theirs? The eastern nations are now developing in a manner very different from the anticipations of some years ago. There was a time when they seemed content to allow the peoples of western Europe to control the world's commerce; but to-day, in Egypt, Persia, China, Japan, and India, the national spirit claims the right to govern. Japan, having sucked . the brains of the eminent men of Europe, has now assumed control of its own industries, telling the white races that it can manage its affairs for itself. To-day, the Japanese are the serious rivals of Europeans in pursuits which were formerly followed only by the latter, and are openly competing for the world's trade. In many industries, the Japanese have driven out white men altogether. We shall not be able to hold our enormous territory unless we populate it; and there is no hope of doing that until we have devised methods for settling the land. In adopting the White Australia policy, we took it upon ourselves to grapple with a problem whose solution will require the whole energy, enthusiasm, and patriotism of every member of the community. If we succeed, we shall show to the world that the white man is as efficient a worker in tropical climates as are coloured persons of any nationality. </para>

                        <para>- Great doubt Has been expressed as to the chance of success of the White Australia policy, but I believe that the white man can do as well, and, in fact, better, in tropical Australia than any black man. When we sought to get rid of black labour we were told that white men would be ineffective on the sugar-fields ; that it was a purely black man's industry. Time has proved, however, that the white man can do better work than the black man can in the cane-fields, and we have solved the labour problem so far as that industry is concerned. There are many other industries, however, that must yet be brought into existence in the utilization of the rich tropical lands of Queensland and the Northern Territory, and in connexion with them the labour problem is one that may well tax the energy arid ability of every member of the community. I have shown what the nations of the East are doing in developmental efforts on lines beneficial to themselves, irrespective of anything that the white man may do. There white men have been forced out of many industries, and since we are told that the population of these Eastern countries is doubling itself -every fifty years, it is only reasonable to suppose that they will cast longing eyes On Australia, which is yet but sparsely settled. In these circumstances, therefore, the question of defence is one of the most important that we have to discuss. As stated in the Governor- General's speech, the important question of the defence of the Commonwealth as an integral part of the British Empire received the close attention of the late Government. Various proposals have been made to provide an effective defence, and it was the honorable member for West Sydney who first submitted to this House a motion providing for universal training. That motion was carried by a substantial majority, with the result that the present Prime Minister, at a later stage, made a statement in the House as to the intentions of the Government in regard to it. In the last stage of a dying session, the Prime Minister devoted four hours to the discussion of the defence problem, and the few then present listened with the greatest attention and patience as he unfolded the policy of his Government. What was that policy? It provided for universal training. Youths and men were to be drilled and trained in the use of arms, and were tq belong to a National Guard until they were about thirty years of age. We are now informed by the press that the honorable gentleman has considerably modified that proposal, and that the present Government would confine the defence of the country to a very small section of the community. The system of training is to be confined to school cadets and youths. We need a more vigorous policy - a policy that will enable and fit every man in the community to take up arms in the defence of the country. It has been said that universal training is a form of conscription.  1  differ from that view. The proposal of the late Government, under which it was intended that every man in the Commonwealth should be trained to bear arms for the defence of his country, was calculated to carry out, not only the wishes of this Parliament, but of the whole community. This brings me to the point that the honorable gentleman who has been deputed by the Government to represent the Commonwealth at the Imperial Defence Conference has made a distinct statement to the effect that universal training should be for aggressive purposes. I do not wish to question the honorable member's technical knowledge of military matters, but I certainly think that his statement is an extraordinary one. I hope the time will never come when the flower of the youth of Australia will be made an armed force for aggressive purposes. In the speech to which I have referred, the present leader of the Government made a strong point of the intention of the then Administration, that the force to be created should not be for aggressive purposes. The Labour Party are opposed to war in all' its forms, regarding it as brutal, cruel, and unjust, and as calculated to cultivate only the baser qualities of mankind. Holding that view, we asked ourselves what was the best way to provide for the defence of Australia. We knew that democracies, wherever they existed, had been crushed by military caste, and we desired to prevent the growth of anything like a military caste in Australia. It was for that reason that the proposal for universal training, put forward by the honorable member for West Sydney, was supported by us. We knew that if every man in the community were given a rudimentary knowledge of drill, and of the use of arms, he would be prepared to protect his home when occasion arose, and that by means of universal training we should avoid the creation of a military caste in Australia. Realizing that, we declared unhesitatingly for universal training. It is the duty of every man to undergo training, not because he loves aggression, and not that he may be used for aggressive purposes, but because it is necessary for him to defend his home. The fact stares us in the face to-day that the world is anning, and we in our small way must make some attempt to protect ourselves. If we do not, then in the event of misfortune happening to the Mother Country, we may suffer to a much greater extent than we could possibly do if we were an armed nation. In these circumstances, we consider that it is necessary for every man to bear arms. But why have the Government backed down from their previous proposals? Is it at the instance of the honorable member for Parramatta that they have decided to reduce the age? That was one point which the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper insisted upon - and that is the paper which runs the Prime Minister. He dare not move without the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> behind his back, and if that paper had stood out against the coalition there would have been none. </para>

Unfortunately, the then leader of the Opposition had not much wool to get hold of, but he had obtained a good hold of the protectionist wool which, being much longer, he was able to handle more easily. At that time the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> thought that it was gaining a point on the free-trade opposition, and I was inclined to think so too, even up to the time when the honorable member for Adelaide delivered his speech ; but when the whole thing came out - when we heard the right honorable member for East Sydney state that certain sections of the agreement, which were to safeguard the protective policy, had to be dropped out, and the honorable member for Lang, the honorable member for Wentworth, and the honorable member for Robertson, together with the right honorable member for East Sydney. announced that they were to have a free hand on the fiscal issue - I came to the conclusion that the protectionists had, to a certain extent, been trapped. </para>

Why, then, have the Government backed down on their defence proposals? It is true that they have told the Mother Country that they are prepared to give a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought, .</inline> or some equivalent. When that proposal emanated from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, the present Prime Minister said, " Yes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline><inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> we shall give a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought."</inline> The honor able member for Parramatta and a number of others were at that time of opinion that the course that should be followed was not to give a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to the Mother Country, but to increase the naval subsidy ; but they thought that the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> proposal would be a popular cry, and so they adopted it. The then Prime Minister, the honorable member for Wide Bay, knew that he could not give a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> and that he had not the money to purchase one. He was, therefore, honest enough to tell the Imperial Government that while the Government of the Commonwealth were quite prepared to take the responsibility for the defence of this portion of the Empire, they were not prepared to give a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline> The Premier of Queensland took up a similar position, but the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria, in a half-hearted manner, and to show their contempt for the Commonwealth, said, " If the Commonwealth won't do it, we will." But they have done nothing. Then the great patriotic citizens of New South Wales offered to raise a subscription towards the cost of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline> The same thing was done in one or two places in Queensland, and in my electorate they have a whole£156 towards the sum necessary. In New South Wales, where such a fuss was made, the magnificent sum of £78,000 is promised, and there is only£10,000 in hand, after about three months' work. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether that would give it even a reasonable coat of paint. I suppose, if we took out the£20,000's and£10,000's promised, we should find that there are not more than  1,000  subscribers at the outside to the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> fund. I regret very much to hear that the heads of Departments in that State have practically used their influence to intimidate public servants to subscribe to the fund. I understand that that has not been allowed in the Commonwealth service. Such a thing is not calculated to promote the best interests of any service. We were not in a position to give a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> and when the Government made their offer to the Imperial Government they knew all the time that it would not be accepted. With that knowledge they were prepared to show the people of the Mother Country and of Australia what a loyal Government they were. They were not in a position to give a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> because they had not one to give. They were not in a position to buy one, because they had not the money to buy it with. Even if the Imperial Government had accepted their offer they would have had to borrow the money from England to buy the vessel with. </para>

                        <para>- It is just as if I asked the honorable member for Indi to lend me a couple of shillings in order that I might buy him a drink. In the circumstances, the late Government acted most honestly, and I very much regret that the present Government were not equally honest. They should have told the Imperial Government that they had not the money to purchase a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to give them, and that they did not think the time had arrived to place additional burdens upon the people of Australia by borrowing £2,000,000 for the purpose. I regard the action of the Government as hypocritical, and the offer as one which ought never to have been made on behalf of the Commonwealth.

                    <para>Recent events have shown the necessity for the Empire to develop new centres of strength, and with this end in view My Advisers some time ago cabled to the British Government suggesting the advisability of a Conference of the self-governing Dominions of the Empire with the Government of the United Kingdom on the question of Naval Defence. A similar suggestion having been made by the Dominion of Canada, the British Government has now convened an Imperial Naval and Military Defence Conference, and has invited the Commonwealth to send representatives. The invitation has been accepted, and the Minister of Defence has been appointed as the representative of the Commonwealth. He will be accompanied by naval and military experts. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">This brings me to the appointment of the honorable member for Brisbane to represent the Government at the Conference. The military knowledge of the honorable member may be all that is desired; he has been connected with the military for a long time, and, so far as I know, is of high distinction in his rank. But I object to a representative who holds views totally opposite to those of the Government. If the Government have adopted the honorable member's views, why have they not the honesty to tell us so? </para><interjection>

                        <para>- That is, if the Government have any views at all beyond sitting on the Treasury bench ; I know that beyond that objective the Prime Minister has none. It is to be very much regretted that the Government should have made this appointment a party question, because, if there is a matter which should be dealt with, putting aside all party considerations, it is that of the defence of the country. I hope the time will never come when honorable members on this side of the House will make such a question a party one. </para>

I disapprove altogether of this being made a party question, but, on every possible occasion, the Government have sought to make it so, to such an extent that, at the last moment, after the members of the Government had been sworn in, they thought it necessary to placate the honorable member for Brisbane. That gentleman, as Honorary Minister, was sworn in at a later time in order that he might be appointed the representative of the Government at the Conference, and that was the only opportunity there was of assisting him in that particular direction. </para>

                    <para>As a contribution towards Imperial Naval Defence, and for the more effective Coastal Defence of' Australia, engagements have been entered into for the building of three modern torpedo boat destroyers, and you will be asked' to approve of a policy of naval construction for the building in Australia of similar vessels, as well as for the training of crews to man them. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">Every one will remember how those engagements were brought about. The Government previously led by the honorable member for Ballarat were very desirous that a Trust Fund should be established for promoting naval construction, and the House readily voted for the purpose the sum of  , £250,000.  The honorable gentleman has always talked about what he was going to do as regards coastal defence, and had a stiff backbone when he had a decent majority behind him. But on this question, how did he act? Did he act like a man who was sincere in his professions about securing the defence of this country? Did he act in a way which was likely to establish the naval policy which he described, in that famous speech extending over four hours and a half? Nothing of the kind. Although he had a quarter of a million pounds at his disposal to initiate a system of coastal defence, yet he had neither the courage nor the backbone to use it for that purpose. I offer my hearty congratulations to the members of the late Government for the action which they took. Knowing that the money had been voted for promoting coastal defence, they, like wise men, turned round and put forward a naval policy: In the first place, they decided that two boats should be built in England, and brought out; and that a third boat should be sent out in parts, to be put together here. They went farther than that. In order to encourage local industry, and to fill our industrial youth with enthusiasm, they selected in the different States a number of competent men to take part in the construction of the boats in England, and to return 'to Australia to assist, not only in assembling the imported parts, but in building other boats. The policy of the  late Government embraced the construction of nineteen boats in all - namely, two in England and seventeen in Australia. That would have meant a great deal to Australia and its workers, especially to iron workers, because docks and ship-building yards would have had to be established.I thoroughly approve of the statement of the late Prime Minister at Gympie that the time had arrived when we should have our own docks and ship-building yards. By that means we should be in a position to help the Mother Country to a far greater extent than we could by presenting her with a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> for the simple reason that she is not in a position to build vessels of that type at a faster rate than Germany. If that statement is true, and we had a dockyard in Victoria and in New South Wales capable of building <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts,</inline> we should be in a position to render valuable assistance to the Mother Country. If the time should ever arrive when the Old Country was in need of <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts,</inline> we could build two, probably more. If any country should outrun the standard set by the Imperial Government, we could immediately go to their rescue and undertake to build some <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts.</inline> That is the greatest assistance which we could render to the Old Country. I again offer my hearty congratulations to the late Government for the action they took. In my opinion, their policy in that regard was a good one. In spite of all the taunts and slurs which have been hurled by honorable members opposite at the proposed mosquito fleet, who have declared that it will not be worth anything so far as the defence of Australia is concerned, have not naval authorities in this community, as well as in other parts of the Empire, declared that it is one of the best forms of defence which could be adopted by Australia? The best way in which we can assist the Imperial Government to defend the Empire is by taking the necessary precautions for our own defence. In these circumstances I regret that the present Government have not taken a more definite stand. What is the proposal of its leader? It is merely to build three or four boats at the outside. The late Government were prepared to build nineteen boats, but the present Government seem to me to be all talk, and not to be prepared to do anything. Even when they had £250,000 in a Trust fund, with parliamentary authority to expend it in the construction of boats for naval defence, they had not the courage to act. It was left to the Labour Government to spend the money which Parliament had voted for a specific purpose. I think that they took a right course in carrying out their defence policy as far as they did. </para><para class="italic">

                    <para>My Advisers recognise that the effective defence of Australia requires a vast increase of the population, and that a comprehensive policy of immigration is urgently called for; but that this is impossible without" increasing the facilities for the settlement of a large population on the land. Deeming this matter to be one of extreme urgency, it is proposed to bring forward at the earliest possible date a measure providing for the progressive taxation of unimproved land values, which, while providing revenue, will, it is anticipated, lead to the subdivision of large estates and cause extensive areas to be thrown open to settlement, and so offer to immigrants those inducements which are necessary to attract them in large numbers. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">I shall not enlarge upon what I have already said on this question in dealing with land taxation, but I urgently appeal to the Government to take the earliest possible steps by the adoption of a system of land taxation- which I believe to be the only effective means to attain the end in view - for the settlement of a large population upon the lands of this country. By that means the lands now held by a few monopolists, who do not fully utilize them, might be settled by thousands of people. I heartily congratulate the late Government upon the action they proposed; to take in this connexion. From the expressions of opinion we have heard throughout the Commonwealth, I believe the time is not far distant when a land tax will be imposed for Commonwealth purposes. Some honorable members say that they thoroughly believe in land taxation, and that a land tax ought to be imposed at the earliest possible moment, but they go on to say that for the Commonwealth to impose it would be to interfere with the powers reserved to the States. They thus shelve the settlement of the question, and on the other hand the States Governments contend that for ordinary purposes sufficient revenue can be derived from Customs and Excise, and that if additional revenue is required, it is the Federal Government that should impose land taxation. Whilst the question is being bandied about between the Commonwealth and States Governments nothing is done. My own opinion is that if the Commonwealth </para><para class="block">Government do not take the question seriously in hand, the closer settlement of our sparsely populated areas will never take place. Apart from all party considerations, I think it is the duty of the Federal Government to take action in the matter, and I again congratulate the late Government on having proposed to do so. We know that it was the one proposal that they submitted which brought about their defeat, owing to the fact that financial institutions that have been so largely involved in land transactions in this country, and others whose vested interests were assailed, brought pressure to bear upon honorable members now forming the Government party to sink their opinions in order to stave off the proposed land taxation. But just so surely as we are here this evening the time will come when land taxation will be imposed, despite any fusion of political parties, or any attempt to coerce Parliament by the financial institutions. Paragraph 16 of the speech refers to the Northern Territory, and I have already made some references to the proposed transfer of that Territory to the Commonwealth. I am reminded by the honorable member for Grey that the Northern Territory embraces an area of  335,000,000  acres, and though we are aware that it possesses magnificent resources, it is idle to talk of its development unless we are prepared to undertake the expenditure of very large sums of money. There is a portion of country fronting the Gulf of Carpentaria which is practically unknown to many Australians, and I make bold to say that in that tract of country, there is a new province yet to be added to the Commonwealth. I take the country from the Batavia River, which runs from about  150  miles inland into the Gulf of Carpentaria, down to the Barkly tableland, extending from Camooweal for about  300  miles, into the Northern Territory. That tableland is the principal watershed of a number of rivers running into the Gulf, such as the Roper and Macarthur in the Northern Territory, and on the Queensland side the Albert, Leichhardt, and several others. These are perennial streams, carrying large bodies of water, and the magnificent flats to be found along those rivers are capable of carrying a large population. I regret very much that honorable members generally have not had an opportunity of seeing that magnificent country, and of judging its capabilities for themselves. I feel sure that if they saw it they would realize, as I do, that it represents practically a new and valuable province for the Commonwealth. But I repeat that we cannot expect to develop that territory without the expenditure of a very considerable sum of money. The sooner that is realized the better. Judging from what we have seen in the press, the Prime Minister intends to ask the House to confirm an agreement for the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth; but it is useless for us to consent to that transfer unless we are prepared to develop the Territory. I personally regret that Papua is not being developed as I should like to see it developed, and if we are to take the same course with the Northern Territory, all talk about locking the back door of Australia against the invasion of Asiatic hordes is only so much sham and hypocrisy. Unless we are prepared to face the very considerable expenditure which will be involved in the proper development of the Northern Territory, we should not take it over from South Australia. Where is the money which will be required for its development to come from? </para><interjection>

But it now transpires that the territory which Parliament selected is not so suitable for the purposes of a Federal Capital as we thought it was. The surveyor who was deputed to make the necessary surveys, has reported that the only water supply obtainable in that territory would be by means of a costly pumping scheme, and that it would then only be sufficient to generate electricity to the extent of some 3,000 or 4,000 horsepower. If that be so, the time has arrived when we ought to reconsider our decision in this matter. I regret very much that the surveyor has reported adversely to our preconceived ideas in this connexion.

                    <para>A measure providing for the appointment of a High Commissioner, urgent on many grounds, will be submitted for your consideration. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">We all know that a Bill of this kind has been talked over ever since the establishment of the Commonwealth. It has been promised by successive Governments, whether for the purpose of placating supporters or not, I do not know. I should, however, like to know what is going to be done in this matter, and who is to receive the appointment. Quite recently, I read a report in one of the newspapers to the effect that the Fisher Government had considered the advisability of granting the High Commissioner emoluments to the tune of £10,000 annually. I have consulted various members of the late Government upon this point, and every one of them has assured me that he had never previously heard the matter mentioned. Yet, the press endeavoured to buttress the suggested payment of £10,000 annually to the High Commissioner, by alleging that that was the sum which the Labour Government approved of giving to the occupant of that distinguished office. Various journals advocate the granting of a salary of  £5,000  to the High Commissioner with very liberal allowances - allowances which would practically total another  £5,000.  Where is all this money to come from? Before we are asked to vote such a large sum, we should know who is to receive the appointment. The names of several honorable members have been mentioned in this connexion. I recognise the qualifications of some of them ; but I hope that none of the remainder will ever have an opportunity of representing Australia in the Old Country. The right honorable member for East Sydney has been spoken of as the first High Commissioner ; and, while I do not agree with him politically, I must admit that his qualifications are a long way ahead of those of any other person whose name has been mentioned. Whether or not he will be selected for the office, I do not know. This reference leads me naturally to a practice affecting the composition of Governments in this Parliament which I cannot regard as other than a serious violation of the Constitution. When the first Commonwealth Government was established, it contained seven Cabinet Ministers. A little later, an additional Minister was added. Then, only a session ago, we witnessed the remarkable spectacle of the present Prime Minister appointing the GovernmentWhip as Secretary to the Cabinet. I do not know exactly what was meant by that office, but certainly the idea prompting its creation was to confer upon the Government Whip, official rank. In order to obtain a majority, the present Government have found it necessary to add two more Honorary Ministers to its ranks. If this sort of thing is to continue, why should there not be ten Honorary Ministers, if the adoption of that course be necessary to placate its supporters? </para><interjection>

Let me tell the honorable member that the gentleman who now holds the position referred to in Papua was not a member of Parliament when appointed; he was never a member of the Labour Party, and it was not the Labour Government that appointed him. He was a member of the Deakin party, of which the honorable member for Hunter is a supporter at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- Another measure that has been before Parliament for a considerable time is the Navigation Bill. The country was put to considerable expense in the appointment of a <inline font-style="italic">Royal</inline> Commission to collect evidence on the subject, and furnished Parliament with a very valuable document. But now we find that the measure has been hung up. I trust, however, that at the earliest opportunity it will be passed. It is another measure that the Labour Ministry attempted to push forward, and which the present Government have refused to have anything at all to do with. While the late Government were in office they did very good work in the interests of the Commonwealth. It is a very pleasant thing for me as a member of the Labour Party to be able to stand here and say that we had a Government in office which, during its six or seven months of administrative life, carried out a policy which has not been the subject of a single indictment from the other side. Honorable members opposite have not ventured to say that they dissent from the administrative acts of the late Government. I congratulate the members of the Labour Government upon occupying such an unique position that neither their policy has been assailed, nor their administration attacked. </para>

                        <para>- The expenditure of the£250,000 was one of the very best things that the Labour Government did. I like to reply to intelligent interjections, and let me tell the honorable member for Hunter that when he makes the bold statement that the administration of the late Government was "rotten," I can only reply that he does not know what he is talking about. If he knows that the administration was rotten, he is failing in his duty as a member of this House in not showing the rottenness. . Either he has not sufficient intelligence to show that the administration was rotten, or else the statement is a mere bald one not worth taking notice of. The expenditure' of the £250,000 was, as I have said, one of the best things that the Labour Government did, and the reason why honorable members opposite are crying out about it is that the Government which they support did not have the opportunity of spending the money. Why did not the Deakin Government spend it? Because the present Prime Minister had not the courage. Honorable members like the honorable member for Hunter and the honorable member for Echuca never lost an opportunity of taunting the present Prime Minister with his want of backbone. The honorable member for Indi used to taunt the honorable member for Ballarat with want of courage and backbone; but now both he and the honorable member for Echuca sit behind that honorable gentleman, and do exactly what they are told by him to do. </para>

Those who are afraid to go to the country are the Ministerial supporters. What has brought, about this coalition? Is not the reason given by the Prime Minister the statement that the Labour Party is opposing the reelection of himself and his followers? He has gone round the country saying that the Labour Party is organizing to win his seat and the seats of those behind him. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Nothing would suit me and Labour members generally better than to go to the country at once. The honorable member for Indi does not wish for a general election, because he knows that this is the first and only Federal Parliament in which he will hold a seat. The relations between the parties to this fusion, which is said to be such a happy one, are rather peculiar. It is difficult to imagine the honorable member for Batman hanging round the neck of the honorable member for Parkes. Indeed, the members of the late Deakin Party are ashamed to enter the room where the other "fusion" members meet, and are trying to annex the old room held by the now defunct Liberal Party. Is this because they are preparing themselves for another somersault, or another desertion ? I should not be surprised at hearing of the leader of the Government preparing to desert any one at any time. He deserted the Reid-McLean Ministry, and tried to make out that the right honorable member for East Sydney told an untruth in connexion with his action, although he came into the Chamber with a certain motion in his pocket. The country ought to know these things. As I have already said, I am not angry at the present state of affairs. Our party has great reason to be proud of the fact that its growing strength has compelled members of other parties to sink the principles of a lifetime in order to obtain a coalition which may hinder our progress. Honorable members opposite, however, have no hope of stopping our progress. It is the knowledge of this that has caused so much alarm, not only on their part, but amongst the capitalistic section of the community. </para>

                        <para>- that is true. I was among the number, but got left. I did not, however, cry about it. May I ask why the honorable member for Laanecoorie refuses to make use of the Coalition Party's room - why he desires to use the little room in the corner? Is the honorable member ashamed of the Coalition Party ? I should like to say, in conclusion, that when I entered the House this afternoon I had not the slightest intention of speaking. I should not have risen, but for the contemptible action of the Prime Minister- </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw it, sir, and regret having used it. I repeat that I should not have spoken this afternoon, but for the attempt of the Prime Minister to stifle discussion. True, that attempt did not succeed, but I cannot exonerate him from the effort to stifle discussion. The business of the House will not be facilitated by such tactics. </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, I have never heard such an intention mentioned by our party. It was purely because of the action of the Prime Minister in trying to shuffle out of doing something that ought to have been done that I rose to speak this afternoon. He knows that it has been the custom under similar circumstances to allow a full discussion of a Ministerial statement. When he came into office, on the second occasion, he laid on the table of the House a certain paper, and having made a statement, invited the fullest discussion. That course was also pursued by the late Prime Minister, and by the honorable member for South Sydney when his Administration came into office. The honorable member for East Sydney also afforded ample opportunity for full discussion on the programme submitted by his Ministry. The leader of the present Government, however, tried to prevent discussion. I am pleased to say that he did not succeed. </para>

I have been speaking since the debate on the motion for the Address-in-Reply was resumed this afternoon, so that it was impossible for me to know what was being done. I know that nothing was done in caucus this morning. </para>
