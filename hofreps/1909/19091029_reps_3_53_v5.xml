                        <para>- Some time ago a scale of rates was fixed by me after a  consultation with the officers of the Department, and information had been obtained from the municipal authorities. I have since received a communication from representatives of the trades concerned, intimating that in certain particulars these rales are lower than those fixed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cussen. I agreed to receive a deputation on the subject last Thursday, but those concerned were not &#39; then ready to proceed with their complaint, so I have promised to receive a deputation next Thursday. </para>

                        <para>- In reviewing the history of the regulations, I informed a deputation which waited upon me yesterday that the honorable member, in arranging for the general imposition of toll rates, and increasing those rates, had provided that any subscriber to a telephone exchange who paid the rate prescribed by Regulation 7a in his list, might place his telephone at the service of the public. Regulation 57 - that complained of by the deputation - says that a subscriber may provide and exhibit a plain and legible notice in a prominent position on his premises, indicating that a telephone is there available for public use, but no such notice or sign is to be exhibited on or about the- premises of any hotel, or other place licensed for the sale of intoxicating beverages. I informed the deputation that when I came into office I had occasion to review the honorable member&#39;s proposal to increase the telephone rates, and to make the toll system universal, and advised that the regulations which he had framed should be suspended pending the final determination of the matter. The suspension of those regulations included the suspension of tha*, referred to by him ig his question. </para>

                            <para>- The two matters referred to are quite distinct. The duties on dress goods were deliberately fixed by this Parliament. The allegation is that they are too high, though the protection to the&#39; manufacturer remains as fixed by the preceding Tariff. As to alleged dumping of goods, any case brought under notice which infringes existing laws will be promptly dealt with. The probable time for dealing with actual anomalies cannot  be fixed. These cannot be dealt with singly. They are now being collected for Ministerial consideration. I should like to add that the honorable member, before rising, drew my attention to a statement which has been made as to the Japanese now in Australia, it toeing alleged that they number 73,000. Inasmuch as we had only 47,000 coloured aliens at the taking of the last census, of whom a large part were Chinese, while returns compiled since show that the number is gradually decreasing, it would be impossible to sustain the estimate referred to. </para>

If any honorable member, in his private capacity, desires to attend the Melbourne Cup meeting, he  is quite at liberty to do so. But I say that the National Parliament ought not to have anything to do with a racing carnival. The honorable member for Melbourne has asked, &#34; What about the officers of Parliament?&#34; I have been informed by a friend who will attend the Melbourne Cup race meeting that it would be a very difficult thing to see that race run, and to reach the House by half -past 4 o&#39;clock on Tuesday afternoon. If that be so, the officers of the House, about whom the honorable member for Melbourne is so anxious, could not possibly attend that gathering. </para>

If the Minister of Defence were Leader of the Opposition, I am satisfied that he would be found objecting to the motion.

                            <para>- I can only answer for myself. To carry my own sins is quite a sufficient burden. If the motion be carried, I shall be present at half-past 4 o&#39;clock on Tuesday afternoon, but after that hour 1 shall not enter the chamber at any time to form a quorum. I do not think it is fair to those honorable members who are prepared to attend at that hour that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> - should a quorum not then be present - should be empowered to take the chair at any time that a quorum may put in an appearance. Neither is it fair to the officers of the House. . If we do not meet at 3 o&#39;clock on Tuesday afternoon, the hour of meeting should be definitely fixed for half-past 4 o&#39;clock and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> should not be authorized to take the chair at any time that a quorum may be present. If the motion be not carried, I take it that the House will meet as usual at 3 o&#39;clock on Tuesday afternoon. I repeat that it is not right that the National Parliament should adjourn because a racing carnival is in progress. </para>

                        <para>.- I did not hear the Prime Minister make reference, when moving the motion, to any racing carnival. He simply explained that a certain number of honorable members were away at Oodnadatta, and that there might possibly be a difficulty in securing a quorum at 3 o&#39;clock on Tuesday afternoon. The honorable member for Barrier opposes the motion on the ground that its object is to enable certain honorable members to attend a race meeting. I do not know whether that is so or not. I do not pretend to be an authority on those matters, but I am prepared to be here at 3 o&#39;clock on Tuesday. When the honorable member was asked by interjection if he would be present to help to form a quorum at that hour, he replied &#34; No, certainly not, it was not his business to assist the Government to form a quorum.&#34; I was glad to notice that he afterwards repented of that statement, and said he would be here. If he and other members of his party are present, it will be a new experience both for him and them to be here when the House meets. Our experience, day after day, has been that the Opposition have been conspicuous by their, absence at the ordinary meeting time. The honorable member, and a number of other honorable members on the same side,.  are scarcely ever present when prayers are being read.  .1  do not know whether that is because there is anything in the prayers to which they object, but with the exception of one or two who stroll in just to save their face, the Opposition, including the honorable member for Barrier, absent themselves in a body while they are being read. In the face of that fact, the new born zeal which the honorable member has pretended to display to-day, for the House to meet at the usual time on Tuesday, and for punctuality in the attendance of other honorable members, is very refreshing. Will the honorable member undertake to be here at  3  o&#39;clock on Tuesday, and also to secure the attendance of other honorable members on that side? </para>

The matter rests entirely with those honorable members themselves. If they are willing to attend, business can be proceeded with. The object of the motion is as much as anything to meet their convenience, because it is known that some of them will be the principal offenders in not being present at  3  o&#39;clock on Tuesday. I object to the honorable member for Barrier attempting to make a little political capital for himself and his party out of the motion, at the expense of those on this side of the chamber. </para>

                        <para>- Order ! I must again appeal to honorable members to preserve order. I am endeavouring to conduct the proceedings with as much patience as possible, but it is exceedingly distressing to have to continually call honorable members to order. Every honorable member knows that an honorable member who is addressing the House is entitled, so long as he is in order, to be heard without interruption.  .1  trust that I shall not be compelled to exercise powers which are inherent in the Chair in order to secure a hearing to any honorable member. I hope honorable members will assist me to insure that this question shall be debated quietly and calmly. </para>

                            <para>- If you, sir, say that the interrogative form is not to be used, I shall not use it, but it is commonly employed in this and other Parliaments, and by no one more frequently than the honorable member who raised the point of order. A rhetorical question of that sort is not expected to elicit a direct reply, but any honorable member who desires to do so can rise later and give an answer. It is fair to ask honorable members opposite, as they are so punctilious about the meeting of the House on Tuesday, how it is . that, day after day, they make a regular practice of not attending the House at the usual time of meeting. They slip in one after the other after prayers have been read, and fire a lot of questions off at Ministers. If they are so particular about honorable members being present at  3  o&#39;clock on Tuesday, it is only reasonable to ask them to assist the Government to make a House on that day for the purpose of carrying on the business of the National Parliament. Let the honorable member for Barrier show his sincerity in this regard by not only putting in an appearance himself at  3  o&#39;clock, but also seeing that his colleagues, who are- paid to do this work, attend to do the business of the House, instead of going to the Melbourne Cup. If he will undertake to assist the Government in that way, I think I can fairly promise that the Government can meet the House at  3  o&#39;clock on Tuesday, - and that there will be a sufficient number of honorable members on- this side, with the assistance of honorable members opposite, to form a quorum. </para>

                            <para>- If, sir, there is anything objectionable to you in that remark, I am prepared to withdraw it with a heart and a half, but the honorable member for Lang is misconstruing it. Unfortunately, according to our Standing Orders, even if there were only three members present, as happened in the House of Lords on one occasion, you could not become officially cognisant of the fact unless your attention was drawn to it by a member of the House. I am going to throw out a challenge to the honorable member for Barrier. If the honorable member is really in earnest in regard to the course that he intends to pursue,- then it will be his duty, if there is not a quorum present on Tuesday afternoon, to call attention to the fact. Some remarks made by the honorable member for Lang in reference to the prayers were not justifiable. I confess that in my school days I used to dodge prayers, but I was younger then : and the observations of the honorable member for Lang were not quite fair to a man like the honorable member for Barrier, whose sincerity in his religious beliefs no one doubts. In London alone there are  450  registered religions, and the adherents of each think that the remaining  449  are wrong, in some way or other. It would be better for honorable members to show a little more humanity in pointing their arguments. Those who are at all familial with horse-racing know that many men, including some owners of race-horses, who attend race meetings, never make a bet. I have seen races run, not for any prize, but for sheer love of the &#38;port, and I do not think that racing necessarily depends upon betting. The totalizator reduces betting, but it has not had the effect of reducing horse-racing. I do not wish to move an amendment, but I should like the Prime Minister to agree to the adjournment of the House until  7.30  p.m. on Tuesday next. That would give perfect freedom for the day to the officers of the House, and there would be no doubt as to their attendance here being required during the afternoon.  I  should like to go to Flemington, but it is very improbable that  1  shall be there. Let us display some common-sense in dealing with a matter of this kind. A number of honorable members, the majority of whom a members of the Labour party, left yester-day to inspect the railway to Oodnadatta, which is to link the north with the south ; and, after all, what will be the loss of one afternoon in a session of so many days ? If the Prime Minister . would amend his motion in the way I have suggested he would remove a difficulty. We should have a common-sense adjournment, not for an hour and a half, but until  7.30  p.m. At that hour there would be a good attendance, and we should be able to take up and push on with our work. </para>

                        <para>. - The suggestion just made by the honorable member for Melbourne is a very good one. If some honorable members, like the honorable member for Barrier and a few others who pose as being particularly good, were to attend Flemington on the occasion of a race meeting, and see for themselves the way in which the proceedings are conducted, they would be agreeably surprised. The behaviour of the people on the course would be in the nature of a revelation to them. On Cup Day there are from  100,000  to  120,000  people on the Flemington race-course, and during the whole day not one intoxicated man is to be found there. That in itself speaks well for the orderly conduct of the people of Australia. It shows that at a gathering which is considered by many to have a bad influence on the community, the people can enjoy themselves rationally. </para>

                            <para>- No; I simply support the suggestion made by the honorable member for Melbourne, that we should adjourn until  7.30  on Tuesday evening. Great difficulty will be experienced in obtaining a quorum at  4.30  p.m., and if the Prime Minister&#39;s proposal is carried, the officers of the House will be obliged to remain in attendance here during the whole day, when other members of the Public Service will be enjoying a holiday, whether they go to the races or not. How would the honorable member for Barrier feel if he were an officer of this House, and knew that while he had to remain on duty every public officer outside the House staff had a holiday, and was free to go down the Bay or to Flemington, or anywhere that he pleased ? </para>

                        <para>. - I did not hear the arguments advanced by the Prime Minister, nor the major portion of the reply made by the honorable member for Barrier. I understand, however, that in the face of a business paper phenomenally long, comprising matters of fundamental importance, it is proposed to waste several very valuable hours in order that honorable members may see a horse-race. We are on the eve of a. general election, and the honorable member for Lang, who is being pursued by a Presbyterian clergyman, finds himself in a very awkward position. He wants to have a holiday - although I do not suppose he knows a horse from a camel - but he does not like to run the risk of losing any votes in his electorate by patronizing a race meeting. </para>

                            <para>- There would be some sense in a proposition of that kind. Either we are coming here on Tuesday afternoon to do what we are paid for, or we are not. If we are not, why all this pretence? I shall be here as usual at  3  o&#39;clock on Tuesday afternoon, and if the House does not meet at that hour, I shall not be back again until  7.45  p.m. I am not going to apply to my soul such a wretched ointment as the Government offer. Every honorable member who votes for the adjournment of the House until  4.30  p.m. on Tuesday will pray to his particular God that no one will be here at that hour to carry out the business of the House. The Prime Minister stands midway between the sinners and the saints. He does not bother very much about horse-racing, but he is surrounded by a number of honorable members who think of nothing else. They are unable at this season of the year to speak rationally on any subject bar horses and horse-racing. When one is in the lift, one hears them asking, &#34; What do you think of so and so?&#34; I heard an honorable member opposite, while in the lift last night, talking to another member of the Ministry about horses. One would imagine that nothing in this wide world mattered save which horse was going to win the Melbourne Cup. I do not take any exception to that, but if that is the temper of honorable members, we might as well adjourn until a quarter to 8 o&#39;clock, because those members will not be here at half-past  4  o&#39;clock. Once a man goes to the Flemington race-course, he will not tear himself away from what is going on there to get back here at half-past  4  o&#39;clock. A. man like the Prime Minister, who lives a detached life, and does not bother about horses, might do so; but the average member of Parliament would be unable to do so. I shall be here at  3  o&#39;clock, and the honorable member for Barrier says that he will be here also, though I do not answer for the honorable member. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie takes a view of this question which differs from that of the honorable member for Barrier, and he probably will riot be here. I shall be prepared, in the honorable member&#39;s absence, to do what I can to present his views to the House, and may, if necessary, prolong my remarks until the honorable member can get here and speak for himself. I shall vote against an adjournment until half-past 4 o&#39;clock. I am in favour of meeting at 3 o&#39;clock, in the usual way, but I shall be prepared to consider very favorably a proposal that we should not meet on Tuesday until a quarter to 8 o&#39;clock in the evening. </para>

                        WILLIS (Robertson; &#91;11.14&#93;. - I believe that the motion submitted by the Prime Minister should be accepted. If there is a quorum present at half-past 4 o&#39;clock on Tuesday, we can go on with the business of the country, and if there is not a quorum present at that hour,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                        can delay taking the chair until there is a quorum. I think the motion proposes a great improvement upon previous, arrangements made for the meeting of the House on Cup Day. I have known the House, on former occasions, to meet at the ordinary time, and I have also known its meeting, though fixed for the ordinary time, should a quorum be present, to be delayed until a quorum arrived. Honorable members opposite did not appear very anxious to form a quorum for the meeting of the House to-day, and it is for themselves to determine whether they will be present at half-past 4 o&#39;clock on Tuesday next. The Prime Minister has adopted the right course. The honorable gentleman knows, as does every other member of the House, that Cup Day in Melbourne is regarded as a national holiday. No fewer than .120,000 people may be seen on the Flemington race-course on Cup Day, and the sight is a magnificent one. My children are not yet. old enough to go to the race-course, but as soon as they are I shall be glad to take them to see the great concourse of human beings who assemble there on Cup Day. I have been there frequently myself. I have no intention at present to go to the course next week. I do not appear to have the betting instinct, but I do admire magnificent horses ; and the race meetings held throughout Australia, and especially that held in connexion with the Melbourne Cup, have done much to encourage the breeding of high-class blood stock. As a result, Australia stands head and shoulders over the great South American Republic of the Argentine in the raising of fine horses, and over&#39; the Republic of Chili, from which country we imported horses in the early days, and in so doing almost ruined our stock. The Melbourne Cup race is .1 great carnival, and is the means of bringing together the finest blood stock in the world. I am given to understand that even betting men get a fair run for their money in the Melbourne Cup. It is a fair race, in which every horse runs to win, and every man who takes an interest in fair horse-racing should make it his business to witness it. I did not hear the honorable member for Barrier say anything against going to races. Many thousands go who do not believe in horse-racing. Cup Day is acknowledged as a great carnival day, and I know that twenty years ago the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association held a great picnic on that day. Young nien were attracted from all parts of Australia by the knowledge that it was gala time in Melbourne. I do not know that they went to the race-course, but man; people who are religiously inclined, and are against betting, hold their picnics on the Flemington ground, on a place which, I believe, is known as the &#34; flat.&#34; I have been upon the flat myself, where all sorts and conditions of men are to be found, and I shall have no objection to going there on some future occasion. I am not aware whether it is necessary to pay a shilling to go on the flat, or whether one can go there for nothing.

                        <para>- Then probably that is where I shall be. This goes to show that I have no prejudice. <inline font-style="italic">En passant,</inline> I may say that I lived for five years next to the Randwick race-course, and did not attend the races held there once during that time. I had opportunities of seeing the horses when they were being trained and exercised. A person who lives at Randwick does not require to go on to the race-course to see the best stock in the world. I may mention that for some years I represented the municipality of Randwick in its Council. In this House the locality is known as Wentworth. The honorable member for Wentworth is merely my successor. Needless to say, I retired, and the honorable member had an open field. I have no prejudice against horse-racing, and think that the Prime Minister has done the right thing in submitting his motion in the form in which  it is before us. For my own part, I shall be here at ha If -past 4 o&#39;clock on Tuesday. I do not say that I shall not be at the race meeting, though I have made no arrangements to go. I shall, however, certainly be in attendance to assist in making a House. </para>

                        <para>. - lt may be a misfortune for me, but still it is a fact that I take the duties of a member of Parliament seriously. I am here as a trustee for1 the people. I contend that it is our duty, as members of Parliament, to pay you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> at least as much respect as we expect children to pay to us as their seniors. We should also set an example to the people of Australia in regard to the dignity of &#34;our proceedings, and our respect and courtesy towards one another. When I first came here, I was imbued with a sense of responsibility, realizing that I belonged to the National Parliament. Holding such views, I am rather surprised that such a motion as this should have been submitted. Private members&#39; business  has been set on one side in order to enable public business to be despatched. 1 have nothing to say as to what is to take place in the city of Melbourne next week, but we have the business of the people- of Australia to transact. There are twenty items of business upon the notice-paper, irrespective of the questions standing in the names of private members. We should endeavour to utilize every hour that is available in giving to that business the consideration that it deserves, until the end of the session. In my opinion, to adjourn for an hour, or an hour and a half, on account of a race meeting should be beneath the dignity of the National Parliament of Australia. </para>

If the motion be agreed to, it means that I, with others, shall have to come from New South Wales in time to do business when the House meets on Tuesday. If there is not a quorum present, we shall have to mope about in idleness. I claim no special virtue because I do not like horse-racing. </para>

It is very seldom that I am able to get home at the week-ends, and an extra day to enable me to do so would be very welcome. The honorable member for Lang had the audacity to say that he did not know this motion was for the express purpose of allowing certain honorable members to see the Melbourne Cup; and the Prime Minister told us that the special adjournment is proposed because a visit of inspection is being paid to Oodnadatta. </para>

                            <para>- It is not quite true, and&#39; it is not honest to give that as the reason. It is well known that the honorable members who are visiting Oodnadatta cannot return to Melbourne until Wednesday j and why humbug the people by arranging for a meeting on Tuesday? I suppose the picture on the Flemington lawn would not be quite complete without the Treasurer, in all his pomp and glory. I notice the change in the attitude of the honorable member for Robertson. Yesterday he was a severe critic of the Government, but, after the threat this morning by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that he shall have opposition at the polls, he is quite a friend of the present Administration. </para>

                            <para>- It is only another exhibition of the honorable member&#39;s versatility ; and it is quite apparent that he will be able to vote against the financial proposals, provided he votes for this motion and enables the Treasurer to go to the Cup carnival. The honorable member for Lang made some reference to the non-attendance of honorable members on this side at prayers ; but we know that when the honorable member himself sat in Opposition, he, time after time, deliberately stayed outside the door until prayers were read. The honorable member desires to convey the impression to the public that the absence or presence of members indicates that they are favorable or otherwise to the reading of prayers; but such an impression would be absolutely incorrect, and the suggestion of the honorable member is a contemptible one. Now that the general election is at hand, the honorable member for Lang and others like himself are attitudinizing ; and that is not surprising, considering that they do not come here because of any political programme, but are elected on the _ sectarian issue. As a matter of fact, this is only another attempt to raise that miserable issue, which has really nothing to do with Federal politics. I have no doubt that the honorable member will shortly come to the conclusion that all who absent themselves from prayers are absolute atheists, and, therefore, object to the Lord&#39;s Prayer being read. I am sorry that the Standing Orders will not permit me to apply the  most appropriate term to the attitude of the honorable member. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the constituency of Lang is fast awakening to the fact that it has a representative who simply attudinizes in a theatrical fashion, and that there is absolutely no sincerity behind his cant, humbug, and sectarianism. I assert most emphatically that he knows that the reason for the submission of this motion is that the Melbourne Cup race is to be run on Tuesday afternoon. It has been stated that if certain honorable members were not absent on a visit to Oodnadatta it would not have- been moved. Why was not a similar motion submitted yesterday when it was known that they would be absent to-day? </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Certain honorable members left Melbourne yesterday afternoon for Oodnadatta, and yet the House met at half-past 10 o&#39;clock this morning. Surely that is a complete answer to the attitude of the honorable member for Lang and the Prime Minister. The other event which is to happen on Tuesday is the running of the Melbourne Cup race, and therefore the Prime Minister, in order to enable certain colleagues to witness that event, submitted this motion, with the object that the House shall meet at any time when the  Speaker  may choose to take the chair. I object to being asked to travel 600 or 700 miles on the off-chance of the House meeting on Tuesday afternoon. It is a great mistake that the national interests of Australia should be subordinated to a horse-race. It is a farcical attitude which the Prime Minister has taken up. In various electorates he has pointed out that people do not take an interest in the exercise of the franchise, and that only a certain percentage of the electors vote. That is the cry of nearly every public man. Ministers of religion are continually telling us that one of the madnesses of our young people is their undue addiction to sport. </para>

I desire to enter a serious protest against the subordination of business which has been stated by the Prime Minister to be urgent and necessary, as affecting the interests of the whole people, to the pleasure of a comparatively few members who desire a holiday on Tuesday afternoon, in order to see the Melbourne Cup race. I have pointed out that honorable members on the other side, as well as elsewhere, are continually railing at those who take a great interest in sport. They have told us that if the Prime Minister were to deliver a serious address on some great national issue comparatively few persons would be present, whereas, if a sports carnival were held, the multitude in attendance would be almost countless. Instead of the National Parliament making a. stand in this matter, and giving a lead to the people, it is simply pandering to some of those elements in the community which I am sure it will be admitted are not the best.

                            <para>- The motion before the House is humbug on the part of the Prime Minister. It is humbug to tell the House that it is necessary to pass the motion because certain honorable members have proceeded on a visit to Oodnadatta. If that was the real reason for the submission of the proposal, why did he not submit a similar motion last night with regard to the present sitting? He did nothing of the kind. It is  not  the absence of certain honorable members at Oodnadatta which makes the submission of this motion necessary, but the fact that the Melbourne Cup race is to be run on Tuesday afternoon. If the Prime Minister is prepared to subordinate the work of the National Parliament to the desire of certain honorable members to seek pleasure at Flemington race-course, then those who would rather have a day&#39;s pleasure in their homes should be  convenienced  as well as the others. I am prepared to go home, but I am not prepared to be absent from my place on Tuesday _ afternoon if any business is to be sprung upon the House. 1 hope that the amendment will be carried. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so, and therefore that is all the more reason why I should take advantage of this opportunity to speak my mind. I have the occupants of the Treasury bench pulling at my coat tails, and asking me not to say anything to delay the business of the House, but that will not prevent me from saying what I have to say. I am not deceived bv the cheers which come from those who sit on the other side. I have their measure; .1 know exactly who and what they are. What I object to is this cant and humbug. I have represented to the best of my ability men whom I am proud to represent. I feel sure that if I required a holiday, none of them would offer an objection, and, what is more, very few of them would object to me going to see the Melbourne Cup race run. Why? If we wish to help the poor and the suffering in my electorate, if we wish to help the class which the so-called Labour mcn in the House are supposed to represent, what do we do? We get up a race meeting. </para>

                            <para>- In Melbourne, Cup Day is almost a national fete. Certainly, it is a great festival in Victoria. Is it not ridiculous and Pecksniffian for this House to sit all through a bright summer&#39;s day when the Melbourne Cup is being run? It is rather fortunate that the debate is taking place at this moment, because it furnishes a grand argument in favour of our establishing, as soon as we can, a city of our own, where we shall be able to regulate such things as we desire. But for a man like the honorable member for Barrier to take advantage of this question to elevate himself in the eyes of his electorate is not right. He quoted from a religious newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Spectator,</inline> to show what a good, honest, and upright man he is. I cannot believe that he is genuine. I always endeavour to get here to hear prayers read at the beginning of the sitting, but this morning I saw the honorable member for Barrier walk in after prayers had been read. Is that propel conduct for a member of a religious sect? Certainly not. I express my utmost contempt for men such as he. I am glad of the opportunity to say this : Should Cup Day be fine, and I feel that I need a holiday, I shall not hesitate to go to the races. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that some heat has been generated by this discussion. Cup Day is a great national holiday in Melbourne. I heard of the Melbourne Cup in America before I knew exactly where Australia was. We who believe in extending to others the liberty which we ask for ourselves do not object to church picnics. </para>

                            <para>- To-morrow is Derby Day, and to-morrow night many men will be poorer, while others will be richer. But this Parliament is the guest <inline font-style="italic">ot</inline> Victoria. The people of the State have  lent us these buildings, so that we may meet here to legislate for the whole Commonwealth. During the past ten years we have been violating the sacred usages and customs of Victoria by our hypocrisy in refusing to adjourn ana take part in the State holiday. I say that those who wish to go to church picnics should be allowed to do so, and that those who wish to take their wives and children to the mountains should be permitted to go there. If I wish to see the races, I shall go to Flemington. No smug hypocrisy will prevent me from enjoying myself in a Christian way. There will be as good and as honest Christians at the Derby to-morrow, and at the Cup on Tuesday, as are to be found on the face of this earth. People have come from the remote parts of the Commonwealth to meet their relatives and friends, and to shake hands on the lawn, or hill, or flat. More real Christianity is to be found at Flemington than exists in lots of the establishments where they backbite and slander each other. I do not interfere with any one, but I maintain my right to go to the Cup if I choose to do so. </para>

When Wolfe climbed the heights of Abraham, and defeated Montcalm, it was John Bull&#39;s racing and gambling spirit that gave him the victory. The Britisher is deteriorating since he became smug and hypocritical. </para>

I am now speaking to the main question If the motion be carried, the messengers of the House, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and the Clerks, as well as you, sir, and myself, will be compelled - should a quorum not be present at 4.30 o&#39;clock on Tuesday afternoon - to remain within the precincts of the building until a quorum is formed. Other honorable members may absent themselves for purposes of enjoyment - the honorable member for Barrier may attend a Sunday-school picnic if he chooses - but all the officers of the House will be compelled to be in attendance here. Under these circumstances, I suggest that we should fix the hour of meeting on Tuesday at a quarter to  8  o&#39;clock in the evening, and I move accordingly. Had that been done in the first instance, all this debate would have been obviated. </para>

I ask all honorable members to assist the Chair in maintaining due decorum, to remember where we are, and to reflect that all our actions are governed by Standing Orders and Parliamentary practice. I would point out that if the Chair is only given an opportunity, the Chair will see that equal justice is meted out to all. I shall now proceed to put the question. </para>

The honorable member for Kennedy spoke to the original motion, and, as you are aware, the Prime Minister then submitted a further motion &#34; That the question be now put.&#34; I submit that that is the question which you now have to put to the House, and not the original motion that appears on the notice-paper. </para>

I took it that he was merely making a suggestion, and I was prepared to hear the Prime Minister at 11&#93;Y time put in a claim in the ordinary way that the original question should be put. In these circumstances, I feel that I cannot do other than abide by the practice which obtains in the House of Commons. </para>

I object to my intention being misinterpreted, because of any words that I may have used. It is quite common for an honorable member in this House to rise as I did, and to say &#34; I have a suggestion to make.&#34; When honorable members started to question my right to speak, I pointed out my position, and the Prime Minister said &#34; Hear, hear,&#34; and nodded, as if to say &#34; We know you are in order.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I am telling you, sir, what I did. I do not know what may be in your mind, but I am simply relating facts. I rose immediately the question was put, and, without any point of order being raised, you called upon me as the honorable member for Kennedy, and I began to address myself to the motion. It is true that I said that I had a suggestion to make, but no words are more commonly used in this House. Honorable members frequently make use of such a phrase in submitting all kinds of motions. I got up deliberately to move an amendment, which I did move, and it was after I had sat down that the Prime Minister moved &#34; That the question be now put.&#34; I merely wish to say that when I rose I did so deliberately, knowing that I had a right to do so at that particular stage of the proceedings, and I made my speech in the ordinary way, and not as a point of order, and moved an amendment in the ordinary way, which this House has declined to have anything to do with. </para>

                        <para>- I have been informed that immediately after the vote&#39; was taken on the motion for adjournment, the honorable member for. Cook rose and pointedly drew attention to the fact that I walked out of the chamber when the vote was about to be taken. It is quite true that I did so, but I was paired with the honorable member for Corio, who was not able to be present until half -past 12 o&#39;clock. As the honorable member for Cook has drawn attention to the matter merely for political purposes, and to try to discredit me in the eyes of my constituents, I take this opportunity of making an explanation and at the same time to suggest that as he has been one of the worst offenders in absenting himself at prayer time, he should be here on Tuesday. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have now an opportunity to invite the attention of honorable members to a great national question. The object of this Bill, &#39; which has come to us from another place, is to fix the territory in which the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be established. It is with feelings of very great pleasure that, as Minister of Home Affairs, I submit the Bill to the consideration of the House. I do not propose to refer to anything that &#39;took place in connexion with this question prior to the passage, at the close of last session, of the Bill, which was introduced by the Administration led by the honorable member for Wide Bay. In this matter the present Government are following the example of the Reid-McLean </para>
                    <para class="block">Administration in submitting a Bill in connexion with the acceptance of Dalgety, and the example of the Fisher Administration in submitting the measure which was passed at the close of last session. The action taken by the Fisher Government called for the hearty approval of the people, not only of New South Wales, but of all parts of the Commonwealth. The late Prime Minister and his Minister of Home Affairs showed a proper appreciation of the position, and, as appears from the correspondence, an earnest desire to have this matter settled in the interests of the Commonwealth generally. They have already been accorded a meed of praise for what they did in connexion with this question while in office. I feel sure that the desire which actuated them at that time still actuates them, and that they will give the present Government all the assistance they can to have this important matter definitely and finally settled. I think I am right in saying that the great majority of the members of this House desire that the question, which has caused so much friction in the past, shall now be finally disposed of.I hope to be able to show that the Yass-Canberra district, selected by this Parliament as the district in which the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth should be located, possesses all the requisites for the establishment of a great city, including great natural advantages, easy communication from all parts of Australia, and a magnificent water supply. </para>

                            <para>- I hope to have the earnest attention of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, and other honorable members who, like him, have some doubt as to the adequacy of the water supply available in this district. I think I shall be able to satisfy even the most critical member of the House that there is in this territory an ample supply of water available for domestic and civic purposes for the Federal Capital, and that, under the agreement entered into with the Premier of New &#39;South Wales on behalf of that State, we shall have the right to obtain from the Snowy River, and any other stream we may think it desirable to use, a sufficient supply for the development of electric power for lighting purposes, the running of trams, and any other purpose necessary to the complete equipment of the capital. I said in opening that I did not wish to take honorable members back to anything prior to the passage of the Bill of  1908  by the Fisher Administration. On the passage of that Bill, the late Minister of Home Affairs, on the  21st  December,  1908,  gave certain instructions to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. District</inline> Surveyor Scrivener. Honorable members will agree that those instructions were very carefully framed to cover all the requirements which the Minister thought necessary for the Capital, and in the subsequent report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener,</inline> and from the Advisory Board, the matters referred to in those instructions were fully inquired into, and the district found to be equal to all the requirements. It may be a little tiresome to recount them, but I think it is necessary that honorable members, and all interested in this question, should know the various steps which have brought us to the present stage. The honorable member for Coolgardie, as Minister of Home Affairs, on the  21st  December,  1908,  gave the following instructions to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener-</inline></para>

                            <para>- On the11th. March the Minister of Home Affairs instructed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. District</inline> Surveyor Scrivener to proceed with the contour survey recommended by the Advisory Board, and an investigation of the country between Canberra and the sea, with a view to ascertaining whether any practicable railway routes could be found between the proposed site and the seaboard. The Prime Minister also asked the Premier of New South Wales to furnish the Commonwealth Government with all information from the State Departments respecting, first, the Molonglo River; secondly, the Queanbeyan River ; thirdly, the Cotter River, more particularly in connexion with the report of the electrical engineer of the Public Works Department ; and, fourthly a railway route from Jervis Bay to the Goulburn-Cooma railway line. On the 26th May <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivenersent</inline> in his final report to myself as Minister of Home Affairs in relation to the instructions issued to him on the nth March. He reported that he had made a contour survey ; that he had run the survey at various levels, ranging from 1,825 to 2,000 feet above the sea ; the datum being the Cooma railway survey, and that the intermediate levels had been taken. He also reported that he had covered the greater part of the contoured area with a triangulation survey, and that the running of the contours had all been checked and found correct. He added that he had made an inspection of the country between Canberra and Jervis Bay, and discovered a very practicable railway route running from a point on the Goulburn-Cooma line, about 26 miles from Queanbeyan, to Jervis Bay, and with a ruling gradient of not more than 1 in 40, probably1 in 50. </para>

He pointed cut - it has since been confirmed, if confirmation was necessary - that in the Bay there is a splendid anchorage from three to five fathoms deep, very close to the shore, and that the part selected for the Commonwealth port is well sheltered from the south-easterly and easterly gales that raise the heavy sea from which shipping suffers on that coast from time to time. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener&#39;s</inline> report was referred by me to the Advisory Board, who, on the 16th June, reported that - </para>

                        <para>The site most suitable for the purposes of the Federal City may be briefly described as a rectangular area, the eastern and western boundaries of the northern part resting on the slopes of Mount Ainslie and the Black Mountain, the southern boundary being intersected by the Narrabundah Range, running from Mugga Mugga Mountain towards the Molonglo River. This river, which flows through the area in a westerly direction, affords facilities for the conservation of water for ornamental purposes. </para>

                    <para class="block">I may mention, in passing, that the water proposed to be used for ornamental purposes in the city will be obtained from the catchments of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo rivers, which are depicted on the right-hand side of the map in the chamber. It is proposed by the utilization of these waters to form a large lake for ornamental and aquatic purposes. It is estimated that it will be 4 miles long, and about forty feet deep, with a varying depth. Honorable members will see that a very large sheet of water will be made available, not only as an ornament to the city, but also as a place where its inhabitants will be. able to enjoy themselves in boating and other ways. Respecting the sewerage of the city, the Advisory Board reported that no engineering difficulties would be encountered in a satisfactory disposal of the sewage and the effluent from treatment works. As regards water, the Board advised that there is a supply of perennial clear and pure water in the Cotter River. The Board practically indorsed everything which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> had said in his report, to which I have already referred honorable members, and which I do not propose to reiterate in quoting from their report. They made special references to the Canberra water supply and to the railway to the port. They indorsed the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> that a practicable route could be found for communication between the site of the city and Jervis Bay. They also considered that before the location was finally decided upon an extensive examination of the intervening country should be made, so that all requirements might be met. A survey was accordingly carried out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy,</inline> an officer in the Public Service of New South Wales. He recommended a route which is practically the same as that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener,</inline> and agreed in virtually all particulars with the report made by the latter as the result of his preliminary investigation. The Board thereupon further reported that it was of opinion that Jervis Bay would meet the requirements of the Commonwealth with respect to a port for the Capital, and that the area situated at the southern extremity of the bay, suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> in his report, is the most suitable. Jervis Bay is an extensive sheet of water, and for years past has been used by the vessels of the Australian Squadron as a manoeuvring area. It is undoubtedly equal to all the requirements of the Commonwealth as a port. Some years back, a number of honorable members had an opportunity to visit it, and I feel sure that all who saw it agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> and the Board that it will meet all future needs. On the 20th July last, the Prime Minister forwarded to the Premier of New South Wales various sets of papers connected with this matter, and drew his attention to several legal and constitutional questions. He asked that, to meet possible future requirements, the State should agree to give the Commonwealth the right to use the waters of the Snowy River for power purposes. That was agreed to by the Premier on behalf of the State. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister also indicated to the Premier of New South Wales that he would be glad to receive an intimation that no objection would be offered to the construction of the line between the Territory and Jervis Bay. That also has been agreed to, and embodied in the agreement signed on behalf of the Commonwealth and the State. On the 16th September, the Premier submitted a series of motions to the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, of which the first reads -  (1.) That this State should surrender to the </para>

                    <para>As an area of 800 square miles would not meet the requirements of the Act of 1908, that was pointed out to the Premier, and he at once, without hesitation, added another 100 square miles to make up the 900 square miles which are required. The alternative area suggested by the Premier was submitted in the best of &#34;faith. New South Wales has not attempted to dictate in any way to the Commonwealth in this matter. </para>
                    <para class="block">As a Commonwealth Minister, I was opposed to any alteration of the area recommended by the Advisory Board, but, after fully investigating the alternative suggested by the Premier, I came 10 the conclusion that it should be adopted. I hope that honorable members will agree with me in that. If they look at the map, they will see that the alternative area is more compact than that recommended by the Advisory Board, that it embraces the whole of the Cotter catchment - the stream chiefly relied on to supply the Federal &#39;Capital with water - and, in addition, water rights in respect to the catchment of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers. Altogether, it is a better area than that recommended by the Advisory Board. Let me now read what was said by the Premier in submitting to the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales the motion which I have quoted. He said - </para>

                        <para>We have recognised at all stages in connexion with the discussion of this matter, that no sound objection can be raised to the Commonwealth having supreme control over the whole of the catchment area, because on the purity of the water and the control of the streams supplying it, is dependent the health and happiness of the people themselves. There is no reason why they should not have the same jurisdiction for protective purposes over the supply pf water for domestic use, as they have over the city itself. </para>

                    <para>If honorable members will look at the map they will see that the Murrumbidgee passes through a portion of the proposed Federal Territory, and it is only proper - seeing that it is one of the largest rivers in New South Wales, and that its waters are not required for Commonwealth purposes - that the State should have its rights preserved in that connexion, especially as she is at present constructing the huge Barren Jack dam - upon which about &#163;3,000,000 is being expended - for the purpose of irrigating a large area of country immediately below the Federal Territory. Resolution No.  10  has therefore been inserted in the proposed agreement, in order to preserve the rights of New South Wales in this matter. After these resolutions had been affirmed by both Houses of the New South Wales Parliament, I submitted them to the Advisory Board. The Board, in their  report of the 22nd September, re-affirmed their reasons for recommending the Territory to be acquired by the Commonwealth, including -the catchment areas of the Molonglo and the Queanbeyan Rivers, and stated that the adoption of the resolutions by the State Parliament will have the effect of curtailing the area of the Commonwealth Territory as recommended by the Advisory Board, by the withdrawal therefrom of the catchment areas of the Queanbeyan and the Molonglo Rivers lying to the south and east of the Goulburn-Cooma railway, containing an area of approximately 580 square miles, the State proposing in lieu to enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth, under which the right of the State to the use and control of the Queanbeyan and the Molonglo Rivers and their tributaries - indicated on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener&#39;s</inline> plan and lying to the south and east of the Goulburn-Cooma railway - shall be subject to the requirements of the Commonwealth. The Board regarded it as essential that the area under consideration should be vested in the Commonwealth, with a view to securing absolute control over the catchment of the rivers contained therein, for the following reasons : - <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> to regulate the flow of the Molonglo River at the City site-; <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> to prevent pollution within the area ; (e) to adopt measures for minimizing turbidity; <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> to regulate flood waters; and <inline font-style="italic">(e) to</inline> provide an auxiliary source of water power. On the other hand, the Board considered that the alternative conveyed in Resolution (2) may be accepted in lieu of their recommendation that the Commonwealth should -acquire the subject area under certain conditions, <inline font-style="italic">viz.,</inline> that in so doing the terms of the agreement to be entered into by the Commonwealth and the State shall cover the essentials laid down, and empower the Commonwealth to perform such acts and to carry out such works at all times as may by the Commonwealth be considered necessary ; also, that the State undertakes to exercise such control over the area and to carry out such works as are or as may be considered necessary to prevent pollution, including the sanitation of Queanbeyan ; also, to reserve and dedicate all Crown lands within the catchment area, and to restrain the use of the waters within the catchment areas of the Molonglo and the Queanbeyan Rivers - either by the State, or others under State control - in any manner inimical to the works referred to. The Board therefore advised that they could not but consider it -an advantage to include within the Federal Territory that portion of the catchment area of the Gudgenby River embracing an area of about 114 square miles above its effluence with the Orroral River, but that no benefit will be derived from the inclusion within the Federal Territory of the catchment areas of either Naas Creek or of Paddy&#39;s River, comprising, approximately, 251 square miles. The position is that there are two schemes before -Parliament, and on behalf of the Government, I take the responsibility of recommending the alternative scheme as submitted by New South Wales. Honorable members will see that an area embracing 205 square miles, and comprising the Federal City and the area immediately around it, is common to both schemes, and that the Cotter River catchment, which is the principal source of water supply for domestic and civic purposes, is also common to .both schemes. In addition to the area originally recommended by the Advisory Board, there is included in the alternative scheme between the Cotter catchment and the Queanbeyan and Molonglo catchment, the catchment of the Gudgenby, Naas, and Paddy&#39;s Rivers. </para>

                            <para>- That may, or may not, be correct, so far as Paddy&#39;s River is concerned, but let me tell the honorable member that I have seen the river which supplies the Prospect dam, and therefore the city of Sydney, with its 600,000 inhabitants, cease running. Therefore, the fact that a river ceases running is no indication of the quantity of water available. If you based the supply of the City of Sydney on the flow, at a particular time, of the river which supplies the Prospect darn, you could say that there would be no&#39; water there at all, but the fact remains that from that catchment area, and from that river, there is derived an ample supply for over 600,000 people in Sydney and its suburbs. The area of the Gudgenby, Naas, and Paddy&#39;s Rivers, is included in the alternative scheme submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> An area of 580 square miles, in- eluding the catchment of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers, was included in the Advisory Board&#39;s report and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> for water, not for domestic or civic purposes, but merely for ornamental purposes in the city. In the scheme which I characterize as alternative, that catchment area is still included, although we have not sovereign rights over it, as we should have had under the Advisory Board&#39;s scheme. Still, we have in the agreement with New South Wales full rights over it with regard to the use of the water, secured by the reservation of land, the right to construct works, and in other ways, every precaution being taken to insure the water being kept as pure as possible. The total area in the original plan suggested by the Advisory Board was 1,015 square miles. In the alternative scheme, we have 900 square miles over which we have absolute sovereign rights, and, in addition, 580 square miles over which we have full water rights. So that, in the latter, we have practically 1,480 square miles of country, as against 1,015 square miles recommended by the Board. In the alternative scheme, the township of Queanbeyan is cut out. of the area over which we have sovereign rights. Some honorable members in another place were deceived to a certain extent by the white line which appears on the map between the portion over which we have sovereign rights and the portion over which we have water rights. That line is merely put in to indicate the boundary between those two areas. It does not in any way represent a thin strip of country belonging to New South Wales, as some honorable senators appeared to think. </para>

                            <para>- The railway really divides the two portions of the Territory. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports is anxious to learn, and I am willing to give, full particulars in regard to the quantity of water available for the Federal City. The first river to which I shall- refer is the Cotter, which is generally conceded to be the source of a magnificent water supply. When I read these figures,&#39; I &#39;hope honorable members will bear in mind that they are calculated on the basis- of allowing each individual inhabitant  &#39;Of  the Federal Capital 100 gallons of water per head per day. The average for Sydney is 39.59 gallons, while for Melbourne it is close on 60 gallons, but even that is very much below- the quantity allowed in all the calculations for the Federal Capital. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The average daily consumption per head of population, of Sydney and suburbs is. 39.59&#39; .gallons, the total average daily consumption of that city is 24,567,492 gallons, while the population of Sydney is 620,415 &#39;persons. The population of Melbourne is 533,000 persons, the consumption per head per day is 59.25 gallons, and the daily consumption is 31,582,000 gallons. The &#39;volume- of water discharged by the Cotter River from the 6th February, 1908, to the 5th February, 1909 - and I would remind honorable members that that was one of the driest years .on record - was 13,752,000,000 gallons. The &#39; mean daily discharge by the Cotter river in that year was 37,677,205 gallons. &#39;; :That: is to say, the discharge by the Cotter River in one of the worst years on record would have sufficed for the supply of either Melbourne or Sydney and suburbs, . and left a large margin in reserve. </para>

                            <para>- I have .not; but if honorable members wish to  have .them I can obtain them. During the &#39;month of August last, the flow of the Cotter River amounted to&#39; 8,228,000,000 gallons :or -an average of 265,140,000 gallons per day. The average consumption of 620^000 inhabitants of Sydney last year was 24,600,000 gallons per day, so that&#39; sufficient water flowed down the Cotter- River during August last to &#39; supply Sydney and suburbs for &#39;333* &#39; days. The report with regard to the &#39; Gudgenby&#34;, which is included in this area, is that it gives a supply of perennially clear and pure water similar to that of the Cotter. The catchment area above the proposed site for a dam, at the 2,750-ft. level, is 114 square miles, and the estimated mean flow at the dam site is 14,874,000,000 gallons per annum. With a 25-in. rainfall, which the Government Meteorologist assures me would be a very small rainfall for that part of the country, it would be 10,050,000,000. There are two other rivers included within this catchment area. The first of these, the Naas, is a tributary&#34; of the Gudgenby, and has an estimated mean run-off at the dam site of 5,989,000,000 gallons per annum. With a 25-in. rainfall its estimated mean runoff would be 4,047,000,000 gallons. Then we have Paddy&#39;s River, which has a catchment area of 88 square miles, and an estimated mean flow of 6,609,000,000 gallons per annum, or, with a 25-in. rainfall, 4,465,000,000 gallons per annum. Honorable members will recognise from these figures that a magnificent supply of absolutely pure, clear water is obtainable from these sources. A further report on the Cotter River was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> M. De Burgh, Chief Engineer for Harbors and Water Supply, and was ordered to be printed by the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales on 21st July last. This report, from the highest official source, is dated 14th July, 1909, and reads as follows : - </para>

                        <para>I have the honour to report that the measurements of the flow of the Cotter River from 1st January to 7th instant are now available. </para>
                        <para>During that time 9,919,000,000, or an average of 52,753,400, gallons of water per day flowed down the river. </para>
                        <para>During the same period 2,240,000,000 gallons flowed off the Sydney catchment into Cataract and Prospect; so that more than four times as much water flowed down the Cotter as flowed into the Sydney storages. </para>

So the  unstored  flow of the Cotter was twice as much as the consumption of 650,000 people for all needs. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">In view of all these facts, no reasonable man could have any doubt as to the water supply included within the catchment area being far more than is necessary to meet any demand that may be made upon it by the Federal Capital. As to the port which honorable members decided it was necessary that the Capital should have, a map exhibited in the chamber shows that portion of the south-eastern side of Jervis Bay to which I have already referred as having been reserved for this purpose. The sections coloured blue are part of New South Wales territory, which were reserved for defence purposes, but were never dedicated for those purposes, as it was thought that it would be unnecessary to do so. However, since the Federal Capital will no doubt be connected by rail with Jervis Bay, the Government thought it desirable that every precaution should be taken to secure the land as necessary for the proper protection of the port, and it has, accordingly, been handed over to the Commonwealth. All these concessions have been granted willingly by New South Wales to the Federation in response to requests made from time to time by the late, as well as by the present, Ministry. They are all embodied in the agreement which forms the first . schedule to the Bill. I do not propose to refer at length to the Bill which I am asking the House to pass, because it is practically the same as the Act of 1904. It contains the provisions necessary in connexion with a territory such as that to be acquired. It provides for the appointment of magistrates and deals with the jurisdiction of the High Court and. other matters for which it is necessary to provide, pending, I presume, the creation of a Constitution for the government of the Federal Territory. I respectfully &#39; submit that we have in the site proposed to be taken over all the requirements for the establishment of a great city. Many honorable members have seen it, and must agree that its configuration and natural beauty fit in with the instruction given by my predecessor that such a site should be chosen as would permit of the creation of a beautiful city. The reports go to show that the requirements in respect of water supply and other essentials will be amply met by the selec- tion of the territory that I now recommend to the House. We shall also have the right to construct a railway from the Capital to Jervis Bay, so that the facilities for which honorable members asked, although no provision for securing them had been made in the Constitution, will be obtained. I hope that honorable members will give this Bill their earnest and serious consideration. We are now proceeding to take what, I hope, will be the final steps to determine a matter that has been pending far too long. The non-settlement of this question has  created friction, not only in this Parliament, but throughout the Commonwealth. Having made the fullest investigation, I have no hesitation in recommending that which I have indicated as the alternative site, and I hope that we shall speedily settle the whole question. I trust that before long we shall have established a city in accordance with the terms of the Constitution as accepted by the people - a city where the Federal Parliament will be able to meet in a home of its own, free from the influence of the large capitals of the States. There, I trust, we shall have as our statesmen and legislators the wisest and best men in the Commonwealth, and that as the result of their useful legislation and sound administration, combined with the great natural resources of the Commonwealth, Australia will take that high place amongst the nations which, I am sure, it is the desire of every patriotic citizen that she should occupy. </para>

                        <para>.- This Bill is largely a machinery Bill, and has been introduced because it has been found by experience that certain amendments of the existing law are necessary to enable elections to be properly conducted. I am sure that it is the desire of every member of the House that when national issues are put before the people, every possible facility shall be afforded the electors to record their votes intelligently, so that this Parliament may truly represent the views of the people. I have not, so far, heard any honorable member congratulate the Minister of Home Affairs on the way in which this Bill has been presented for our consideration. I wish to do so now. Under the practice hitherto adopted in the framing of amending measures it has been very difficult for honorable members to compare the proposed amendments with the various provisions of existing&#34; legislation. I am very glad to note in this case a new departure. The Minister has supplied honorable members with a copy of the existing Act as proposed to be amended by this measure, in which the amendments are indicated in black letters. Honorable members are thus enabled very readily to understand the changes proposed to be made in the existing law. We have also been supplied with documents showing the alterations proposed in the form of enrolment, ballot-papers, and postal ballot-papers. One reason for the introduction of this measure is the necessity for some amendment of the existing postal voting provisions. Theoretically, there can be no objection to the recording of votes in any way which will express the views of the electors. But, in practice, we know that unless electors come to a polling booth and record their votes under the most stringent provisions, there is great liability to corruption. Those who object to the postal-voting provisions base their objection chiefly upon the liability to corruption where that method of voting is largely availed of. I believe that no matter under what conditions postal voting is permitted, it is impossible to avoid irregularities. </para>

We know that when political feeling runs high, there is great temptation to exceed what is legal and fair. I dare say that the majority of candidates for election transgress the present law in some way or another. The honorable member for Balaclava has given notice of an amendment which would enable any woman to vote by post. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Whilst I . should like to make it easy for all women to vote, and should not object to their being supplied with carriages to take every one of them to the poll at the Government expense, we must remember that if postal voting is made easy, we shall have a repetition of the corrupt practices which took place in connexion with a State election in Queensland, and which led to the abolition of the postal -voting system in that State. The postal vote should be used only where its use is absolutely necessary. A person confined to a sick bed or a person who must be absent from the electorate in which he is entitled to vote on the polling day, should be allowed to vote by post. But the system should not be extended to others, and even where its use is justified, it should be hedged about by the most stringent conditions. The next matter of importance with, which I think it is necessary to deal, is the question of candidates&#39; expenses, which are limited under the existing Act. </para>

                            <para>- I think I heard an honorable member on the other side say that the limitation of candidates&#39; expenses -under the existing Act is an awful nuisance ;&#39; but I think it is very likely that at the&#39; next Federal election the honorable member w.ill be provided for handsomely, and the expenses of his election will not trouble &#39; him very much. I am sorry that honorable members on this side are not likely ito be . in so fortunate a position. There &#39; is. a provision in the existing law which limits the expenses of a candidate to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> ;&#39; but I venture to say that that provision ;is:being violated wholesale, and if the section is to remain in force, some course should be adopted to make it effective. There is- another point which ought to be taken into consideration. A claude ought to be inserted in the Bill to compel the newspapers,, which are practically run in the interests of a particular class, to act fairly when an election takes place. I notice that an amendment has been circulated by the honorable member for Herbert to the effect that if a newspaper publishes the address of one candidate, it shall also publish the address of other candidates; and that, for a specified time  before  the clay of an election, the newspapers shall not comment upon the views of  candidates </para>

As a master of fact, the members of this Parliament are not elected, to a very large extent, in accordance with their political views, but from&#39; what the&#39; newspapers supporting them have had to say about them. I have known candidates who could not express themselves from the platform in a coherent manner, but who1 nevertheless have been returned in consequence of newspaper influence. In a part of New, South Wales in which I once lived, a- gentleman of foreign extraction stood &#34;for Parliament. He won the election without Having to address a single meeting, simply because the newspapers took him up, and expounded politics for him. They made all&#39;&#39; sorts  of charges against his opponents, and ruined their chances. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know where the honorable member for Dalley would be if the press support were taken from him ; but I do know, that, in. the country districts especially, where it is difficult for candidates to reach the electors, the daily press exercises a very evil influence. I, for one, will support the idea underlying the amendment to be proposed by the honorable member for Herbert, which will limit to some extent the power exercised by party newspapers owned by capitalistic shareholders. They are purely class organizations, existing not so much in the interests of the people of Australia as in the selfish interests of those . who own them. I trust that in Committee we shall take the opportunity of evolving an effective measure which will secure the election to this Parliament of candidates fairly representative of the views of their constituents. I trust that the Minister in charge of the Bill will set himself strongly against any expansion of facilities for postal voting. The present facilities ought to be surrounded by such limitations as will prevent abuses of the system, such as have occurred in connexion with certain State elections. The measure has no party aspect. It is purely a machinery Bill. Consequently, I shall do all I can to help the Minister to produce such a Bill as will effect great improvement in our existing legislation. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Cook has referred to an amendment which I propose to submit in Committee, lt is probable that women who live in city and suburban constituencies do not require greater facilities for registering their votes than they have at present. But in the country electorates the case is otherwise. The matter does not affect my constituency in the slightest degree. But let us take an electorate like Corangamite. I have been all through that district, and remember that it took me on one occasion eleven hours to </para>

                    <para>Tide  19 miles. Some of the settlers live at distances ranging from 10 to 15 miles from a polling booth. A man who has taken up a selection in the back blocks, and is working hard to clear his property and make a living upon it, cannot very well get away to vote on polling day. Even if tie does, his wife must stay at home to look after the children. I think that people so situated should be afforded greater facilities for exercising their right to vote; and my amendment is designed with the object of increasing the conveniences for country electors. The State Parliaments have given the vote to women, and no difficulty should be placed in the way of the exercise of the right ; and a great deal of money could in my opinion be saved if the whole of the voting were done by post. The Australian Mutual Provident Society send out ballot-papers to every member, and I do not know of anything wrong ever having happened at their elections. </para>

                            <para>- Then they are evidently the elect of the Society ; and I think we should probably find a similar result in the case of Parliamentary elections. The honorable member for Cook referred to abuses under the Electoral Act, and there is one abuse to which I should like to draw attention, and of which the honorable member may know more than myself . It is pretty well known that some of the trade unions have no great confidence ,as to the votes their members may give, and I am told on good authority that a method has been resorted to in order to insure that they shall vote as desired. When a man goes into -a polling booth and is given a voting-paper, he deposits a blank sheet in the ballot-box, and takes the paper to one of the Committee rooms, where it is marked and given to the next voter to use, each man being expected to fetch a plain paper from the booth. </para>

                            <para>- I do not intend to impute any corruption to the honorable member for Cook ; but, if he thinks I do so, I am only too pleased to apologize, because the thought was never in my mind. It is known to mc and other people that such a practice has been resorted to in Victoria ; but I cannot speak as to any other State. The schedule of the Bill provides penalties for taking ballot-papers out of the polling booths, but such a provision is absolutely useless unless power be given to the electoral officers or the police to search, under warrant, people suspected, and the premises to which it is thought papers are taken. </para>

                            <para>- I do, because it does not give a man freedom to exercise his judgment, and the intention is that there shall be secrecy. Another proposal I intend to submit is that separate compartments or booths be provided for women voters. At the Brighton State election the&#39; other day, the Town Hall, which was used as a polling booth, had a bar down the centre, the women going to the left, and the men to the right. The women were under the supervision of the returning officer, and were not hustled or rushed as they have been at other elections. When party feeling is very high, it might prove very unpleasant for women voters to have to record their votes in the midst of a number of excited men ; and my proposal would secure them from interference or annoyance. Objection has been made to the use of cabs at elections. Personally, I do not see why a cabman should not have the chance of earning his living on an election day, as well as at any other time; and, as a matter of fact, no one ever knows whose supporters are being carried. At one election in a district for which I was a candidate for the Legislative Council, I was told that, if I sent vehicles to a certain place, there were sixty electors who would vote for me. Accordingly, I hired and sent out three coaches, but, as a matter of fact, not a single man of the lot voted&#34; for me. I cannot see that the hiring or lending of cabs can do any harm whatever ; and, at any rate, it is regarded as rather a good joke to  Tide  in the cab of the man for whom you do not intend to vote. I cannot understand why there should be any objection to cabmen reaping a small harvest on election day, in the same way as do newspaper proprietors from the advertisements, and printers generally from the printing of bills and other matter. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister has made a good departure in endeavouring to simplify the compilation of the rolls. A great difficulty in the past has been to prepare the rolls in such a perfect form that there is no repetition or overloading. The adoption of the card system of record is, I think, a wise step. It will enable the Departmental officials, when the records are collected, to see thai names are not duplicated. We have heard comments made on the percentage of electors who vote, but the commentators entirely overlooked the fact that the rolls are inflated with the names of a number of persons who have gone elsewhere. They ignore that fact, and make no comment on the much more serious fact that a number of names have been improperly left off the roll. The Department has, I think, been introducing some improvements. I have brought under their notice cases where carelessness has been exhibited - a lack of attention to the collection of names which can only be described as carelessness. I have since been informed that in the selection of a constable to collect the roll for a district they make an effort to get a man who knows the district. Not very long ago, however, a constable who had only recently, been appointed to a district, and therefore did not know its people, was intrusted with the duty of collecting the roll. Naturally it followed that, although he did his best to discharge that duty, the names of a considerable number of persons were left off the roll. Even the names of men who had been under the eyes of the police practically every day, and who had been enrolled for twenty-six years, had been left off. Although various improvements have been introduced by the Department as the result of personal representations, still there are considerable difficulties to be overcome. Take, for instance, the last roll collected by.&#39; the police in Cobar, which is in my electorate. As soon as it was made available, one of the active officials connected with the organization of the Labour League compared the new roll with the roll of the Miners&#39; Union, a body composed of about  700  men who are working in the district. The names of nearly  200  miners did not appear on the roll which had been collected by the police. That was most unsatisfactory. So many names had .been left off the roll that their omission could not be said to be due to ordinary causes. If a constable calls at a boarding house, it depends upon the interest which the landlord or landlady takes in the work whether he gets the names of all the boarders. If the constable is very  anxious to see that he gets the names of. every boarder, he may make inquiries from, other parties, and find out the facts, but where there are no checks available, such as the one I have referred to, there does not. appear to be any effort made by the collectors to ascertain that they have obtained the names of all the persons who are entitled to be enrolled. In the case of the Miners&#39; Union, the roll of its membership was available at an office in the centre of Cobar, and within a few doors of the police office. It appears to me that if there were an assiduous and careful collection of names, an officer would avail himself of every possible chance to see whether any names had not been supplied to him at particular houses. It is not sufficient for a collector to merely take the statement of a landlord or landlady. There has been too much carelessness in the collection of names. I believe that the Departmental officers are taking steps to minimise the results of such carelessness. I would point out to the Minister that what is specially wanted is the exercise of very great care in the selection of those who are to carry out the machinery of. the Act, because the success of its working depends upon that. The collection of the rolls is a matter of the first importance. Whenever the matter is mentioned to me, . I tell an elector that there is only one way to make sure <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> being enrolled, and. that is to see that his name is on the roll, and, if not, to attempt to get it inserted. No matter how efficient officers may be, the names of some persons will be missed. As there is no certainty that a man&#39;s name will appear oil the roll, it behoves him to examine the roll as soon as it is published. But unfortunately persons are careless and apathetic. and a considerable number of names are left off the rolls every time. The Minister is proposing to meet the situation bv the adoption of the card system. It is important that every facility should be afforded to persons to get enrolled. The selection of the registrars who are to compile the rolls is just as important as is the selection of the constables who have only now and again to collect names. A most extraordinary attitude was taken up by a Registrar in the biggest town in my electorate. According to my informants, whom I believe to be reliable persons - in fact, their statement was not denied when it was brought under the notice of the Department - when they asked for forms for the purpose of putting on the roll the names of persons who had not been enrolled, the Registrar held that they would have to come to himself at the post office, get the forms, and fill them up in his presence. The Minister need not make a note of this case, because the officer is not there now, and the matter was remedied at the time. When a man who is in charge of a very large post-office, and whom we may reasonably expect to be intelligent, makes a mistake of that kind, what can we expect from officers who are not of the same standard? That mistake on the part of the Registrar was remedied quickly. When a representation was made to the Department, he was informed that he had to supply the forms. Since his removal, I have learned from a correspondent,, whom I believe to be absolutely reliable, that he had refused to supply forms to one political section, but had granted them to others. I am repeating the statement just as it was made to me, for I have not had a chance to verify it. If it is true, that officer should never have another chance of doing that kind of thing. It is reasonable for the Electoral Department to assume that a postmaster will do this business honestly and impartially. I ask the Minister to impress upon the Departmental heads the importance of making careful inquiries as to the class of men who are put in charge of the rolls. An extraordinary position of affairs was found to exist just before the collection of the last rolls. All the forms had been withdrawn from circulation, and none were obtainable anywhere by those who wanted to get their names put on the roll. As soon as it was communicated to me, I brought the matter under the notice of the Department, and the Chief Electoral Officer at once issued instructions that forms were to be supplied. The fact that such a thing did happen shows that some officer does not understand his duties, or is not doing his work properly. It- seems to me extraordinary that forms should not be available, in a reasonable number, all over the country. These are not documents which any one would want to use for other purposes. Every facility should be provided to enable persons to get their names placed on the roll. What is the use of our complaining about persons not voting, and talking about compulsory voting, because, at the general election, a number of persons did not vote, when such defects in our electoral system exist? I wish to say a word or two regarding the conduct of elections. Care should always be taken to see that proper deputies and other officers are appointed to control the proceedings. I had occasion, prior to the last election, to call the attention of the Chief Electoral Officer of New South Wales to the displacing of a man who had conducted elections for something like forty years, and one in whom every one had confidence, by another whose only previous experience was as a  deputy,  when he left the polling place of which he had charge, and went 12 miles to record his vote. It is not right to supplant an experienced man in whom every one has the utmost trust by one who is without experience. I do not know how the officer who was superseded votes, and do not wish to know. But he is not a partisan. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dooley</inline> has jokingly said that he would not care how the votes were cast if he had the counting of the ballot. No doubt we sometimes feel that we should like to have a friend at court; but our great desire is that there should be honest men to control the elections. There should be less stinginess in regard to our officials, including poll clerks. It is most unwise to send one man into a little country town where there are probably no scrutineers to act for the candidates, and no one to assist or to check him. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that. Statements have been made which countenance the strong suspicion that matters are not conducted properly everywhere, and we should be very careful that everything, from the collection of the rolls to the conduct of the elections, should be done properly, and should be beyond question. I am in favour of the general principles of the measure, and although I was one of those who voted for the establishment of postal voting, I have now changed my mind on the subject. What I learnt during a trip to Queensland showed me that at Charters Towers, and other places, postal voting has lent itself to practices which are outrageous. I am informed that these practices cannot happen under the Commonwealth Act. </para>

                            <para>- Postal voting was instituted largely to enable those belonging to the shearing class to vote when away from home. I am surprised that the honorable member should be so ready to attribute ulterior motives to his fellows. </para>

                    <para class="block">This ought not to be regarded as a party measure. At any rate, very few honorable members represent constituencies in which, during certain seasons of the year, so many of the electors are away from homes as in the Darling district. My objection to postal voting is that evils are possible under it, and they may extend further. Our great object is to secure the honest expression of the will of the people. We wish to give every adult the widest facilities for having his name placed on the roll, and to every elector the opportunity to vote uninfluenced and in secret. To this end we properly provide that no person shall come within a certain distance of the door of the polling place. Only  a  few persons are allowed within the booth at a time. Where it is suspected that the intending voter is not properly qualified, he may be questioned on oath regarding his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides,</inline> and every safeguard is taken to prevent the illiterate from being imposed upon or unduly influenced. I ask honorable members to remember that phase of the question. The time was when no election could be held without two or three fights taking place, and at some elections I have actually seen stones thrown. But nowadays, elections are conducted with due decorum and with an appreciation of&#39; the serious responsibility which attaches to them. But the position of the person who votes by post is quite different from that of the elector who attends the polling booth to exercise his franchise. The former is not subjected to the cross-examination to which the latter has to submit. So many electors are apathetic, careless and ignorant of the political questions of the day that a considerable number in every constituency are susceptible to all sorts of subtle influences. I ask leave to continue my remarks on a future day. </para>
