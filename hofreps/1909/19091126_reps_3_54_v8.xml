                    <para>.- On the 11th November, when speaking upon an amendment of the Electoral Bill, I referred to the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> as having a circulation of  20,000.  There is a newspaper of that name in each of the States, and I did not particularize that to which I referred. To remove any false impression that may have been created, I desire to say that the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> has a circulation of  50,000. </para>

                        <para>- In reference to the proposed Kitchener camp in Victoria, which is to be held between the  10th  and  17th  January next, I draw attention to the fact that, while a great many men are ready to take part, it has been ascertained that out of  220  in one regiment which was paraded, only forty can obtain leave of absence from their employers, while out of a company of sixty-eight, only four can go. I ask the Minister of Defence if he can circularize the employers, . with a view to obtaining their consent to their men attending the camp. I would point out, too, that many of these men live from&#39; hand to mouth, and would suffer serious loss were their payment for attendance at camp to be deferred until the end of the half year. They should receive their pay for their eight days in camp immediately before leaving the camp. </para>

                        <para>- The Railways Commissioners of a State are in no  official relation  to the Commonwealth, and comment on their action, however interesting, is hardly fit matter for a public declaration, assuming that they are acting independently. The remark applies more strongly if, as is suggested, the authority of a State Government is behind them. Our relations with the Governments of the States are fairly, though not completely, defined by the Constitution, and I hesitate to enter upon a consideration of the particular point at which any action would involve action on our part. Had I a well-considered opinion on this subject, I would not care to express it now, because to do so would not at all help matters. Only action on the part of the Commonwealth can be of value in this grave contingency. I am extremely sorry that the dispute is intensified, and that the. hopes of the last few days are apparently dwindling. As the Attorney-General said yesterday, the Government is watching every incident which can be officially verified, and, at the first opportunity when the Constitution permits our intervention for the purpose of arbitration and settlement, we shall be prepared to take action. </para>

                            <para>- That is not a question which I would venture to answer off-hand, or without prolonged consultation with the Attorney-General and the Cabinet. The honorable member&#39;s view is that the action of the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales is a breach of the Constitution, because in restraint of trade. Assuming, for the purposes of the argument, that it is so, nothing would be gained by my saying it. The expression of an individual opinion would carry no weight. It may be, that, within a few hours or days, the Government will require to adopt a judicial attitude in this matter, and it will then be better if we have not personally expressed even mature opinions upon the points at issue. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately, I do not seem to have made my statement clear to the honorable member. I pointed out that restraint of trade in itself did not imply Commonwealth jurisdiction, but that circumstances might arise at any time when that jurisdiction would be created. Within the Commonwealth jurisdiction, if either party to a dispute takes action in conflict with the Commonwealth Constitution, or with which it becomes the duty of the Commonwealth Government to deal, it will be dealt with without delay. </para>

                        <para>The law does not provide for the acknowledgment of a claim for enrolment. On the receipt of a claim it is the duty of an Electoral Registrar to at once enter on the roll the name of the claimant if satisfied that he is entitled to enrolment, or, if not satisfied that he is entitled to enrolment, to transmit the claim to the Divisional Returning Officer with such observations relating to it as he thinks proper. If the Divisional Returning Officer decides not to enrol the claimant he is required to notify him of the fact, and if the claimant is not satisfied with the decision of the Divisional Returning Officer he may then appeal to a Court of summary jurisdiction. </para>

                    <para>.- Last night the honorable member for Grampians made some extraordinary statements with reference to the construction of a railway on the Victorian side of Dalgety, and also with regard to the construction of a line connecting Cooma with Dalgety. I do not know where he obtained his information. Last year reports by surveyors of the Railway Department were placed before the Victorian Railways Standing Committee, recommending the route going through Orbost, and thence following the Little River, crossing the watershed of the Cann, and reaching the border near Bondi. The line would be 142 miles in length, and its estimated cost was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5,750</inline> per mile. That estimate shows that the country to be traversed is not very difficult. Another route was suggested, the highest elevation on which was only 1,600 feet, and it was said that it would permit of a broad-gauge line, with fairly steep grades and round curves. That which the surveyors recommended, however, is the easier one. </para>

                        <para>- I have no information on that point, but the route is easier than that through Murrungowar. Another proposal was made for a direct route passing through Buchan, by which a saving of 30 miles would be effected, but the Railways Standing Committee would not take any evidence with regard to that route, holding that they were concerned with the question not of what would be the shortest and best route to Dalgety, but of what would be the best route for a railway to Orbost. There is no difficulty in the way of connecting the Victorian system with Dalgety. and the cost of construction would not be high. As to the connexion on the other side, the 6464 <inline font-style="italic">Seat of Government</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Acceptance Bill.</inline> honorable member for Grampians probably knows that since the selection of Dalgety was set aside, the reason for the display of parochial feeling in New South Wales in regard to railway construction in that part of the State has disappeared, and that the Parliament of New South Wales has passed a Bill permitting the construction of a line from Cooma to the Bombala district. Before very long Bombala will be connected by rail with Sydney, and the distance between Bombala and Dalgety is not great. </para>

                <para class="block">In the first instance, we had a ballot, and the decision was in favour of Canberra. Subsequently a Bill was introduced by the late Government, and that decision was unanimously confirmed; and I take it that the second reading of the present Bill is a further confirmation, with the difference that the measure now before us gives us an opportunity to study in detail, and approve or disapprove, of the agreement between the New South Wales Government and the Commonwealth Government, as set out in the schedule. There is a very vital part of that agreement which, in my opinion, should be amended. I do not wish to vote for the agreement while it contains the important defect which I seek to remedy by my amendment.&#39; The question of water supply is all-important.  I  do not intend to traverse the arguments in regard to the advantages or otherwise of the Yass-Canberra site. I have read carefully the reports as to the water supply of both Canberra and Dalgety; and, from this point of view, Dalgety, in my opinion, completely out-distances every other site placed before us. But the water supply conditions of Canberra have considerably improved on investigation; and from the reports of the various engineers, I think the supply would be sufficient for domestic purposes. In regard to the area reserved, the watershed, access to the sea, and the port at Jervis Bay, the State of New South Wales has been by no means parsimonious ; but there is a very important defect in the Capital site, inasmuch as there is not a sufficient water supply for the generation of electrical power. At this stage, we know little of the requirements of the Capital ; but we ought to provide for sufficient electricity, not only to light the city, but to run trams, and, if necessary, the railway to the sea. In the future there may be certain manufacturing industries established at the Capital; and it may be found desirable to build ships of war at the port. </para>

                        <para>- Electricity has already been conveyed 70 miles, and radiated over long distances with a maximum loss of 20 per cent. All the leading engineering authorities show conclusively that, while the Snowy River is sufficient in quantity and velocity to generate unlimited electrical power, the supply of water within the Yass-Canberra area is limited. The Minister of Home Affairs has been good enough to show me a report by the Chief Electrical Engineer of New South Wales, who states that, by the construction of certain works within the reserved area at Yass-Canberra, a large quantity of electrical power can be generated. We know that under the Barren Jack scheme, it is estimated that 5,000 horse-power can be generated, but when we reckon the whole of the possible water supply for power purposes, it is not nearly sufficient for the utilities I have mentioned. In fact, the whole of the water capacity under the Barren Jack scheme, and within the reserved area at Yass-Canberra, would not suffice to raise electrical power to run suburban trams. This shows how necessary it is to have a reserve power in hand, especially in view of the fact that the Capital site is the only area that we can regard as our own territory. I do not think that it is necessary to go into an elaborate citation of authorities to show the difference in the water supply of the two places. Honorable members all agree that the supply from the Snowy River is unlimited, whereas it is limited at Yass-Canberra, and must be supplemented by the construction of expensive works. Had the selection of Dalgety been confirmed, the Snowy River would have been our own property, and it is admitted that that is the best river in Australia for the generation of electrical power. The only means by which we can be placed in the same position, in regard to water supply, that we would have been in had we selected Dalgety, is to give the Commonwealth priority of rights over the Snowy River; and this might make the selection of the Canberra site more tolerable. In one of the first reports submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bloomfield,</inline> Resident Engineer of the Department of Public Works of New South Wales, he contrasted the supply at Queanbeyan with that at Buckley&#39;s Crossing, and I presume he had made reasonable investigation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bloomfield</inline> states - </para>

                    <para>Buckley&#39;s Crossing is decidedly the best. The supply is unlimited, the distance the water will have to be brought is small, and provision could easily be made for generating electricity at the place where the water supply would be taken off, as the fall in the river is very rapid. </para>

As power will probably not be required from the Snowy River for the Capital for the next fifty years, the State may in the meantime step in and erect works on the river, which will give it priority of right over the Commonwealth. To show the necessity of placing the matter altogether beyond doubt, let me quote clause 2 of the agreement, which deals in a very different fashion with the area reserved by the State for the use of the Commonwealth for water supply purposes.

                    <para>. - I trust the Committee will reject the amendment. I was glad to hear the honorable member for Wimmera acknowledge that on further investigation, he is satisfied that the water supply of the Yass-Canberra district is something like what we have always represented it to be. The honorable member desires that the Commonwealth should be given paramount rights over the Snowy River in regard to electrical power purposes, but I would point out that that is a matter entirely outside what was asked for under the Constitution. It is one of the provisions which were added during the negotiations between the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Premier of New South Wales. Paragraph 10 provides that we shall have full rights over the Snowy River for this purpose, and that if we want other rivers in addition, the cession of rights may be agreed upon, or, in default of agreement, may be determined by arbitration. The Commonwealth is given power to construct whatever works are necessary on the Snowy, and the right to conduct the electricity generated from the Snowy to the Seat of Government. I would draw the attention of the honorable member for Wimmera to the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corin,</inline> Electrical Engineer of New South Wales, who was sent up specially to report on the possibilities of electrical power within the proposed area. </para>

                    an exhaustive report he shows that, even after allowing 100 gallons per head per day for the domestic supply of a population of 50,000, there is ample force in the Cotter River itself to generate at least 7,000 horse-power of electricity. He also furnishes an appendix showing that in a number of English towns, with populations between 40,000 and 60,000, having municipal combined electric lighting and traction plants, with tramways running up to 17 miles in length, the capacity of horse-power used is nothing like that amount. He also points out -
                </para>
                <para>On comparing with Sydney, where the maximum lighting load has not yet reached 8,400 horse-power, nor the maximum traction load 24,000 horse-power, on the basis of population ratio, say, 50,000 to 600,000, or 1 : 12, at the capital, 700 horse-power might be expected to be required for lighting and power, and 2,000 for trams, or 2,700 in all, as against the 7,000 that I suggested. </para>
                <para class="block">Consequently nearly three times as much horse-power as would be required could be generated from the Cotter. The State of New South Wales, after giving us everything that we have asked for, grants us this further right over the Snowy River and over any other stream that may be required for the purpose in the future. Why, then, after this agreement has been deliberately made, should we ask for still more? So far as the generation of electricity is concerned, 1,V ho can say that that will be the power of the future? In hundreds of places to-day suction gas has taken the place of the power previously used, and in the course- of years that may be displaced by something better and cheaper. While I look into the future and am prepared to consider the probable developments of the Capital I am not going to say what the motive power of the future will be. But even if electricity is to be the power that the Federal city will depend upon, we have within the territory itself the means of developing more than ample, and, in addition, we have under the agreement the full right to use the Snowy River for the purpose, and any other stream in the Commonwealth as determined upon by agreement or arbitration. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret that the honorable member for Wimmera did not make yesterday the speech that he made this morning. He tells us that the first consideration for the Federal Capital site is its water supply, and yet he voted against a site which has a plentiful supply, and now wants to go back to that site to bring from it the water required for an inferior site. </para>

I am surprised to learn that he thinks Dalgety is superior to Yass-Canberra. </para>

The honorable member&#39;s attitude is, &#34; Dalgety is the best site, and if I had an opportunity I should vote for it, but I will not give the people of Australia an opportunity of doing so.&#34; When he faces his electors in March next, he will be able to tell them that although Dalgety is the best site, it has not been chosen, and that the site which has been chosen cannot furnish a water supply sufficient for the great centre of population which the Attorney-General predicts will be established at the seat of Government. The honorable member has stated that, in his opinion, Dalgety should have been chosen, but that, as a majority is now in favour of another site, he will follow it. He has already voted for the agreement. </para>

                        <para>- It was referred to on more than one occasion. The Minister of Home Affairs stated that Canberra has a good water supply. The honorable member for Wimmera now tells us that, in his opinion, the water supply will not meet the requirements of the future Capital, and that steps should be taken to improve it. He has made the startling statement that the best site has not been selected, and that, if he had another opportunity, he would vote for Dalgety. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member voted once for Dalgety, and therefore must have thought it the best site. I conclude that, had he another opportunity, he would again support that site in preference to Canberra. Yesterday, when he had a chance to point out the deficiencies of the Yass-Canberra district in regard to water supply, he was silent. I am therefore at a loss to understand why he opened up the question to-day. However, I shall support his proposal, with a view to obtaining a better water supply for this waterless area. </para>

                    <para>.- In reply to the Minister of Home Affairs, I desire to read a report appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> last week, wherein the Premier of New South Wales, referring in the Legislative Assembly to the Capital Site Surrender Bill -  explained that he proposed to take the second-reading of the measure to endorse the principle, but not to go beyond that stage until it was-  6468 <inline font-style="italic">Seat of Government</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Acceptance Bill</inline> made clear that the Commonwealth Parliament required no modification of the proposal now before it. If the House of Representatives,in its wisdom, thought the schedule should be modified it could be referred back to the State, and be dealt with before it had passed through Committee. If the House of Representatives decided to pass the Bill and endorse the agreement without alteration then the course of the States was perfectly simple. </para>

                        <para>- It was passed on the voices. That was an indorsement of the original decision regarding Yass-Canberra. The passing of the motion for the second reading of this Bill was the reaffirmation of previous decisions. Having agreed to the second reading, it is our duty now to consider the details of the agreement with New South Wales. &#39; If any honorable member thinks that any clause of the agreement should be altered, he may propose an amendment of it, and should his views not be met in regard to what he considers a matter of vital consequence, he will be at liberty to vote against the third reading. The report read by the Minister of Home Affairs estimated that a horsepower of  7,000  could be obtained within the territory, and, in addition, a horse-power of  5,000  from the Barren Jack scheme ; but a total horse-power of  12,000  would not be sufficient to run the suburban railways of Victoria by means of electricity, so that clearly we need a still greater water supply. </para>

I am one of those who was opposed to it, and when the question was put. called &#34;No&#34;; I did not demand a division, because I saw that a majority was against me, and I am always opposed to any obstruction of business, or waste of time. If misrepresentations like those of the honorable member for Wimmera become common, I shall feel obliged to call&#34; for a division on every question when I am against the proposal under consideration. The honorable member for Wimmera has repeated three times a statement which is a misrepresentation of the facts. I hope that the Minister of Home Affairs will make clear the position of the Commonwealth in regard to the control of the proposed Federal port, and will read very carefully the legal decisions on Tasman ian and English cases dealing with high watermark. </para>

The honorable member is not in the chamber at present, but it appears to me that his proposition, instead of being moved as a new clause, should be submitted by way of amendment to the clause now under consideration. </para>

The honorable member for Maribyrnong, who is temporarily absent from the chamber, spoke to me in regard to this clause. I pointed out to him that a Constitution would have to be framed to provide for the good order and government of the territory, and that he would have an opportunity to endeavour to place in that Constitution the provision that he proposed to insert in this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that the honorable member for Werriwa should have seen fit to interrupt me with a point of order which he must have known would not be upheld. The amendment proposed by the honorable member for Gippsland provides that a licence for the manufacture or sale of intoxicating or spirituous liquors shall not be issued in respect of the territory except upon a direct vote of a majority of the people resident therein, but it does not enable the initiative to be taken by the people. It was for that reason that I asked the honorable member to consent to the addition of the words &#39; &#39; initiated by petition in such manner as may be prescribed.&#34; The honorable member has consented to that addition, and the amendment so amended will enable the Government to prescribe regulations permitting the people to take what action they think fit. It has been said that this condition would have to be accepted by the Parliament of New South Wales. That is not so. It is not for the State Parliament to determine what laws shall operate in the territory after we have taken it over. Although it has gone to certain lengths in interfering with Federal matters, I do not think it would be prepared to go so far as to say what laws should operate in the territory once it is taken over by the Commonwealth. This is a reasonable amendment. It simply declares that the manufacture and sale of spirituous liquors shall not be forced upon the residents of the territory against their will. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. There is in the States . a growing consensus of opinion against the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors. That being so, this Parliament will be compelled to legislate on the question, and I think that we ought to take time by the forelock by making provision for the settlement of this vexed question from the very beginning. The manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors should not be imposed on the people against their will, and they should have the power, on petition, to initiate a referendum, and give expression to their views. </para>

There is not even a clause dealing with electoral rights. </para>

                        <para>- Although the amendment may -be strictly in order, it is very inexpedient to introduce legislation for the government of the territory in the absence of any machinery for carrying it out. In the Licensing Acts of trie States there are whole pages setting )forth how a local option poll is to be taken ; and the amendment would be inoperative owing to the absence of any provisions of the kind. To some extent the amendment is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> in that it proposes that it shall come into operation &#34; from the commencement of this Act.&#34; The territory is not accepted from the commencement of the Act, but only when the acceptance proclamation is issued. </para>

                        <para>- No ; clause 2 provides that the Act shall commence on a day to be fixed by proclamation, but the territory is not accepted on the issue of that proclamation. By clause  5,  the Governor-General is authorized to declare by proclamation that, &#34; on and from a day to be fixed by the proclamation,&#34; the territory surrendered is accepted. The Bill first comes into force under clause 2, but the acceptance, which gives us jurisdiction and brings our laws into operation, only takes place when a proclamation is issued accepting the territory. As a matter of fact&#34; the amendment declares that local option is to come into operation at a time when we have no jurisdiction over the territory. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt; I am merely pointing out that the amendment, as submitted, will be utterly inoperative. However, the main objection I have is that we are not now, as in the case of Papua, providing a complete Constitution, and that, if we accept this amendment, there is no machinery by which it can be brought into operation. If the amendment is anything, it is simply a ban on the issue of licences by the State. </para>

                    <para>.- Under the State &#39; laws, local option is in operation in the territory at the present time ; and, if we accept this amendment, we shall find ourselves absolutely without any machinery by which we could register the will of the inhabitants. The very object aimed at may be defeated, owing to the fact that, by this amendment, we wipe out the law of the State. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the State law is not as complete as it might be, and that I am in favour of an absolute majority prevailing. If, at the proper time, the honorable member for Cook will move an amendment in favour of the change I have indicated I shall support him, or, if he takes no action, I will move it myself. </para>

                        <para>- Such a suggestion would be absurd from anybody but the honorable member for Cook. Does he think for one moment that we shall allow ten years to elapse without passing any Act for the government of the territory ? The amendment is premature, and is proposed in the wrong Bill. Moreover, if the amendment be carried, it will prejudice and endanger the measure, and I believe that that is one of &#39;the principal reasons of the honorable member for Gippsland in submitting it. I point out that if this amendment be made, the Bill will have to be sent back to another place, and will, probably, not be passed this session. </para>

                    <para>.- There is one point that seems to have been overlooked. It must be presumed that there are some hotels at the present time within the selected area, and that the licensees possess certain rights conferred on them by State law. If we pass this amendment, we shall immediately deprive those people of rights for which some of them may have paid considerable sums of money. That, it seems to me, would be grossly unjust ; and, for this reason alone, we ought to reject the amendment. No reason has been given why Parliament should destroy existing rights, created under State law, without some provision for compensation. As I interjected when the Attorney-General was speaking, the amendment appears to me to limit the powers conferred by subclause 2 of clause 6, by which the existing authority is continued in the Governor-General, or whoever may represent the Commonwealth. On this and on other 6472 <inline font-style="italic">Seat of Government</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Acceptance Bill.</inline> grounds I object to a proposal of this kind being embodied in the Bill. It will be time enough, when we get possession of the territory, to initiate what is called domestic legislation. If the amendment is carried, some honorable member may be tempted to make the provision more ridiculous by moving that all public houses shall be closed at  4  o&#39;clock in the afternoon. </para>

It is to the credit of the Minister of Defence, however, that the Bill has reached its present stage. This Bill has been sent to us from another place, and evidently we are to accept it holus-bolus - to make this Chamber merely a registering body of the decisions of another place. We are told that if the slightest amendment is made in the Bill, and it has to go back to another place, it will be lost, because there will be no time to deal with it. That is not a fair position to put us in. If the Minister says that no amendment, however reasonable, is to be accepted, had we not better decide that this discussion should not continue? I want to point out to the Attorney-General a necessary amendment. The Bill now provides for two proclamations. </para>

                        <para>- But look at the terrible danger, that if a few extra words are put into the Bill, the Senate, according to the honorable member for Nepean, will not have time to consider it ! Apparently we cannot even meet an obvious technical difficulty.. Clause  2  necessitates one proclamation ratifying and confirming the agreement, and clause  5  another accepting the territory, while clause 6 refers us to the proclamation day, without stating whether it is the proclamation under clause  2  or clause  5.  It has remained for the Attorney-General in the course of the debate to discover that two proclamations are necessary. </para>

                        <para>- But it will be necessary to specify in clause 6 which proclamation day is meant. Another argument of the honorable member for Coolgardie is that the amendment will mean immediate prohibition, and he does not want the hotels to be closed. I understand that the honorable members for Maribyrnong and Nepean do want hotels to be closed, but the honorable member for Nepean, with his knowledge of New South Wales law, admits that the hotels cannot be closed for a period of about eight years. </para>

                        <para>- I understood that there were six hotels and two wine bars. That might be a very proper reason why we should not select that district at all. We might wish to choose another part of New South Wales, where the&#39; awful injustice pointed out by the honorable member for Cool gar die of being able to close hotels without compensation might be avoided. The amendment as amended gives the Government power by regulation to put into force the machinery about which the honorable member for Nepean is so anxious. The honorable member for Nepean and the honorable member for Werriwa will have something to answer for if they refuse to vote for an amendment which would insure the Federal territory being a temperance district, and give its inhabitants the right to decide whether it should contain any hotels. The honorable member for Calare will also be undoubtedly on the side of temperance. I hope that all those honorable members will show that their temperance principles are not only for the platform, but are also occasionally to be put into legislation. </para>

                        <para>- The New South Wales laws will be in force in the territory until the Constitution is passed, and any application for a licence in the district will have to be granted under the local option provisions of the New South Wales law. I understand from the honorable member for Werriwa that there is only one hotel at present in the territory, and it has passed through the local option system. In the circumstances, seeing that no new licences can be granted except by a local option vote, and that the Government will next session introduce a Constitution for the territory, the Committee might fairly reject the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- There are many provisions which I should like to see embodied in any law for the government of the Federal territory. It is important, for example, that no public lands in the territory should be sold. If I had to choose between the two, I would as soon choose land nationalization as prohibition, although I favour both, but if, before we undertake to frame a Constitution for the territory, we are going to lay down every principle that we think ought to be embodied in it, it will be impossible to pass this Bill during the life of this Parliament. As a temperance man, I have not sufficient confidence in the honorable member who moved this amendment to constitute him my leader upon the temperance question. </para>

                        <para>- It is essential to settle the site first. We can very soon afterwards settle the question of temperance. The honorable member for Cook was not quite correct with regard to the rights that a hotelkeeper gets under the New South Wales local option law. Those who wanted to secure a period of eight years before their hotels could be closed had to obtain a lease before a certain day, which expired two years ago. No licensee could get an eight-years&#39; right by obtaining a lease now. I think every honorable member who is opposed to the liquor traffic would be satisfied to accept an assurance from the Minister that, pending the passing of a Constitution for the territory, the Government will oppose the granting of any further licences there. </para>

                    <para>.- It is a piece of gratuitous impertinence on the part of the Minister of Defence to suggest that I moved this amendment for the express purpose of destroying the Bill. Since the Fusion came about, we have not had many such exhibitions of his temper, but it was characteristic of him, and he was as usual absolutely incorrect. I had no thought of the effect of the amendment on the Bill. When the amendments were circulated, I decided that I would support this one. It was discovered to-day that the proper place to move it was clause  6,  and, as the honorable member for Maribyrnong was not in the chamber, I took the liberty of moving it for him. If it were my intention to destroy the Bill, I should not have the faintest hesitation about saying so; but the fact that the moving of the amendment may delay the passing of the measure will not deter me from trying to insert a provision which I think should be in the agreement. Parliament will not be in a position to make laws respecting the Federal territory between the end of the year and next July, and I wish to prevent the creation within that time of vested interests which it will cost something to buy out. With the permission of the Committee, I shall alter my amendment so as to provide for the insertion of the word &#34; new &#34; between the word &#34; no &#34; and the word &#34; licence.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The various States at the present time are spending a good deal of money in reducing the number of licensed houses. The licensing of an hotel creates a vested interest, not for the benefit of the person who makes the business, but for the benefit of the owner of the property. </para>

                        <para>- I desire that no person shall be allowed to sell &#34; stagger juice&#34; in the Commonwealth territory unless by Commonwealth licence. No doubt the Minister means well, but I remember a case in Augusta, Maine, in which a man proceeded to sell &#39; &#39; stagger juice &#34; in bulk, in defiance of the State prohibition law. The Supreme Court decided that he could not be prevented from doing this if he did not put up the liquor within the State. The reason why prohibition has failed in many of the States of America is that vested interests have constantly interfered. The liquor traffic is one of the most profitable businesses in the world. We reformers believe in so regulating it that its profits may go towards the reduction of taxation, and that the business may be made respectable, and cease to create drunkards. My fear in this instance is that the opportunity to make boodle may induce the issuing of new licences in the Federal territory before we can take charge of it. </para>

                        <para>- I should be the last to reflect on the honorable member. A great deal of drinking goes on in Australia, and we should nip in the bud attempts&#39; to push the liquor traffic in the Federal territory. The honorable member for Nepean is a great temperance advocate, and I appeal to him to give effect to his principles by preventing the sale of drink there. Whatever may be the State law, we should deal with this matter by means of a Commonwealth law. Apparently, the honorable member for Nepean thinks that this is not the proper time to do so. He appears to be under the impression that the carrying of the amendment would endanger the Bill, because if there were delay there would not be time to secure its due consideration by the Senate before prorogation. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Maribyrnong originally proposed to insert this amendment in the Bill by way of a new clause, and in his absence it was moved by way of amendment to clause 6 by the honorable member for Gippsland. I have not heard the honorable member for Maribyrnong say, however, that he desires that it shall be withdrawn. If the proposal is a bad one, honorable members should take the responsibility of voting against it; if it is a good one, they ought to vote for it. Surely it ought not to be said that we should not discuss this question, inasmuch as to do so may mean delay in passing the Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to make a personal explanation. Whilst the division on the motion &#34; that the question be now put &#34; was being taken, the Minister of Defence accused me of bad faith in the matter of an agreement which he said had been made last night to dispose of this Bill by  1  o&#39;clock to-day. I refer the honorable member to the honorable member for Wentworth, who was acting for the Government Whip last night, in support of my statement that I made no such arrangement. All that I said was that I should do my utmost to restrict debate on this matter. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to explain that I placed the new clause, in my name, on the notice-paper, after consultation with a number of temperance members, and with the Prime Minister, who has been associated with me in Alliance work for many years. I found that the State laws were quite effective until such time as the Constitution was applied, and also that the clause as I proposed it was not nearly so comprehensive as I desired it should be. I mentioned that fact to a number of temperance members, and they offered no objection to my withdrawing the motion. I did not speak to the honorable member for Gippsland, because he has not been associated with me in temperance work ; otherwise, I should have gladly done so. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister of Home Affairs has done perfectly right in submitting this amendment. For the sake of expedition, the Bill was introduced in another place with the schedule in blank, as the agreement at that time had not been finally settled. We telephoned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> about the matter one night, and it was understood that to avoid delay the signatures would not be witnessed. Afterwards it was thought better in Sydney that the agreement should be witnessed ; and in the Bill before the New South Wales Parliament, the signatures and witnesses appear. For the sake of conformity, I said it would be better to have the witnessing clause in the Bill now before us, though I do not think they are essential, if the body of the agreement is adopted by Parliament.

                    <para>. - The agreement has not yet been passed by the New South Wales Parliament, and, even if we do ratify the agreement without these words, it would not be invalidated. However, it would be better to have the non-essential terms of the two agreements the same if opportunity afforded. As I have already pointed out, the agreement had not been signed when the Bill was before the Senate, but it was understood that the testimonium was not essential. If the signatures do appear in the New South Wales Bill they can be omitted. I point out that the agreement in the schedule is only a record of the terms, and that it is not essential to include the signatures. There might be no agreement in the schedule, and reference might be made to an agreement orally entered into. </para>

                    <para>.- Through the action of the Ministry just before lunch, I was deprived of an opportunity to speak on a question then before the Chair. Although I am in favour of the closure being used in a proper manner upon any honorable member who is considered to be abusing the time of the House, I do not think it should be used upon every member when an important measure of this kind is under discussion. I shall not oppose the third reading, but at the same time I hope the Ministry, when using the closure, will in future consider all the members of the House. I was not consulted by either of the whips in regard to an agreement to close the debate at 1 o&#39;clock, but I suppose the whips consider themselves the masters of the House, although in a division each of them, like other members, has only one vote. Personally, I never make an agreement of that kind. If honorable members want to vote, they should be here when the division is taken, and that should be when the House has debated the question and concluded its business in a business-like way. It is not right for members to go away on pleasure or business and come back to vote at a time fixed upon by the whips. </para>

                        <para>-  On a point of order, can you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> accept the motion for the third reading of the Bill to-day ? A motion for the suspension of any standing order, if it appears on the notice-paper, can be carried by a simple majority of voices, but if it is moved without notice it must be carried by an absolute majority. When the motion of the Prime Minister was put just now, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports cried &#34;No.&#34; and, there fore, as no division was taken, it cannot be said that the motion was carried by an absolute majority. </para>

It is merely a measure to apply to the taking of referenda the new provisions with regard to postal voting, and other matters provided for in the Electoral Bill passed yesterday. Communications have been sent by the Prime Minister to the Queensland Premier regarding the State referendum in Queensland, but a reply has not yet been received. </para>

                    <para>. - A promise was made some time ago by the present Minister of External Affairs, the honorable member for Darling Downs, when Minister of Home Affairs in the last Deakin Administration, and, I believe, assented to by the Prime Minister, that no State referendum should be allowed to take place at a Federal election. A referendum on such a question as Bible reading in State schools would bring a very bitter sectarian issue into a Federal election, and that should certainly not be allowed. If I had time to look it up, I think I could find in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a distinct promise on the subject by the honorable member for Darling Downs. </para>

                    <para>. - I deprecate the discussion of this question at this moment ; but it will probably meet the situation if I explain the position of affairs. I am informed that the honorable member for Corio is incorrect in attributing such a statement to the Minister of External Affairs. The statement was made, I understand, by the Treasurer of the previous Administration - the honorable member for Hume. It was made spontaneously, and expressed his views at the time. We have called attention on more than one occasion to the difficulties inevitably associated with the taking of a vote on a State question at a Federal election by Federal officials. Some little time ago, we received a reply minimizing the objections, and, after consultation with the Minister of Home Affairs and his officials, replied to the effect that the taking of a State referendum by Federal officials in voting places dedicated to Federal purposes would lead to confusion, especially when as in the present instance, probably two other referenda will be submitted. A State referendum should be taken under the State law by State officials, in State polling places, separate from ours. If this is done, our responsibility in the matter will be nil. So long as Federal officers are not employed, and Federal polling booths are not used, we can have nothing to say. </para>

                        <para>- I think that there have been two. I made a communication to the Queensland Government on the subject, but up to the time I left office received no reply, and presume that my predecessor in office was treated in the same way. Various phases of the question were discussed, and there was a changing of ground. A third party intervened, a gentleman representing the Bible in State Schools League. He called on me casually, and afterwards sent along a memorandum with all the statements of which I did not agree, and I told. him so. The interview was not official in the strict sense of the term. I am entirely with the Prime Minister in this matter. It is most undesirable that State issues should be raised to complicate Federal elections, especially when Federal referenda will make matters very perplexing to the ordinary elector. </para>

                    <para>- The State elections are likely to take place shortly after the Commonwealth elections, and, therefore, the Government does not intend to agree to the proposal. In my opinion, it would not be wise to allow any matter savouring of sectarianism to be mixed up with Federal politics. </para>

                <para>The Queensland Government were informed by that announcement of the views of the Commonwealth Government, and I hope that the present Ministry will stand by the position then taken up. If necessary, we should put into the Bill words which will prohibit the taking of the State referendum in connexion with the Commonwealth elections. It will be very dangerous to allow State and Federal politics to become mixed. The Premier of Victoria wished to save State members from embarrassment by providing for a referendum on a State question to be taken at a Federal election. If we permit the Queensland referendum to be taken during the next election, we shall on future occasions have  all  kinds of State questions submitted to the electors at Commonwealth elections, and it  will  be impossible for them to decide between the Commonwealth and State functions. If during my candidature I am asked if I believe in permitting the Bible to be read in State schools, and reply that the question is not of Commonwealth concern, I shall be thought by many to be sitting on a fence, while if I define my position I shall have to spoil  a  speech dealing with Commonwealth politics by an expedition into the field of State politics. I take it from what the Prime Minister has stated that no part of the Federal electoral machinery will be used for the Queensland referendum. </para>

                        <para>- I pity the Queensland candidates who try to gain seats in this House at the coming election, because the State question will be made a burning one, and will cause them trouble, whatever their views may be. We should insist upon the State referendum being taken in different buildings from those used for the Commonwealth referendum and voting, even though that may necessitate a large additional expense. The introduction of this question will interfere with the proper expression of the views of the Queensland people on Commonwealth issues. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but I cannot help recalling the fact that the Minister, when this Bill was previously before us, took a very strong stand against the clause being amended in this way. He suggested that the High Commissioner might desire to accept the office of  President  of the Royal Colonial Institute, or an honorary position in an organization having for its object the strengthening of the Empire. Indeed, he grew quite eloquent in his support of the clause as it stood. We now find him, without explaining his change of attitude, inviting the Committee to agree to an amendment which completely blots out the speech that he then made. He seems to have accepted the statement made recently by the right honorable member for East Sydney that the advantage of turning a complete somersault is that when one does so, one lands on one&#39;s feet. If my honorable friend has somersaulted in this case the Opposition have no cause to complain, but I thought it well to bring the fact before the Committee. </para>

It has been submitted to the law officers, who desire that it shall be placed in strict legal phraseology. I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>.- I think the Committee might well accept the amendment made by the Senate. It seems to me to express clearly enough the intention of another place. It is rumoured that,&#39; although the Government applied the &#34; gag &#34; during the second reading of this Bill, they are not so anxious to have it finally dealt with as they would have led us to believe at that time. The motion submitted by the Minister suggests that they desire to waste a little more time. If it is agreed to, the Bill will have to be returned to the Senate, and there will be another discussion upon it there. </para>

                        <para>- Why not accept the Senate&#39;s amendment? The Minister, who is a lawyer, wishes to have it framed in legal phraseology. The less we have of legal phraseology in our Acts of Parliament, the better. If more conventional English were used there would be less litigation. The length of time that has been allowed to elapse between the passing of the Bill by another place and the presentation of its amendments for our. consideration does not suggest that the Government are in such a hurry to dispose of it as they would have us believe. I shall object to the Minister&#39;s proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause was discussed at length when the Bill was originally before us, and the Minister was then very certain of his position. Indeed, he is always so certain in regard to every matter that he brings forward that I am beginning to have doubts as to his confidence. On the occasion in question, he would not accept even the most trivial amendment. It was quite out of the question to suggest the dotting of an &#34; i &#34; or the crossing of a &#34; t.&#34; The Senate has made a common-place amendment, and the honorable gentleman now says, &#34;No, that will not suit me, I wish to put the amendment in other words.&#34; If we agree to his proposal, the Senate may make a further amendment. This is mere pettifogging business. The clause, as  certain course was advised by the Attorney)  General as absolutely necessary. </para>

                    <para>.- This is an extraordinary .procedure on the part of the Government. It might be well to point out the history of the measure. The Prime Minister had an intimation from me that it was regarded as a non-party measure, and that we should help to get it through at the earliest moment. He closured the second-reading debate before I spoke on it; the Bill was put through, and sent to the Senate. It came back from the Senate, with a few technical amendments, on the 15th October. We are &#34;now at the 26th November. Again and again in the meantime&#39; I have asked the Minister in charge of the measure why it was not brought on. </para>

                        <para>- I will leave it at that. The Senate has sent back an amendment to make the latter part of clause 7 read in this way, &#34; or hold or exercise any other employment, whether within or without the Commonwealth.&#34; The Government decline to take the Senate&#39;s wording, and propose to strike out the words &#34; or exercise,&#34; with a view to insert after the word &#34;employment &#34; the words &#34;or engage in any business,&#34; so making the paragraph read: &#34;or hold any other employment or engage in any business..... &#34; What is the difference between &#34; exercise any other employment &#39; &#39; and &#34; hold any other employment or engage in any business&#34;? The latter is simply a roundabout way of saying the same thing,  and all this is the result of six weeks&#39; cogitation on the part of the Government, the law officers, and all the machinery of the Department. There is not an honorable member in the Committee who seriously believes in .the good intentions of the Government in .this matter. I make that charge in the plainest possible language. The action of the Government is a mere device to palter with a great question. It is- being shuffled backwards and forwards by a Government who seem to have a greater wish to delay the measure, which they declare to be urgent, than to act on those straightforward lines which one would expect a Government with any grit at all to follow. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to say that he does not, and, further than that, as the honorable member for -Gippsland says, the Prime Minister will not get up and attempt to defend it. It is an obvious shuffle for delay, in order to keep the measure on the business-paper until the last day of the session. It could be just as easily passed now as then. Speaking as a layman, I think the words proposed by the Senate are far more definite and distinct than those proposed by the Ministry. To shuffle about the mere wording of a clause for the sake of a little delay is not worthy of the governing body of this Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - It is a great pity that, after we have waited so many years for the passage of this very important measure, it should be hung up for a paltry quibble as to the difference between, the meaning of one or two words. The Cabinet is full of legal minds, and surely they ought to be able to show us the difference, in this c!ase, between tweedledum and tweedledee. If they wanted a different wording to be used, they should have had it inserted in another place. At this late stage of the session the Government might well accept the Senate&#39;s amendment. It is unimportant, because whoever is appointed will be a gentleman of such high standing that he would never he on the look-out for a loophole or .pretext to evade the plain intention of the Act. We do not require to hedge him. round so .carefully. It would be sufficient for the Government .to fell him that they expected him not to engage in other occupations, or, in other words, become a guinea-pig. Any of those whose names have been suggested privately for the position could be safely trusted. The Government must have some other motive for their action to-day. The English language is so copious that a number of words with practically the same meaning can be found. There must be an untold reason why the Government are asking the Federal Parliament to argue as to which of two or three words with practically the same meaning shall be selected. The Opposition cannot be charged with delaying business in this case, for we are eager to help the Government through- with the Bill and finish up the business of the session. Why this quibbling over words, instead of passing the measure into law? It is important that it should be passed, so that the appointment can be made before the&#39; prorogation, but this is a way of preventing that being done. </para>

                    <para>.- This is the first opportunity I have had of saying a word on this important measure. I was not previously permitted .to express my opinion as a representative of the people, for it was on that notable occasion that the Prime Minister decided to put a stop to the discussion. The Government objected then to <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> exercising my right, and they are objecting now to the insertion of the word &#34;exercise.&#34; Why? The object of the amendment of the Senate is to insure that whoever takes this high position will not accept commissions and undertake all kinds of business outside his office. </para>

The Opposition are trying to help the Government to expedite business at this late stage of the session, but the Government are throwing obstacles in the way. The Minister of Home Affairs appealed recently to honorable members not to amend the Electoral Bill or the Seat of Government Acceptance Bill, because there would be no time for the Senate to deal with the amendments. If that argument was a good one in those cases, surely it is good in this. The Government are straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel.

The intention of the Senate was to prevent the High Commissioner engaging in any business outside his office. The amendment now before us was made, and it was understood at the time that if it did not carry out the Senate&#39;s intention the Government would put it in proper legal form. As it now reads, it says, &#34; or exercise any other employment.&#34; The word &#34; employment &#34; suggests that a man is employed by somebody, and the prohibition was intended to apply, not merely to employment by somebody- </para>

It is clearly impossible to terminate the session next week; but, with great assiduity, we may accomplish what remains to be done by the week after, lt may be some consolation to those who may have to remain here to know that there is a possibility that the existing railway conveniences may be limited by then. The business remaining on our notice-paper consists mostly of measures which have been received from another place, in which party considerations are not involved. They are practical business measures, and there is no reason to suppose that they cannot be disposed of during a few days of, perhaps, long and steady sitting. In addition, there will be the Bill for which the Governor-General recommends appropriation in the message just read. Time must be allowed for whatever debate may be found necessary in connexion with it. I do not despair of being able, with the assistance of honorable members, to satisfactorily complete the business of the session within about a fortnight. </para>

                        H. Moore, Sydney manager of Messrs. A. Kethel and Co., whose mines are to be worked by the Miners&#39; Federation, stated to-day that his company was in no way connected with the Newcastle vend or Defence Association. Further, he added, &#34;We have no grievance with our miners, or they with us. We maintain that we have every right to work our collieries should we think fit. I might mention that the Sydney coal merchants, who all handle the vend coal, and the Inter-State shipping and coal companies have during the past twelve months lent every effort to crush our firm out of the trade. We can quote instances, if necessary, where the vend refused to load cargoes if our Wallsend coal formed part of such cargo. Another instance of the tactics adopted by the vend was when it refused to load its coal as cargo because our coat formed part of the bunkers of steamers, hot a ton being despatched as cargo. The predicament caused by such selfish action can well be imagined. Should the Commonwealth Government ever desire to inquire into the methods of the vend and certain steam-ship companies in regard to the restriction placed upon Inter-State and oversea trade by their combined action - and .such inquiry certainly should be made - we shall be most happy to support our statements by instancing cases in which our trade has been hampered by the methods I have mentioned.&#34;

                    <para>.- I wish to say a few words regarding a very important subject, the inspection of produce passing from State to State. It is high time that the Federation took this matter into its hands, by appointing inspectors who could do the work impartially, and give general satisfaction. I should have liked to bring this matter before the House in a form which would have enabled honorable members to vote on a definite proposal, and have been urged by many public bodies to do so ; but, as there is no opportunity for that, I am forced to take this action. I hope that the Government will look very closely into the matter, and see whether it cannot, provide for Commonwealth inspection in the immediate future. The past season has been so unsatisfactory to producers that the Commonwealth should begin to create machinery for dealing with the business of next season. A most peculiar position has been created. In practically all the States, the same diseases are attacking vegetable produce, and yet, one State will not accept sound produce from another, alleging that it must prevent the introduction of disease. By this action, not only are the producers affected, but the consumers, and those who handle produce, are also injured, great monetary loss being entailed. A most un-Federal feeling is also being produced. When men send sound .produce from their State to another and have it rejected, and are convinced that there is being consumed within that State inferior locally-grown produce, they cannot help thinking that they have gained nothing by Federation. Did time permit, I could quote a number of instances in which injustice has been done; but I dc not wish to detain honorable members unduly. </para>

                        <para>- Something must b; done at once. The establishment of the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau is far in the future, and we must deal with this <inline font-style="italic">matter</inline> before  next sseason-.  It is true that New South Wales has just removed her embargo on produce coming from Victoria and the other States ; but as she has no potatoes of her own at the present time, her inspectors may now pass potatoes which, in April next, when there is a local crop, may be condemned. The action of the State Governments this season has been disastrous so far as many producers are concerned, and should teach us a lesson. Having read the opinion of the Attorney-General, I am afraid that the Quarantine Act does not empower the Commonwealth Government to deal with this matter by proclamation. Therefore, it is the duty of Ministers to propose an amendment of the law which will enable us to provide, at the first opportunity, for proper inspection. </para>

The statement that the honorable member for West Sydney is encouraging the men in their contumacy is a deliberate and absolute lie. The honorable member for West Sydney, and I, are interested in the same organization. He is the  President  and I am the Vice-President of it. and as one who is behind the scenes I have no hesitation in saying that there is absolutely no foundation in fact for the statement concerning him of which I complain. I give it an unqualified denial.

                        <para>- I am prepared to assist him in expediting public business, but I should like to clearly understand whether or not the Government, in dealing with important questions, and more especially the Naval Loan Bill, are going to display that impartiality which ought to dominate their control of the House. If I receive fair play 1 shall not avail myself of the forms of the House to prevent any honorable member from expressing his opinions. But in justification of a certain action that I took in the House early this week, I desire to explain that I was led to do so because of the belief that the &#34;gag&#34; had been used unfairly, not only to curtail discussion, but to penalize certain honorable members in the discharge of what they conceive to be their public duties. So long as the. Government deal fairly with honorable members generally I shall take no action; but if they continue the conduct of which I complain, I shall have to persevere and show that this weapon of the &#34;gag&#34; is used- for the persecution of some honorable members.. I know of no Legislature within the British realm where there exists such a closure resolution as we have in operation in this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I did not support it. I was not present when it was passed ; had I been I should have opposed it. I have never supported the &#34;gag,&#34; and do not believe in it. I think that honorable members have a full sense of the responsibility of their position and recognise the reasonableness of the desire of a Government to push on with public business. In the New South Wales Legislative Assembly the closure cannot be applied to an individual member unless a .majority of those present approve of its application, and a still larger majority is necessary to permit of the application of the &#34; gag &#34; to the general question. In this way honorable members are safeguarded against the unreasonable use of a weapon which, I admit, is necessary, although not to the extent to which it has been employed by the Government in this House. If the debate on the Naval Loan Bill is not going to be one-sided  1  shall be satisfied ; but I shall certainly protest if we have a repetition of the action of the Government in connexion with the consideration of a measure recently before us. On the occasion to which I refei, three honorable members on the Government side of the House, having practically voted against their expressed convictions, desired naturally to put their position before the country. The Government connived at securing for them an opportunity to make a statement, but as soon as they had done so, and the Leader of the Opposition rose to speak, the &#34; gag&#34; was at once applied.&#39; That was palpably an act of persecution. When the weapon- is so used resentment must be expected. If the Government are prepared to play the game fairly, I am. But if they attempt to use the &#34; gag,&#34; as they have done, as an instrument of oppression, I shall resist their efforts as far as possible, and shall not hesitate to repeat what I have done in this connexion. I sound .this note of warning, because I am determined to secure fair play. </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable member has been misled, and has got off his usual track. In that he has my sympathy. As for the statement made bv the honorable member for Herbert, I think it cruel that an honorable member who is doing his best to bring about a peaceful settlement of a dispute that threatens the whole of the commerce of Australia - who is endeavouring to have it dealt with by legitimate methods according to the laws of the country, and to frustrate extremists who might take steps that would be disastrous to the country - should be assailed as the honorable member for West Sydney has been. The honorable member is trying to settle a great difficulty, and in dealing with it has displayed ability and capacity such as no other honorable member could show. Every encouragement should be given him in his endeavour to bring the dispute to a satisfactory issue without resort to violence, such as would probably have occurred had he not been called to the position that he now holds, and acted as a mediator. As a member of the Labour party, as a man having some interest in the welfare of the masses, and of the commerce of Australia generally, I resent these insults hurled at a man who is deserving of credit for the stupendous efforts he is making, notwithstanding that he is hot in the best of health, to combat a grave public difficulty. </para>

                    <para>. - In reference to the remarks of the honorable member for Darwin, I do not think it necessary to add to what the Prime Minister said this morning. If a carrier engaged in Inter-State business is interfering with trade and commerce between the States by failing to give fair and reasonable facilities for traffic, his being a State authority does not exempt him -from the application of the Trade and Commerce section. As to the other matter to which reference has been made, I may say that I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> H. Moore&#39;s statement, as published in the press this morning. I read all these matters, and after perusing the paragraph in question I gave instructions to the Crown Solicitor to communicate with that gentleman. The honorable member for Wilmot has raised the question as to whether we should not either bring into force the provisions of the Quarantine Act or pass legislation extending them. I do not think that the whole field in relation to this matter is covered by section 13 of the Quarantine Act; but it is rather late now to consider the advisableness of amending that statute. It would require a great deal of .care and an ample staff of supervisors to supersede the State jurisdiction. </para>

The honorable member for Gwydir made some remarks concerning the application of the closure a &#39; day or two ago, but as his observations were largely in the nature of a personal explanation, I did not think it well at the time to draw attention to the fact I have mentioned. I do so now in order that honorable members may understand that the fact that the honorable member was allowed to refer to the matter in the way he did is not to be taken as constituting a precedent. </para>
