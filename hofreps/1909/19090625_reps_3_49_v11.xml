                    <para> - The leader of the Opposition, as an ex-Treasurer, is aware of the position in which the present Treasurer will be placed on the  30th  of this month if Supply is not granted.. The votes which have been passed will lapse, and there will be no money in hand to pay ordinary, current expenses. I refer, not merely to the salaries of the public servants, which will not become due until the middle of July, but to a large number of incidental undertakings on which day labour is employed, whose . obligations become due day by day. As the honorable member understands these difficulties as well as I do, I shall be glad if he will see his way to allow us to pass a Supply Bill to-day, so that the Senate may deal with it oh Wednesday next. We shall then be in a position, on the first day of the next financial year, to telegraph to our officers in the various States that provision will be made for the payment of the services of their various departments.</para>

                        <para> - In both those cases the position was quite exceptional. I do not think that there is any real, urgency for the passing of a Supply Bill, because sufficient money has been voted to meet all expenditure up to the end of this month, which concludes the financial year. Therefore, no liabilities which cannot be met will fall due until about the middle of July, and on previous occasions it has been the middle of a month before Supply has been granted. It is true that the Treasurer may have no parliamentary guarantee that liabilities incurred will be met, but he may be sure that necessary services wilt be paid for, as on other occasions. I do not think that a Supply Bill should be proceeded with to-day. ' The Treasurer said last night- the statement has since been corrected - that a Supply Bill is necessary to pay old-age pensions on  1st  July.</para>

                    <para>. - I have not yet taken part in the debates of this session, and did not intend to do so until the motion for the adoption of an Address-in-Reply was being debated. But as the Opposition is now making its main attack upon the Government and its supporters, chiefly on the ground of inconsistency, I think it well to take this opportunity to give my views in regard to certain phases of the action, of those who are opposing us, and particularly respecting the programme of the Labour Party. As fair-minded men, the members of that party should be prepared to give the same treatment as they have received. For eight years the party has been the spoiled child of the House, and now expects  different treatment from that which it has meted out to others. Although members of the party have been squealing throughout the country because ,the Fisher Government was put out of office before it could introduce a Bill, this motion of want of confidence was moved before the present Government had such an opportunity. Another ground of complaint seems to be that no reason was given for the dismissal of the Fisher Government. But the Labour Party gave no reason for combining with the then Opposition to defeat the late Deakin Government. The vindictiveness and abuse poured out by the exAttorneyGeneral throughout the country recalls forcibly the phrase in which he was described on a previous occasion of the kind as " screaming because he was being taken away too early from the political tart shop." The Labour Party is acting a childish and ridiculous part. Children, when they behave in this way, usually receive a good smacking, and I should like to have a hand in smacking the Labour Party. Some of its members are already, by their uproar, squealing in anticipation of the punishment. I have here the official report of their fourth Commonwealth political conference, which was opened at the Trades Hall, Brisbane, on 6tb July, 1908. It is officially published by the Honorable" <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hinchcliffe,</inline> M.L.C., Secretary to the Conference, and a member of one of those bodies which the party professes great anxiety to abolish. I notice, too, that the Victorian State Labour Party, at its Easter conference, accepted a proposal of the Hampden branch that a plank of the platform for the next election should be a referendum as to the abolition of the Legislative Assembly. Apparently, it is proposed in Victoria to sweep away both Council and Assembly, notwithstanding that the latter is elected on an adult suffrage. This would leave public matters to be controlled entirely by the secret and unrepresentative caucus which meets at the Trades Hall. The platform of the Labour Party has to be signed by men who do not believe in it, and to be supported by men who have condemned several of its planks. Every one of its good planks has been stolen from the Liberals, and members of the party at times have done their best to destroy them. Labour members are pledged on all questions affecting the platform to vote as a majority of the parliamentary party, may decide at a duly constituted caucus meeting. That pledge they have to sign. Should the caucus at any time decide that the fiscal question is covered by the words "new protection" - and new protection must depend on old protection - the party would do its best to secure free-traders by leaving fiscalism and the Tariff alone, because if the fiscal question were made a distinct issue, a majority of free-traders in the caucus would decide the action of the party. </para>

If I withdraw a statement, I do so because I am sorry to have made it in an assemblage of gentlemen, and I do not subsequently repeat it and glory in it on platforms throughout the country. The only occasion on which I remember the honorable member to have finally and completely withdrawn a statement was in relation to the "six potters," and that statement he withdrew, after a most deliberate speech in the House, in an interview with a newspaper reporter in the lobby. The honorable member, in view of the facts, must be either illogical,, or shutting his eyes to the true meaning of written words, which I shall read - </para>

I can. quite see now why it was that the leader of the Opposition at Gympie said that the country had declared for. Protection " rightly or wrongly." The honorable member was treading on a volcano ; if he had said " rightly," he might have fallen into-the Free-trade abyss, and if he had said "wrongly," the protectionist gulf would have swallowed his party, and I do not know what would have happened. Possibly he might have found that some of the Protectionist members of his party would cast aside the chains of the political machine, and, like some other strong men, relieve themselves of the intolerable pressure placed upon them. </para>

                        <para>- I think I have only to quote from the earlier debates of this House to show that considerable time was taken up by honorable members opposite in the repudiation of men who had formerly been members of their party. It does not matter to me whether the honorable member for Parramatta, the honorable member for Bourke, the honorable member for Batman, the honorable member for Maribyrnong, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> were or were not formerly members of the Labour Party ; but the Opposition evidently think it of much importance that some men have in them the love of liberty developed so strongly that they could not bear the chains and ignominy of the organization any longer; indeed, that is one -of the worst charges that the Opposition can hurl against these supporters of the Government. Up to recently the Victorian members of the Labour Party insisted on a Protectionist plank in their platform, but, at the behest of caucus, which is declared by one of the leading members of the party to be an unrepresentative body, those members are evidently preparing to accept whatever fiscal decision may be arrived at by the majority of their colleagues. Formerly Victorian Labour members had to sign a pledge to support Protection, but at present the four members from Victoria - they are dwindling away - are absolutely at the mercy of members from other States who may hold different fiscal opinions. A Victorian Labour candidate may tell the constituents of Yarra, Melbourne, or Port Melbourne that he is a Protectionist, but he has to admit that he. is only so until a majority of representatives from other constituencies, who may happen to be Free-traders, have decided upon the course to be adopted. I am glad to see that the Labour Party desire to stick as closely as possible to the policy of the Deakin Ministry, and to steal as much as they can of the Liberalism it represents. The honorable member for West Sydney openly gloried in it at his Geelong meeting. The Labour Party have adopted almost entirely the plank of the Deakin Government in regard to compulsory military training, as shown by the following extract from their platform :  - </para>

                        <para>- The first sign of friendship is the absence of bitter asides. The honorable member for Hume with, I am sure, all kindly feeling in his heart, refers to an unfortunate meeting in Geelong, where my voice, in endeavouring to speak to intelligent men and women, was drowned by an organized opposition of members of the Labour ranks. It is, perhaps, because of my inability to express myself as fully and carefully as I would have liked, at Geelong, that I am inflicting these remarks on the House to-day. </para>

                        <para>- The meeting was well worth threepence, because on the occasion in question the late Attorney-General fairly excelled himself by abusing even me. I have heard of a modern American who, on visiting Egypt, stood before the Sphinx, with his fingers to his nose, and on learning that the honorable member for West Sydney at this meeting abused me, one cannot help being surprised at the remarkable audacity of these Labour men. My constituents, who think a 'lot of me, evidently considered it would be good fun to hear Crouch getting a gruelling, and consequently .some of them paid threepence each to enter the meeting. The difficulties of getting an audience were such that their meeting did not start until 8.25 p.m., and I was so anxious to- convert the Labour men that I freely distributed handbills stating that I intended to reply to the innuendoes, abuse, and vindictive statements which constitute the ordinary language of the honorable member for West Sydney. Fully forty Labour men entered my meeting, but I dare say that after hearing my speech, only five Labour men went out ; the rest were converted on the spot. I propose to show why the Labour Party have to agree with the plank in the Deakin platform in regard" to a citizen defence force and compulsory military training. I have here a copy of the official report of the proceedings at the Political Labour Conference, held at Brisbane in July last, and at page 17 I find that the honorable member for Darwin, who attended that conference as a representative of Tasmania, said that Labour - in referring to the question of compulsory military training - proposed to adopt the most diabolical methods of Europe and give the gilt-spurred roosters power to blow a bugle and snatch farmers' sons, business men's sons, and Labour men's sons, and send them to the front. </para>

                        <para>- Of course he has to. He has agreed to the plank of compulsory training, although he is against it. Still another delegate at the Conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey,</inline> M.L.A., of Victoria, declared against compulsion, but he has had to sign the platform. It was 'announced a little while ago that he would be a candidate for the' electorate of Bourke at the next general election, but for a long while he refused to nominate. He held back, and at first I was inclined to think this was due to the fact that he did not want to give up his seat in the State Parliament, and risk being left in outer darkness. I was, perhaps, doing him an injustice.  His  tardiness in coming forward may, perhaps, have been due to the fact that, having declared against compulsory military training, and having declared that the Victorian Labour men were only avowedly protectionist, he could not bring himself to the point of signing the Federal Labour platform, which makes provision for it. It must have required the efforts of every member of his committee to drag him up to sign the pledge. At page 19 of the report of the Conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey</inline> is reported to have said that - </para>

If it will only keep him quiet, I do not mind saying to please him and amuse the House that his political career has, throughout, been, marked by consistency and a regard for the highest principles. This attitude of hostility to compulsory training was taken up, not only at the Brisbane Conference, but elsewhere. At a Labour Congress held in Sydney, in April last, a recommendation from the . clerks'" union that the Congress approve of a system of compulsory military training was rejected. The reports show, further, that a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coulls.</inline> one of the Labour delegates from the Barrier branch of the Amalgamated Miners' Association, said - </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the honorable member for 'Adelaide is rather sore because I have not responded to his interjection that I would never be shot in defence of my country. I hope that I never shall be shot. I would certainly be prepared to defend my country whenever the occasion arose, but it is a mistake for any one to imagine that I have any desire to be shot. In case there is any doubt on he subject, I wish to emphatically declare I am not going to be shot if I can help it. The honorable member's interjection reminds me that as the representative of Adelaide in this House, he succeeded a great man, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Cameron Kingston, and 'that he poses as " Kingston the Little." It is unfortunate that he never misses an opportunity to send forth his shafts of bitterness, and it is well to remind him that the honorable gentleman whom he has succeeded, and whom he ever attempts to imitate and to parody, never went out of his way to give useless offence to an \ one. Another plank in the Labour Party's platform is that providing for a graduated tax on all estates over .Â£5,000 in value, and on an unimproved basis. That has to be read with another plank providing for " naval and military expenditure to be allotted from proceeds of direct taxation." The two planks read together are utterly inconsistent, and mutually destructive. While they claim that their graduated land tax applies only to estates over Â£5,000 in value, and appeal to the small farmers for support, asserting that no revenue will be obtained from the tax, how are they to allot the Defence expenditure of the Commonwealth, which totals Â£1,700,000, out of the proceeds of direct taxation ? They say that the Defence expenses are to be,,. not paid by, but allotted from, the proceeds of direct taxation, showing that, in their view, the proceeds of direct land taxation are to exceed Â£1,700,000. If so, is it not a farce and a scandal for the members of the Labour Opposition to go round the country stating that the small farmers will not be affected, and that no revenue will be obtained from the land tax?

                        <para>- Hear the contempt being poured by the Labour Party on the small farmers ! It is an echo of the speeches that were made by responsible members of the late Government, objecting to the change of venue of the trial of Tom Mann and others to Albury, where they practically stated that the small farmers would not do them justice. Those Ministers of the Crown, who are now so ready to go up and down the country appealing to the small farmers for support, had at that time so much contempt for them that they declared that they would te prepared to perjure themselves, and violate the oath which every man takes on going into the jury box. The affection for the small farmer has only been developed " on that side in the last ten minutes, but still any development in that direction is refreshing. A <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Thorne, from the New Zealand Trades and Labour Council, is reported to have said at the Melbourne Trades Hall, on 21st May of this year, that one of the worst things that they could do was to create small farmers in New Zealand, because they were against the righteous Labour men.

I am reminded by the honorable member for Cook that the Socialist League is against the Labour Party. I am aware that the Labour Party have these deeper depths to fathom. In fact, it is rapidly becoming the party of the centre. They have now the Socialists on their own flank. That is the reason why many of them are declaring themselves to be Socialists, in order to conciliate both sides ; but they will have to take a very different line of action if they do not declare themselves to be in favour of the platform of the organization known as the Industrial Workers of the World. I have here some of the literature of that body. To show what the honorable member for Wannon and others .have to meet and how necessary it will be for them to come in  out of the wet very quickly and give up the machine, one of these Industrial Workers of the World told me that they are not going to vote for the Labour men at the next election. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Cook is a man who does not want any votes. He never looks after votes. He is wasted in this House, and if he put up in New South Wales for the Senate he would sweep the country. To read his speeches, such, for instance, as the one he delivered last night, would be sufficient indorsement of him to any intelligent or fair-minded constituency. My only fear is that he will come to Corio, but as he does not want votes I am sure that the Industrial Workers of the World will not vote for him. </para>

It is a divergence, but this little redoubt stands in the way, and I have to clear it before resuming the general engagement. In a discussion at the New South Wales Labour Congress, one of the ablest members of the New" South Wales Labour Party ridiculed the representative character of the Federal Conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> saying that - he viewed the Inter-State body as being non-representative, because he found <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spencerepresenting</inline> Western Australia and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts</inline> Tasmania. Then the gathering was held in a haphazard way. It was composed largely of members of Parliament and officials, and when these thirty-six men passed a resolution it was binding on those of the States, and he felt that if some alterations were not made there would* be a split. </para>

New South Wales contains more free-traders than does any other State, and yet this Conference which met to decide the policy of the party, which, should it obtain power, would become the policy of Australia, and' which was supposed to represent all the States equally, gave New South Wales a representation 50 per cent, greater than the representation of Victoria, and 125 percent, greater than that of Tasmania.

                    reply to that was a reference to " the current tripe of united Australia."' A delegate interjected, " That is a nice expression to use." The episode then closed. I wish now to show that Socialism was adopted at the last Victorian Labour Conference, and that the Federal' Labour Party has declared for a most objectionable form of Socialism. The Victorian Labour Party proposes to start farms in opposition to the small farmer. At the Conference held on the 10th April of this year to settle its future programme -

                    <para>At the instance of the Richmond and Hamilton branches it was decided that the following new plank be added : - " The establishment of State farms, mines, factories and shops, for the purpose of affording employment, under Go- 'vernment supervision, to citizens requiring it, the employees to be, as far as possible, the consumers of the wealth they produce and to receive as wages an equivalent of the net total produced." </para>

It would be a monopolist of labour, and if a man were dismissed, he could appeal to no other employer, as no other would exist. Should a butcher come along and ask for work, he would have to take what was offered to him. Under this system, when he asked what his wages would be, the official would tell him that he would be paid from the produce of his labour, getting so many pounds of beef, perhaps a- couple of legs of mutton, and two loin chops and some sausages. A tailor asking for wages would be told, " the job will not run to a pair of trousers weekly, as the Labour Party's wage is only i2s- 6d. a week, but we can give you a leg this week and the other next week." If a farmer asked to be paid in money, he would be told, " We do not believe in coin. ' It is the mark of the exploiter. Besides, it has the King's head upon it.

I find that the first meeting of the Conference took place at Amsterdam in 1904, and the next at Stuttgart in 1907. The Australian Labour Party has declared Socialism to be one of its objectives, while the Social Democratic Federation of England, which will also be represented at the Conference to which the ex-Prime Minister and exAttorneyGeneral - possibly accompanied by the honorable member for Cook as representative of, say, South America - may go, advocates, according to <inline font-style="italic">Modern Socialism,</inline> and its own official platform, among what it considers! immediate political reforms, the abolition of the Monarchy, and among financial and fiscal reforms the repudiation of the national Debt.

                </quote><para class="block">Some of the resolutions passed at the Brisbane Labour Conference are worth reading. The Labour Party professedly stands for labour, and that is a noble aspiration. I think that I myself stand for the best interests of the worker. I am a worker myself, and the son of a worker ; and am proud of it. But when I find reactionary principles adopted by the Labour Party, I can only regard those who follow them, and are deceived by the word " labour," as being foolish and ignorant in the extreme. One of the resolutions passed at that Federal Labour Conference is the severest attack on the rights of the working men we have ever witnessed. In any trade we know that the chance the worker has is by the exercise of his brains and the application of practical methods to introduce new processes; and he is occasionally able to take out a patent and obtain a return for his research. But the Federal Conference passed the following resolution - </para><quote>
                    <para>That the existing Patents Act should be amended to provide no letters patent should protect any patent after the expiration of two years from registration. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">I know that very often a working man does not take out a patent for a new process he may discover ; but, if he does so, it usually takes the greater part of two years before he is able to find capital to develop it. I regret to say that sometimes, though not always, such patents are stolen; but if the resolution I have read were carried into effect, the inventor would never get any return. In the past the Liberal Party have thought it wise, in the face of the opposition of employers, capitalists, and exploiters - the last is a new word of the Opposition for employers - to give a patentee protection for a period of fifteen to twenty-two years; but the Labour Party would wipe out all our Patent Acts, and need not substitute any other, because protection for two- years would be only an encumbrance on ingenuity. </para><interjection>

                </quote><para class="block">It seems to me that the -appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was rather too hurried in the face of such a resolution ; and we know that he is a bold man who dares to defy the red-book Conference. I am sorry, in one way to have to make these remarks; but I must refer to the declaration bv the leader of the Opposition at Gympie in favour of a maximum wage. For the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, the Labour Party had a chance to express themselves as to what they regard as good pay for the worker, and the leader of the Opposition, speaking, not only officially as Prime Minister, but as leader of the Labour Party, said he thought that for skilled artisans and other 'workers over  20  years of age,  12s. 6d.  a week was sufficient. If there is one thing that would lead me to feel that the Labour Party no longer deserve the support of working men, it is that they have become a one-and-ninepenny-a-day party. The proposal, in my opinion, was an outrageous one; and I immediately drew attention to it in Melbourne. The leader of the Opposition, who was then Prime Minister, was not on the spot, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> replied to my communication to the effect that, although the Labour Party proposed  12s. 6d.  a week, the Deakin Government had' proposed nothing. Is that not a splendid justification for the men who depend ore the Labour Party ? Liberal Governments, by whom the Commonwealth has been largely administered, have, always paid their employes, under similar circumstances, on a much higher scale. For instance, every militiaman in camp is paid  8s.  a day, or <inline font-style="italic">Â£2</inline> 16s.  a week for seven davs, and in the arrangement made with the Imperial authorities as to the employment of men on war vessels, the present Prime Minister insisted on  4s. 8d.  to  5s.2d.  a day for those Australians permanently engaged. Now, however, we are told that 1s.9d. a day is the ideal and ultimate aspiration of the Labour Party. Friends of the workers if you like ! In the same speech at Gympie, the leader of the Opposition expressed the opinion that the rate of 8s. 7d. per day, awarded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, was a magnificent proposal, and he lauded that gentleman to the skies. Every time that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins' name is mentioned in Labour circles throughout the Commonwealth it is cheered, and justly so; indeed, the learned gentleman has been almost adopted by the Labour Party,  although he was always a member of the Liberal Party. But I remember the time when the man who is now cheered was opposed, and every effort made by the Labour Party to hound him down and deprive him of his seat in the House. Just before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins was elevated to the High Court Bench, he was faced with a Labour antagonist in his constituency, although he had been Attorney-General in a Labour Government. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins ever did, or ever would, rat on his principles; indeed, I do not know any honorable member on this side of the House who ever did so. Personally, I was elected as a Protectionist, a Democrat, and a Radical; and I see nothing in the programme of the present Government to cause me in the slightest de- gree to deflect from those principles. I go straight ahead, supporting what I think right, opposing what I cannot agree with, and I stated my views to my constituents, and they accepted me without feeling it necessary to ask me to sign any pledge ; but every promise I gave I keep as though I had signed a pledge. It seems to me that those foxes who have lost their tails are extremely sorry to have been in the Labour trap, and would be very glad, indeed, to find a number of others in the same predicament. I recommend members of the Labour Party to visit the Melbourne National Gallery and look at the newly purchased Burne Jones' picture, <inline font-style="italic">The Wheel of Life.</inline> There they will see three or four men bound to an enormous wheel ; these men have nothing to do with the movement of the wheel, but are simply moved by it, just in the same way as the members of the Labour Party are flies on the wheel of their organization. Members of the Labour Party have to sign pledges with which they do not agree. I believe in compulsory military training. If I did not </para>

He deals fairly and freely with his constituents, and they do the same with him. Amongst the Opposition, however, there are honorable members who do not believe in Protection, although they have signed a platform, and have to accept the principle whether they approve of it or not. They are mere atoms in the grip of a great machine. Victims of the machine struggle and writhe, but cannot free themselves from it. They cannot leave it, and the position, in my opinion, is becoming intolerable even to some members of the party.

Is it that he finds it impossible to stand by a system that crushes out a man's independence, strength of intellect, and freedom of conscience, and conviction ? One of the things that is really destroying representation and democracy, is this machine, with its small coteries of men meeting in a secret chamber, and rigorously excluding all but the representatives of their own press. I need say no more. I was born free, and am going to preserve my freedom.

I do not propose to follow the honorable member for Corio in all his references to individuals who are alleged by him to express the opinions of the united Labour Party. I wish only to mention that I am informed he has attributed to labour men remarks made in Sydney by one or two members of the International Socialist party. May I remind the House that the International Socialist party of New South Wales has always opposed the Labour Party, and has run candidates for the Senate in opposition to our men? We shall be quite prepared to accept responsibility for statements, however absurd, made by men who are, or have ever been, associated with our party, provided that the honorable member for Corio and his friends will accept responsibility for the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole,</inline> and those associated with him, that marriage is a luxury, &amp;c. It will be difficult to find authority for many of the honorable member's Statements. Indeed, it would be as difficult for the honorable member to find authority for some of his statements as it was to find him on a celebrated occasion when he volunteered to go to South Africa. It is strange, to say the least, that an honorable member holding such views regarding the Labour Party as he has expressed this morning should have desired to become associated with it. He is here now, has he any reply to make to that statement? If the Labour Party is as bad as he has painted it, why did he wish to join it? </para>

                        <para>- Because we have placed' them on their trial for the abandonment of their pledges. I am afraid, however,, that they have gone so far that it is impossible now to make them wince. They have determined that since they have a majority they will continue, for some months at all events, to flout the will of their constituents, and to refuse them the right to express an opinion regarding their betrayal. That remark does not apply necessarily to every honorable member opposite. I believe that- all have had to make some sacrifices, but the Prime Minister has certainly abandoned the programme upon which he was returned at the last general election. The position is the same in regard to those honorable members who were closely associated with him - the thirteen who carried on the Government of this country by our grace. </para>

He now says he stated that the resolution was one to which no one could take exception.  He tells  us,  however, that the meeting was a rowdy one so that some one must have taken exception to it; but he does not tell us whether he committed himself  in  any way whilst in Western Australia to the presentation of a <inline font-style="italic">Deadnought.</inline></para>

He ought to have taken up that attitude when he was in Western Australia. My objection to the Government is that they have broken faith with their constituents. The Government met Parliament on a Wednesday, and asked for an adjournment, although the House could have met the next day. As soon as they got safely into their offices for three weeks, without the criticism of Parliament, they turned round and pledged Australia to an expenditure of , Â£2,000,000, although the general expression of opinion among the people was against the gift of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline> They flouted Parliament in doing so. </para>

                        <para>- We did so only to this extent, that we saw the time had' arrived to make provision ' for the defence of the Commonwealth. It did not take our Government long to appreciate that fact when' they got into a responsible position, whereas the honorable gentleman and his colleagues were thinking about it for nearly eight years prior to that. It was left to the Labour Party, when they obtained a few months in office, to give the necessary orders to bring into existence the nucleus of an Australian Navy. I am opposed to this Government, who have betrayed the trust of their constituents, on many grounds. I am opposed to them on the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> question, on which they do not represent the feelings of the people. I am opposed to their proposal to sully the name of the Commonwealth by introducing a borrowing system. It is a certainty that they intend to do that. I am opposed to them because they have made no provision in their policy for the taxation of the unimproved value of land, which at present is' the greatest necessity of all j and I am opposed to them on account of their paltering with the proposal to introduce the new Protection. How many of those on that side of the House can be said- to be sincere in their professed wish to do justice to the workmen engaged in protected industries? When the Prime Minister or the then Minister of Customs introduced the Tariff, there was an understanding amongst all sections of the House that provision for the payment of suitable wages to the workmen was to accompany the imposition of duties. The Deakin Government proceeded with the Customs Tariff, but as they neared the end of it nothing practical had been undertaken in regard to the new Protection. They then tabled a memorandum, the principle of . which was that Excise duties might be imposed on articles made under the protection of the Customs Tariff, but should be rebated to manufacturers who paid a living rate of wages. Nothing was done in regard to the matter for a considerable time, and action was only taken, I think, on account of the persistent urging chiefly of the honorable member for Hindmarsh. It was then found that the harvester manufacturers were prepared , to defeat the provisions of the Excise law by an application to the High Court. Later, on 28th October, 1908, whilst the Deakin Government were under the control of the Labour Party, or, I should say, getting the assistance of the Labour Party, and when that guarantee "of- assistance, or the support which was being accorded to them, was getting very shaky, they brought down another memorandum on the new Protection, containing this very significant paragraph :- </para>

                    <para>As the power to protect the manufacturer is national, it follows that unless the Parliament' of the Commonwealth also acquires  power  to secure fair and reasonable conditions of employment to wage-earners, the policy of Protection must remain incomplete. </para>

                <para class="block">It appeared at that time as though the Government intended really to appeal to the people of Australia to grant that power to the National Parliament That was the proposal in 1908. Now, the position is that, in order to effectively safeguard the interest of the workmen throughout Australia, the members of the Anti-Sweating, League have associated themselves with the biggest sweaters in the country - the Employers' Federation and their representatives. They are going to save the workmen* from being sweated by associating themselves with the sweater. They will endeavour to secure better wages by associating themselves with the men who never have paid, and never will pay, fair wages-, until they are compelled to do so. They, are going to do all this by the blessed proposal to appeal to the States to grant them the necessary power. Has any one ever heard a more plausible attempt to conceal a piece of hypocrisy than the effort made by the Prime Minister last night in dealing with the question? </para>

                        <para>- When the Prime Minister is endeavouring by means of a multitude of words to conceal his real intention, and to make people who do not know him think that they are going to get something from him, he does not require the assistance of any man in Australia. He is a master at it. This blessed proposal of the Government is to get from the States power to institute improved conditions in the States when the States have refused to do it themselves. </para>

                        <para>- My difficulty with the then Treasurer, the honorable member for Hume, was that I thought him to be on wrong lines in dealing with certain Tariff items. I felt that he was doing a big injury to some of the important industries of Australia. I said to him, in regard to the machinery section of the Tariff, as it related to the mining industry, "I am prepared to give you prohibition on those articles in that list that can be made in Australia, but the other articles, which cannot be made in Australia, I want to see made free, or 'subject only to a nominal duty." The honorable member for Hume could not bring himself to my wav of thinking, and he could not convince some of his alleged friends, who have since deserted him, so he chose to take a duty extending over the whole list. He met consequently with my opposition regarding several items which I believed to be of the utmost importance for the development of one of the primary industries of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That is a. matter of opinion. I am in a position to say that I did not come into the House as a protectionist, and then seek to bring about protection by joining with the free-traders. I came in as a labourite. I have no pledges unfulfilled in regard to fiscalism. I have stuck to the Labour Party, and when T thought they were on the wrong track in supporting the present Prime Minister, I tried to bring them to my way of thinking. I am glad to say that at last they agreed with me. </para>

                        <para>- I do so, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> though I was merely repeating the interjection of another honorable member. The proposal of the Prime Minister shows no consideration for the working men and women of Australia. If the States refuse to grant this measure of justice to their employes, does he expect that they will agree to allow some one else to do it ? The statement that the power once given cannot be revoked was modified by the Prime Minister last night. There is nothing in the Constitution to show that it could not be revoked, if it were given, and of that there is not the slightest chance.  His  next position was that if his proposal were adopted, and the consent of the States obtained, the Government would use machinery already in existence, and thus it would be unnecessary to increase taxation. But he also proposed to create an Inter-State Commission which will have power to control nearly all things. While he said that the Government would use institutions already in existence, he suggested that the Labour Party wishes to bring into existence a new set of institutions. Could anything be. more absurd ? Does he believe that we should duplicate machinery, if existing machinery would serve our turn? The honorable gentleman must see the absurdity of his suggestion. But, apparently, he de- . sires it to be spread abroad that the Labour Party wishes to incur additional expense, while he would be content with the machinery which is in existence. The possibilities of his proposal are nil. It is founded on wrong lines. He has no chance of obtaining the consent of the States, and cannot give relief to the workers. Another point which he tried to make against the Labour Party was that, if we got constitutional power, we should endeavour to use it in respect to every industry in every part of Australia. Apparently he anticipates that Melbourne is for a long time to remain the Federal Capital, because he spoke of our controlling all the industries of Australia from Melbourne. No one has made such a proposal. The most that the ex-Prime Minister asks for .is that in industrial matters the Commonwealth shall have powers concurrent with the States. Could anything be more absurd than to argue that if we obtain a constitutional power we shall at once exercise it? The Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate in regard to at least fifteen matters with which it has not yet attempted to deal. ' The Labour Party proposes to exercise the powers of the Constitution only where the Commonwealth administration would be more beneficial than that of the States. While we seek for power to protect those who are being sweated in the protected industries of Australia, it is not likely that that power would be used more quickly than would be good for the workers. Apparently, the Prime Minister wishes to intimidate those who belong to the State Frights party, or who think of joining it. As to immigration, it would be a farce to bring persons to this country until our land laws have been altered. The Prime Minister, himself has said that in the Old Country there are now more men ready to come to Australia than we can absorb. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. In order to encourage immigration, and make the position of immigrants secure, it is obviously necessary to pass legislation which will require those in possession of the land to use it to its fullest extent, or make it available for others. In order to bring about this reform, the Prime. Minister has associated himself with the great land monopolists of Australia. So, too, have the members of the Anti-Sweating League. With some of them it is not a vital matter whether one programme or another is accepted. Once before, when there was a political crisis, what two or three of them were most anxious for was to secure immunity from opposition at the next election. </para>

                        <para>- There was no compulsory charge, and there never has been at any meeting of the party. Of course, the party accepts subscriptions from friends and sympathizers in order that a good work may be carried on. Quite a number of the gentlemen who object to our methods have been associated with the Labour Party at one time or another in the course of their political career, while others have been prepared to join the party, but have been refused admission. We have seen the honorable member for Corio walk silently out of the Chamber ; he knew the proofs were here. There are " friends of the Labour Party " who associate with the party on the platform, but who, in this House, when away from the electors, ally themselves with the Employers' Federation and sweaters. Apparently those honorable members regard it as wrong for the Labour Party to have a plate at the door for donations, but have not a word to say against clergymen who adopt a similar means of raising funds on the Sunday. Do the Labour Party receive any support from the big squatters and monopolists of Australia? </para>

                        <para>- In any case, it does not appear to me to be a very heinous offence for the Labour Party at their gatherings, to ask for voluntary subscriptions in order to meet the necessary expenses. But it is quite another matter to have it alleged that a compulsory charge is made before admission, or that once in the audience cannot depart without paying. It appears that objections are raised to the workers paying their threepenny pieces or shillings, while nothing objectionable is seen in subscriptions paid by squatters of the Ritchie type in opposition to the. Labour Party. </para>

Â£100 in order to enable an anti-Socialist to fight the Wannon seat. </para>

                <para class="block">This reminds me of a former subscription raised on one memorable occasion in the history of this State, when there was sent out a notification, " Don't mind sending your name, just send in the cash." If the honorable member for Corio and the honorable member for Bourke have a remnant of that feeling that ought to actuate honorable members, they will withdraw the statements they have made and admit their  error as to compulsory levies at meetings connected with the Labour Party. I do  not say that it would be an outrageous thing if the Labour Party, when about to give an exposition on any question connected with the movement which they thought of value, were to make a charge, because, in any case, no one is compelled to attend. But it is a very different matter to say that a charge has been made, when the fact is the contrary. The honorable member for Corio referred to the decision -of some residents in Broken Hill in regard to a resignation, but, while expressing no opinion as to the merits of the proposal, I say that if those people required any justification they have it in the exhibition we have just witnessed in the Federal parliamentary arena. </para>

                        <para>- I know of no members of the Labour Party who, returned to advocate a particular programme, have abandoned that programme as soon as they entered the House. If a man feels that he cannot conscientiously advocate the policy on which he was elected, his only honorable course is to present himself to his masters and ask their opinion. At present there are honorable members exercising their functions here with no thought for the opinions or desires of their constituents ; they simply take the view that there are yet nine months in which the great daily metropolitan newspapers of Australia may be persuaded to throw a, cloak over their iniquities - to justify, explain, and excuse them to their electorates. During the past week or two honorable members opposite were in fear and trembling at the prospect of the people being appealed to ; they showed no enthusiasm then. </para>

As-to what they will be, unfortunately little can be gathered from the printed Ministerial statement read by the Prime Minister, and still less from his explanation of it last night. One of the paragraphs in this precious document sets forth that- </para>

I confess that I do not know what that means. Although the House is being invited . to say whether or. not the Ministry possesses its confidence, honorable members are not in a position to know whether the Government intend to proceed with a policy of borrowing. The Prime Minister might well have been expected to make a definite statement on the point. </para>

                        <para>- We are told that a new departure is called for to provide for the early construction of reproductive works in connexion with the Postmaster-General's Department. Surely we have been in session long enough to have from the Prime Minister an explanation of the intentions of the Government in this regard. Some years ago I predicted that as the financial possibilities of the Commonwealth were limited under the Braddon section, and we were returning to the States money that might well be used for Commonwealth Departments, while at the same time taking over Departments, the transfer of which was not urgently necessary, we should be confronted with financial embarrassment before the expiration of the Braddon period. The Prime Minister, who for seven out of the eight years of the Commonwealth's existence has been a member of different Governments, now tells us that one of the transferred Departments - that of the Postmaster-General - is in a chaotic condition, and hints that, although Parliament has already passed a resolution in opposition to the principle of borrowing, we must raise a loan in order that that Department may fulfil its functions. </para>

                        <para>- The fact remains that as the result of the administration of successive Governments led by the present Prime Minister, a loan apparently is to be proposed to enable a Department of the Commonwealth to be raised to a state of efficiency. I am not prepared to support a' loan for that purpose, whilst it is open to us to tax the unearned increment and to resort to other methods of taxation. If by means of taxation we cannot raise sufficient to carry on one of the Departments of the Commonwealth in a satisfactory manner, the people of Australia must be in 3  very  bad way. Is it not extraordinary that the Government should say that it is necessary to borrow money for this purpose, having regard to the fact that it is evidently so over-burdened with cash that it has offered to present ^2,000,000 to a people whom the Treasurer himself has said are able to built hundreds of <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts,</inline> independently, of any action we may take?' The Treasurer has admitted that he left: Western Australia without uttering a word as to his intention to support such a gift, but he says that he now accepts responsibility for the offer. An honorable member who so misleads his constituents - and there are others on the Government side of the House in the same position - ought to be prepared to go before them and to obtain from them an expression of opinion. 1 shall oppose any loan to bring up a Commonwealth Department to a state of efficiency, as is suggested in the somewhat ambiguous paragraph that I have read. . Nor am I in favour of the proposition made by the Treasurer when he was in a previous Deakin Administration, that we should continue the operation of the Braddon section. </para>

                        <para>- It is certain that in the years to come, if the responsibility for the debts of the States is to be taken over by the National Parliament, some of the assets of the States will have to accompany that transfer. National administration would, tend to the advantage of the railway systems of Australia. I cannot imagine, however, a set of circumstances rendering it necessary to seek the assistance of cash oi&gt; the spot to carry on the affairs of a Commonwealth department.

                        <para>- I cannot be charged with speaking in one direction and voting in another. Evidently there are on the Government side of the House a number of honorable members who are not satisfied with the financial proposals of the Ministry. They claim to be free men, and that being, so, it would be interesting to learn what they intend to do regarding these proposals. The honorable member for Robertson expressed the opinion that the Government ought to go to the country. He certainly threw no bouquets at them, and it would appear that he is prepared to assume permanently the <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of the Government's candid friend. When he was asked'/ however, whether he intended to support this motion, the passing of which would force the Government to go to the country, ' what did he say? I venture to assert that he will be found voting with the Government. </para>

I am in the greatest anxiety about the proposal that will emanate from the present Treasurer, and, possibly, be indorsed by the Government, with regard to the future financial relations between the Commonwealth" and the States. It is a matter of the greatest and most urgent importance that the national exchequer should not, after 1.910, be hampered to the degree that it is at present. </para>

The only thing we have to guide us in this matter is the past record of the Treasurer.  His  past achievements as demonstrated in the financial adjustment scheme which he submitted at Brisbane are eminently unsatisfactory from my point of view, and I look forward with the greatest anxiety to the temporary adjustment which is promised in the document tabled by the Prime Minister. </para>

                <para>This energetic Government, that has been in existence almost continuously since the beginning of the Commonwealth, has not, up to the present; been able to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion on the question of whether the telephone service is paying or not, or whether the telephone rates should be increased, and now, after eight years, they have reached the stage at which we are going to get from them a consideration "in principle and in detail" of the important question of State debts. Our national debt amounts to about Â£250,000,000, with an annual interest obligation of about  Â£9,000,000.  We owed Â£202,000,000 at the beginning of Federation, and that has increased to a little over Â£250,000,000 now. Yet in the face of that fact, in face of the fact that we have one of the heaviest public debts per head of population in the world, the Government propose to go on the market as a seventh borrower in order to bring one of our ordinary functions of government into a state of efficiency. </para>

The Prime Minister might well have explained last night what he really means on this question.

The severest criticism of the present Administration and their supporters is contained in their opinions about one another. They are composed of the wreckage of a number of parties, according to the Prime Minister, as honorable members have already heard. </para>

The honorable member for Flinders evidently appreciates the capacity of the Prime Minister to adapt himself -to any circumstances. He can denounce us to-day, just as easily as he denounced the Opposition corner party at that time. The people with whom he associates himself from time to time may be cast off, just as he cast off those who followed the .right honorable member for East Sydney, but he must always re main on top. So long as he is in the honorary position of Prime Minister, everything is satisfactory. </para>

                    <para>. - I take it that the motion now before the House is not really meant to be regarded seriously. I believe I am correct in regarding it as having been tabled with the intention of enabling honorable members opposite to give a full exposition of their principles and their grievances, and to prepare electioneering matter to lay before their constituents. I do not think that the Opposition believe they have any hope of carrying the motion. Having the knowledge, as they undoubtedly must have, that it will not be carried, the responsibility will rest upon them to justify in the eyes of the country their action in delaying the transaction of public business. At the same time I must congratulate them upon now living in a political atmosphere of much greater freedom than that to which they have been accustomed for many a long day. I can fully sympathise with them in the exhilaration which they feel in occupying what to members of that party must be a unique, position. I had no intention at first of taking part in this debate, but I wanted to justify, or rather to explain, my own position, for it needs no justification, and so I proposed to speak upon the Ministerial statement recently read to the House by the Prime Minister. As, however, this debate is likely to last some time, and my abstention from- taking part in it would not appreciably curtail it, or save much time,  I  thought it would perhaps be more convenient to say what I have to say now and probably to refrain from speaking at a later period on the Address-in-Reply or the Ministerial statement. I much regret the tone of many of the speeches that have been delivered in this House. The late Ministry departed from office in a most undignified fashion. We have heard from members of it. and from their sympathizers, an undignified tirade of splenetic abuse. I do not desire to pose as a lecturer to the House, but I would suggest that a form of criticism.' so much associated with the personal element is likely to lose a great deal of its force with the electors. I make to the Opposition merely the friendly suggestion that they would better attain their object by refraining from so much of the purely personal element, which does not tend to raise the dignity of debate in this Chamber. I come now to the general complaint which we have heard all over the country from members of the Opposition of the alleged unfair treatment that they have received - I do not know whether they include the late Opposition to which I belonged - but principally at the hands of the members of the old Deakin party. The treatment of which the Labour Party is now complaining so bitterly is similar to that which it meted out to the Deakin Government. It is getting a Roland for its Oliver. But in the manner of going out of office the members of the Deakin Administration showed to much greater advantage than the members of the Fisher Administration. They, on the support ot the Labour Party being withdrawn, asked no reasons, but, in a dignified manner, becoming their position, resigned their portfolios. The Labour Government took office in the full knowledge that it could not command the support of a majority, and, therefore, could not carry out the Labour programme. In the light of that knowledge, it proposed merely to continue the work of the Deakin Government, whose Ministers might reasonably have been supposed to be better able to carry out their own policy, being necessarily more familiar with its details, than an entirely new set of men.. But the cat has since been let out of the bag, and we have been informed that the change of Government was a preconcerted arrangement for dividing the loaves and fishes of office between two minorities on the " turn and turn about" principle. I do not know what the country, will think of such an arrangement. It seems to me to have been subversive of the public interest. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that no such arrangement as that to which I refer would be come to by any party of which I was a member ; it certainly would not receive my support. It really amounted to a conspiracy, ' for mere ' personal gain, against the whole community. May I trace the course of events which have led to the present situation? Late in last year, the then leader of the Opposition - the right honorable member for East Sydney - moved a motion of censure upon the .Deakin Administration because of its unsatisfactory financial administration. He particularly pointed out that no proper provision had been made for the payment of old-age pensions. Ai&gt; amendment, moved' by the right honorable member for Swan, with a view to shelving, the main motion, was defeated, and, by arrangement with my then leader, I moved" another amendment, specifically declaring the financial administration to be unsatisfactory because of the lack of proper provision for the payment of old-age pensions. The leader of the Labour Party and his followers had been speaking in the strongest terms of condemnation of the financial proposals of the Government, but none of them voted for the amendment or for the motion of censure. Votes speak louder than words, and in voting against the motion and amendment they indorsed the financial policy of the Government, and thus in the most positive and emphatic manner possible declared their full confidence in the Government and its proposals. But within three weeks, although' the Government had not altered its policy in the slightest, the leader of the Labour Party, from his place on the cross benches,, made a statement to the effect that his party had decided to withdraw its support from the Government. No reasons were advanced for that action. The support was withdrawn in the most contemptuousmanner. </para>

                        <para>- The action of the Labour Party was contemptuous, seeing that its allies had brought forward the measures which it had asked for, and were ready to go further in carrying out its policy. The summary withdrawal of support was, under the circumstances, contemptuous. The only justification for the action of the Labour Party would have been that the Deakin Administration had failed to carry out the policy which it had been arranged should be proceeded with, but that had not happened, and the incoming Government actually only proposed to continue the legislation of that which had been ejected. It will take a great deal to satisfy the public that the interests of the country were being considered by that change, or to prevent it from believing that the motive was other than to enable Labour Ministers to enjoy the spoils of office. That that was the motive is evidenced by the character of the speeches which we have heard both inside and outside of this chamber since the defeat of the Labour Government. Nothing but personal revenge is talked of because members have been deprived of their share of the spoils which, according to the arrangement with the old Deakin Party, should have fallen to them, and, instead of enjoying the emoluments of office for twelve months, they have drawn Ministerial pay for only six months. But what about the public interest? That appears to be left out of consideration altogether. Certainly, if the alleged arrangement was made, they have, from that purely personal point of -view, been treated unfairly. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Although the Labour Party appears to think that it acted quite fairly towards the Deakin Administration, its members have assumed a most virtuous indignation on receiving similar treatment. To use a sporting phrase, they cannot " take their -gruel." It is political cowardice for them to make the puerile complaints which we hear from them. </para>

                        <para>- Very good; and I dare say I shall be able to return the compliment with interest. In offering these remarks and criticisms on the question before the House, 'I desire to avoid anything that can be construed into the nature of personal animus or personal attack. I go even further, and say that I believe that inconsistencies of honorable members on both sides are very often the result of really worthy, and not sinister, motives. I do not always believe that members who are inconsistent, or change their opinions, are not honest in those opinions at the time. It happens sometimes that the point of view changes with unforeseen circumstances. Members of the Labour Party are going about the country complaining of the lack o!: consideration they have received at the hands of the present Prime Minister, and the party with whom he was associated prior to the events which brought about from the labour point of view this lamentable catastrophe; but, in my opinion, the present Prime Minister owes the Labour Party no consideration whatever. During the whole of the time when he was trying to carry out legislation desired by the Labour Party, he was subjected to attacks from platforms in various parts of the country, and u n announcement was made that he was " to be put to the sword." No mercy was to be shown to him, nor any appreciation of the services he had rendered to the Labour Party ;" on the contrary, that party were prepared to show the basest ingratitude by opposing the honorable gentleman, and all associated with him, at the elections. Treatment of that kind would not be resorted to, or tolerated by, members of any other political party in any part of the world ; and to show that the Prime Minister owes the Labour Party no consideration I propose to read one or two extracts from speeches made by prominent members of the party at the very time the Prime Minister was receiving their support, and obeying their- behests. I have no desire to pose as an apologist for the Prime Minister - I think he is fairly open to condemnation for deliberately putting himself in inexcusable relationship to the Labour-Socialist party, whose aims and methods he has scathingly denounced - but I make these quotations in common justice. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Heagney,</inline> the secretary of the Victorian Labour Conference, when speaking at a picnic, said - </para>

                <para class="block">That is a sample of the friendly attitude displayed by the Labour Party and those associated with them; and, in the face of such a. declaration, could it be reasonably expected that the object of such attacks should be inclined to show any very great consideration to those attacking him.

                <para>I do not like even repeating such expressions, but it is necessary to give the exact words of a quotation.

                <para>We have members of the Labour Party going about speaking in this disparaging manner of the head of the Government which they were supporting ; and yet here, and throughout the country, they complain of a lack of consideration on his part. The marvel to me is that the Prime Minister was able to continue in his position whilst this threatening language was being used towards him. I cannot understand how a man of breeding, culture, and refinement of feeling could continually tolerate such attacks, especially in view of the fact that all the time he was doing his very best to carry their behests into legislative effect. </para>

                        <para>-I do not wonder that the Prime Minister himself entertained a very poor opinion of the Labour Party. I unhesitatingly say that I had very little pity for the Prime Minister, considering that he knew or believed that the Labour Party was without gratitude or appreciation of friendly help, and was always prepared to destroy those with whom they had been most closely associated - to poniard those nearest to them, and attack, with the greatest ferocity, those who had the most friendly disposition towards their general' aims. Therefore the pity that would1 ordinarily go out to him had to be withheld, the more so as he had given utterance to a number of expressions of opinions of the party as a result of a previous alliance, which should have been a sufficient warning to him. I propose to read' one or two extracts from speeches which the Prime Minister made, showing that, although he believed the character I have indicated to be that of the Labour Party, he, with his eyes open, entered into an alliance with them.

                <para class="block">That was in 1904. It is equally a true statement of the position to-day. I believe that among the present Opposition there is at least one honorable member who is in some such position. According to statements that have been published, one of the late followers of the Deakin Government has had it plainly intimated to him by the Labour organizations in his constituency that if he desires to be immune from opposition, he must sign the Labour platform, and, presumably, the pledge associated with it. Returning to statements made by the Prime Minister in 1905, I find that .he said - </para>

                <para class="block">I regret to say that although since that time an attempt had been made to give effect to the views propounded by the honorable gentleman, which at the outset was successful, it was ultimately frustrated by the action of the Prime Minister himself. It cannot be denied that the subsequent separation of the first Coalition party in this House into additional parties was due to the action of the Prime Minister. That is a matter of history. We all know the circumstances that led to the resignation of the Reid-McLean Administration. We know, too, the prominent part which the present Prime Minister played in bringing about the disruption of that Coalition. It is never too late, however, for the sinner to repent, and the Prime Minister apparently has availed himself of an opportunity to show his repentance of the action he then took. Let us hope that the attempt now being made to restore responsible government will be persevered in loyally, to the best interests of the country. What the Prime Minister said was an expression of sentiment which ought to be indorsed by every well-wisher of this country. I cordially indorse those sentiments and so far as concerns those who have been connected with the Liberal Party from New South Wales hitherto sitting in Opposition, I can say that our desire was to bring about a consummation of those things. So that whatever may be the result of the present fusion movement, the purpose of it is to restore a principle which it is very necessary should be restored, and without which it will be impossible to give p'roper expression in legislative form to the will of the majority of the people of this country. Perhaps one of the worst features associated with the present position in politics is the alleged intention of. the Labour Party - the intention imputed to them by the public press - to refuse under any circumstances to give pairs. If that be their determination, I say that it is one of the meanest, most inhuman, and most undignified methods of procedure that I have heard of in connexion with parliamentary institutions, either here or in any other part of the world. In the bitterest moments of political warfare, no other party, so far as I have been able to learn, has been guilty of expressing a like determination. In this case it is particularly discreditable by reason of the fact that it is well known that some honorable members are incapacitated from attending on account of physical affliction. To refuse pairs to them when it is known that they cannot leave their beds, being prostrated by illness, certainly is not creditable to the humane instincts of those who call themselves the Labour Party, nor is it likely to commend itself to the majority of their followers or to the rest of the community. </para>

                        <para>- I can quite understand that on a motion of no-confidence, or a question affecting the fate of a Government, or one of much urgency in a party sense, it might be necessary for every, member of a party who could to attend and vote. There might on such an occasion be an indisposition to give pairs. But there is no justification for a general refusal out of motives of revenge or for any other similar reason. To do so is to bring parliamentary institutions down very low indeed. I do not assert myself that the Labour Party has refused to give pairs. It is, however, so reported in the press, and the statement stands without contradiction. I sincerely hope that they have been misrepresented. 'From my knowledge of several members of the party, and from my cordial friendship with them, personally, I should be very loth indeed to believe that all of them would lend themselves to such procedure. Perhaps at a time of disappointment or anger one or two members of the party may have declared themselves determined to disregard one of the ordinary courtesies of parliamentary life. But I trust that when we resume normal conditions of amity one towards the other these courtesies will be observed. Now I wish to come to some of the reasons why it was necessary that the Labour Party should be ejected from office. It was imperatively necessary in the interest of the country at large. Although prior to the Christmas recess the party took office in the full knowledge that when Parliament reassembled -after the recess they would be met by a motion which would have the effect of displacing them from office, nevertheless they took office, knowing that they could not give effect to a single item in their programme. Their displacement of the Deakin Government was not prompted bv any consideration of public policy. They knew that the moment they attempted to bring forward any proposition involving their Socialistic principles their doom was sealed. I told them so at the time. Therefore, rather than risk the loss of office they were prepared to throw over the Labour platform. Rather than surrender the emoluments of office they were prepared to see their policy perish for a period at least. Their programme might perish and their policy go by the board for the time being. They could only carry out the policy of those whom they had ejected from office. All that they could ask for was to be allowed to get into recess, and they hoped that they would then, through their administration, behind the back of Parliament and the people, be able to secure things they could not get on the floor of the House. </para>

                        <para>- It rested with them to say whether it should be for a fortnight, three months, or six months. They had only to say to the man they had displaced, and on whom alone they had to rely for support, " Our desire is to carry your policy into effect, until we get into recess ; . will you prevail upon your followers to help us to do so?" and that help could not have been refused. Therefore, when the honorable member for Boothby spea'ks of having only a. . fortnight, I repeat that it was their own choice. It might have been three months or six months, or any time during which they were prepared to give effect to the programme of their predecessors in office, which was then on the business-paper. However, all they wished to do was to get supply as speedily as possible, and! get into recess. They hoped then, by acts of administration, and by cunningly keeping their Socialistic objective and projects in the background, to pose before the country as not by any means the dangerous people they were stated to be. They hoped that they would then be able to go upon public platforms and say, " The members of the Opposition and of the Deakin party have denounced us as a danger to the community ; but see how mild and gentle and harmless we are. We are as harmless as sucking doves." They hoped, bv these means, to establish confidence in themselves in the minds of many people, who, I think, justly view them with suspicion as being, in their political capacity, a danger to the community. They could play the role of political " confidence men." By thus working upon the confidence of the people they hoped, later on, to be able to secure votes under false pretences - so that if returned again by the votes of the unsuspecting electors outside their own ranks, they might bring forward a programme of a much more drastic Socialistic character, the one kept in the background, and at the same time, be able to say that they did so with the approval of the electors, although many of the electors would probable never have suspected that any such legislation would be proposed by those for whom they voted. One of the reasons why it was necessary to eject the Labour Party from office was that the outstanding act of their administration was a violation of a distinct pledge given to this House in regard to the trust fund for defence purposes. ' When we were considering the Surplus Revenue Bill, and the proposal to put aside Â£250,000 to a trust fund for defence purposes, the question was asked, not by one, but by several honorable members, whether it was proposed to spend any of that money before the defence policy of the Government had been approved by the House. The Ministry of the day assured the House that not a penny of that money would be spent without the authority of Parliament, or until 'Parliament had approved of a defence policy. A declaration to that effect was made not only on behalf of the Government, but also by the present leader of the Opposition, and one or two honorable members who were associated with him in the Labour Ministry.

Yet he became a member of a Ministry which, in spite of that declaration, appropriated without the consent of Parliament a portion of that trust fund. He said that we were committed to nothing more than putting the money aside as a trust fund, which was not to be touched without direct authority from Parliament, after the defence policy had been debated in detail' and agreed to. He therefore cannot shelter himself behind the plea that he was no party to giving that pledge to the House.. In the circumstances he was just as much a party to it as was the Prime Minister or any member of the then Government. </para>

Not a penny of it would have been voted had any other idea prevailed amongst honorable members, and had a definite and distinct promise not been given that it  would not be touched, I am certain that no member of any party would have voted for that motion but for that distinct pledge and understanding.

                        <para>.- I take this opportunity, sir, of directing your attention to an important matter, and of asking you a question. A system has been commenced by a section of the press of suppressing the speeches of honorable members. That practice appears to me to be a degradation to the proprietors, and the reporters, or those in authority in those newspapers. There obtains in South Australia a system of a daily <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> issued to the public through the press. In New South Wales, the practice that is now being perpetrated here was begun some years ago, and a Committee, or Commission, was appointed, of which I was a member, to inquire into the matter. I am speaking from memory of things which happened a good while ago, hut I believe that Committee recommended the establishment of a daily <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to be is-' sued through one of the newspapers by tender, so that it should go every day to as many of the electors of the State as it was possible to reach in that way- The time has arrived when something similar should be done with regard to the debates of this Parliament. Can you, sir, state whether you have power to order the issue of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> daily in some such way as was proposed at that time , in New South Wales, and as is done now in South Australia? If you have the power, I would ask you to exercise it. If you have not the power, and the matter has to be decided by Parliament, I should like you to take the question into consideration and tell the House the most approved course that could be adopted for having a morning <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I am not raising this question on my own account, because it does not matter very much to me whether the newspapers report me or not, but it does matter to the electors of the Commonwealth. </para>

I wish to direct the attention of the House - I do not blame any one in the matter - to the attitude that the Government or the responsible officials are taking up with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baxter,</inline> the Collector of Customs in Sydney. He is one of the best officers in the Department, and has given the greatest satisfaction to the commercial public. In fact, the public generally are glad to have such a man in that position. He has nearly reached the age limit, but he is still hale and hearty. There is a provision in the law by which such a man can be retained in the service after reaching the statutory age when he has proved himself an excellent officer and has many years of active life before him. It is often difficult to get a man who is well up to his work, who has never caused any trouble, and whom the public are so satisfied with as they are with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baxter.</inline> The provision to which I have referred might well be put into force in order to retain him in his present position, at any rate while he retains his health and strength. </para>

                        <para>- Earlier in the afternoon the- honorable member for Hume was good enough to inform me that he intended to ask this question, so that I am now prepared with a reply to it. In the first place I must remind the House that this matter was referred to the Printing Committee during the first year of the existence of the Commonwealth Parliament. That Committee, after giving it some consideration, saw such great difficulties in the way of circulating an official <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> daily over the vast extent of this great Commonwealth that it made no recommendation in the direction desired. The issue of a daily <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is not a. matter which it is within my power to order. It would be very undesirable if a  Speaker  were able to take . action which might involve the Commonwealth in a very heavy expenditure, upon his own initiative.  If the honorable member for Hume desires to have this matter discussed he can best secure his purpose by tabling a motion in respect of it, and then such a decision will be reached as the House may desire. </para>

If an exception be made in their case, I fail to see any reason why it should not be made in the case of men who are not so highly paid, but who are just as honorable, and who discharge their duties just as faithfully. The honorable member for Hume thinks that the services of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baxter</inline>
                        should be retained for the benefit of the Commonwealth. But I would remind him that there have been instances in which public officers have become so accustomed to the forms and  regulations of the service that they could not satisfactorily discharge their duties, and yet - simply on account of the length of their service - they have been retained even after they have reached the retiring age. I hope that the Government will be slow to interfere with the regulation relating to the retirement of public officers.

                        <para>- I am surprised at the remarks of the honorable member for Hunter, because nobody could gather from the observations of the honorable member for Hume that the latter does not favour the retention in the service after the retiring age has been reached, of any officer who is capable of satisfactorily discharging his duties. But if ;a rule is to be enforced it should be made uniformly applicable. The rule governing the matter of the retirement of officials from our Public Service has already been departed from with the sanction of this House. </para>

                            <para>- I have known <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baxter</inline> for a great many years, and I believe that the whole trading community of New South Wales recognise that he is an officer of great ability and strict impartiality. Although he has reached the retiring age it would be absolutely unfair to dispense with his' services, whilst at the same time retaining officers who are very much older than he is. I repeat that exception has already been made to the general rule. I do not quarrel with that. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott,</inline> Secretary to the Postmaster-General's Department, is an excellent officer. </para>

                            <para>- Every Postmaster-General with whom I have conversed has warmly commended that officer for the manner in which he has discharged his duties. That has taken place on two or three occasions. If .the rule is to be departed from, as it has been, I think that consideration should be given to New South Wales when it asks that one. of its officers in whom it has entire confidence shall be continued in the Public Service for some time longer while he retains the abilities which are so generally acknowledged. </para>

                        <para>.- What the honorable member for Hunter has said is quite true, because there is a. number of officers who are in a similar position. While I indorse what the honorable member for Hume has said in regard to the Collector of Customs at Sydney, I wish to point out that there is a number of officers who are obliged to retire at the age of 65 years. To my personal knowledge, some of them are in the zenith of their physical and mental powers. They were never more fitted at any time in their lives for the performance of their duties, and it seems a great pity that their services have to be dispensed with at a time when they are really most efficient. If I remember rightly, there is in the Public Service Act a provision under which, in certain circumstances, the services of such men can be retained. Perhaps it might be necessary to amend the law so as to give a little more elasticity to that provision. </para>

                        <para>.- I quite agree with the statement of the honorable member for Hume that it is absolutely necessary that some officers, after reaching the retiring age of 65 years, should be continued in the Public Service. As it has been mentioned that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> has been retained after having reached the retiring age, I think I am justified in stating that it was not done at his request. I am sure that he was asked to continue in the Public Service not merely by one Government, but by several Governments. I . thought it was only right, as his name had been mentioned, to put the House right in that regard. </para>

                        <para>.- I, with several other honorable members, hope that the Government will not consider the proposition of the honorable member for Hume. It simply means a concession to any officer who has a friend at court ox on an honorable member who will get up and ask for his services to be continued. In Queensland there were several officers in the lower ranks who had attained the age of 65 years. They had no one to speak on their behalf, or to barrack for the continuation of their services for a year, although they had a wife and family to maintain on a very low wage. They had to go out into the cold world. There was no compassion shown to them. If we are to have one rule for a first class officer and another rule for a third class officer, the, House should be made acquainted with the fact. It was decided by the House that the retiring age of a public officer should be 65 years, and I, for one, hope that the provision will be carried out in its entirety. Every representative of Queensland knows how the Public Service was packed with men much older than 65 years, and it was only owing to Federation' that- it was purged of those individuals. We have a much more efficient service now than ever we had, particularly in the Customs . Department. I hope that the Government will not give this New South Wales officer consideration beyond that extended to any other officer. </para>
