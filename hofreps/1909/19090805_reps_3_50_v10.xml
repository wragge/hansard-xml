                        <para>- A couple of days ago I asked a question regarding the raising of a loan by the Fremantle Council, and yesterday it was stated in this House that a wire had been received from the Mayor, pointing out that I had misrepresented the true position. I did not say that the loan was not floated.

Therefore I am reading the newspaper statements on which my questions were based. They make it appear that only &#163;3,150 was subscribed in Melbourne, and an inquiry which I made to-day shows that to be true. To continue the quotation - </para>

Tenders were to be lodged in Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide yesterday, at noon. No steps were taken to get the loan underwritten, the municipalities apparently believing that the attractiveness of the issue would be its own recommendation. Melbourne tendering, however, was on a very small scale, the tenders lodged amounting to . &#163;3,150. </para>

                    <para>.- This is undoubtedly a considerable departure from what was understood earlier in the discussion. I do not think it wise to delegate even to the Printing Committee the question of deciding whether there shall be sub-headings or any alterations in the speeches which honorable members may desire to publish. It is true that there must be some controlling authority, but I greatly prefer that the question be left entirely in the hands of yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and the Government Printer. </para>

                        <para>- They would naturally refuse to allow anything to be published which is not contained in the official <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. If you, sir, indicate that you have nothing to do with any alteration of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> outside of the official report, I agree with you. That is a wise position for you to take up, and certainly a doubly wise and safe position for the Principal Parliamentary Reporter to take up. Nevertheless, I doubt the competency of the Printing Committee to deal effectively with the question. There appear to be two courses open. One is to reprint exactly from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as officially published, while the other is to allow honorable members to add anything to the official report at their own risk and expense if they so desire. Those alternatives can be argued and debated. If some honorable members have recently erred, they have followed very distinguished delinquents, because both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have inserted very telling cross-headings, which in no way appeared in their speeches as published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

                        <para>- We are always glad to have authorities pointing out the risks that we run of transgressing the Standing Orders, and nothing is more natural than that the correction should come from a recent recruit to the position of Temporary  Chairman  of Committees. You, sir, correctly interpreted my intention when you said I was simply illustrating the early errors that honorable members -had apparently fallen into. All this trouble arises from the action of a member of the Government, backed up by the Government. The Prime Minister, in moving to remit the question to a Committee, is waiving the responsibility that has already been taken by one of his colleagues. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to explain, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that my sole reason for objecting to the motion for printing the report was that I desired, before it was put, to ascertain whether I had correctly understood your statement as to the way in which matters of this sort ought to be submitted. I have seen to-day for the first time a reprint from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> published in pamphlet form, of a speech delivered by the Prime Minister, in which some fairly strong cross-headings have been inserted. In the first place, the cover, on which is printed the title, &#34; Policy of the New Government contrasted with the Labour Policy &#34; - &#34;By the Honorable Alfred Deakin, M.P.&#34; - is an extraordinary one. Those lines did not appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but they have been printed in the Government Printing Office, and I find, amongst other cross-headings in this reprint the line, &#34; Cut-throat Tactics.&#34; This speech was delivered on  24th  June,  1909,  and the reprint is certainly worth looking at. When this question was first brought before the House, I thought that the Treasurer was making a mountain out of a mole-hill. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer does not quite understand what is and what is not a disgrace to Parliament. I do not wish to import any heat into this discussion; but, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, I fail to see that objection can be taken to reprints of honorable members&#39; speeches at their own expense, if the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report is adhered to, and the cross-headings introduced are not of an offensive character. It would be idle for honorable members to obtain reprints of their speeches, if they have to be submitted to the censorship . of the Treasurer, and the right honorable gentleman is to be permitted to allow only such cross-headings as he considers suit the policy of his party. </para>

I compared one or two of the Treasurer&#39;s reprints with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report, and I believe I found that more slices had been cut out, and more junks inserted in them, than in the case of any others I have examined. I do not think that this question should be referred to the Printing Committee, for that would be a roundabout method of settling it. At the present time, I have with the Government Printer an order for a reprint of a speech delivered by me in this House. </para>

My opinion is. that honorable members should be allowed to use headings if the headings are in consonance with the body of the speech ; and I should be quite prepared to leave their propriety to the judgment of any reasonable person. It is about four weeks, or more, since I asked for copies of my speech, and I was told that I could not have them within three weeks. If permission for printing has to filter through the Committee, the delay may be interminable; and, under the circumstances, 1 cannot see what use the Printing Office would be in assisting honorable members to circulate their speeches. As a matter of fact, I did not desire to have any headings inserted in the speech, but they were inserted by my clerk. </para>

It is extremely difficult for the occupant of the chair to do his duty to the House and to individual members if it is made impossible for him to hear what is going on. The question before us is whether something shall be referred to a Committee; and I ask the honorable member not to attempt to discuss the merits of the question, or any other matters which will more properly come before us when the report of the Committee is submitted. </para>

The honorable member for the Grampians suggests that honorable members ought to have the work done by some outside printing office, and, doubtless, he has means to enable him to take that step. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members have very few privileges in this regard, and this one was granted, when there was suppression of speeches by the public press, to enable honorable members to place their utterances before their constituents. It seems to me to be against the spirit and intention of the permission in the first instance to prevent or delay honorable members in circulating their speeches in this way. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members have ample opportunity to revise their proofs, and see that what is published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is correct. If honorable members desire to. circulate their speeches with additions, or emendations, they may do so by having them set up and printed by some outside firm. Why this printing should be done at the Government Printing Office, when there are so many printers outside awaiting employment, is a matter for honorable members opposite to consider. We understand that when the type is once set up, the mere printing of so many copies is very much cheaper than having the whole of the work done outside; and it is for that reason that members have the privilege now under discussion, instead of being compelled to circulate complete copies of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> But if honorable members reprint speeches, they ought to be issued with the limitations which appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> without headings or emendations. If the work were done outside, and the printer&#39;s name appeared on each copy, the public would know that they did not represent reprints of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but were a production by an honorable member himself. </para>

                <para>Mr.FISHER.- The Treasurer has admitted that he has used sub-headings in reprints of his speeches, and that he has made considerable emendations. Yet it has been thought necessary to deal with subheadings inserted by honorable members on this side. Members representing distant States are at a great disadvantage compared with the representatives of Victoria, and members of the Opposition are at a still greater disadvantage compared with Ministerialists. Speeches made by honorable members opposite are delivered &#34; right side up with care&#34; by the press, but our speeches, if published at all, are distorted. Of course, there are persons living in Victoria, and members of this Parliament, who think that the Commonwealth is contained in Victoria and New South Wales. Apparently it is being attempted to prevent the people of distant States from knowing what takes place here. This action is quite in keeping with what the Government has done since it took office. Its policy is to suppress everything that tells against it, and to publish everything that may speak in its favour. Ministerialists should remember, however, that they have behind them the monetary influence of Australia, and should rely on their intelligence for the proper putting of their case, even though sub-headings may be used in the reprinting of Opposition speeches. </para>

                        <para>- Let us hope that no honorable member would do such a thing. It is evident that the Government Printer was moved by some one else, though who that person was I do not care. I have a suggestion which I should like the House to consider. Honorable members who have their speeches reprinted, desire to make the reprints as acceptable as possible to their constituents, and if, in furtherance of that desire, they have certain words separated from the text, and printed in special type by way of sub-headings, to attract the attention of readers, I think that should be allowed. It must, be remembered that they would pay the cost involved in any such arrangement, and it is necessary to emphasize the fact that these reprints are paid for by the members issuing them. I cannot conceive of injury being done to any one by this practice, it being understood that only words which have been actually spoken and printed in the official record may be used for headings. I would not vote with the honorable member for Maribyrnong to prevent the use of headings altogether. If members desire to use such headings as I suggest, they are entitled to use them, especially in those cases in which only this means exists for making their views known to distant constituencies. </para>

                    <para>.- The suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition is one which it would be difficult to act upon without some such abuse as that about which we are now complaining creeping in. The question is, not what cross-headings shall be allowed, but whether pamphlets announced as reprints from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> should be accurate reprints, or whether, in the endeavour to make their speeches more interesting to readers, headlines should be employed by those authorizing the reprints. In my opinion, the time has come for the House to put a stop to the present abuse. I had personally no idea that the use of cross-headings has recently become so common. I do not think that I have had any of my speeches reprinted for some years past, and I have certainly never inserted cross-headings. Probably the majority of honorable members are innocent of the practice which has been brought under notice. The Leader of the Opposition wishes us to believe that no harm will be done to any one if members pay for the cost of separating the type, in order to insert cross-headings, but I differ from him. If honorable members use a Government Department, which was not instituted for the purpose, in order to issue their speeches at cost price in the form supposed to be most attractive to readers, they get their work done for about half what they would have to pay in the open market, and take employment from the honest workmen in the printing trade of Australia. Of course, one has only to mention the honest workmen to be greeted by them with mirth if the privileges of members of the Labour party are in question. </para>

Of course, if my argument cannot be answered, honorable gentlemen must try to drown it by sound. By using the Government Printing Office for the circulation of their speeches, honorable members are taking work from the honest unionists in the printing trade throughout Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I am not pleading for those who have fixed billets. If honorable members opposite could get their speeches published as cheaply by private offices as by the Government Printing Office, we should have no debates of this kind. For reasons of economy and accuracy the abuse which has been brought under notice should be stopped. Anything we say in the House ought to be reproduced absolutely as it appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> or not at all. I am grateful to the honorable member for Maribyrnong for putting the issue plainly before us. It is all very well for the Leader of the Opposition to say that there is nothing new in the amendment, and that we might just as well have left it to the Treasurer, but I hope honorable members will be prepared to accept the responsibility for any action which they wish to be taken. I do not desire to throw the responsibility upon the Treasurer, any more than he wishes to assume it. I feel that it is our duty, by our votes, to show clearly whether we pay more regard to our privileges than to the rights of workmen outside the Government Printing Office. Do honorable members believe that a speech reprinted with the statement on the cover that it is an exact copy of the parliamentary report- </para>

                        <para>- That is the inference. The statement that appears is &#34;Reprint from parliamentary <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.&#34;</inline> Does not the honorable member know that when he puts a cross-heading in his speech what  purports to be a reprint from the parliamentary <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> becomes no longer so? Does he wish to publish broadcast on the cover of a speech a statement which is deliberately false? I take it that when this matter is put fairly and squarely before honorable members, they must, without flinching the issue, vote for the amendment of the honorable member for Maribyrnong. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to point out to the Treasurer that, while the Printing Committee will be quite willing to deal with the question, they can only make a recommendation, which will have to be discussed and dealt with in the House, and may be referred back to them. At this moment, the speeches of a number of honorable members are being held up. Would it not be fair to allow the speeches that have been ordered to be delivered as they are in no sense worse than others that have already been reprinted? </para>

                        <para>- As the Treasurer does not know how to. show ordinary civility, I will put the question to the Prime Minister, from whom I think I will get civility. I do not want to move an amendment, and shall not do so if the Prime Minister will give us an assurance that no further speeches will be allowed to be reprinted with cross-headings until the House has arrived at some conclusion on the matter, but that the speeches which have already been ordered shall be printed and delivered. If this had not been a one-sided affair, I should not have asked for even that concession. It has been pointed out that there is nothing in the cross-headings that will compare with what has been allowed to be published by honorable members on the Ministerial side. In the speech of the honorable member for Yarra, for instance, no exception can be taken to the cross-headings, unless it be to two words which in themselves are not objectionable. The honorable member is, however, willing to substitute &#34; Answered &#34; for &#34; Refuted.&#34; Why then should the honorable member have to wait for several weeks longer before he can distribute that speech among his constituents ? It is most unfair. We do not know whether the House will accept the recommendations of the Printing Committee when they are made. I am sorry the honorable member for Wentworth has left the chamber, for I wished to tell him that if honorable members on this side could afford to run motorcars they could afford to go to a private printer, as he suggested, instead of to the Government Printing Office.  His  remarks were beside the question. If we did not get the speeches reprinted at the Government Printing Office, we should not get them reprinted at all, and many unionists would be deprived of work. That is what the honorable member would really like to see. Instead of having sympathy with them, he wants to take away what little work they have. Honorable members get their speeches reprinted at the Government Printing Office, because the greatest cost of production is the cost of setting up or lino-typing. The speeches are already in type there, and the only cost to the Government Printer is that of the paper, printing, and insertion of cross-headings. I have only had two speeches reprinted, and I have nor altered a letter of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> If I had been compelled to go to a private printing office, I could not have afforded the reprints; yet that is the only means which my constituents have of knowing what is going on in the House. I reprinted those speeches at their special request. They said to me: &#34; We do not know what you are doing in the Federal Parliament. Cannot something be clone to let us know what is going on there ? &#39; &#39; </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member delivered a long speech, he would know that many readers would not care to read the whole of it, whereas if they could glance down the cross-headings, they could pick out the parts in which they were specially interested. I can understand the action of the honorable member for Maribyrnong, because he is the darling of the Melbourne press, and gets all the publicity necessary ; but will he contrast what he gets with the treatment accorded to some of his Victorian colleagues in this Parliament ? I am sure that for every sentence that the others are given, he is given columns. I object to his amendment. I entirely agree that not a letter of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> ought to be altered but that is no reason  why bold cross-headings should not appear in the reprints. I have had speeches published in the press, although not many. I could get them published in Adelaide if I paid a column. Honorable members can therefore see the handicap to which poor candidates are subjected in South Australia as against wealthy ones. If a man is wealthy, he can get a report covering a whole page of a newspaper; but if he is poor, he is given half a column, and not another sentence during the whole of the election campaign. Is it not time, therefore, that honorable members were given some facility to acquaint their constituents with what takes place in this Parliament ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and therefore I hope my motion which appears on the notice-paper will be carried. Then those who so desire will be able to learn what is going on in the Federal Parliament ; but until that time comes, we ought to give what other facilities we can. It is very easy, without altering a line of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> to pick out and make a cross-heading of a striking word or phrase in a speech. I do not want to see new matter introduced, for that is neither right nor necessary. I cannot understand why this privilege should be taken away at this moment, unless it is that honorable members opposite desire, if possible, to suppress everything said on this side. Unless that were so, action would have been taken against a Minister who dared, not merely to insert cross-headings, but to mutilate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The Treasurer actually cut out all the interjections - a most objectionable proceeding on his part. </para>

                        <para>- There must be a Guy Fawkes conspiring with Ministers to prevent honorable members from having their opinions conveyed to their constituents. I favour the motion, and I am sure the Printing Committee will do all they can to formulate recommendations acceptable to the House, but I want a reasonable promise from the Prime Minister with regard to the speeches that have already been ordered. I am sure those honorable members whose speeches are now hung up will be quite willing to submit the headings to the Prime Minister) It is only fair that he should put them in exactly the same position as he and the Treasurer have occupied up to the present. If Ministers have had their speeches printed and distributed, surely it is fair to grant others the same right? After this, however, I should not permit any other member to insert cross-headings. We should come to a conclusion upon the question, but I never heard of such an unfair proceeding as to hang up members&#39; speeches for weeks, and possibly months, without warning. If the Prime Minister cannot give me the assurance I ask for, I shall have to move a further amendment, to add to the motion the words - </para>

                    <para>. - I support the honorable member for Maribyrnong&#39;s amendment. I regard the discussion as a storm in a teacup, but should like to take members back to 1903, to show that some of them have probably abused a privilege. It is in the interests of the Government Printing Office and of Parliament itself that the practice that has grown up should be stopped. I propose to read a letter addressed by the Government Printer to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner - then Treasurer of the Commonwealth - in 1903, and the instruction that was issued as the result of that communication. The letter is as follows :  - </para>

                    therefore desired that the matter should be submitted for the consideration of the Honorable the Treasurer. Furthermore, he authorized me to state that in his opinion no discrepancies should be allowed as between the speeches as reported in

                        <para>- But by means of headlines the facts could be so distorted as to convey a wrong impression to the public. Honorable members opposite will not be debarred from obtaining as many reprints from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as they desire, but I contend that it is altogether wrong to allow the official record to be distorted in what purports to be a reprint from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> issued by the Government Printer. I hope that the amendment moved by the honorable member for Maribyrnong will be carried. I have heard that a number of printers are out of employment, and I know that many firms possess the plant necessary to enable them to undertake work of this kind at a reasonable price. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner pointed out in his memorandum that the question was urgent, as a large quantity of type had to be kept standing, and I have heard today that the type used in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of some of these speeches has&#39; been kept standing for three weeks. In other words, a large quantity of type has been locked up. </para>

                        <para>- A printing office in which a large business is carried on has to keep large fonts of type to permit of matter being kept standing for weeks at a stretch. The honorable member for Hume, according to a statement that has been read to-day, proposed to insert in &#39;a reprint of one of his speeches the cross-heading, &#34;The Commonwealth disgraced.&#34; Does he not think that the Commonwealth is being disgraced by this frivolous discussion? What is proposed by the Government is not to interfere with the privileges of honorable members, but to prevent an abuse of those privileges. All that we are seeking to do is to prevent a distortion of the facts, and  I  think that honorable members should be well satisfied when they are able to obtain for publication in pamphlet form the correct <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of their speeches. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Grampians has read the instruction which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner gave to the Government Printer some six years ago, and which has not been observed from that day to this. Had the relations which, until recently, existed between a part of the present Fusion and the Labour party continued we should not have had to-day the spectacle of the honorable member for Maribyrnong rising to move such an amendment as that which he has submitted. He would have seen the heavens fall, or even the fire tower totter, before he would have taken such an action.  Honorable members opposite know that, although they have at their command the press of Australia, they are steadily losing ground.  The speeches delivered by the Opposition are finding a more ready audience than is agreeable to them, and that,  I  think, is the beginning and the end of their complaint. The honorable member for Grampians and the honorable member for Wentworth have reduced the matter to an absurdity. The honorable member for Wentworth affects to be overwhelmed with feelings of pity for the poor unemployed printer. Nothing funnier has been heard of for centuries. </para>

From his seat in the Ministerial corner he seems to regard the whole House in a superior and altogether delightful way ; but he has as much idea of the work of the world as a butterfly has of casting an 81-ton gun. And yet he claims to be sorry for the un-&#39; employed printer ! The honorable member for Grampians says that he knows of many printers who are out of work. </para>

Yet both he and the honorable member for Wentworth propose to support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Maribyrnong, which will result, if in anything, in the work of reprinting speeches being still carried on at the Government Printing Office.

                        <para>- I  am not excepting my own speeches from the statement  I  have just made. Alterations in form but not in substance are properly allowed, because when an honorable member is addressing the Chamber, he is so torn by conflicting emotions, and troubled with interjections that his delicate equilibrium is disturbed, and he recovers himself only with difficulty. It is desirable, and, indeed, necessary, therefore, to present a readable report of what he would have said had he been addressing an audience having the manners to listen to him, and, in the circumstances, I think it is right that honorable members should have the privilege of making alterations in form, but not in substance, of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proofs of their speeches. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> however, is notoriously deficient in one absolute essential, if the people are to read it, and that is that the speeches are not printed in paragraphs. A new subject is introduced in the middle of a line, whereas every new subject dealt with in the course of a speech should be introduced in a new paragraph. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> ought to be paragraphed, just as reports in newspapers are, or just as the Bible is. I venture to say that many men would not read the Bible if it were printed like the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports are, as one uninterrupted narrative. If it is desired to reprint speeches, the stereos could be bought from the Government Printer and used in a private printing office; and the Government Printer would thus be put to no inconvenience. But it is a good thing for the Government Printing Office to have this work to do ; and the same amount of work is given there as in a private office. The fundamental distinction between honorable members is that on the Government side are men clamouring for private enterprise, whose champions and servants they are. If the speeches of those gentlemen were put in the press bare and unadorned--  </para>

                        <para>- I am not saying that they are the only men whose speeches could not bear that treatment. But how does the press build up a man&#39;s reputation? It keeps his speech in a little corner, while the leader writer or reporter, in a more prominent part of the paper, says, &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. So-and-so</inline> pointed out last night very acutely so-and-so,&#34; and everybody says, &#34; That was a fine speech our member delivered !&#34; But as for reading the speech, they have never been known to do it ! The press builds up the reputation of my honorable friends opposite and I do not object to that. But we on this side ought to be al- . lowed, in our own puny, tin-pot way, to supply the people with the basic elements upon which the newspaper reports are founded. We do not ask that our speeches shall be dressed up ; and as to cross-headings I think the suggestion of the honorable member for Wide Bay a very fair one. I should be perfectly prepared to allow the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff to say whether suggested cross-headings were proper, just as they are allowed to say what alterations are proper in the form of the report. If that were done there would be no difficulty or trouble. The Chief of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff already has a far greater power, inasmuch as he determines the extent to which corrections shall be made. Several honorable members go to a considerable extent in making corrections; and, no doubt, a man likes his speech to read easily and to be as elegant in form as he can make it. I take no exception to that, but regard it as very desirable on the part of those who like to take the trouble, so long as we have a perfectly impartial authority to determine what is or what is not a material alteration. If that authority were extended to the cross-headings, we should have no reason for complaint ; but it is intolerable that the Government should declare cross-headings to be a dangerous innovation,  when everybody knows that the real reason for their action is that parties are as they are. Our speeches contain those disagreeable truths which, whether they are cross-headed or not, are getting home to the people; but I do not deny that they get home all the more if there are cross-headings. It is for that particular reason that the Government have determined to abolish cross-headings; and I hope that the House will accept either the reasonable suggestion of the honorable member for Wide Bay, or the one I made myself, to leave the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff to determine what is or what is not a proper cross-heading. If that were done, the new-born zeal to purge the utterances of honorable members on this side from anything disagreeable or annoying would perhaps die. The Treasurer and other honorable gentlemen opposite are alert to put us in our places - to determine what books we shall read and what speeches we shall make, and how we shall head them. However, I realize that, even if a man were gifted with the tongues of angels, or if he were like the cherubim and continually did cry, he would not alter the vote by one fifty-millionth part of a hair&#39;s-breadth. Honorable gentlemen opposite have been announcing their freedom to a sceptical people. They have been here eight weeks, and they are signalizing their freedom in a way which was never attempted in the &#39;House before - they are going to vote to-night which way the Government tell them,, lest they should be left off the Fusion ticket. </para>

                    <para>. - I am a member of the Printing Committee ; but I approve of neither the proposal of the Prime Minister nor the amendment. The duty of the custodian of the privileges of Parliament rests with the  Speaker,  and he ought to say what shall or shall not be printed, at the instance of honorable members. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports are not a true record of the remarks made by honorable members, but a very capable summary ; a.nu there is no reason whatever, so far as I can see, for objection to the raising of a line occasionally, so as to give point to the subjects touched on. Such head-lines make a report all the more readable, and do not interfere with the ordinary literary context. The head-lines are taken from the body of the speech, and are used so that people may grasp the ideas expressed more readily ; and, as I say, they give additional interest, and make the speeches more widely&#39; read. Further, I think that the reprinting of speeches should be encouraged, because honorable members have not the means to place their utterances before their constituents in any other way. There are but few honorable members who have the privilege of being reported in the press; and these are the pet men of the press, which booms them from time to time all over Australia. The electors have no way of learning what is being done by their representatives generally other than by a reproduction of the speeches. Is it because these reprints can be obtained cheaply that exception is taken to their publication by the Government Printer? It must be so, or otherwise, if money were no consideration, honorable members could go to private firms, and have the reprints issued in their own way. But the expense is a great consideration ; so great, that if the work were done elsewhere than in the Government Printing Office, honorable members must forego the opportunity to place their constituents in possesion pf their views. In the interests of the electors, we should allow these reprints, because to-day the press is governing this Parliament. The  press makes the policy of the Government - it will boom any policy that it foreshadows - and when the policy is a failure it will urge the throwing out of the Government. Our only appeal to the people is by the republication of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> speeches; but I have no sympathy with those who would alter the reports. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> gives a very excellent summary, and with the  Speaker  should rest the responsibility of saying what should or should not be a cross-heading. It is only fair that nothing offensive, or likely to injure another honorable member should be permitted ; but I have every confidence in the  Speaker.  Of course, if the  Speaker  did what was unfair - a thing of which he is incapable - we should have the matter in our own hands, because he would, on the floor of the House, have to give an account of his stewardship. I shall not release the  Speaker  from the responsibility of being censor; and I hope the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports will be brought under his notice from time to time, so that  jio  honorable member shall take the liberty of cutting out an interjection. Such a deletion, I regard as most unfair. We know that interjections are not reported unless the honorable member who is speaking, refers to them ; and it is unjust to remove an interjection and leave in the reference that caused it. The republication of speeches is really an increased circulation of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and will do good rather than harm. </para>

                    <para>.- Some honorable members seem to confuse the form with the essence. The honorable, member for Wentworth objects to cross-headings, or to any republication except in&#39; exactly the same form as the speech may occur in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> No honorable member has urged that any word should be added to or taken away from the speeches. ; and&#34; hence there is no division of opinion on that point. As already pointed out, the form of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports is entirely out of date. All who know anything of newspaper or printing work, are aware that the. tendency is to break up matter into paragraphs, and to indicate the separate subjects dealt with. I suppose that the honorable member for Wentworth would object to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report being broken up into paragraphs, and would have us adhere to the old-fashioned method. The honorable member and others have suggested that the printing could be done by outside firms; but in this there is a real danger. Both those who oppose and those who support head-lines, agree that any speeches published should be reprints of them as reported by the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. If the printing were done outside, there could be no check ; and we have had some experience already of alterations made even under the present system. I was certainly very much surprised to hear the Treasurer publicly admit that he had cut out portions of his speech, and still more surprised to hear no condemnation of that conduct from the honorable members behind the Government. It would seem that anything the Government do is right, while everything that we on this side do is wrong. In view of the danger I have indicated, there should be no encouragement given to the reprinting of speeches outside the Government Printing Office when something may be put in that has not been said, making the publication misleading. I am at a loss to understand why the circulation of speeches should be discouraged. The honorable member for Maribyrnong seems to be tired of the Fusion, and therefore has moved to take the business of the House out of the hand&#39;s of the Government. He wishes us to be bound down to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> form in the reprinting of our speeches. Really, the House should not be called upon to discuss a question of this kind, because it is not big enough. The proper course is to submit the matter to the Printing Committee for the drafting of a regulation for the guidance of the Government Printer. The honorable members for Maribyrnong and Grampians appear to have no faith in the Printing Committee, and wish the House to deal with details with which it is unfitted to deal. The members of the Printing Committee know the feeling of the House, and can thresh out the matter without delaying public business. Our aim must be to secure the accurate publishing of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> What has been said about taking work from outside printers is mere hypocrisy. If the work of the Government Printing Office is increased by the paragraphing of speeches, and the use of more frequent headings, extra hands will have to be employed. Therefore, the cheap sneer at the recognised friends of the workers who sit on this side of the chamber is unworthy of the honorable member who made it. As it has been continually suggested that speeches are reprinted for nothing, or at a very cheap rate, I would point out that no evidence has been adduced to show that they are not printed at a profit. Indeed, it is questionable whether they could not be done privately for less. What we have to do is, first, to see that the reports and reprints are accurate, and, secondly, that they are made as readable as possible. It is important that electors should take an interest in political questions, and the circulation of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in an, attractive form will encourage them to do so. This can be done without cost to the country, and at a profit to the Government Printing Office, members themselves bearing the expense. The honorable member for Maribyrnong has no consideration for the electors. Would he contend that the report should be <inline font-style="italic">literatim et verbatim,</inline> the speeches printed exactly as they are uttered, with all their redundancy, hesitancy, and repetition? If so, I do not agree with him. We are greatly indebted to our officials for the excellent reports which they make. I believe that the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is the finest staff of reporters in the world. But the printing of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> could be improved. To my mind, it would be an advantage to break the speeches up into paragraphs. When a leading member makes an important address on a question like the Budget, he speaks on a number of separate subjects, and it would greatly facilitate reference, and make such a speech clearer, if each subject were given as a separate paragraph. It would also be an advantage to indicate by a heading the subject-matter of the paragraph. Similar information is given in connexion with the clauses of Bills, but the double-column measure used for the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports makes side-notes like those of clauses impossible. Such an arrangement would greatly convenience those honorable members who are fond of going back to the past, to find out what others have said. </para>

                        <para>- No party suffers so much as the Opposition in having its speeches suppressed by the newspapers, but many Ministerialists get very brief reports. The Prime Minister was at one time in favour of making voting compulsory, but before that is done the electors should be given an. opportunity to get their political information at first hand. In Queensland there is a large circulation of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but the people of that State would know nothing of Federal politics, were it not for the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports. Honorable members, whatever their party, should encourage the circulation of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> so that the electors may exercise their votes intelligently. I have a very poor opinion of the Government and its supporters, but I hardly think that honorable members opposite would act so meanly as to try to prevent Oppositionists from being heard by the country. The honorable member for Grampians seemed to think that he had made a most wonderful discovery in the letters which he read. But the Treasurer properly declined to be a censor of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner to give to the Government Printer the direction which was sent to him in 1903 was an assumption of authority which they did not possess. The Government have done the right thing in bringing the matter before Parliament, and moving that it be referred to the Printing Committee.If there is to be a censor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> should act, but before anything else is done, the Printing Committee should draft a rule dealing with the whole matter. We could then lay down the rule that reprints must be exact copies of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> If, however, the Committee want to adhere to the present form of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and allow cross-headings, that can be done by breaking and setting up in larger type here and there a word or a line already appearing in the speech. That could possibly be left to the Government Printer, but the best person to superintend it would be the head of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. We have the utmost faith in the staff, for we have had experience of their work. I have no objection to leaving the matter to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> but I understand that you very naturally do not care about undertaking it. The work, however, is exactly in the line of work of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. It would not impose greatly increased duties upon them, for it is only on big occasions that speeches are reprinted. I do not think there are enough reprints, and the practice should be encouraged. It would not take long for the head of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff to see that the cross-headings were correct. I hope the motion to remit the matter to the Printing Committee will be carried. If it is, I commend to the Committee some of the suggestions that I have made. Our time this afternoon will not have been wasted if we get an improved production of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and an increased circulation of it, and induce more electors to read it. </para>

                    <para>.- You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> must consider yourself a very lucky man to-day, after hearing this debate, in having refused, as you did recently, to act as censor in regard to headlines. The honorable member for Maribyrnong does not propose by his amendment that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> shall not be improved, or that it shall not be brightened up by paragraphs. All he says is that as a member of the House he refuses to hand over to the Printing Committee the power to re commend what should or should not appear in what are called reprints of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Honorable members opposite suggest that those who oppose their right to insert display headings on their own initiative are simply the darlings of the gods or of the press, which in this case amounts to the same thing. They also insinuate that those who would refuse them that privilege are simply capitalists who can afford to circulate their own speeches. I am neither one nor the other, but I intend to oppose the practice in the best interests of Democracy. Honorable members in their own interests, if they believe in educating the public, should set their faces against the introduction to Australia of the dangerous spirit of pamphleteering that arose a few years back in France. It is one of the most dangerous innovations possible to democratic thought and teaching. Honorable members who say that they must put display head-lines in: their speeches are practically admitting that the electors are not keen enough on public affairs, or interested enough in their representatives to read the debates without them. That is an admission that the public already have enough material to read, and that their attention can only be seized by fancy head-lines. </para>

                        <para>- It is a fact. Although I have been sixteen years in public life, I have only once attempted to reprint a speech in pamphlet form, and I shall probably regret it ever afterwards. I agree with honorable members that we have much to thank <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for. It is certainly bad to cut out interjections as the Treasurer has done, because a speech itself is dead enough as it appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and if the interjections are cut out most of the speeches might as well be delivered to a morgue. Any man with half an eye can always tell the stuff that has been shovelled into the newspapers by public men who have got the ear of the press, either by paying for it as in South Australia, or by engineering it as in Melbourne or Sydney, because such matter always comes out dead, flat, and uninteresting, I would rather have a few lines  in a report of a public meeting where there was life and vitality and interjections by the public, than the morgue-like speeches which some honorable members of influence - and, I will admit, of purse - get into the public press of Australia. I am astonished at honorable members asking that they themselves should write the head-lines, and that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> should be the public censor of them. I cannot picture you holding that position for long. If I, for instance, with my occasionally captious spirit, caught the disease of issuing pamphlets, I could put before you headlines that would probably stagger you, and that you would at once object to. When the House met you would find the honorable member for Dalley on his feet pleading for fair-play, and so it would be in the cases of others, although you might think that you were acting judiciously in the interests of honorable members themselves. I am pleased that some honorable members opposite refuse to give this power to the Printing Committee, but why are many Labour members prepared to surrender their individuality to that body? Why give the Printing Committee the right to say what shall appear in their speeches ? Apparently men who profess to fight for liberty, advanced thought, and free parliamentary institutions, are ready to surrender to a Committee of this House for the time being the right to say what shall or shall not go out to the public. </para>

                        <para>- It is not necessary to surrender it to anybody. The honorable member for Wide Bay has watered down his demands, for he now says he wants no other head-lines than words that appear in the speeches themselves. If I wanted an attractive head-line, I should have sufficient ingenuity to bring it into my speech. I could say, for instance, that the demand for freedom to draft their own head-lines came from &#34; Fisher&#39;s frenzied followers,&#34; and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> could be asked to make a head-line of that. I could further say that the demand was opposed, not by the capitalistic section, or by the darlings of the press, but because of &#34; Deakin&#39;s Devilry Detected.&#34; It is easy for honorable members when on their feet to be alliterative, if they so desire. The desire of some honorable members to write special head-lines of their own savours too much of the circus poster business. I agree with the honorable member for Hume and the honorable member for Wide Bay that the press only report certain people, and injure certain other members of Parliament. I believe, with them, that the electors in the far distant parts of the Commonwealth should be afforded opportunities of learning what takes place in Parliament. The way to secure that is to establish a daily <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> as the honor able member for Hume proposes. But let that daily <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> be as pure as purity itself, and let it be undefiled by the interference of any Printing Committee, or Speaker, or honorable member of the House. It should be left in the hands of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff itself, We have had experience of the chief of the staff for some years, and I must say that if all our speeches were presented to the public in the way in which they are delivered in the House, very few of us would be returned again. I occasionally read in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> speeches which I have never heard delivered in this House, including some of my own. The beauty of the language employed by the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff is the thing that surprises me on many occasions. I admire their literary ability. I am told that some honorable members correct their speeches, but if that is so, I cannot understand what is the matter with them. They must have vanity beyond all conception if they attempt to correct their speeches after the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff have prepared them. I do not regard this afternoon as having been wasted, for the question is a most important one, affecting the interests of all honorable members. When honorable members opposite say that we on this side are in the hands of capitalists, let me tell them that during my term of public life no purse but my own has ever paid my electioneering expenses, or the cost of circulating my speeches, and no purse but my own will ever attempt to do so. When honorable members say that we oppose the practice which has grown up because we are the darlings of the press, or the mere instruments of rich corporations, they are not doing justice to themselves or to the position. There are greater dangers in members being allowed to tamper with their speeches, but I certainly think the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff could brighten the reports up by breaking them into paragraphs. They might be allowed discretion to do that, but the public certainly do not require that honorable members shall be allowed to lay traps in the shape of personal and offensive head-lines. I think the thing will cure itself, because if honorable members deluge Australia with their speeches on all occasions, the public simply will not read them. I would advise honorable members to read the reply of Robert Burns, one of the most Democratic poets that ever lived, to a gentleman who sent him a paper, and informed him that it would always be sent to him free. That will be found  a  most apt quotation for those who desire to inflict pamphlets on the community. Honorable members will not be prevented by the amendment of the honorable member for Maribyrnong from reprinting their speeches. They will still have the cheap and ready facility of the Government Printing Office to do so;. .nor does the honorable member for Maribyrnong say that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> shall not be improved or paragraphed, to make it more readable, but that is the work of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> will be the best director in that matter in the interests of the general public, as .you know no party. If things go much further, some honorable member who has a genius for sketching may in a few years ask to be allowed to publish his own speeches with illustrations. Another may ask, &#39; &#39; Why not allow me to furnish the Government Printing Office with blocks to be published in my reprints from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> showing how Deakin looked after I had dealt with him, or how Fisher looked when I followed him?&#34; If honorable members opposite were able to announce to the public, &#34; The honorable member for Dalley has been engaged to supply us with a few comic sketches which will appear in the next reprint of our speeches,&#34; I am sure that their pamphlets would be far more widely read than they are. We now find honorable members opposite gradually drifting away from their original contention, that cross-headings should be permitted, and simply urging that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> should be made more readable. I shall support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Maribyrnong. </para>

                        <para>- Such an amendment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> will entirely remove the objection that I intended to raise. I think it right that some properly constituted body should be called upon to make a recommendation that will be likely to do away with the friction that has arisen. I have before me the official papers relating to this matter. They appear to be records of the Treasury, but have been circulated so freely amongst honorable members, and have been referred to so often, that I think they should be made records of the House. These papers show that in the first place <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, when Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, declined to allow reprints from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to be executed by the Government Printing Office. Subsequently the question of the introduction of headings in reprints was raised, and the decision which has already been quoted was arrived at. It appears that the present Treasurer recently intimated to the Government Printer that that decision must be strictly adhered to, but we find that he (was the first to depart from it. He broke the rule laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton in a way which I think no honorable member has ever attempted to do, by omitting from reprints of his speeches from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> interjections which were made, probably with the object of correcting misrepresentations. In these reprints the right honorable gentleman preserved only the report of his own remarks. I do not think that an honorable member who has any consideration for his honour and reputation as a politician would ever dream of eliminating&#39; interjections from what purported to be a reprint from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of a speech made by him in this House. Another peculiarity in connexion .with the official papers is- that only two or three honorable members are mentioned in them. </para>

                        <para>- That is a question that I intended to put. Is it another indication of the way in which the Government  intend to&#39; carry on their party warfare? Do they intend to point out by means of these official papers what some honorable member on this side of the House has done, and to keep from the public that which Ministerialists have done? T believe that honorable members on the Government side of the House have distributed far more reprints of their speeches - and reprints in which cross-headings have been introduced - than have the Opposition. The Treasurer tried to belittle the honorable member for Hume by showing that he had sought to introduce certain cross-headings into a reprint from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of a speech which he recently delivered in this House. I have a copy of that reprint before me, and find that it does not contain one cross-heading. As a matter of fact, the honorable member did1 not desire to use any, but a gentleman who was acting for him suggested that some should be inserted, with the result that there was prepared a list of cross-headings which the Treasurer has described as &#34; a disgrace to Parliament.&#34; I have compared those cross-headings with the speech made in the House by the honorable member for Hume, and find! that there is not a word in any of them which was no!: actually used in the speech. If those headings are a disgrace to Parliament, why were they allowed to be uttered in this House? I think that the Treasurer brought forward this list with the deliberate intention of heaping contumely on honorable members on this side of the House. We all know that the daily newspapers are strongly partisan, and that the two great morning newspapers published in Melbourne are for the time being in favour of the Fusion. How long they will continue to support the Government I do not know, but no one will deny that they devote far more space to the speeches of the Ministry and  their  supporters than they do to the speeches of the Opposition. The honorable member for Wentworth made a statement that is certainly calculated to mislead the public. He declared that the Opposition and those sympathizing with them were a cringing, cowardly, impecunious lot of men; that they desired to loaf on the people of Australia by getting something for nothing from the Government Printing Office. When he made that statement the honorable member must have known that no honorable member has ever obtained from the Government Printing Office a reprint from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> without paying for it. </para>

The daily newspapers often put up striking headings, and only a few days ago the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> &#34;headlined &#34; the honorable member for Wentworth. It desired to know what he meant when he said that he was packing his carpetbag, and it asserted that it was time for him to declare himself on either one side or the other. I think that the honorable member is still sitting on a rail. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member also endeavoured to make it appear that he and those thinking with him were specially solicitous for the honest working man. He said, in effect, &#34; Why not give this work to the honest working man and not find more work for those who are employed in the Government Printing Office?&#34; When I interjected, the honorable member, it seemed to me, purposely refused to attach to my words the meaning that I intended to convey. What I said, in effect, was that those employed in the Government Printing Office were honest men and unionists, and that therefore we were doing no wrong by having reprints from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> published from the Government Printing Office. My point was that the more work we gave the Government Printer by ordering reprints the more men would be employed there. I do not know what particular claim the honorable gentleman has to raise as the  cham-pion  of the honest working man. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter what the form is. What we require are facilities for honorable members to lay their utterances before the people, so that it may be known that there is some patriotism, liberalism, and progressiveness left amongst our legislators. Such information would never reach the people if the duty of recording it were left to the daily newspapers I have mentioned. Had it not been for the intimation that the Prime Minister desires to alter the motion, I should have voted against it. I refuse, for one, to delegate to any body outside Parliament the power which the people have given me as their representative. As for the amendment, I regard it as meaningless, and it should be withdrawn if the honorable member for Maribyrnong desires to shorten the debate. What objection has that honorable member to the utterances of honorable members being issued to the people? </para>

                        <para>- No, I do not. If any honorable member wishes to have type lifted in order to form a head-line - which really has the effect that a marginal note has in a Bill - and he is prepared to pay for the work, I see no reason why he should be prevented. I would uphold the dignity of the House in every respect, and would disallow any cross-headings which are personally offensive. There was nothing personally offensive in the cross-headings of the speech of the honorable member for Hume; indeed, much stronger terms were used in the body of the speech, which stands as a record for ever. If the motion be carried, the onus will be thrown upon the Printing Committee of bringing up some recommendation as to how far honorable members may go in the future. Something must be done, because, under present circumstances, there is such serious  delay  that the speeches lose their point before they can be issued. To any recommendation of the Printing Committee I shall give close attention, with a, view to conserving the right of every honorable member, at his own expense, to publish his utterances as freely as is consistent with the dignity of this Chamber. </para>

                    <para>.- I think I am safe in saying that during the last few sittings quite six hours have been consumed in discussing this question ; and I do not regard the subject of sufficient importance to warrant this expenditure of time. In my opinion, we ought to adopt the amendment. Honorable members have sufficient privilege when they are allowed to obtain from the Government Printer, at cost price, reprints of their speeches as they appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I have never had any reprints made myself, but I heard it stated, I think by the Treasurer and others, that members are allowed to have reprints at what  they  actually cost the Printing Office; and that is quite as much as any honorable member has a right t to ask. If honorable members are not content, and desire to embellish or alter their speeches with scare or other head-lines, they should go to some outside printer, and provide a little work for unionists who do not happen to have fixed Government billets. If I may say so, unionists have done rather a handsome thing in sending honorable members opposite here as their representatives ; and the least those honorable members can do, when there is any employment available, is to give it to unionists. Like other privileges, this one has ended in abuse. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care where the abuse is. The amendment, if adopted, will have the effect of preventing any abuse in the future, whereas, if matters be allowed to go as at present, a censor will have to be appointed, or the Printing Committee will have to act. If the Printing Committee have to act, the result will be, as pointed out by the honorable member for Riverina, that a fortnight or a month may elapse before the reprints are issued, and by that time they will be really of little or no use. It is better to nip this in. the bud at once - to say that, in our opinion, there shall be no reprints, except of the speeches exactly as recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Honorable members owe the official reporters their thanks for the manner in which their utterances are recorded. There is not much that one would wish to add or take away from the published reports, which may well go forth as a fair record of what is said and done here. </para>

                    <para>.- Nearly twenty years ago I came to the conclusion that it would be advantageous to honorable members to have the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports of their speeches reprinted; though it did not then occur to me, or to those who supported the action which I took, that &#34;it would be desirable to introduce head-lines. About fourteen years ago, after a hard fight, I got the Government of the day to allow the stereotyping of speeches. This, as no doubt honorable members know, is a very inexpensive process, and the stereos, costing is. or is. 6d., can be stored away for future use. No one could say that a stereotyped reprint is not an exact copy. I have belonged to a party- whose safety in the past has been the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports. I was in the Victorian Assembly before there was a Labour party, when the press cared little what it published, so long as it &#34; downed &#34; us. But we had <inline font-style="italic">Hansard to</inline> appeal to. and, knowing the value of such support, I hesitate now to express an opinion in favour of any alteration of the official record. I pay my meed of praise to the Chief Parliamentary Reporter for the manner in which the work of the Commonwealth staff is done. I have never read more accurate reports than those of the speeches which have been delivered in this chamber since I became a member of the House. Of course, mistakes must occur at times; but honorable members have the opportunity to rectify them, and once the report has been corrected and published, it should not be altered. If it be the general opinion that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> would be more readable if the report were broken up into paragraphs, preceded with head-lines, let that be done before publication, and let each reprint be an accurate copy. A reprint containing head-lines which were not used in the original publication, is not an accurate copy. I know that outside printers sometimes object to the use of the Government Printing Office for the issue of member&#39;s speeches. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">I do not complain of that, and it was one of the reasons why I got permission for the taking of stereos. The public should know, if the reprints contain head-lines, and are paragraphed, that the alterations have been made by the member issuing them ; but it would be better that reprints should be exact copies in the legal sense. I regret that the Treasurer, in giving examples of the. way in which head-lines have been introduced, should have picked out the speeches of three Oppositionists. It would have been fairer to have taken speeches of members of both parties. The issue of a daily <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> would cure everything. If such a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> were issued, I would not allow an honorable member to make any alterations. The report would be edited by our own officials, in whom we should have full confidence, and they could be removed if they abused their power. I look forward to the time when public opinion will be so advanced that those who are now Labour men will be thought Conservatives. The honorable member for Wilmot laughs. No doubt, when that time arrives, members of his way of thinking will be as rare as the dodo. A daily <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard,</inline> carrying all the Government advertisements, and issued in the capitals of the six States, would be a publication of great power. Commercial men advertise in papers like the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> because of their circulation. The publication with the greatest number of subscribers will always get the most advertisements, and a daily <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> would therefore bring in an immense revenue. But <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> must be sacred as a book of reference. Honorable members must be able to point to that record as containing an absolutely true account of what is said in Parliament. A daily issue would be widely read. No honorable member would be afraid of letting his constituents know the opinions which he puts forward here. At the present time we each have twenty-five <inline font-style="italic">Hansards</inline> to circulate, and represent something like 30,000 electors. The publication goes to clubs, schools of arts, mechanics&#39; institutes, debating societies, and similar institutions, but not one per cent, of the population has an opportunity of reading it. Were it published daily at &#189;d., the price of the newspapers which have the largest circulation in the world, it would be read in the homes of the workers, or, at any rate, of all who take an interest in political questions, and wish to forward the cause of Democracy. In my opinion, if <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> has to be altered by the paragraphing of speeches, and the insertion of headlines, that should be done before publication, and, if necessary, someone should be appointed to determine what head-lines should be used. But reprints should be true copies of the official record, and the members issuing them should be able to say, &#34; These are correct reports of the speeches which we have delivered.&#34; </para>

                    (Fawkner) &#91;5.21J.- Judging by the duration of this discussion in our National Parliament, the subject before us must be an important one. I was at first inclined to agree with the Prime Minister that it should be referred to the Printing Committee to determine what headlines shall be used in reprints of speeches. When debates are republished by the Government Printing Office, the corporate honour of Parliament is in some degree concerned with the manner of publication. But the Leader of the Opposition has shown that speeches must either be reprinted entirely as they appear in
                    <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline>
                    or members must be allowed to use whatever head-lines they please. Clearly, honorable members could not tolerate anything in the nature of censorship in the matter of head-lines. Therefore, I am forced to support the proposal of the honorable member for Maribyrnong that speeches should be reprinted exactly, as originally published.

                        <para>- I am aware of that, but the feeling of loyalty in the Labour party is so strong that probably honorable members opposite could get their effusions issued for less than cost price. At any rate, any censorship is impossible. The honorable member for Wentworth has suggested that unionist printers who are not in the Government Printing Office could be employed now and again; a very fair suggestion. At times work in the printing trade is very slack, and if honor- able members gave employment occasionally to those outside the ring fence, it would be appreciated. </para>

                        <para>- There are a great many things about the Opposition that I cannot be expected to explain. The honorable member for West Sydney sneered at the honorable member for Wentworth in a personal way, which appeared to most of us to be in singularly bad taste. However, we let it pass, for we do not stoop to tactics of that sort. The suggestion of the honorable member for Wentworth was really a good one. There are people in straitened circumstances in the printing trade outside who would be glad to get the work. The honorable member for Riverina said it would not cost any more, and I am prepared to take his word for it. After this debate the only possible course open to us seems to be to adopt the amendment of the honorable member for Maribyrnong. It is obvious that no honorable member or body of members will stand censorship from any one. I thought at first that the Printing Committee would be an admirable body to undertake the work, and I should have supported the proposal if all honorable members had fallen in with it readily; but we can now see what the result would) be. The House would be a regular bear garden. Instead of having this sort of debate continuing for a week only, the whole of the time of Parliament would be monopolized by it. If honorable members opposite will entertain the suggestion of the honorable member for Wentworth, they can go to the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call,</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Liberty and Progress,</inline> or even the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and get reasonable terms. There are numbers of people out of employment who would be willing to make arrangements to do the printing practically at cost price. </para>

                    <para>.- The whole trouble seems to have arisen through the error into which the Prime Minister must have fallen the other day, when he suggested as a remedy the reference of this question to the Printing Committee. I asked him on more than one occasion whether he could personally authorize that reference. He consulted with you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> so far as I could see, and then came back, and told me, as the result of his conference with you, that it would be in order for him to do so. </para>

Many things said this afternoon have been practically aimed at the party on this side. We have heard no admissions of guilt from those sitting opposite who were the originators of the present system. They have for years availed themselves of the privilege of inserting head-lines in their addresses,, while in some cases they have cut out interjections, and in others they have cut out from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> parts of the speeches which they have delivered in the House. </para>

They have lopped off here and there what did not suit them, and put in paragraphs which they thought on reflection would better express what was in their minds.

                        <para>- At any rate, that has been done, as honorable members well know. What is more, the greatest sinner of all in the matter of interference with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports has been the Treasurer, who begins, immediately he gets into power, to exercise that despotism for which he has been renowned throughout his career. He sits in judgment upon his fellow members, and tells us that the Government Printer drew his attention to something which was going on. As several honorable members have quoted head-lines culled from the reprint of my speech, which has been in the hands of the Government Printer for two or three weeks, let me tell the House and the country how far the Treasurer has gone. Do honorable members know that there has appeared in the daily press matter which has never appeared in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> although it was spoken in this House? </para>

                        <para>- The date of the occurrence was 17th September, 1907. I take it that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> would not print nearly three-quarters of a column of what the right honorable member for Swan said if it had not been spoken in the House. That report appears in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of Wednesday, 1 8th September, 1907, and yet there is not a word of it to be found in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I will read what the present Treasurer has succeeded in getting cut out of the records of the House, which are supposed to be sacred so far as parties are concerned. </para>

                        <para>- The question of the elimination of the report from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> was not placed before the House in the ordinary way. When an honorable member desires that something shall be expunged from the records of Parliament, the only course open to him is to submit a motion to the House that the words in question be removed from the records. No such action was taken by the Treasurer. In some secret way he succeeded in eliminating from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a report of the proceedings to which I have referred, and I venture to say that the incident is unexampled in the history of any other Parliament. The Treasurer has admitted that in reprints of his speeches, as published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> he has cut out junks from the official report and inserted new matter, which he never uttered in the House ; and we find now that he has succeeded in cutting out of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the whole report of a speech made by him in reply to the honorable member for Coolgardie, who had been castigating him for his inconsistency with respect to the Tariff. Are the Labour party to be made the butt of men of his type? In return for the generous treatment extended to him by an honorable member of the Labour party in permitting him to have this matter eliminated from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> he begins, as soon as he takes office as Treasurer, to place the iron heel of despotism upon the Labour party. Six years have elapsed since <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, as Prime Minister, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, as Treasurer, determined that reprints of members&#39; speeches published by the Government Printer must be an actual reproduction of the official report, but ever since then the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and other honorable members on the Government side of the House who have availed themselves of this privilege have wholly disregarded that edict. The question now at issue is whether this differential treatment of honorable members is to be permitted. It savours very much of the dark ages. If, in the course of events, the honorable member for Flinders becomes Prime Minister, and has the power which the Treasurer seems to possess, members of the Labour party will probably be prevented from going on public platforms and giving utterance to their thoughts. We shall probably be prevented from making public speeches. I have arrived at that conclusion because of what, the honorable member did in connexion with a celebrated case, when he was Premier of Victoria, some few years ago. The action of the Treasurer in securing the excision from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of a lengthy report of an incident in this House ought not to be tolerated. We have heard a great deal as to the equity of his decision that cross-headings shall not be permitted in reprints, but very few of the representatives of Victoria are aware of the position of those who represent distant electorates. It takes many of us a week to travel to and from our electorates: I have not toured my constituency since the last general election, having been engaged on public business, and I think it cruel that I should be denied an opportunity of placing before my constituents reprints from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of speeches made in this House. The daily papers do not report, save in a mutilated and offensive fashion, any remarks that I make, and surely I ought not to be prevented from doing that which honorable members opposite have done for the last six years, without any objection being raised. If the House decides that reprints sent out from the Government Printing Office shall be an actual reproduction of the official reports, I shall offer no objection. It is mean of the Treasurer to use this privilege for six years, and then, without notice or warning, deprive honorable mem1 bers of its advantage. Who bestowed on the Treasurer the power to censor honorable members&#39; speeches? The honorable gentleman says that he does not like the duty ; but he is performing the duty all the time. In order that the speech I made a short time ago should, whatever may be its value, reach my constituents, whom I have not been able to visit for nearly three years; I asked the Treasurer to allow me, in lieu of head-lines, to underline some of the words and sentences so that they might appear in raised type, and thus cut up the solidity of the matter. One would have thought that the Treasurer could not have refused such a request, seeing that the words I desired to underline had been uttered in this chamber under the Speakership of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, who was ever keen to observe when an honorable member infringed the rules or passed the boundary of good taste. The Treasurer, however, set himself up as the judge, and refused me the permission sought; and I can only say that in so doing he acted the part of a despot pure and simple. I can quite understand that it would not be a fair head-line if ah honorable member were to use words of the right honorable member for East Sydney, when he called the honorable member for Corio&#34; a freak of nature.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- Nor would it be fair to put up as a head-line the words used by the honorable member for Wentworth, when he spoke of the Prime Minister as &#34; Sneaky Deakin,&#34; or described him as &#34; walking behind with a stiletto.&#34; Nevertheless, these have been uttered in this House by prominent members, and recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> unless in some cases they have been amended. I challenge the Treasurer, the Government Printer, or the  Speaker  to say that any one of the headlines that I suggested for the reprint of my own speech was. not appropriate to the subject-matter. </para>

                        <para>- They were mostly, but other honorable members, in their reprints, have paid no regard to the substance of the speeches. For instance, when the Prime Minister used the head-line, &#34;Cutthroat tactics,&#34; there was nothing in the matter which followed to justify the reference. The Treasurer has read some of the head-lines that I desired to use, but, of course, he selected only those which suited his own purpose. As the honorable gentleman has- placed a selected few on record, it is only fair that I should let honorable members know what the others were. As I have shown, it was not only the head-lines that were objected to by the Treasurer, but the whole speech, seeing that he would not allow me to even break it up by means of raised words or sentences. </para>

                        <para>- What are we to think of the Treasurer? Here is a gentleman who sets himself up as a judge of something he has never heard or read ! What can be actuating the honorable member? It cannot be reason ; it cannot be judgment, because he could not judge without reading or hearing; and it cannot be a desire to do what is right to honorable members. No ; it is party bias and party tactics, with the object of boycotting honorable members of this House as effectively as possible. The following are the headlines that I. desired to use -  &#34;A Novel Stonewaller.&#34; &#34;An Able Effort.&#34; &#34; How they Evolved.&#34; &#34;Eternal Strife.&#34; &#34;What shall we do to be Saved?&#34; &#34;The Stiletto.&#34; &#34; Not a First&#39; Offender.&#34; &#34; Measures, not Men.&#34; &#34;Notice to Quit.&#34; &#34; Treacherous Treatment.&#34; &#34;Betrayal of Alfred.&#34; &#34; Quintette of Peddling Politicians.&#34; &#34;Look at Them!&#34; &#39; &#34;The Men who Left their Post.&#34; &#34;A Double Shuffle.&#34; &#34; Save Thyself at all Cost.&#34; &#34;The Famous Quartette.&#34; &#34; The Idol of the &#39; Age.&#39; &#34; &#34;The Only King.&#34; &#34;The Medium.&#34; &#34; Did not know it was Loaded.&#34; &#34;A Political Anarchist.&#34; &#34;We Asked for Bread and Received a Stone.&#34; &#34; Lawyers Bad and Worse.&#34; &#34;The Advent of the Labour Party.&#34; &#34; The Medium and the Monarchs.&#34; &#34; New Protection Promised.&#34; &#34;Dished Again.&#34; &#34;The Broken Promise.&#34; &#34; The Demon of Modern Politics.&#34; &#34; Black-hearted Treachery.&#34; &#34; A Fool or a Sacrifice.&#34; &#34;The Man Behind the Mask.&#34; &#34;The Trinity of Remnants.&#34; &#34;A Figurehead.&#34; &#34;Keep Him in Front.&#34; &#34; Once a Lawyer, Always a Lawyer.&#34; &#34;Cook&#39;s Refuge.&#34; &#34; He is a Renegade.&#34; &#34; The Reason Why.&#34; &#34;The Buffers.&#34; &#34; Humiliation.&#34; &#34;A Miner.&#34; &#34;A Republican.&#34; &#34;A Protectionist.&#34; &#34; A Confiscator.&#34; &#34;A Cry for Mercy.&#34; &#34;The Mirror.&#34; &#34;A Free Trader.&#34; &#34;The Opportunist.&#34; &#34; Reid the Conjurer.&#34; &#34;An Outcast.&#34; &#34;Nailed to the Mast.&#34; &#34; The Day of Judgment.&#34; &#34; Missed the &#39;Bus.&#34; &#34; The Surrender. &#34; The Tories. &#34;Work the Oracle.&#34; &#34;One at a Time.&#34; &#34;Right at Last.&#34; &#34;A Deaf Ear.&#34;  &#34;The Primeval Emperor. &#34;Deprived of Power.&#34; &#34;Ten, not Seven.&#34; &#34;The Pawns.&#34; &#34;What a Shock.&#34; &#34;Reid&#39;s Downfall.&#34; &#34;The Resurrection.&#34; &#34;More Billets.&#34; &#34;The Branding Iron.&#34; &#34; The Coercionist.&#34; &#34; The Threat that Failed.&#34; &#34;The Noble Eight Hundred.&#34; &#34;The Grave Digger.&#34; &#34;The Golden Bullets.&#34; &#34; Farmers, Beware !&#34; &#34;Deer for Peers.&#34; &#34;England&#39;s Folly.&#34; &#34;The Downfall of Nations.&#34; &#34;Press Boycott Labour.&#34; &#34;A Daily <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.&#34;</inline> &#34;Cut to the Bone.&#34; &#34;The Writing on the Wall.&#34; &#34; Brief History of Australian Land Laws.&#34; &#34; Peacocking.&#34; &#34;A Dead Letter.&#34; &#34;The Golden West.&#34; &#34;Land Laws Galore.&#34; &#34;The Tight Little Island.&#34; &#34;Unlucky Number.&#34; &#34; Penalizing the Poor.&#34; &#34;The  Squatter  King.&#34; &#34;The Gilded Absentees.&#34; &#34;The Day of Reckoning.&#34; &#34; The Trail of the Lawyer. &#34;The Political Land Agent.&#34; &#34; A Government of Lawyers.&#34; &#34;Crowded Out.&#34; &#34;Closure Settlement.&#34; &#34;The Enemy of the Farmer.&#34; &#34; Experience Teaches.&#34; &#34;Land Transferred.&#34; &#34; Improvement Leases.&#34; &#34; Reduced Settlement.&#34; &#34;Educate our Boys, &#39;For What?&#39;&#34; &#34;Require Watching.&#34; &#34;Postpone the Evil Day.&#34; &#34; If the States will not Act.&#34; &#34;How Long are we Secure?&#34; &#34; Our Responsibility.&#34; &#34;A Correction.&#34;&#34; &#34;Queer Bedfellows.&#34; &#34; National Danger.&#34; &#34; The People&#39;s Vengeance.&#34; &#34; Innocence or Ignorance.&#34; &#34;A Rotten Foundation.&#34; &#34;Farmers&#39; Decoy.&#34; &#34;Farmers, Note This.&#34; &#34;Put a Pin in that Spot.&#34; &#34;Once Bitten, Twice Shy.&#34; &#34; False Pretences.&#34; &#34;A Page of History.&#34; &#34;Reid&#39;s Advent.&#34; &#34;Why I was a Free Trader.&#34; &#34;The Chess-board of National Politics.&#34; &#34;The Respite.&#34; &#34; Temporary Salvation.&#34; &#34;An Honest Effort.&#34; &#34;New Zealand&#39;s&#39; Error.&#34; &#34;Where is the Man?&#34; &#34; Socialism.&#34; &#34; True .

                <para class="block">What is there to object to in those headlines, which were simply designed to indicate to the people the subjects dealt with in the various parts of the speech? Is there any reason why we should not paragraph the speeches, so that the public may select what they desire to read, and leave unread that in which they do not feel interested, just as readers do with a book of short stories? There is no danger in allowing honorable members to use headlines. I remind honorable members that the few head-lines I have read cover a speech which occupied nearly ten hours in delivery ; and, in the circumstances, the reader is certainly entitled to such spells as the breaking up of the matter can afford&#39;. I did my best to make the speech as readable as possible, and the public are reading it. In my opinion, Ministers should have allowed the reprints which have been ordered to be published, as scores of others have been, leaving it to the Printing Committee to make a recommendation for the government&#39; of future cases. What has been done by honorable members on this side is as nothing compared with what the Treasurer and other Ministerialists have done. If we have done wrong, they have set us the example. While we have merely inserted a few head-lines, the Treasurer  has not only done that, but has even gone to the length of cutting a speech out of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

I find, however, that head-lines were sent by my clerk, unknown to me. Personally, I should not have put them in, but I did not know that it was proposed to use them. </para>

                        <para>-  I, too, wish to make a personal explanation. Honorable members have referred to the omission of part of a speech. It had to do with&#39; ,a difference between myself and the Treasurer, the rights and wrongs of which are now immaterial. He subsequently wrote to the  Speaker,  asking that certain interjections might be removed. When the matter was referred to me, I at first demurred, thinking that what had been said should be recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but becoming good-tempered again - which, I hope, is my normal condition - I consented, writing, &#34; With a heart and .a half, yes.&#34; I take it that the  Speaker  then ordered the passages to be expunged from the official record. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Wilmot tried to make it appear that the question at issue is : Shall cross-headings be allowed in reprints of parliamentary addresses ? and that to discuss such a matter here is to waste the time of the House. But underlying this discussion is a very much more serious matter. The real question at issue is: Are the privileges of honorable members to be trenched upon by the Treasurer, or whatever Minister is responsible for the interference which has been complained of? </para>

                        <para>- This matter must be ventilated, in the interests of the country, as well as of the House. The honorable member for Grampians read certain official documents, giving what he claimed to be a statement of the case, but it was an <inline font-style="italic">ex parte,</inline> and very unfair, statement. One would suppose from it that the Government Printer has been the prime mover in .the rejection of head-lines. But from information which has since come to us in dribs and drabs, .we know that he was actuated by some one outside his office. A number of the proposed head-lines have been quoted, to show their objectionable character, and, strangely enough, the selection was made wholly from the speeches of Oppositionists. We were not told that the Treasurer himself was responsible for the departure from the rule laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, by introducing subheadings into the reprints of his speeches. He had to admit that he had done that, and that he had even cut out matter to which he objected, although it had been passed by the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> authorities. Other Ministers have done the same, and members of the Labour party followed in the footsteps of members of other parties, until the present practice came to be recognised. The Prime Minister, in publishing, towards the end of June, a speech which he delivered during the censure debate, introduced a liberal supply of sub-headings, amongst them one particularly offensive to members on this side of the House. He used the heading &#34; Cut-throat tactics,&#34; although it had nothing to do with the subject-matter following it, and the words were not uttered during his speech. The Treasurer did not take exception to those headings. It was only when Oppositionists wished to reprint their speeches that he discovered that the practice was being abused. What is right for Ministerialists cannot be wrong for Oppositionists. The real cause of the objection which has been taken to the headings used by members on this side is that Ministerialists do not like the publication of our speeches. Not long since, the newspaper organ which dictates the policy of the Government, printed a leading article, advocating the total abolition of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and the action of the Treasurer seems to be a movement in the direction of suppressing reports. It would be a good thing for the Ministerial party if the Opposition speeches could be entirely suppressed, because it would prevent the public from knowing what goes on here, from being informed of the compelling influences which brought about the fusion, and from seeing criticisms upon the policy of the Government. An insidious attack is being made upon our rights and privileges, and the real question is : Shall our speeches be placed in the hands of our constituents and the public generally ? If this means of conveying information to the electors was helpful to the party opposite, they would commend, instead of condemning it. They certainly initiated it, and availed themselves considerably of it, until it began to cut against them, when honorable members on this side began to make use of the same privilege. It is very significant that the advice to honorable members on this side to have their speeches published by private printing concerns, instead of at the Government Printing Office, comes from certain honorable gentlemen opposite. They put in a plea for the out-of-work compositor, and suggest that if honorable members&#39; privileges in this direction were abolished, the work would be transferred to outside firms, and unemployed printers would be benefited. The interest which some of those gentlemen, who are intimately associated with the Employers&#39; Union, profess to take in trade union compositors, is very much in the nature of a gift from the Greeks. Honorable members know that the Government Printer must get the best and most reliable workmen that he can secure, with the result that at the Government Printing Office good union wages are paid, and there is no attempt made to coerce men to leave their unions. Consequently, .the Government Printing Office is practically manned by union labour. Honorable members on this side, who believe in and support the principles of unionism, can go to the Government Printing Office and get their work done, knowing full well that it will be turned out, not by sweated or non-union labour, but by good substantial union labour, at decent rates of pay. The specious plea that iL will benefit unionism to divert the work from the Government Printing Office, and so reduce the number of hands there, is only another effort on the part of certain honorable members opposite to get something for their black-leg labour to do. If the course they suggest was really in the interests of unionism, I very much question whether they would advocate it, seeing that in their own unions they are always fighting trade unions as hard as they can. I submit that the insertion of sub-headings improves the speeches. It it were not so, honorable members would not go to the trouble of editing their addresses or incur the extra expense of having them printed in that way. </para>

                        <para>- That opens up another phase of the question, which rests with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff and the  Speaker.  I assume that nothing can be added to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report without those officers being first made acquainted with it; and I suppose they would not permit any alteration which was not right, or that did not represent what had been said in this chamber. I am, however, dealing at present, not with the production of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> itself, but with the reprinting from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of addresses to the order and at the expense of the members directly interested. One would gather, from honorable members opposite, that the insertion of subheadings was a violation of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record, and an attempt to get work done without paying for it; but it is well known that honorable members have to pay for not only the cost of production - with, I suppose, a reasonable margin of profit - of the reprints from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> they order; but also the setting of type, and other work involved in putting in the headlines. As the Government Printing Office is run at union rates of pay; I presume that the charges are fixed accordingly, and that honorable members pay fair union rates for the work which is done for them. It is, therefore, not a question of members getting something, for nothing, or even for less than cost price. In the Government Printing Office, the type has already been set for other purposes, and the reprints are struck off it before it is distributed. In that way, honorable members can obtain reprints of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports much cheaper than if they had to get the whole matter reset. I understand however, that some honorable members have . had their speeches reprinted in outside newspapers, after practically getting the printing done at the Government Printing Office ; that is to say, they have been supplied with the matrix, and so have secured the cheap production of their speeches, in country or city publications. I am not in a position to say whether that is really so; but I am informed that it has been and can be done. Consequently, all the- arguments used by honorable members opposite about providing work outside by closing up the Government Printing Office are so much moonshine. The&#39; purpose which they appear to honorable members sitting upon this side to be intended to serve is to discountenance and make as difficult as possible, and ultimately to abolish, the system of having honorable member&#39;s speeches in this Parliament recorded by authorized <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters, and published at the Government Printing Office. The insertion of subheadings appears to . be such an improvement in the form of presenting speeches, that it should be adopted, quite apart from the question of reprints for private circulation. The advisability of introducing it in the production of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> itself, might well be considered. Honorable members in their speeches deal with different subjects, and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters compile a very important and necessary index, in which they give titles to the subjects dealt with in debate. No objection has so far been taken to the words which they use in the index to indicate those subjects ; but there is nothing in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report itself to indicate in what parts of the different speeches those subjects are dealt with. The result is that honorable members who desire to look up matters for purposes of reference, are often inconvenienced. They can locate a certain address ; but they frequently have to read right through it to find the particular part to which they wish to refer. It would simplify matters, and materially improve the speeches themselves, if the different subjects dealt with were clearly indicated, either by subheadings, or by marginal references. In that way, the whole purpose aimed at by honorable members in this connexion, would be amply met. I do not believe any honorable member desires to interpolate in the reports of his speeches anything objectionable or unparliamentary that  he could not say in the House. I submit to the Government that that proposal might well be remitted lo the Printing Committee for report. If acted upon, it would make <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> much more useful for purposes of reference, bring it into actual accord with the index, and meet the desires of honorable members themselves. In short, it would be a permanent and most desirable improvement in the production of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I come now to the amendment which has been moved by the honorable member for Maribyrnong, and which, if applied literally, would make reprints from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> utterly useless. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member, proposes that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> re- * prints shall contain nothing which does not actually appear in the official reports. It would, therefore, be impossible for a&#39;n honorable member in republishing a speech which he had delivered to indicate on the front page the subject to which it related. An exact reproduction, as proposed by the honorable member, would be little short of a farce, and that possibly is what the Government and their supporters desire to reduce the system to. They have urged that reprints in which cross-headings are inserted cannot be said to be an exact reproduction of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports, but that difficulty could be readily overcome by the publication of a statement on the title page that the pamphlet was a reprint from the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Debates,</inline> with head-lines inserted by the honorable member issuing it. </para>

                        <para>- That would be an improvement in the right direction. I listened with considerable pleasure to the speech made by the honorable member for Robertson, who took a common-sense view of the question, and I am sure that had other honorable members opposite followed his example no heat would have been imported into the debate. The honorable member does not hold with some of the Ministerialists, whose desire apparently is either to curtail or to wholly abolish this privilege. There is no doubt that the action taken by the Treasurer is a direct attack oh the Opposition. As long as the right to issue <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reprints was the special perquisite of honorable members opposite - as long as they were able to sub-edit such reprints, eliminating interjections which told against them, and inserting cross-headings that were a direct reflection on the Opposition - they saw no objection to the system. But as soon as members of the Labour party began to follow in their wake they evidenced a desire to abolish it. With few exceptions <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reprints in pamphlet form are the only vehicle  which honorable members on this side have for conveying their views to their constituents. The Government have the big daily newspapers and a large percentage of the country newspapers behind them, ready and willing to give full publicity to their utterances, and, therefore, even the abolition of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> at the present time would mean nothing to them. </para>

                        <para>- For years many honorable members opposite have been publishing reprints in which headings are inserted, and any one taking an interest in politics could scarcely avoid knowing that this was done. It is strange, to say the least, that Ministerialists should try now to put a stop to the system, because they find that in the hands of the Opposition it is an effective weapon against them. I hope that as the result of this debate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will be permanently, improved in the way I have indicated. If my suggestion cannot be adopted, it is only reasonable that those who pay trade union rates of wages in connexion with the reprinting of their speeches should be permitted to insert subheadings in order that each subject dealt with in their speeches may be clearly indicated. Honorable members of the Opposition, I am sure, would be perfectly satisfied to allow the Chief Parliamentary Reporter to determine what sub-headings should be inserted, and would not press any cross-heading to which he took exception. All that we desire is that the different subjects touched upon shall be indicated by means of sub-headings, so that reprints in that way may be made acceptable to the people. </para>

                    <para>.- Had the  motion submitted by the Prime Minister been carried without discussion, a considerable amount of time would have been saved. A few days ago it was practically agreed that the whole question should be referred to the Printing Committee, although a motion to that effect was not formally submitted. The subject was brought before the Printing Committee this morning, but we found that we had no legal right to deal with it, as the Standing Orders had not been complied with. I therefore anticipated that, as soon as the House met this afternoon, a motion to refer it to the Printing Committee would be submitted and carried without delay. Had that course been adopted, we should not have wasted the whole afternoon. There is an important principle involved. Certain Ministerialists have published reprints from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> containing numerous cross-headings, and the attempt of members of the Opposition to follow in their footsteps has given rise to the present situation. Had the honorable member for Maribyrnong brought forward an amendment, that from this date sub-headings should hot appear in reprints published by the Government Printer, it would not have been so objectionable as that which he has submitted. As there are now in the hands of the Government Printer five or six orders for reprints of speeches made by members of the Opposition, I think it unfair that they should be denied a privilege which1 Government supporters have enjoyed. The question is of no importance to me, because r have not had, nor am I likely to have, any reprints of speeches made by me in this House. My constituency is much smaller than many others, and I do not find it necessary to avail myself of the system. I approve of the suggestion that cross-headings should be introduced to enable those who read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to find, without difficulty, the subjects in. which they are interested. It has been . said by an honorable member -opposite that the Prime Minister has proposed that the members of the Printing Committee shall practically censor all reprints. I am sure that that is not intended. All that the Prime Minister proposes is that the Committee shall draw up recommendations, and I hope that the motion will be carried.. It would certainly be unfair to refuse to allow subheadings to appear in reprints for which orders have already been given, since that privilege has not been denied to others. The question is of interest, not only to honorable members, but to the people generally. The electors desire to know what is taking place in the national Parliament. In every part of Australia there are men and women who take great interest in various political questions, and who are naturally desirous of learning how their representatives have dealt with them in Parliament. If the reports were so  broken up as to show the different subjects dealt with, I am sure that not only honorable members, but the people, would be convenienced and benefited. Surely those who live hundreds or thousands of miles from the Seat of Government have a right to know what goes on here, and to be able to find quickly what is in honorable members speeches. It is impossible for a man who has his business to attend to, or his livelihood to earn, to read the whole of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports. I hope the motion will be carried, because the amendment would do an injustice, and not tend to create good feeling in the House. </para>

                    <para>.- I would suggest to the honorable member for Corio that, as the issue has become so confused, he should withdraw his amendment. It brings us back to the original position. The powers of the Committee, which are defined by the Standing Orders, cannot be increased by a simple resolution of the House. No such resolution woul&#39;d override the Standing Orders. Be that as it may, we are spending too much time and a great deal too much energy over a very trifling matter, which might easily have been settled by the exhibition of a little friendly feeling at the beginning: It could be settled now. upon reasonable lines, but the acceptance of the amendment of the honorable member for Corio, so far from settling the matter, would make it twenty times worse than it was when we started. </para>

                    (Dalley) ^.41&#93;.- The carrying of a previous amendment upon the voices was an evidence that the House did not desire to single out any member for ill-treatment. I was prepared to vote upon that occasion that the three or four members who have already ordered their speeches should be allowed to have them reprinted with the head-lines which they have attached to them. If the House now decides against allowing those honorable members that right, it will place others who had their speeches reprinted earlier in a better position. Why should the Prime Minister or the Treasurer have been able to issue speeches with head-lines without any review at all, either by the  Speaker  or the Printing Committee? On the general principle, I am still against honorable members writing head-lines into their speeches, but I am also against any proposal to treat some honorable members differently from others. There appears now to be a fight with regard to headlines which certain honorable members regard as offensive.

                    <para>- The effect of the headlines referred to will be precisely in proportion to the class of member who issues them. The country will soon gauge the value of them. The only weight which the electors would attach to an offensive attack on the Prime Minister, for instance, would be the weight of the honorable member who made it. It is late in the day to bring in the Printing Committee as censor over three or four honorable members, when other honorable members have already got their reprints through with head-lines which- are claimed to have been equally offensive. The heading &#34; Cut-throat tactics,&#34; which was used bv. the Prime Minister in connexion with a speech in the same debate, has been quoted by honorable members opposite as offensive. I do not think that they grieved over it very much, nor can- any one seriously regard as offensive the head-lines quoted by the Treasurer as having been used by the honorable member for Gwydir. I shall vote against the amendment, in order that all honorable members may be treated alike up to this  stage, but I am glad the House has decided that from to-night the censorship shall rest with the Chief of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. </para>

                    (Wentworth) r8.46&#93;.- The arguments used by the honorable member for Dalley would, if given effect to, debar all reforms. One has to start somewhere. If one lias constantly to consider whether one class of malefactor will benefit by achieving his malefactions before reform is effected, we shall never start to deal with malefactors at all. This House would scarcely like to describe itself to the people of Australia as anxious to permit offensive cross-headings to be placed in what purport to - be

                    <para>- Could we have a better Committee to decide upon a question of that kind than the Printing Committee? I agree with the .Leader of the Opposition that this is a very trifling matter to spend so much time over. If we are going to make an alteration, let us do it from now on. We give certain honorable members opposite the latitude that they ask for. They can have their cross-headings. They claimed! to be able to split up their speeches - some of them monumental - into fractions, each with its appropriate crosshead, and they asked that the cross-headings should be allowed only because they were descriptive of the subject, and enabled readers to locate in the speeches the particular remarks they wished to find. If they are sincere, and have any regard for the honour of the House, they will join with us in doing all we can to insure that, whatever grace is given to honorable members on the present occasion, it shall not be carried to the extent of allowing the publication of offensive cross-headings which would bring discredit upon the Chamber whose reputation we all have at heart. </para>

                    <para>.- The country ought not to be permitted to believe, as the honorable member for Wentworth would have it believe, that there is anything in the cross-headings of the speeches of any member upon this side that can be regarded as offensive, nor is it right that the impression should1 be conveyed to the country that the Government have the power to confer any right at all in this matter upon honorable members upon this side. Whatever liberty we have comes to us by virtue of rights and privileges which, thank God, do not depend at all upon any power of the Government to grant or withhold. What has been asked for is so natural, so moderate, and so just that nothing but party bias of the most paltry and inexcusable character can explain the attitude of gentlemen on the other side. I am glad to hear that the honorable member for Dalley, at any rate, does not believe that any tribunal, short of this House itself, should be allowed to set itself up as a censor of what headings are proper or improper. How could any man so divest himself of political bias as to sanction headlines which, perhaps, hold the mirror up to nature, so far as he is concerned, all too clearly and too faithfully ? . Even honorable gentlemen on the other side are human, although one is sometimes tempted to forget it. I am prepared to leave this matter to only one tribunal - either the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, or the Government Printer, or yourself. Any of those three authorities will be perfectly satisfactory to me. I again wish to urge what I put forward earlier in the afternoon - it was not then imperative, but it now becomes so - that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> should from now on be paragraphed, and that there is neither reason nor justification for the continuation of a narrative which in many cases is disjointed, leaving one in the middle of a line to take up a subject entirely alien to the previous one. That reform requires no authority, I understand, other than a direction from you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> If you have that authority, I trust that you will exercise it. </para>

                    <para>.- When the House carried the amendment of the honorable member for Hindmarsh, I take it that it decided that certain members who had given orders at the Printing Office for reprints of speeches before the Treasurer gave orders to stop the practice of inserting head-lines, were to be allowed to have their orders fulfilled. That would be fair. It applies only to three or four  members whose head-lines are, I understand, already in the printer&#39;s hands. As they have gone so far, it would be distinctly unfair, by carrying the amendment of the honorable member for Corio, to prevent those speeches from appearing in the form in which they have been handed in. The honorable members who have given those orders should be allowed to insert whatever head-lines they think fit. In that way they will be put on the same footing as were those who had the good fortune to have similar work done for them before the order in question was given. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to second the amendment, and hope it will be carried. In 1904 I made in this &#39;House a speech on finance and placed an order with the Government Printer for a reprint of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. I was informed by him that if head-lines were inserted an additional charge would be made, and in order to avoid that expense I published a reprint in which no subheadings appeared. I was told by many of those to whom I sent copies of the pamphlet that I ought to have inserted cross-headings so that every reader could find without difficulty that part of the speech in which he was specially interested. One man would be interested in finance, another in something else- </para>

Unless we obtain these blocks or matrices from the Government Printer in order that we may have our speeches reprinted by private firms we shall not. be able, by means of cross-headings, to attract the attention of the public to questions that we desire to bring under their notice. I was informed that whilst my speech was very interesting, the reprint would have been more valuable had cross-headings been inserted. For instance, those interested in borrowing would look for the heading &#34; Borrowing,&#34; and those interested in the question of a Commonwealth &#34;note issue- </para>

We ask not for mercy, but for justice. The great newspapers of Australia seldom report any of our utterances ; they are controlled, unfortunately, in the interests of the few. The press rules Australia, and a few great advertisers rule the press. That being so, what hope have the mere everyday members of placing their views before their constituents, if they are not permitted to scatter broadcast reprints from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard ?</inline></para>

                        <para>- We are not all millionaires like the honorable  member. The Labour party represents the meek and the humble. We were chosen to represent those who had been abandoned ; those who had not been represented heretofore in Parliament, and who had to appeal to the rich men to urge their representatives to do something for them. All Australia is now represented in this Parliament, and the Labour party try to do justice to every one. The newspapers fasten on any little foolish interjection that we make, but will not report our speeches, and we ask, therefore, that this privilege shall not be denied us. When a great are lamp is set up in a dark street thieves are driven forth, and the wider the publicity given to our doings in this House the greater will be the benefit to the community. In that way bribery and corruption will be driven into the dark corners of the earth. Why should we be prevented merely because the Government have a big majority, from republishing our speeches in accordance with the old system? </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to speak to the amendment before it is withdrawn. The proposal is that any honorable member may borrow the stereos, or matrices from the Government Printer. Such a rule has been in operation in connexion with the Victorian Parliament for the last ten years, and I do not know that it is one to which the Government could take exception. These matrices can be prepared at a cost of about sixpence per <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> page, and an honorable member may keep it in his pigeon-hole for fifty years, because it can be used at any time. All that is necessary is to send the matrix to the printer, to have the type cast and the printing done. It was on my initiative that this plan -was adopted by the Victorian Government; and if the Commonwealth Government could see their way to extend a similar privilege to honorable members there would be no need for the amendment. I may say that the rule in Victoria has never been rescinded, and if it is not acted upon it is simply because honorable- members do not care to avail themselves of the privilege. As a believer in trade unionism, I think it would be better to have this work done by outside printing offices. </para>

                            <para>- I always do so. My object now is to ascertain from the Minister of External Affairs whether he has authorized the landing at Broome of a Japanese medical man for attendance on the Japanese there? Further, I desire to ask whether the Government .are in possession of information from Broome that, if a Japanese doctor be allowed to land to attend the Japanese patients, it will mean that the European medical man at present there will be driven out of the place for want of practice, and the white residents will be forced .to rely on the skill of the Japanese doctor? </para>

                            <para>- I understand the first question to be whether I have authorized the landing of the Japanese doctor, and I may say -that at present there is no application before the Department with respect to the exemption of any doctor. On a previous occasion I informed the House that a letter had been written by the Japanese Consul, asking if any exception  would  be taken; and he was informed that it would be possible for a Japanese doctor to land for a period of two years, provided he  was a qualified medical practitioner, who intended to devote his time solely to the practice of his profession. </para>

                            <para>- That was a letter written from the Department in April last. As to the second question, there is no information in the Department that the landing of a Japanese doctor would leave no practice for the European doctor in Broome. All we have had is a notification from the Premier of Western Australia that a protest would be forwarded. That notification was by telegraph, and the protest itself has not yet arrived. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister the fact that a most excellent collection of Australian literature and relics is now being relegated to a cellar in this House, and to ask whether the Government will take into consideration the desirableness of allowing a few specimens from that collection to be permanently placed in the Queen&#39;s Hall? Whilst they were there they filled up the niches, and were objects of great interest to visitors. I am sure he will agree with me that it is a pity to hide them in the cellar. </para>

                        <para>- If I can be assured that I shall be granted permission to do so. The Government very reluctantly propose this adjournment. We would not do so, but for the exceptional circumstances with which we are confronted, and the pressing obligations with which both Government and Parliament will very shortly be faced. Once, when a Premiers&#39; Conference was sitting in Melbourne, Commonwealth Ministers attended on three occasions. But as on two of these days this Parliament was sitting, they found&#39; it very difficult to prepare and present their case while discharging their parliamentary and departmental duties. At the forthcoming Conference, we shall be carrying a still heavier burden of responsibility. The Budget this year will deal with a situation without precedent in the history of the Commonwealth. Owing to the enormous payments to be made from the Treasury for old-age pensions, the demands of the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services, and the measures to be proposed for the effective defence of the country, the financial situation requires, not only a much closer and more searching examination than usual, but also the consideration of new expedients. The preparation of the Budget is still absorbing the whole of the time and energy of Ministers, and the financial statement will be delivered next week, immediately before the assembling of the Premiers. The Premier of New South Wales, writing to me on the  22nd  June, pointed out - </para>

In a few days the present financial Y:ar will have closed, and, I presume, in the light of the actual experience of another year, your Government will be better able to indicate the position for the future. Moreover, I gather from reports in the press that it is proposed to ask the States to confer -certain powers on the Inter-State Commission to regulate undue State competition in industrial matters. This would necessitate a further meeting of the State Premiers at an early date. If this occasion could also be made use of for further consideration of the financial position, I would be prepared to ask the Premiers .of the States to deal with this matter also. </para>

                        <para>. . . shall be happy to meet the Premiers of .the States, as suggested, to consider their proposals for the future financial relations of the States with the Commonwealth. It is highly desirable that this complex question should be simplified, so that this Government can frame concise propositions for submission to the electors at our general election. . . . In the opinion of this Government any attempt to determine now the future distribution of the revenue from Customs and Excise would, for practical reasons, require to contemplate some fixed period for which the circumstances can be forecast with considerable confidence. This should greatly simplify a task which, under any conditions, will -be arduous. I was not aware that the Conference of Premiers would be thought necessary in respect to the proposed endowment of the Commonwealth Inter-State Commission wilh a judicial industrial authority, having anticipated that a general agreement could have been arrived at without delay. </para>

                <para>In one of the last letters, I point out that that was on the assumption that the temporary proposal for a fixed and shorter period had been assented to by this House. If it had not, that also would be submitted to the country. That is the gist of the correspondence. Ministers have the preparation of the Budget to engross their attention until the opening of the Conference, and when meeting the Premiers, will have to give attention to the position of the Commonwealth, not merely in regard to the current finances, but also in consequence of the expiration of the Braddon section of the Constitution at the end of 1910. General powers of taxation are jointly held and independently shared by the Commonwealth and the States, without qualification or limitation ; but the levying of indirect taxation rests wholly with the Commonwealth. The Braddon section provides that, for the first ten years, three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue must be returned to the States, leaving the remaining one-fourth for the services of the Commonwealth. Hitherto, the States have largely depended for revenue on the sums returned by the Commonwealth, and are expecting to have some share of the Customs revenue, and some considerable share, to depend upon in the future. Their own finances will be governed very largely, and in some cases one might say  absolutely,  by the new division of the receipts from Customs and Excise after the year 1910. A consideration of that question, and a knowledge of the intention of this Parliament, are therefore of the utmost importance to the States.. But the same situation is just as full of responsibilities and anxieties for the Commonwealth itself. Its expanding necessities have to be taken into account and carefully assessed. An examination of the range of its powers has to be made, and a possible extension of those powers foreseen. We therefore,, feeling as we do our responsibility to the electors of the Common wealth, who are also the electors of the States, realize that at the coming general election one of the greatest issues to be submitted - perhaps the greatest issue of all, if we take into account the many other questions that depend directly or indirectly upon the financial position of the Commonwealth Treasury - will be the financial. As we shall be appealing to the electors we require to be fortified with such a statement of the case for the Commonwealth as will enable us to satisfy them that our demands are, not only just, but reasonable, made with a due regard to the responsibilities of Australia as a whole, and at the same time not ignoring the great responsibilities and critical positions of the several State Legislatures under any agreement which we may carry out&#34;. On no subjects are the electors likely to require from us fuller and more complete information, on no matters are we more likely to be criticised than in respect to the proposed division of the Customs and Excise revenue, even for a period of years, and particularly if any proposals in regard to that revenue for either that period or for a longer period are associated with counterbalancing financial changes, such as the acceptance of the whole of the debts of the States. That would introduce into this problem other considerations of the greatest moment to the whole of the people of Australia in both their spheres. Under these circumstances, as I think honorable members will recognise, we find ourselves not altogether in a new situation, but in one of which many important features have become so much more marked than they have been hitherto, that it may be fairly described as a new situation. Never will the electors at the ballot-box cast their suffrages, determining by them so man momentous issues for the future as they will in the forthcoming general election. A great number of those issues will, as I have said, centre in the all-important question of finance, rendered more than trebly significant on this occasion, because it will determine our own future and also the future to a large extent of the States and their Legislatures, under any agreement which is proposed in substitution for the Braddon section. It needs no development of these considerations to remind honorable members of the great gravity of the choice to be made, and the immense importance of our being able to present to the people of Australia a clear, and,, so far as possible, a simple series of  propositions in this regard, so that, when the Commonwealth Parliament is resolved into its constituent parts, and honorable members seek their constituencies, they shall be able to state the case for the Commonwealth in a pithy manner. We seek as far as possible to set aside any qualifying considerations which may be disposed of in anticipation beforehand in order to concentrate attention upon any differences between the proposals of the Government and those of men who take a contrary view. The States and their interests have also their appeal which they will be legitimately justified in making to the country. Under these circumstances, I venture to think that it is a reasonable request of Ministers to be relieved for a week from the obligation of maintaining their attendance in Parliament, and also set free, so far as may be possible, from their departmental duties in order that they may not only enter the Conference prepared, but have at all events a few days in which the necessary delays for consideration, examination of figures, and comparison of proposals may be made. We hope that the decision of the Conference may be, if possible, final. </para>

                        <para>- That is more than I can inform the honorable member at present. Supposing that an adjournment for the short time named to be justified under these special conditions, I think that honorable members will admit that the time for the adjournment has been well chosen. I could wish that it had been possible a fortnight earlier, in order that the jubilee of the great State of Queensland might have been freely attended by its representatives, and many other representatives. But it was not possible for the Premiers to arrange to meet before the  13th  - a period at which most of the functions in Queensland will be over. </para>

                <para class="block">It would have been a great pleasure to have taken advantage of the opportunity which is thus afforded in order that the Commonwealth might have been fully represented there, as well as the States. The House, from this point of view, will, I think, allow, that the Budget having been launched, the statement of the finances of last year having been laid before honorable members, and the proposals of the Government for the current twelve months having been submitted to them, they will have abundant food for reflection and consideration during that short interval. Therefore the occasion granting that an adjournment is necessary, is probably as timely as it could be well made. But, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the fact is that this is the occasion on which, if ever, in the life of this Parliament, a definite demarcation of the financial proposals of the Commonwealth, and a definite statement of the financial views and aims of the States may be really final. It will properly be called final if the sittings proposed to be held a fortnight hence fulfil their purpose. There have been already, I think, seven Conferences of Premiers with which Commonwealth Ministers have been associated in one way or another. The coming Conference will be the eighth, and probably the last of the series before the Braddon section takes its new shape, whatever that may be. The previous Conferences have exhausted a number of the open possibilities of a financial character. But the coming Conference must either find the Premiers in such&#39; a mood that they are prepared to consider their own requirements, their own situations and necessary demands in the light of the requirements of the Commonwealth and its future financial position, or else this Conference will not only end with a postponement and adjournment of the question, as has happened on previous occasions, but it will send the question directly to the electors in whatever form this Parliament may think fit to shape it. Certainly, this will be the last opportunity which the representatives of the States will have of considering their position together prior to the cessation of the Braddon section, or, rather, prior to the general election, which precedes by some few months the termination of the period governed by the Braddon section. Having regard to the gravity of the question to the people of Australia as electors and taxpayers to the Commonwealth, it is impossible for us to exaggerate the momentous; nature of the coming Conference from our point of view. Whatever we may do during the rest of this session, it is perfectly certain that if we are fortunate enough - as I earnestly and most anxiously hope we shall be - to arrive at a common understanding, admitted to be fair to the Commonwealth and its future, and also fair to the States- </para>

                        <para>- It will be. The Senate will have its representatives in the Government which will embody the views of the Senate and of this House, as the views of the great majority of the people of Australia. The significance of this Conference to us is even greater than to the representatives of the States, because the issue must be decided at our elections, and not at any State elections, to which the State Ministers will no doubt be looking forward. We have to shoulder the burden of national responsibility. We face the constituencies of Australia, and it will be the decision which the electors of Australia give at our forthcoming general election, and not anything that takes place at any State election,- or in any State Legislature, that will decide our financial future for the next few years. Under these circumstances, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> it appears to us that in taking the unusual step of asking the House-to adjourn for a week, in order that an opportunity mav be afforded for the conduct of this question to a final consideration between ourselves and the Premiers, the Government are making no unreasonable demand. On the contrary, we have cut down the period to the shortest possible. We shall be happy if the proceedings are concluded within the time named. But, having in view the great pressure of business upon us, and the great mass of legislation which we require to deal with, if we are to conclude this session with a satisfactory contribution to the statute-book of Australia, we have &#39;been very reluctant to ask for the suspension of the proceedings of Parliament, even for a single week. I confess that reluctance is now to some extent, tempered by the unfortunate fact that the progress we are making with our work has been by no means rapid up to this date. </para>

                <para class="block">Still, however, that argument is capable of being applied both ways. The principal anxiety of the Government is to be able to do justice to .their obligations, and in the circumstances which at present obtain to be able to put their case to the best advantage. For that purpose, this brief adjournment is indispensable. If, during that week for which we ask, we succeed in clarifying this issue, in getting rid of some of those matters which have hitherto been quite properly associated with it, having as a result a ten,dency to lead the public criticism aside from its main principle - if we are able to concentrate the attention of the people of the Commonwealth upon this great financial issue on this critical occasion - it will have been a week extremely well spent. I do not know that one need dwell upon the nature of the meeting arranged. We are invited to discuss the future finances of the States with the Premiers and Treasurers, and if nothing else results from the discussion but a better understanding of each other&#39;s position, and a clearer, demarcation of our differences, as well as our agreements, that, in itself, will be worth a good deal. Of course, an agreement, if we are fortunate enough to obtain one, would mean that a great body of public opinion, which is apt to be swayed by State or local considerations, and not called upon in its local Legislatures to be much swayed by any other considerations, will be brought behind the great national sentiment upon which the Commonwealth and this Parliament depend. Ours is a Federal Constitution, and the part of that Constitution under which we have been, both by its terms and by the necessities of the situation, most closely bound to the States, is in its financial relations. As the part of the Constitution to which I refer requires the dividing of one fund raised by this Parliament between two sets of claimants, our rival necessities- must necessarily be irksome, lend -themselves to misunderstanding, and involve a certain amount of competition. All this we must be prepared for. It was in order to meet these conditions, and enable us to overcome them, that frequent Conferences have been held, which certainly have greatly assisted in making it plain to both sides what were the reasonable requirements of the other. I trust that the forthcoming Conference will be more fruitful, that all its members will be able to work together, and that, at all events, we shall approach the consideration of the issues before us with a hope  that the proceedings will not terminate without an agreement which will be recognised as equitable by both sides. At all events, a great effort will be made by us to obtain finality. The Government will ask no more than fair consideration at the close of the Conference, whether they are able to agree or disagree with the body of influential and able men who are at present the principal responsible Ministers of the various States. If we are obliged to disagree with them, we shall do it at all events clearly and explicitly. We enter the Conference with every wish to be perfectly fair to the States, consistently with the necessities of the future of the Commonwealth, which we cannot cripple, and which are our peculiar and special care. There lies the. crux of the whole position. I therefore trust that honorable members will view with favour the proposal to give this brief adjournment, in order that the Conference of Premiers to be held in Melbourne shall not be rendered less effective owing to the absence of Commonwealth Ministers, who have always been willing to discuss these questions with the State Premiers. I also trust that honorable members will agree that in taking this course, we shall really be contributing to the work of this Parliament, and that the interruption is made in order that our work here may more efficiently and more rapidly proceed. I desire, therefore, to move - </para>

In. order that there may be no confusion, after that motion has been disposed of, the Prime Minister will have to obtain leave to submit his motion with regard to the adjournment of the House at its rising on 13th August. Of course, if leave is not given, it might be better to discuss the question that has been raised on the motion for the printing of the paper. </para>

                    <para>. - I understood from the Prime Minister, when he left me about an hour ago, that he intended to move a motion such as the one of which notice has just been given. I did not think that he would anticipate it by moving that a paper be printed, and make a carefully prepared speech on the question of the financial relationship of the Commonwealth and the States, and the duty devolving upon the Government and the House of dealing seriously with financial and other issues at the earliest possible moment. I agree with him that the financial position of the Commonwealth is serious from one point of view, but I do not agree with him that it presents a new situation. It has been serious for some years, and the Prime Minister is as much responsible for it as is any other member in the Chamber. At a time when money was required for the public services of the Commonwealth, different Governments returned freely to the States amounts in excess of what the Constitution demanded. No complaint need be made about that now beyond this : that the various Governments then allowed the Postmaster-General&#39;s and Defence Departments to fall into a state of inefficiency to the detriment of the Commonwealth and with no distinct advantage to the States. </para>

                        <para>- I admit it. We are indebted to the honorable member for Flinders for the legal acumen which he displayed in discussing that aspect of the  question some years ago. Many of us laymen have to rely to a great extent upon the assistance of the legal gentlemen advising the Government and the legal members of the House. I as a layman thought that we could not put any of the surplus of our one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue to a trust fund until the expiration of the book-keeping period. That opinion may or may not have been correct, but no complaint can be made now of the Commonwealth taking full advantage of its constitutional powers by the Surplus Revenue Act. I do not agree with the Prime Minister that there are any more- tremendous issues to be discussed  at the forthcoming Premiers&#39; Conference than have been discussed since the first of those Conferences met. The very first issue debated by the Premiers when they first met was the operation of the Braddon section. Their principal object in meeting was to endeavour to come to an agreement with the Commonwealth for the continuation of that section indefinitely. Proposals have been made from time to time to them by representatives of the Commonwealth Government, but none has been accepted. It is true that in one instance an attempt was made to accept, but the proposal was never adopted by the whole of the States nor by the Commonwealth. Government. The Prime Minister now speaks of the tremendous financial and other difficulties that must be dealt with prior to the pending general election of the Commonwealth. Those difficulties have always existed, and will still exist. No amount of declamation that the electors of the Commonwealth and the electors of the States are one and the same will get us out of them any more readily than would a plain statement of the fact that the Commonwealth requires and must have a greater proportion of the revenue that it collects than it has at present, in order to carry on the great public services of this country. Why do not the Government say so? What is the use of oratorical flourishes in a matter of this kind? </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear it. I took down one phrase which in itself was quite clear, but I did not understand what the Prime Minister .meant by it. I understood him to state that his proposition must be for a permanent settlement, but he afterwards qualified that by calling it &#34; what may be regarded as a permanent settlement.&#34; That qualification does not assist him at all. </para>

                        <para>- No; but this Parliament can legislate in that direction at once, and need not wait until 1911. If the Prime Minister is so sure of his ground, and if the Government, several of the members of which are legal members, and another a distinguished Treasurer, know exactly what the Commonwealth necessities are, why do they not state them to the House? Why should the Prime Minister make a statement in his own capacity, and not as Treasurer, as to the enormous responsibilities and requirements of the Commonwealth, the great necessities of the States, the insufficiency of the revenue to carry out both those services, and the great and onerous duties that will devolve upon the people at the next election? Why not make now a plain, straightforward statement of the necessities of the Commonwealth ? </para>

                        <para>- That is a good point. The Government are taking credit to themselves for the fact that the Treasurer will make his Budget speech just prior to the adjournment of the House over the Premiers&#39; Conference. They do not intend that their Budget statement shall receive a single word of criticism from the members of this House until the organs of the press that are friendly to them have an opportunity to assist them to hide its weaknesses, and to give prominence to its good points, if it happens to have any. This may be a very clever political move, but  I  doubt whether it will benefit the Commonwealth in any way. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> have, from time to time, joined with other members of &#39; this House in endeavouring to secure a full discussion of financial questions. I have regarded it as a distinct weakness in the proceedings of this Parliament that during the last four or five years we have had practically no financial discussions apart from those attaching to the consideration of Budget statements, and the necessities of the Government Departments. Because the two largest States of the Commonwealth adjoin, and their centres of population are nearer to the Seat of Government than are the&#39; centres of population of the other States, honorable members are apt to forget that there is a very large body of electors who never learn what actually transpires in this Parliament. Honest men and women in Australia have the most mistaken ideas as to our attitude on important public questions. They have no conception of the financial position of the &#39;Commonwealth. I state the bare fact when I say that there are many newspapers, reputable in their own way, that grossly misrepresent every financial proposal put forward in this Chamber. Some of the most sober and sensible financial proposals have been entirely misrepresented To give an illustration, let me remind the House that the honorable member for Hume, as Treasurer, proposed that ,&#163;6,000,000 should be returned to the States, and that, after an interval of five years, the amount returned should be increased by one-thirtieth each year, &#39; for thirty years, so that, at the end of thirty-five years, the permanent annual contribution to the revenues of the State Governments would amount to &#163;9,000,000. That proposal was misrepresented to such an extent that some newspapers stated again and again that the honorable gentleman proposed to return to the States only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6,</inline> 000,000 annually for all time. Why should we permit statements of that kind to be published, when, by a discussion on the financial position in this House, we might enable the electors in every State to understand the true position? The honorable member for Mernda submitted a scheme for the taking over of the State debts, which, from my point pf view, was a very acceptable one. I do not think, from what I know of the State Premiers and Governments that they are prepared at the present time to allow the Commonwealth to take over the State debts. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for North Sydney is correct, if he means that the electors of the Commonwealth, who are the people who have to bear the burden, will regret it. The Treasurer has said, and every other Treasurer of the Commonwealth has indorsed the opinion, that if the Commonwealth Government were to handle the State debts they would be able to convert them at a lower rate of interest than is now being paid upon them, and in that way we should be able, in the near future, to save for the people a very large sum annually. The great advantage of the adoption of such a proposal would be that it would bring about an absolute and permanent severance of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and States. From my point of view, that is most, desirable. It would&#39;, perhaps, be out of place for me to express any further opinion on matters which the Government intend to submit to the Premiers&#39; Conference. The Prime Minister&#39;s remarks left upon me the impression that the Government are going into the Conference, not to maintain the rights of the Commonwealth, but to conciliate the representatives of the States. It is quite true that the honorable gentleman said that there would he conflicting opinions expressed. That is inevitable. But I am not sanguine that the present or any other Government of the Commonwealth will be able to induce the representatives of. the States to accept a permanent solution of our financial difficulties, which will be fair and just to the Commonwealth. The fact is that we are still so near to the time when Federation was accomplished that State Premiers, Governments, and Parliaments are unable to free themselves from the idea that the States are supreme in everything. It is true that the State Governments have grave responsibilities. They have great work to perform, within their sphere of action, in helping to promote the progress and settlement of the country. But their responsibilities are as nothing compared to those which are now cast on the Government of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite true that they have. We ought not to regard too seriously the resentment of the State Governments. We should try to recognise  that the powers with which they are now vested are being transferred to Federal authority from time to time. No authority cares to have its wings clipped, or its dignity lessened. It would! humiliate this Parliament, and injure the interests of the people if any Federal Government were to go to the Premiers of the States, and give away the rights of this Parliament in such a way as to interfere with the permanent progress of the Commonwealth. That is the true position, and it should be calmly and faithfully put before the representatives . of the States. I can speak freely on this matter, because the late Government felt obliged at the Hobart Conference to offer the Premiers of the States a smaller sum than any previous Government had offered them as a permanent settlement of the great financial question. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member will do me the honour of reading what I did say, he will find .that I stated that I felt it .an honour, to receive an invitation to be present ; that I thanked the Premiers for the courtesy they had extended to me ; but that, as Prime Minister, I met them only as I should meet any other body to. discuss in a friendly way the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. 1 cast no reflection on the Senate by attending that Conference. Honorable members of another place have been elected for the specific purpose of conserving State rights, and, with all respect to the Premiers and those associated with them, who have taken part in these Conferences from time to time, I cannot refrain from saying that that part of their deliberations in which the)- attempted to usurp the rights of the Senate is the least valuable of their contributions to the proceedings. The time may come when senators will take up the position that they alone have the constitutional power to deal with the relations of the Commonwealth and the States. I have always felt that we cannot have too many Conferences and consultations; and that, when kept within their proper sphere, they must be very beneficial. I ask the Prime Minister now whether he thinks that in his elaborate statement he has proved the case for a week&#39;s adjournment. I think not. The Prime Minister carefully repeated the statement that he has made again and again since he first left office, that the Parliament has an enormous quantity of work awaiting its attention. That &#34;statement has been made by him on the public platform, as well as in this House during the present session. And yet what do we find on the business-paper ? Not one proposition of magnitude. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister has said again and again that there is a great deal of important business to be transacted. From time to time he has stated in public that the Government have twenty-three or twenty-four measures prepared and ready to go on with, and at the Australian Natives&#39; Association banquet in January last he outlined a long list of measures which had been left in hand by the late Government. It is a distinguishing feature of the Administrations which the Prime Minister has led that they have always had plenty of measures on the stocks. Indeed, it is impossible to think of any legislative subject that has not been proposed by one or other of the Government.? which he has led, or in respect of which memoranda or reports have not been submitted by them. No one can hope to originate any scheme that has not been included at some time or Other in the honorable member&#39;s programme. Notwithstanding the volume of work that demands our attention, the Prime Minister now wishes to waste another week. He desires an adjournment, in order, as he says, that he and his Ministers may be able to attend the Conference of Premiers, and to hold Cabinet meetings. Why is the Cabinet to meet in the meantime? Has not the Prime Minister told us that the Treasurer will deliver his Budget before the Conference takes place? If, on attending the Conference, he finds that the Budget is not the correct one- </para>

                        <para>- The Budget is&#39; for the current financial year, and not for next year. The honorable member is very_keen on these matters, but I am sure that the Prime Minister is quite able to get out of any difficulty, if he is in one. According to the honorable gentleman, the next Budget is one of the most important that is ever likely to be delivered here; and if the Government know what is necessary for trie Commonwealth, they should declare their financial policy in that Budget. If their policy is a settled one, it will be. very easy for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to say to the Conference, &#34; These are the propositions which we think are in the best interests of the Commonwealth, and we shall be glad, indeed, if you can agree; but, failing agreement, we stand by them.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- There are one of two positions which the Government must take up; they must either lay down their financial policy in the Budget and stand by it, or they must lay down a temporizing policy and adjust it with the Premiers of the States. Either we have a Government prepared to stake its existence on the policy it has adopted in the interests of the Commonwealth, or we have a Government which will pander to anybody able to give then: a short lease of life, even though that may mean disaster to the Commonwealth for the time being. That may be strong language, but it is the -only language fitted for the occasion. If the Government find themselves in any way embarrassed in attending the Conference while Parliament is sitting, I shall promise to give any protection desired for any number of Ministers. No person in my position could do more than that. I do not think that Ministers will find the strain of the Conference very severe; and if the Prime Minister agrees to withdraw this motion, I shall give him that pledge and promise. </para>

                        <para>- I think we did ; at any rate, the Prime Minister knows I was always ready to give effect to the will of the majority. It is time this childish nonsense was dropped by the Government, and that they declared a policy the people can understand. For the Prime Minister to tell us, on a motion for the printing of a paper, that he desires a week&#39;s adjournment, so that he may be able to hold intermittent Cabinet meetings after the financial policy has been declared, is a weakness I never anticipated he would display to the House. I cannot agree, on behalf of the Opposition, to the proposed adjournment. In making that statement I find myself in the usual difficulty that we have not a direct proposition before <inline font-style="italic">vs.</inline></para>

                        <para>- Clear statements do not often emanate from the Prime Minister ; and, whatever he may have said last week, I was content to ignore, because there is a proper course to pursue in connexion with this matter, and that course was to give due notice of this motion. During an early stage in to-day&#39;s sitting, I withdrew an objection which I had raised, and which enabled the Prime Minister to filch from private members the time that should have been devoted to their business. Last year, when the Premiers&#39; Conference was sitting, this Parliament did not adjourn, and I venture to say that there has been no period in the history of the Commonwealth when its financial position was more acute than it was then. It will be recollected that the proposal outlined by the honorable member for Mernda in regard to the adjustment of the future financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, was submitted to that gathering in a modified form. On that occasion, I submitted figures to the Prime Minister, which are in the Treasury to-day, and I will undertake to say that, within two days they can be brought up to date. Where, then, is the necessity for this long adjournment, or for the wordy statement of the Prime Minister, in which he was careful - as he always is - to leave a loop-hole for escape. The proposal for an adjournment comes with specially bad grace from him, seeing that at the beginning of the session he refused to allow the late Government an opportunity to defend themselves or their policy, upon the ground that the time at our disposal was so short.  His  very next step, however, was to secure an adjournment of Parliament for three weeks, notwithstanding that under similar circumstances it had never previously adjourned for more than two weeks.  His  action constituted the first waste of time that had occurred during the current session. </para>

                        <para>- And they are not ready now. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to write articles alleging waste of time on the part of the Opposition, and for the press to support them. I do not hesitate to say that there has been less waste of time by the Opposition in this Parliament than has occurred in any other Parliament with which I am familiar. I have read the newspaper articles to which I have alluded ; and I know the authors of them, and those articles may yet result in one or two libel actions, because I will not stand nonsense by understrappers who are being &#34;egged on&#34; by the head of the Government. The Treasurer need not hold up his finger, because it is not a very good one. It is a thick finger, and not an artistic one. During the period that was occupied in debating the want of confidence motion, the Government should have prepared the Bills which they intend to submit to Parliament. But we find that none of those measures have been prepared. Why ? Because the &#34; Confusion &#34; party cannot agree among themselves. They have some very ugly and knotty questions to decide, especially in connexion with matters of defence, and consequently it is hard for them to arrive at an agreement. What I cannot avoid seeing, is that the Prime Minister is endeavouring, by all sorts of pretexts, to cause delay, in order that he may not be called upon to take up any serious and concentrated position. I know him of old. I have no hesitation in saying that the State Premiers will never again be offered such liberal terms by the Commonwealth as they were offered on the occasion of their last Conference. </para>

                        <para>- Probably they are. We offered to take over , &#163;6,000,000 of interest at once, leaving &#163;2,000,000 to be paid by the States for a period of five years, after which the Commonwealth would reduce the amount by one- thirtieth annually, and, at the end of thirty-five years, would shoulder the whole responsibility for debts and interest. Had the debts of the States, including those of South Australia, been taken over by the Commonwealth, there would be no need for the discussion which we are now having regarding the Northern Territory. When the Prime Minister and I last met the Premiers, they were supposed, as a whole, to have the confidence of their States. But now the Queensland Premier has a majority of only one, and the Premiers of South Australia and Western Australia are in the same position. What will be the value of any arrangement made with Governments, which are toppling over? The Queensland Government are likely to fall almost immediately, I believe. </para>

                        <para>- At the elections it will come down like a ton of bricks. The party opposite is the &#34; Confusion &#34; party. They cannot make any definite and  straightforward statement of policy, because they are not agreed. I have already asked how long the Tariff is to remain in abeyance, but the Free Traders and the little Protectionist section cannot agree, and, therefore, wish to put the matter off indefinitely. The Government have to provide for defence. Ministers should come to an arrangement as to what their defence policy is to be, and what they will spend during the first two or. three years. They should know by now how much will be required for old-age pensions. </para>

It is, however, for the Government to estimate what is needed. Ministers must know, too, what is required for the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, I am. Those two railways should be carried out. Why must all the Ministers attend the Conference of Premiers? What have they been doing since they came into power? Merely sitting in their offices twiddling their thumbs,nstead of getting Bills ready. It will be a crime if the Ministry tries to make the financial question a party one. The Prime Minister is capable of doing so, and it would appear from his speech that he intends to do so. In a matter of that sort he is an adept. But the result will be detrimental to the interests of the Commonwealth and of the States. The Government should make no arrangement with the Premiers, and any proposals recommended should be put before this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I have fought majorities before, and have not been long in defeating them. On one occasion, with a party of seventeen, I eventually defeated a party that originally numbered sixty, I am afraid that the Government will attempt to bind this Parliament for electioneering purposes. That will be very reprehensible. We should not be financially under the heels of the States. I speak from experience when I say that no arrangement will be made with the Premiers, unless the Government gives away more than it should. Our responsibilities are very great. We could at any time come to the assistance of States, if they were in difficulty, but we should see, first of all, that the Commonwealth is placed above them in matters of finance.I am afraid that the Government will not do that. The Treasurer on a previous occasion almost abandoned to the States the powers of the Commonwealth. With his robustness and bluff he can over-ride the Prime Minister, who is like a child in his hands. I am afraid lest something shall be done for which we shall be sorry in the future. </para>

                        <para>- I judge from the remarks of the Prime Minister that a big borrowing policy is intended. Unless we borrow, we shall need the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue within a few years if we take over the debts of the States. There will not be harmony between the Commonwealth and States until the financial bond between them is severed. Let that happen at once, and then let us see what is to be done. If the States do not agree to reasonable proposals, the Commonwealth can assume about &#163;200,000,000 of debts without their consent. I presume, however, that we shall be able to discuss the proposed adjournment to-morrow. </para>

                        <para>- I am used to parliamentary practice. I am pretty well accustomed to the Prime Minister, but lately he has done things which I never thought he was capable of doing, and therefore I am more suspicious of anything he does than ever I was before. I do not wish, however, to deal with that matter to-night. I firmly believe that it will be a waste of time to adjourn the House for twelve days- that is, over five sitting days - when good work could, be done. This adjournment is only wanted by the Government so that they may defer the statement of their defence proposals and the submission of other matters which should have been brought to a head long ago. The other night the Prime Minister made a very hot speech, in which he accused the Opposition of wasting time. He could have had no other object in making that speech than to irritate the Opposition, with a view to causing them to waste time. I said at the time that it was not a speech which should be thought much of, but one which was made for the purpose of causing the Opposition to lose their temper, and enable the press behind the Government to say,&#39;&#34; Oh, what a terrible waste of time.&#34; I presume, sir, that to-morrow there will be another opportunity of dealing with the question of adjournment, and therefore I shall not say any more on the subject now. </para>

                    <para>. - The proposal to adjourn the House for a week&#34; to enable Ministers to discuss the financial question with the State Premiers is, I think, a matter of momentous importance. At the Conference of Premiers, the Prime Minister proposes to apportion &#163;8,000,000 for all time, or until such time as the people reverse the decision which shall then be arrived at. If that is not a question on which an honorable member should speak, I do not know what is. I hold that the Parliament which raises the money should have the responsibility of spending it. Up to last year, the Commonwealth had returned to- the States not less than &#163;8,000,000 per year, and in order to do that our services were impoverished. The post, telegraph, and telephone services throughout the Commonwealth have been impoverished to such an extent as to require, on the computation of the present Postmaster-General, an expenditure of , &#163;2,000,000 in order to put them in fair working order. The State Treasurers were so desirous of obtaining every penny they could that they tried to show that the Surplus Revenue Act was unconstitutional, in order that they might be able to appropriate every fraction it was possible to obtain, and leave the services controlled by the Commonwealth impoverished. </para>

                        <para>- They were always clamouring at the Treasury for more money. They got all the surplus, and then they were so ungrateful as to tell the country that the impoverished services were so badly managed, and the payments were so paltry, and mean, as to show the incapacity of the Federal Government to manage the affairs of the Commonwealth. That is the kind of ingratitude we got from the State Treasurers, who were for ever clamouring at the Treasury for the last fraction of the surplus. It behoves the Government, through the Prime Minister, at the Conference, to see that the Commonwealth shall retain sufficient money for its requirements, not for the present, but for the future. It should be remembered that we have to provide for the taking over of the Northern Territory, and the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has asked a very fair question. If we are in favour of taking over the Northern Territory - and that is part of the policy of the Government - we must be prepared to finance it to the extent of  ,&#163;150,000  a year. At the present time the Government have &#163;8,000,000 which they propose to appropriate by an arrangement with the States for all time. I desire to say a few words to-night on what I regard as a momentous question. This is the only occasion on which we shall have an opportunity of raising our voices on behalf of our constituents before that money is practically appropriated, because the agreement entered into by the Prime Minister with the States will have to be kept. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly the agreement will be subject to the approval of Parliament, and, if it does not approve, the Prime Minister will return his commission and ask the Governor-General to send for some one else to advise him. But while the present Government have a majority at their back they can pledge this Parliament. The Prime Minister intimated that he would go to the country with his policy, and, in reply to a question by the Leader of the Opposition, he said, by way of explanation, that for) the present it would be settled, but that it could not be said to be settled for all time, because the people could alter it. That would mean an appeal to the people by referendum for an amendment of the Constitution. The Prime Minister did not explain whether he intended to ask the people to approve of the grant by Statute to the States for a limited period or for all time. I did read in a newspaper that he said that it would be a tentative arrangement for something like five years. I am disposed to think that we should not, even for five years, appropriate the sum of ,&#163;8,000,000, because we know very well that our expenditure on old-age pensions, quarantine, and navigation will account for about  &#163;2,000,000.  But there is another sum of  j&#163;3, 000,000  which the States should be told that they must not expect to receive in the future. It should be made known that the Commonwealth .will take over from the States, with their approval, or, if not with their approval, with the consent of the people, services that will require another sum of ,&#163;3,000,000, so that we who raise the money shall have the responsibility of spending it, when he can economize for the States if they themselves will not do so. We should take over the Judiciary, and manage it just as we now manage the High Court. The States Treasurers must be given to understand that we cannot hand over to them the millions that have been paid to them in the past. The immediate requirements of the Commonwealth will absorb something like ,&#163;3,000,000. The States have received about ,&#163;8,000,000 per annum out of a revenue of  ,&#163;10,500,000.  When we have fulfilled all our obligations, and taken over further services, there will be a balance of perhaps  ,&#163;2,000,000  which can be paid to the States. But there should be the stipulation that that payment is but tentative, and made on the condition that the States would do something national and satisfactory for the people. They should initiate a progressive land settlement policy, for instance, so that we may induce immigrants to come to Australia with some likelihood of settling them. </para>

                        <para>- Under present circumstances, we are raising money for the States to spend which this Government could expend more economically. Let them attempt to raise revenue for themselves, and the electors will want to know what they propose doing with it. Why should we tax the people to enable the State Governments to squander millions? It is about time something was said on this subject. What have the States to show for the millions which they have received from the Commonwealth? Yet they are clamouring for more. We have impoverished the services of the Commonwealth, notably the mail services and postal facilities, whilst State politicians have been stumping the country, and maligning this Parliament, representing that the services controlled by us were mismanaged. </para>

                        <para>- If it were necessary for my argument, there would be no difficulty in snowing how mil-lions have been squandered. But the point which I wish to make clear is that as we raise the money, we should be responsible for the spending of it. If the Minister of Defence knows nothing about the millions of money returned to the States - representing the surplus revenue - which have been squandered, he is very ill-informed. In addition, New South Wales has borrowed several millions of pounds, and has very little to show for that money. I had no intention of being drawn into any reference to the extravagance of the States ; but I do protest when I see and hear State Ministers deriding the Commonwealth Parliament, and the services which we control, whilst not one Minister representing the Commonwealth has had the courage to stand up and defend his Department. We have simply ladled out money, whilst our own Departments have been strangled or impoverished. We have cut down mail services, and inconvenienced the whole community. The evidence collected by the Postal Commission affords proof of what I say. The question with which we are faced is a momentous one. The Prime Minister has not told us what his policy is to be. Now is the time for honorable members to speak. I approve of the Prime Minister meeting the Premiers on the present occasion. I have not approved of other Conferences of the kind ; because  T  considered that, instead of the Commonwealth taking its policy from the State Premiers, we should have laid down . the Commonwealth financial policy for their guidance. But the State Premiers, on this occasion, should not be allowed to live in a fool&#39;s paradise. They should be plainly told that they are not to expect, in future, the immense sums they have had in the past, and that they must raise revenue from their own resources, but not behind the backs of their constituents. </para>

                        <para>- What have the States done with this money, which was surplus revenue, and what have they done with the millions that they have borrowed and spent? If they want to spend, let them raise their own revenue. We are not- justified in raising as much as we do; but as we do raise it, let us be responsible for spending it. We can ask the States to hand over the Judiciary, as we are taking control of old-age pensions, navigation, and quarantine. These services will represent  &#163;5,000,000.  The balance might be handed to the States, so long as they spend  it  judiciously, and for national purposes. But  it  should only be handed over tentatively. There is no reason why the Commonwealth should not launch out into fresh lines of policy. ( There  is  no reason why we should not carry out a policy of reclaiming and settling lands  if  the States bungle the business. We have just as much power to reclaim estates as the States have. I admit that they should do  it  better than we can, provided they work on judicious and national lines. </para>

                        <para>- There is plenty of money for covering that service. I think that&#34; honorable members should have something to say on the motion under con&#39;sideration, even  if  we sit for three or four hours longer. The Prime Minister should be given to understand what we think and recommend, and should not meet the Premiers in a false position. I have made my views clear, and I hope the Prime Minister will be as candid to the Premiers as he was to us to-night. I thought he made a very clear statement. It suited me very well, and if he acts up to it the Premiers will find for the first time that they are not in the future to have the control of millions to spend as they like. </para>

                    <para>. - I see no reason for postponing the debate on the main question until Wednesday. I quite agree with the honorable member for Robertson. He made a speech that does him credit. It shows that he at least considers the National Parliament as against the State Parliaments. Why cannot the Prime Minister give an assurance that the debate will come on on Tuesday next, so that every honorable member may speak on the. question if he desires? It is the duty of every honorable member if he represents Australia to speak on it. Wednesday will be too late, because the Budget speech will be delivered on Thursday. </para>

To fix it for Wednesday would confine the debate upon this most important matter to a very short space of time. I believe every honorable member is prepared to allow the Prime Minister to give notice of the motion to-night for Tuesday next. </para>

                    <para>.- The discussion on this motion may not come on until Wednesday evening, and so we may have a late sitting to complete it prior lo the Budget speech on Thursday. The Prime Minister has expressed his views on the question, and I do not see why other honorable members should not express theirs for the benefit of the State Premiers before they meet. The Prime Minister evidently intended his speech to be taken notice of by the Premiers. I do not want to take up  time in discussing the question of the printing of the paper. </para>

                        <para>- That Bill, like a number of others, appears to be merely a placard with no serious intention behind it. Very likely those Bills are being introduced one after the other in order to impress the State Premiers when they meet. We ought to have an opportunity of discussing this question at reasonable length. </para>

                        <para>- Considerable latitude was allowed to the Prime Minister in discussing the motion for the printing of a paper. If a new discussion is initiated on Wednesday evening it may cause an all-night sitting, and upset the arrangements for the Budget speech on Thursday. If the Prime Minister leaves the discussion of the proposal until Wednesday, he must be prepared to accept responsibility for an all-night sitting, to enable honorable members to ventilate their views on financial questions prior to the meeting of the Premiers&#39;- Conference. </para>

                        <para>- I was not addressing the Minister of Defence, whose interjection ought not, in fairness, to be applied to me, as I am not in the habit of duplicating my speeches. If I am obliged to do so on this question, the fault will rest with the Government. If they intended to give honorable members an opportunity to discuss the proposed adjournment, they might have given&#39; notice of the motion in the ordinary way, and so have prevented a duplication of the debate. It is not quite fair that the Government, having an opportunity to conduct the business in a perfectly regular way, should bring this matter forward in such a manner that they must ask the special grace of the Opposition, and then turn round and complain of a waste of time. </para>

                        <para>- What necessity was there to make such an arrangement when the honorable gentleman might yesterday have given notice that he would submit the motion to-day ? If that course had been adopted, it would not have been possible for honorable members opposite to charge . the Opposition, with wasting time. I believe that the whole business of this session, so far, has been deliberately arranged by the Government on a preconcerted plan, in such a way as to prevent anything being done, in order that the stigma for delay in the transaction of the business of the country shall attach to the Opposition. Honorable members opposite may be quite sure that although the newspapers are behind them, and everything said and done on this side is distorted and misrepresented, we shall take advantage of every opportunity to publish the fact that all the talk about waste of time is only so much humbug, and that the Government . have deliberately planned what they complain about. </para>

                    <para>.- Last week I heard the Prime Minister say that this question would be brought on about the middle of this week. Late on Thursday night is not the middle of the week. If this is the way the business of Parliament is to be transacted, we need not wonder that so few business men are disposed to take any part in polities. </para>
