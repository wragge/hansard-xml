            <para>- It is understood that the proposed small arms factory is to be built at Lithgow, but I ask the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Minister of Defence, whether he does not consider it desirable that Parliament should have an opportunity to express its opinion as to the location of the factory. Does he not know of thefeeling that this factory should be within Federal territory? I have been informed that prices have already been received, and that the Government is actually considering the acceptance of a tender. Is not the Prime Minister aware that some of the responsible officers of the Department are averse to placing the small arms factory at Lithgow, thinking that it should be placed absolutely under the control of the National Parliament? </para>

            <para>- For months past Lithgow has been announced as the site of the proposed small arms factory, which the Government and honorable members, too, no doubt, are anxious to establish as soon as possible. Though I do not brush aside the suggestion that the factory should be placed in Federal territory, it must be remembered that, even if Parliament accepts at once one of the areas which are shortly to be submitted for approval, much will remain to be done &#39;before it can be ready for occupation. Therefore, to change a site which has been tacitly agreed to would mean great delay in the manufacture of small arms by the Commonwealth. </para>

Within the last two or three years,  His  Majesty the King has instituted a special decoration in addition to the Albert medal for the recognition of such splendid deeds as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davis,</inline> and I shall be only too pleased to consider the advisability of suggesting his heroism as a proper subject for recognition. </para>

            <para>- I wish to ask the Treasurer if he can see his way to facilitate the hearing of applications for old-age pensions? I understand that special magistrates have been appointed for the Melbourne districts, but that in some cases applications have been heard at the rate of only fifteen a day ; and that in others the magistrates have not commenced to hear them. In the Coolgardie electorate, great difficulty is experienced in obtaining persons who can testify that they have known applicants for pensions for a period of at least twenty-five years. I desire to know whether the Treasurer cannot issue instructions to the magistrates who hear these applications not to insist too rigidly upon the production of certificates from persons possessing a twenty-five years&#39; acquaintance with applicants. Can he not instruct them to accept the testimony of persons who may not have known the applicants&#39; for so long a period? I would also point out that old people experience very great difficulty in producing certificates of their age. In this matter also can he not relax the regulations? </para>

In my address at Inverell on Sunday, nth July, I am reported to have said that a member of&#39; the Federal Ministry had offered to pay my expenses if I would deliver certain addresses throughout the State in every electorate. This report found its way to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald.</inline> I cannot understand how I could have used the words &#34; Federal Ministry,&#34; as I do not know one member of that Ministry. If I was correctly reported I made a slip and used the word Ministry instead of Parliament. Some eighteen months or two years ago I delivered an address upon the subject of loyalty to the throne of England and in opposition to Home Rule. At the close of that address a Federal member, who was present, thanked me, and said &#34; I should like that address delivered in every electorate in the State, and would willingly do my share in meeting your expenses.&#34; This is the incident I briefly referred to in my Inverell address, and which has caused some little stir in certain quarters. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bamford</inline> is, I think, reported to have  said that it was to pay my expenses to deliver addresses upon Orangeism.

              <para>- It will be within the recollection of honorable members that some two or three years ago, shortly before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon&#39;s</inline> death, this House indorsed a draft agreement which had been entered into between the Government of the Commonwealth and the Prime Minister of the Dominion of New Zealand, under which a modification of the New Zealand Tariff would have been made in favour of Australia. Unfortunately, that agreement was not ratified by the Dominion Parliament, and consequently, from the stand-point of trade, we occupy precisely the same position towards New Zealand as does the rest of the world. That was not the first attempt which Australian Parliaments had made to conclude a reciprocal Tariff agreement with New Zealand. The first effort of the kind of which I have special knowledge was one which you, sir, made, when, in 1895. you introduced into the South Australian Parliament a reciprocal agreement between New Zealand and that Slate. But after the agreement had been tentatively arranged, the New Zealand Parliament altered the items which it covered very considerably by striking out the provision that fresh fruits from South Australia should be admitted free, and by considerably reducing the preference to be granted by that colony to South Australian wines. As a result of that alteration . the South Australian Parliament carried an amendment, compelling the Government to lay aside the agreement. Since that time other Governments - and particularly the Governments of the South African Colonies - have done more than we have in concluding reciprocal agreements with New Zealand. An agreement has been concluded between the Dominion of New Zealand and the South African Customs Confederation, which is already having a considerably prejudicial effect upon Australian trade. It is therefore urgently necessary, as honorable members will agree when I supply them with some statistics that steps should at once be taken to enter into communication with New Zealand, in order to see whether Australia cannot be placed upon at least as good a footing in these respects as South Africa. The agreement between New Zealand and South Africa came into force on the 7th January, 1907 ; that is, a little over two years ago. It is styled an agreement between the Dominion of New Zealand and the South African Customs Confederation which includes the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Orange River Colony, the Transvaal, and Southern Rhodesia. The agreement provides that certain special duties shall apply to South African products. Under the agreement feathers enter New Zealand at a duty of 15 per cent., and fish at1&#189;d. per lb. Dried and fresh fruits are admitted duty free, although the ordinary New Zealand duty on fresh fruits is1d. per lb. in some instances, and&#189;d. for the smaller fruits. On maize the general tariff is 9d. per cental ; the tariff for South Africa is 6d. per cental. On sugar the duty is is. 8d. per cental ; on tobacco, manufactured, 2s. 6d. per lb. ; on tea,1d. per lb. On wines other than sparkling, the duty is 2s. pergallon; whilst the duty on Australian wines is 5s. per gallon - a. preference of 3s. per gallon in favour of South African wines. Wines, sparkling, pav 9s. per gallon under the general tariff ; and there is a preference duty of 5s. per gallon on South African wines. On other goods, except spirits, the duty is 25 per cent. less than what would be payable except for this agreement. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Now, the total imports from Australia into New Zealand last year amounted in value to  &#163;2,841,426  ; and if South African goods are to obtain a preference of  25  per cent, it will be seen that that constitutes a very substantial handicap on Australian merchants.. It is a very serious matter, requiring urgent attention on the part of the Parliament and of the Government. </para>

              <para>- I shall go on as I am doing, irrespective of the issues that I raise. On the other hand. South Africa has granted to New Zealand preference on the following lines: - Bran, is. per cental ; flour,  2s. 3d.  per cental ; wheat, rs. per cental ; oats, is. lod. per cental ; butter,  2d.  per Jb. ; cheese,  12  per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> ; meats, id. per lb. ; all other goods except those specified,  25  per cent, less than the duty which would otherwise be payable. Of course, we need not trouble so much about that branch of the subject, because Australia has her own preferential Tariff with South Africa. But it will be seen that the agreement between South Africa and New Zealand involves a considerable handicap upon Australian trade. </para>

              <para>- That is a matter for negotiation. It would be absurd forme to propose a Tariff, which is a subject for negotiation between the two Governments. But I say without any hesitation that it ought net to be impossible for the Commonwealth Government to make some concession to New Zealand in the matter of trade, which will not shut us out from New Zealand markets, but which, on the contrary, will enable us to secure the same preferences as are granted bv New Zealand to British South Africa. Surely a trade amounting to nearly  &#163;3,000,000  per annum is worth making some efforts to conserve. &#39; In order to show the effect that has already been produced in one line of trade I may mention the wine business. This is the only aspect of the matter into which . I have been able to inquire since the subject was brought under my notice. The figures have been supplied to me by some members of the Viticulturists&#39; Association of South Australia, and Victoria. The effect upon their trade has been marked. The effect on the fruit trade I have been unable to ascertain; but the Government can easily obtain the figures with reference to those goods. In the year  1907  no wine was imparted from South Africa to New Zealand. In  1908  the imports were  434  gallons, valued at  &#163;126.  That was the first year after the new agreement came into force. In the same year Australian viticulturists exported to New Zealand  60,765  gallons of wine other than sparkling, valued at  ,&#163;24,248. </para>

              <para>- The value of the imports of sparkling wines was &#163;3&#62;53iIn the following year the imports of Australian wines into New Zealand very considerably decreased. The decrease in the imports from Victoria was not very great - 23&#62;I33 gallons, as against 23,243 gal-  Ions in the previous year - a drop of about 100 gallons. The import from New South Wales, however, dropped from 11,927 gallons to 7)574 gallons, and from South Australia from 35,000 gallons to <inline font-style="italic">26,4.00</inline> gallons. That was a very considerable decrease in the imports during one year. New South Wales imports show a drop of about 40 per cent., and those from South Australia very nearly as much. The  total import for the year ending 31st March, 1909, was 57,184 gallons, valued at .&#163;20,260, as against ,&#163;24,248 - the valuation of the import for the previous year. In sparkling wines the import from Victoria dropped from 531 gallons to 457 gallons, and from New South Wales from 1,329 gallons to 746 gallons. The value of these imports of sparkling wines dropped from &#163;3,531 to &#163;2,234, a very substantial decrease. Honorable members will, perhaps, say that this decrease corresponds with a period in which New Zealand experienced a temporary check upon the extraordinary prosperity hitherto enjoyed. The &#39; value of ihe total imports in the same year from all other countries than Australia and South Africa dropped from &#163;23,737 to &#163;23,525, showing that, so far as the imports from other countries were concerned, there was no considerable falling off. If we look now at the South African figures for the same period, we shall find them very suggestive of the reason for the falling off in the Australian trade. In the first year during which the preferential treaty was in force the imports into New Zealand from South Africa were nil. In the second year they were 434 gallons, and in the- year . ending March, 1909, they were 5,602 gallons. </para>

              <para>- It was greater than that. Australia probably suffered from a loss in consumption of wine in that year, or the importers may have been more fully stocked. The point is that a progressive decline is shown in the imports from Australia, whilst there is a startling increase in the imports from South Africa. Australians, as well as South Africans, are of course pleased to see any part of the Empire doing an increased trade, but whilst a transfer of trade from Australian to South- African wine growers is of no advantage to the Empire, it is a source of considerable danger to the interests of Australia. </para>

              <para>- I dare say that the honorable &#39; gentleman did, and, if so, his prophecy would appear to be borne out by the facts. I do not wish to occupy too much time in dealing with this matter, but I think I should refer to a few other items. I take, for instance, imports of fruit. The fresh fruit imported to New Zealand from Australia represented a value of ;&#163;74;985; dried fruit, &#163;20,845 ; bottled, pulped fruit, and so on, &#163;16,292, or a total value of &#163;112,122. The value of the total imports of fruit from all sources was &#163;354,752, so that in 1908 one-third of the total imports of fruit into New Zealand came from Australia. We are in danger of losing the whole of that trade, unless some such arrangement as I suggest is made. I do not wish to be an alarmist, but the figures are striking. Refined cane sugar to the value of &#163;28,417 was imported into New Zealand, as against an import valued at &#163;28,831 from all other sources. So that one-half of the import of refined cane sugar is affected. I do not know whether at present South Africa is producing any refined cane sugar, but the very considerable preference  given her will probably soon induce her people to enter for the New Zealand sugar trade. Of tobacco manufactured, &#163;102,840 worth was imported from Australia, or about 33 per cent, of the total imports. I have read the wine statistics, and, therefore, need not refer to them any further. I point out to the Government, however, that the case is sufficiently urgent, and that business interests involved are so large as to warrant Ministers in entering into negotiations at the very earliest moment, with a view to concluding some equitable business arrangement between the Commonwealth and New Zealand, which will, at least, place us on as good a footing in, doing trade with that part of the Empire as is British South Africa. New Zealand is our nearest neighbour, and, if we are shut out from one of our most profitable markets, one which ought to belong to us - though I do not mean in an exclusive sense - it will be a very disastrous blow to Australia. I admit that it is not the. simplest matter in the world to at once write out a list of the variety of articles which could be admitted into Australia, without, perhaps, raising some difficulties amongst the producers of similar goods in Australia ; but it ought not to be beyond the statesmanship of the two colonies to come to some agreement. The last agreement this Parliament accepted very readily; but, unfortunately, it was rejected in New Zealand. We ought not, however, because of that, to stay our hand, and refuse to enter into anyfurther negotiations-, seeing that the business interests at stake are so large. </para>

            <para>. - The honorable member for Boothby, in the last portion of his remarks, placed his finger accurately on the real obstacle there is to meeting the situation that has arisen. In  1906  a draft agreement for reciprocity with New Zealand was made by the then Commonwealth Government ; and, as mentioned by the honorable member for Boothby, passed by this House; but, unfortunately as I think, owing to the untimely decease of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Seddon, who was responsible for this agreement - he having represented his own Government, and conducted the negotiations which led to the framing of the proposed reciprocity schedule - it fell to the ground. </para>

              <para>- Yes; but, as a matter of fact, although the schedule presented was the result of a series of long and arduous struggles of a friendly character across the table, as between the Minister of Trade and Customs and myself on the one side, and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Seddon on the other, the latter, after its acceptance, expressed himself satisfied with it, not that it contained all he desired, but as representing substantially the basis of an agreement for commercial interchange between the two Dominions. I have always believed that, but for his untimely decease, his strong ascendancy in his own Parliament would probably have led to the acceptance of the agreement as it stood, or, perhaps, with some minor amendments. Since then, however, we have on more than one occasion, and latterly in an informal manner, attempted to bring about a revised agreement ; but on each occasion so far we have been informed that the time in the sister Dominion is not ripe for anything likethe agreement which we desire. I assure the honorable member for Boothby that we shall need no stimulus, and we have needed none, to repeat those proposals. In point of fact, it was in my mind to take advantage of the return of the present Premier of New Zealand, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir JosephWard,</inline> should he come to his home by the Australian route, to once more re-open the question. Whether that be so or not, although it would be a favourable opportunity, there will be other opportunities to endeavour to revive the matter. I cordially agree with the honorable member for Boothby that, amongst all the proposals for reciprocity and preference, the Dominion of the Empire which is nearest to us, and situated in the same seas, is, above all others, one with whom the very fullest commercial relations ought to be sought; and they will be sought without any hesitation. The agreement which was approved by this. House provided for a reduction of duties on our wines, as the honorable member for Boothby has properly said. At present Australian wines pay  5s.  and  9s.  per gallon, the latter for sparkling wines, before they enter NewZealand. Under the treaty which was proposed, the  5s.  would have been reduced to  4s.,  and the  9s.  to  6s.,  so that there would have been only an advantage of  2s.  on non-sparkling wines, and no advantage on sparkling wines under the treaty which has since been made with South Africa. At present South African wines have an advantage of  2s.  on both non-sparkling and sparkling. </para>

              <para>- I am afraid it means something very like that. But if the treaty had been passed, the advantage would have been only 2s. on non-sparkling wines, and no advantage on sparkling wines. After having looked at the figures, we require to bear in mind two very important facts. New Zealand is a non-wine producing country, and imports all it requires ; and it was the entrance into its market of our wines on which the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Seddon rested in a great deal of the bargaining that took place. South Africa, like Australia, is a wine-producing country, and, of course, the South Africans, having our treaty before their eyes when they made this agreement for reciprocity with New Zealand, naturally took particular care to put their wine industry on the most favorable basis possible. They did so, as my colleague, the Attorney-General, prophesied more than twelve months ago, when he asked a question in this House. The object of thetreaty, from the South African point of view, was very largely to get an advantage over Australian wines. I do not think my figures differ substantially from those of the honorable member for Boothby. I make the decline in the quantity of our wines about 13,000 gallons from 1908 to 1909, and the decline in value to be about  &#163;3,000,  taking all wines together. </para>

              <para>- That is the measure of our loss in one year ; but there still remains to us a trade chat we should be very sorry to lose. Since New Zealand accepted this treaty with South Africa, knowing whatits effect would be, we are placed at some slight disadvantage when entering into further negotiations. This debate, and the figures themselves, clearly point to the direction in which we should seek for concessions, and these would require to be paid for in some other direction. The difficulty, however, is by no means insuperable. The condition of things brought about by this competitive treaty certainly calls for the closest attention; and I undertake, on behalf of the Minister of Trade and Customs, that he will make full inquiry at an early date into all the circumstances of the present condition of trade between New Zealand and the Commonwealth, so that we may reopen negotiations for a reciprocal treaty in which the duties on wine and fruits will receive special consideration. </para>

            <para>.- After the long debate which we have had upon another motion, obviously no good public purpose would be served by again traversing the old ground. Probably the statement which I am now called upon to discuss was drafted with the intention of preventing any considerable debate upon it. It will be recollected that at the time of its submission to this House, some little trouble was experienced, owing to the fact that the Prime Minister then thought that it ought not to be discussed at all. The honorable gentleman shakes his head ; but I certainly understood him to say then that there was no need to debate it. </para>

              <para>- The Prime Minister, when leading the Opposition to the late Administration, was enabled within a day of his appointment to that distinguished position, to defeat the late Government. He was thus enabled to do what he had previously done in more instances than one, and in more Parliaments than one. No reflection is cast upon him by that statement. He adopted the best method that he could to attain the object which he had in view. He is the oldest parliamentarian in this House, having had thirty years&#39; political experience, twenty years of which has teen spent in Ministerial office. Naturally, he knows his way about from the standpoint of parliamentary tactics. He knows exactly what to do and what not to do, and this Ministerial statement I regard as an evidence of what he desired not to say. </para>

          <para class="block">Upon a former occasion, I did him an injustice by asserting that I thought the Ministry had been too hard upon him by compelling him to put their policy in writing, and by refusing him liberty to depart from it one iota. Upon a later occasion, the Prime Minster declared that, so far from that being the case, it was his special request to the Cabinet, that the Ministerial policy should be committed to writing, so as to obviate the possibility of any misunderstanding as to its contents. I must say, to his credit, that he has always been in favour of putting things in writing. In that respect, he is distinguished from other persons who are quite content on certain occasions to give and accept a word of honour. The Prime Minister, I repeat, desired to put his case in writing. But, although he does not wish to deceive anybody, he is a very difficult correspondent to bind down to the exact ideas which he wishes to convey. Be that as it may, I say that the statement read by the Prime Minister contains nothing more nor less than a number of glittering generalities. It embodies no policy like that in the speech which was put into the mouth of the Governor-General at the opening, of the present session, which the honorable gentleman condemned. It offers us no Federal guide in the matter of Australian development. </para>

              <para>- I shall leave , the honorable member for Dalley to deal with it as questions develop in this House. But I repeat what I stated during the debate upon the no-confidence motion that, instead of the Government - who boast that they came into office to preserve the Federation, and to develop our national and industrial life - acting up to their professions, they have merely sought to evade the whole duty that devolves upon this Parliament.. The industrial legislation which is outlined in the Ministerial statement will - if effect be given to it - deprive the Commonwealth of that dignity which properly belongs to it, by taking from the. Conciliation and Arbitration Court which it has established, the powers which are now wielded by that tribunal, and by vesting then in another authority for the purpose of preventing the workmen of Australia from getting the benefit of verdicts which they have won at great expense, and after strenuous fighting. Because a method has been discovered by which one Commonwealth tribunal may de cide what is a fair and reasonable wage in all the States, it is now proposed to delegate its powers to another authority - an authority which will not be able to deal with industrial matters so expeditiously and effectively as can the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. </para>

I may observe, further, that there is in draft a Bill to amend the Old-age Pensions Act, and that it was the intention of the previous Government to introduce that measure at once. But they were defeated before they had an opportunity. </para>

              <para>- If the right honorable member questions my statement on that point, he will question anything. If he means to convey that the Bill was not in type, I agree with him. But we had conveyed to the official head of the Department our intentions in regard to a Bill, which could&#39; be drafted in half an hour. The facts were all settled as regards the  reduction from twenty-five to twenty years, and all the subsidiary points which were necessary to make the measure work smoothly. I was pleased to read the Prime Minister&#39;s statement, published in the newspapers, that it was the intention of the present Government to make that amending Bill the first measure introduced. I think it ought to have been dealt with some time ago; and but for the action of the Prime Minister in dispossessing the previous Government, it would have been passed by now. I only mention that fact so that if it be said that we have been delaying the matter it may be seen that the blame does not rest with the late Government, but that it must be thrown on to the present Ministry, seeing that, by their action, they rendered necessary legislation impossible. However, I presume that honorable members on all sides of the House will agree with the principle of the Bill, although it has been delayed for a week or two. I also assume that there will be no difficulty in incorporating in the measure a provision to enable payments to be made as from the 1st July to all old-age pensioners, who would have been entitled to the pension from that date, had the alteration of the residential period from twenty-five to twenty years been made earlier ; because, obviously, had the previous Government not been disturbed the measure would have been passed during May or June, and consequently a large number of persons would have been entitled to the pension. That, at any rate, is the view which I take. I should like to say again to the Prime Minister that I regret very much that he did not think it necessary to make a fuller explanation of his reasons for including ten Ministers in his present Cabinet. I consider, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that that was a dangerous encroachment on responsible government. </para>

              <para>- The number of Ministers in the Cabinet rose from eight to nine, and then from nine to ten ; and it is singular that the last increase was made by those very gentlemen who are always saying that we must have responsible government. If the number of Ministers can be increased from eight to nine, and from nine to ten, it can be increased from ten to twenty ; and bv adopting that course, as I said previously, any Government could suborn Parliament. The Prime Minister will perhaps reply that Parliament itself would be the corrector of such an abuse. </para>

          <para class="block">But how could we expect Parliament to correct an abuse of that kind under a state of things such as we have existing here at present, when the pledges given by honorable members to their constituents seem to stand for nothing whatever? Promises made to the electors are flaunted, on the ground that r:TC we go to the constituencies we shall be defeated.&#34; Surely that is not a sufficient answer. I should like the Prime Minister to state to the House and the country the reasons why he thought it necessary to have a tenth member in the Cabinet. I make no charge against him for taking the position of Honorary Minister himself, although I think it is most undesirable that the chief adviser to the GovernorGeneral should be without a portfolio, and nominally without a salaried position. I do not suppose, however, that the Prime Minister intends either the House or the public to believe that he does not share in the emoluments distributed amongst Ministers </para>

              <para>- That may or may not be so. We are only ten years away from the time when the Constitution was drafted. At that period many of the authorities on constitutional government who took part in the Convention felt that the effect of bringing into operation a Constitution such as ours would be that Federation would kill responsible government, or that responsible government would kill Federation. It is just as well to remember that fact. </para>

              <para>- But there was something behind it. The drift in Australia is undoubtedly towards responsible government, but it is getting further and further away from the Federal ideal. I am not going to complain about that. But I have a right to challenge honorable members opposite who call themselves the Federal party, the protectors of the Constitution, &#38;c., &#38;c., and who must see that what has recently taken place in connexion with the formation of this Government has not been in accordance with the principles of responsible government, about which they make so much outcry. </para>

              <para>- I shall leave that subject for the honorable member who interjects to discuss with his friends. The point which I make against the Prime Minister is that he has increased the number of Ministers from nine to ten; and I say that if he can constitutionally do that, he can equallywell increase the number still further. It is only fair that he should say whether he adopted this course deliberately, and for the good of the country, or whether he did it for party purposes. He should state whether he considered that the increase of the number of Ministers would be beneficial to Australia. We must assume that that was his motive. This same question was brought up in the first Parliament by the leader of the Opposition, when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton included an Honorary Minister in his Cabinet. </para>

              <para>- The Ministerial statement is submitted to us under three headings. The first portion of it deals with industrial matters, which are all important. I think that the proposals submitted by the Government are altogether unsatisfactory. I hold the opinion that it is impossible for such machinery as the Government suggest for the purpose to be made effective. I shall watch eagerly for the Government proposal regarding new Protection. It is not to be found in the Ministerial statement. There is nothing in that statement to guarantee fair and reasonable wages to the workers of Australia. There is nothing in it that takes us any further than did a statement submitted on behalf of a previous Government led by the present Prime Minister, in which we were given to understand that fair and reasonable wages were to be paid in some industries, and a minimum wage fixed in others. This Parliament should not say that fair and reasonable wages are not to be paid to every one. Surely we should not seek to shelter ourselves in this matter, and proclaim that, if an industry is not a protected industry, the workers engaged in it need not be paid reasonable wages? It might be difficult to meet the circumstances of various industries, but we ought to leave it to a competent court to decide that any industry which is unable to pay fair and reasonable wages shall cease to be carried on in Australia. I need make no further reference to the proposal respecting silver coinage than to say that I am happy that it is about to be consummated.  On  the question of defence, all parties in the House are agreed that it must be dealt with more effectively than it has been in the past. I feel sure that I express the desire of Parliament and of the country when I say that we hope something will be done, and that people will cease merely to talk about providing an effective defence. Hitherto we have heard most eloquent orations regarding the defencelessness of this country. We have now reached a stage when it has been said that action must be taken, and I know of no way in which action can be taken unless we begin by collecting from the people the funds necessary to equip our defence forces as they ought to be equipped. </para>

              <para>- I had but one statement to make to the public on this question throughout my campaign in the country. I asked, &#34; Do you think that we are sufficiently defended at the present time? &#34; By interjection those to whom I spoke usually said, &#34; No.&#34; I then asked, &#34; Are you prepared to pay a sufficient amount for the efficient defence of Australia?&#34; And the usual answer was, &#34; Yes.&#34; The only position which any man holding a responsible office in the Commonwealth can take up on this question is that, if we &#39;are going to defend the country, we must provide &#34;funds to enable our forces, however well trained they may be, to be as well equipped as any enemy that might operate against them. I know of no way of securing the money which will be required for this purpose but by &#39;obtaining it from the people by taxation. The present Government would appear to have access to some Fortunatus&#39; purse, into which they can dip their hands and obtain money without in the first place taking it from the people. I know of no such way of getting money, and I shall await with some interest an announcement of the scheme by which the Government propose to defend Australia effectively without touching the wealthy people of this country, whose property will be protected by an efficient defence. On the question of finance I am somewhat apprehensive of the action which the Government has taken to convene a Premiers&#39; Conference to discuss financial problems of interest to the Commonwealth and the States. In surrendering, as I believe they have done, the powers of this Parliament to deal with such questions, they have taken a step which, I hope, they will live to regret. It is quite right that the Commonwealth Government should confer as often as possible with the representatives of the States Parliaments; but they have no right, in my opinion, to attempt in any way to reduce the powers of this Parliament under the Constitution. </para>

I certainly have read in the prt:-.-  letters  from the Prime Minister himself to the Premiers, asking when it would be  convenient  for them to meet. Of course, those letters may have appeared after the Premiers had themselves decided to hold the Conference. </para>

              <para>- I understand that the Conference was suggested entirely by the Premiers, and that, the Ministry then thought that it would be a good thing to set it forth in the statement that the question of our financial relations with the States would be discussed at. the Conference. I took no exception to that, but I do take exception to the proposal which is hinted at  vaguely,  namely, that the Government intend to inaugurate a borrowing policy. I have done my best to discover what is meant by the paragraph in the Ministerial statement ; and I think that the Prime Minister will not object to say whether or not it means borrowing. </para>

              <para>- I suppose we have no right to expect anything more - that, until the Budget is placed before us, the Opposition have no right to know the -financial proposals of the Government. We have a right to know, however, what is meant by these words in the Ministerial statement, because, amongst other important matters, this, in my opinion, is the most important. Honorable members are pledged, and have been pledged from Parliament to Parlia ment, that a borrowing policy will not be inaugurated without consulting the electors ; and I trust that no Government, whether their majority be big or small, will so far depart from principle as to act without that consent. Had we yielded, to the proposal made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, when Treasurer, and authorized the borrowing of &#163;500,000 in the first session, I venture to say that the Commonwealth would now be indebted &#163;20,000,000, and the community would have been neither better nor wiser, while it would have been saddled with the payment of interest. No doubt the rigid economy which was rendered necessary has affected the services ; but, however that may be, the party that was then led by the honorable member for South Sydney checked the borrowing idea, and I do. not think that there is a single honorable member who thinks that the right policy was not then adopted. Indeed, 1 heard <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner say later in the House that lie was delighted that Parliament had refused to authorize the loan. It would be an anomaly, not to say a danger to the financial stability of Australia, if the people, seeing that the Commonwealth was brought, into being partly to consolidate the States&#39; indebtedness, should, eight or nine years afterwards, find that, instead of reducing six borrowers to one, it had in itself added a seventh. I trust that until some arrangement is made between the States and the Commonwealth regarding the taking over of the State debts, we shall not inaugurate a borrowing policy ; at any rate, I shall do all I possibly can, whether in this House or elsewhere, to prevent any such course from being adopted. I am sorry, indeed, to hear the Prime Minister indicate that borrowing mav be resorted to; but if such is proved the fact, I hope the step will be taken in such a way that there may be no misapprehension. Let the policy be plainly and straightforwardly set before the people, so that he who runs may read, and all may express their view on the subject. </para>

              <para>- If the verdict of the people be in favour of borrowing, that, of course, will condone any action on the part of the Government. I do not wish to debate that matter at length ; but only to say now that, in my opinion, the action of the Prime Minister in creating a fusion of parties has, instead of conserving the in-  terests of the Commonwealth, tended to demoralize politics. I may be right or wrong, but that is the view I take. Further, the policy which has been put forward by the Government is not in any way a bold national policy ; there is nothing in it to guide young Australia in its thoughts towards national life and action, but it is a mere pandering to press popularity that cannot live, and cannot be sustained. If we are to develop on national lines, we must tread on some people&#39;s toes; we cannot provide money for national works without taxing and disturbing some interests. Some misunderstanding arose between myself and the present Prime Minister while I was in office. I desire now to place the facts on record as correctly as I can ; and I am indebted to the Prime Minister for copies of the correspondence that passed between us. Early in December, when I had the honour to be Prime Minister, there wasa disturbance in the party, led by the present head of the Government, and great pressure was attempted on myself to induce me to make a statement as to when Parliament would meet in the following session. The right honorable member for Swan came to me, and told me that the numbers were against me, and that I should have to make a statement or something would happen. The right honorable gentleman can tell honorable members in his own words what I said to him. Later on the honorable member for Parramatta, from his place in the House, asked me whether I was going to say when Parliament would be convened, and I said, &#34;No.&#34; The honorable member sat down, but rose again, and threateningly asked, &#34;Are you going to make a statement?&#34; I replied that I was unable to do so then, and he said, &#34;You can take the consequences!&#34; At that time I was told the numbers were all right; at any rate, I made no such statement as that desired. Later on I saw the Prime Minister on the cross benches, and in a brief and hurried conversation during which, I admit, I was watching the Opposition as much as listening to him, I made certain remarks. I think there is a difference of three weeks between the time that I indicated to him that the House would meet and the time it actually did meet. I told the honorable gentleman then that I could inform him only in confidence when Parliament would be called upon to resume business. I believe that he conveyed to a third party the information I gave him, and that in that way a difficulty arose, and I desire to exonerate him from any blame in that regard. If he says that, in view of a statement I made to him privately, the Parliament should have met on 1st May, instead of three weeks later, I shall not contradict him. </para>

              <para>- That is not the point. I say that, rightly or wrongly, I declined until the last day of the session to make any statement whatever as to when Parliament would again be called together. On the closing day of the session I said publicly that I felt that we should have to invite honorable members to resume their&#39; parliamentary duties about one month earlier than was usual. That announcement was observed to the very letter. Subsequently, I had an interview with the pre- sent Prime Minister, and later on some trouble arose between himself and a third party. I am making this statement with the full consent of the honorable gentleman, who wishes to justify himself with a third party. </para>

              <para>- I have, at all events, his consent. I should also like to state that in this matter of the date of the reassembling of Parliament I, too, was committed to a third party, who, at the time, was on his way to England. I am sure those who know me will do me the credit of believing that I would not deceive thePrime Minister, or any one else ; and certainly not as to the matter of a delay of a fortnight, or of three weeks, in the re-assembling of Parliament. During the recess the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> scare arose, and our Government declined to adopt, in connexion with it, a newspaper-made policy. Such a policy may be all very well; but the newspapers express merely their own views, although they may occasionally express the views of others. At the time we considered that we were performing our public duty to Australia by refusing to join in such an agitation. Although due largely to patriotic fervour, it had not a little of hysteria associated with it. We resisted the demands of the newspapers that we should make an offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> and I believe that we did right. I cast no reflection on the patriotism of those who took part in the agitation ; but it has since been proved, happily, that Great Britain is not in danger because of any deficiency either in her naval or military defences. Every citizen of the Empire must be proud to know that this is so. The figures that have come to hand since the agitation first arose indicate that the British Fleet shows such a margin, even over the two-power standard, that we may rest content that Great Britain is not likely for a day or two to be in danger. There are gentlemen who, at the time of the scare, expressed themselves strongly in favour of the Commonwealth presenting a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to the British Government, but who are now ready to admit that we took up the right stand. I shall not discuss the Government proposals in this direction; but shall confine myself to the statement that, in my opinion, they have not dealt with the question in a statesmanlike manner. If they were in favour of the presentation of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> they should have said so, and have offered one. Members of the present Ministry were bold enough at the time of the agitation to say that they would give a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> or nothing ; but to-day they take up a different attitude. They are now in possession of all the information as to what the late Government did, and know exactly how far we went in the views we held, and expressed. I have never considered it necessary or advisable for Ministers to make known to the public matters of international importance that are the subject of negotiation or correspondence. All other public matters certainly ought to be openly discussed ; but international questions should not be made public until the negotiations have been completed. I have always held that view, and shall continue to hold it.

          <para class="block">It would appear, from the last telegram received by me from the Prime Minister, that some &#34;subsequent event&#34; had arisen, of so startling and pressing a character, as to make the early re-assembling of Parliament more urgent than ever. Was the event the decision of members of the present Ministry that a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> should be offered to Great Britain? The correspondence indicates that the desire of honorable members opposite then was that a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> should be offered. Where is that proposal now? Had I been apprehensive of the attitude of those who enabled us, as a Government, to live, I should have found in these telegrams evidence on which to base my apprehension. As a matter of fact, however, I was not. I did not regard these messages as hostile. Having regard to the relationship that had existed between the present Prime Minister and myself, prior to the Labour Government coming into office, I did not anticipate that we should have an indirect notice of withdrawal of support. On no occasion whatever did I, indicate to him that I suspected that he was withdrawing his support ; he conveyed that fact to me in writing at a later period, after the parties had fused. May I here say that he is mistaken, and the press are mistaken, when they say that the withdrawal of our support was indicated to the previous Government in writing? That is a small matter, but apparently the press want to make a little score out of it, to buttress an untenable position. That, however, is not a matter which I wish to discuss. The honorable member knows how intimate our relationships were, and how frankly - I can say this without egotism - I put every phase of those relationships between ourselves as it ought to be put. I make no complaint at all as to what was done, or how it was done. I simply say that, wherever there is a misapprehension, and there is a written document available to put it right, it should be put right. I am indebted, therefore, to the honorable gentleman for the copies of these letters. </para>

              <para>- Yes; that letter, as I recollect it, indicated that it was desirable, owing to certain things that had been said and communications that had been passing between the honorable gentleman and other people, that we should meet as early as possible, and, at any rate, that the matter should be cleared up. I have tried to clear the matter up, and the main question between ourselves is as to whether the difference of time was a fortnight or three weeks. The honorable member will agree with me that under no circumstances whatever would I allow him to say publicly on my behalf what I told him then privately, as I was entitled to do. On many occasions I have had the confidence of the honorable member, and on no occasion, I am happy to say, did I communicate with anybody when the matter was strictly private. I say again, as I said on the evening when I spoke from the other side of the chamber, that I trust that, now that the fusion of parties has come about, and we are settling down to business, the best interests of the Commonwealth will be conserved by the people&#39;s representatives in this chamber performing the public duties that lie nearest to them. I again deplore the fact that a Government with a big majority hesitate to take a forward step and declare a bold financial and industrial policy for Australia. If they do not - since they have chosen not to do so - it will be only a short time before another Government, who will not hesitate to express the will of the people, will take their places. </para>

All it spells, then, is procrastination, and procrastination means ultimately the sacrifice of Australia.

I should like the Government to explain why they have backed down from the opposition which they offered then, and why they are in favour of the measure now. It will be remembered that when it was last under consideration, the then Opposition took strong objection to its provisions. </para>

            <para>- At all events, thehonorable member took strong exception to some of the provisions. I desire to know what arrangement the Government have come to. I think it would have been only fair if the Attorney-General, when he asked the House to reinstate the Bill, had&#39; given some information as to what action the Government intended to take. Because, if they intend to pursue the same course asthey did on a previous occasion, they will go a long way towards wasting the time of the session, and doing nothing. </para>

            <para>- That seems to be what the Government are driving at. I think that the Bill should be placed on the statute-book in the strongest possible terms. Instead of being modified in any way, it should be strengthened. Previously, there was a tendency on the part of the then Opposition to modify its provisions to a very large extent ; and that is why I think that, at this stage, the House should receive some information concerning the action which the Government propose to take. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member must be aware that this is a Bill which has been passed, so to speak, by the House itself, which has not been, and which is never likely to be, the measure of any particular Ministry. It is one of those measures which the House takes into its own care and shapes according to its own intent. Honorable members on both sides, no doubt, will find themselves divided on particular provisions; but the object - and no one knows it better than does the honorable member for Kennedy - is to provide for the circumstances under which witnesses may be examined by Select Committees. </para>

            <para>- The present proposition is simply one to restore the measure to the notice-paper for further consideration, and when it is reinstated it can be strengthened or amended in any direction which honorable members may think fit. It is not in the ordinary sense of the term a Government measure, but it is one which the Government feel bound to ask the House to restore to the stage which it had reached before the last prorogation, and so enable honorable members to decide, when the proper time arrives, in what particular form :it shall reach the statute-book. The piesent is only a preliminary motion for placing the Bill on the notice-paper, and in the bands of honorable members. </para>

          <para>. - I object to this motion being proceeded with at the present stage. Apparently the Government are determined to occupy the time of this session with the consideration of measures which are in the last degree unimportant, and of which the Marine Insurance Bill is a typical example. </para>

            <para>- Yes, it is relatively very unimportant, indeed. If the measure were intended to remedy any wrongs which exist, I might recognise its importance. But it does not contain a single provision which alters the law in any respect whatever. Even if it be passed, it will not assist a single individual. It is a measure which is designed merely to meet the convenience of a few underwriters and a few marine insurance agents, who experience some difficulty in determining what is the Commonwealth law upon the subject. The whole of the ninety-five clauses which it contains are already the law of the land, and the principles with which they deal are well established by the judgments which have been given during the past 100 years. There is no dispute on any one of them, and even if there were, this Bill would not make the position one bit clearer. Whilst it seeks to set out certain well recognised principles as the law on marine insurance, it does not completely codify the law. It is merely a copy of an English Act which was passed a little more than two years ago. Where that Act is defective, this measure is also defective. Yet we are asked to occupy the time of the final session of the present Parliament in discussing this trivial measure, notwithstanding that a number of matters of pressing importance - of such importance that, according  to the Prime Minister, this Parliament ought to have been called together earlier to deal with them - are awaiting our attention. The honorable gentleman deemed some of these matters so important that immediately after the opening of Parliament he submitted a motion for the purpose of wiping out the late Administration, without even affording them an opportunity to defend themselves. It is very significant that every measure which will confer a benefit upon a small and favoured class of the community is immediately brought forward by the Government, whilst every measure which will benefit a large section of the community is passed over. </para>

            <para>- Is that the most important duty which has been imposed upon us by Federation ? I would remind the honorable member that we are under an obligation to settle the Federal Capital site, to establish an Inter-State Commission, to appoint a High Commissioner, to initiate an effective defence scheme, to adjust the future financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth, and to decide upon our attitude in respect of the transfer of the Northern Territory. All these questions are of the utmost importance. Yet they are to be set aside whilst the interests of a favoured few are considered. With what ease gentlemen occupying high positions in the commercial community are able to command the ear of the Ministry in respect of any measure which will benefit them ! This Bill is brought forward merely for the purpose of copying a measure which was passed in England about three years ago - a measure that has benefited only a few commercial men and a few individuals who are interested in marine insurance. </para>

            <para>- But there are many features of the present law to which I object. I do not think that the Judges have always taken the wisest view of matters upon which they had&#39; to give decisions, and when we deal with the Bill in Committee I shall endeavour to point out various ways in which it ought to be amended, and in which the interests of the country can be served by making amendments. If honorable members opposite think that the duty of an Opposition is simply to open their mouths and swallow whatever the Ministry choose to send them, I can only say that we take a different view of our responsibilities. When I consider the anxiety of Ministerialists to adopt a measure of this kind passed in England a few years ago, I cannot help contrasting their attitude with the difficulty we have had in securing the adoption of English legislation designed to benefit the masses. About twelve years have elapsed since the English Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act was passed. A number of honorable memberswere in office in various States when effect was given to that legislation. But I did not observe such keen anxiety on their part to adopt English legislation in that particular, the object there being to remedy substantial injustices from which the workers suffer. </para>

            <para>- Three out of four workmen in Australia are employed under conditions to which the principle of the English Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act does not apply. There was not such a keen desire to imitate British legislation in respect to a measure which remedied substantial injustices. But a measure of this kind, that merely meets the convenience of a few commercial men, is introduced at once. I am doubtful about the Bill on other grounds. We often find that after a piece of legis-  lation of this character has been in operation for a few years, defects requiring to be remedied are discovered in it ; and, seeing that the business men of Australia will suffer no disability from the non-passing of the Bill, it would, I think, be much better to allow the English Act to remain in operation for three or four years longer, in order that we may see in what respects it fails to attain its objects. Then we might entertain a proposal to bring the Australian law up to date, benefiting by the experience obtained in Great Britain.  1  turn to the Ministerial statement to see what reference is made in it to this Bill. In this document proposals, are promised, the object of which is to benefit large numbers of the people of this country. I turn to the section headed &#34; Industrial.&#34; I ask honorable members to notice the way in which an unimportant measure of this kind is there treated. We are told - </para>

            <para>- I have no doubt that the honorable member also knew how much worth there was in not turning up for divisions. When  1  consider the modest contributions to the last debate made by honorable members on my own side, and recollect the five and a half hours&#39; speech delivered some time ago by the honorable member for Parkes, I cannot help drawing comparisons. I understand that he had that speech carefully printed afterwards, and sent copies in large batches to England. Not content with inflicting it upon this House, the honorable member tried to induce his friends 16,000 miles away to devote their attention to it. There is very important work which this Parliament should be called upon to do. If we are to give effect to the proposals of Ministers, we shall have to appoint an Inter-State Commission, which is to be called upon to take up so many functions that I believe that, should any of its members hereafter attend a performance of the opera of &#34; The Mikado,&#34; Pooh Bah will retire blushing from the stage when he sees them. We have eighteen weeks of the session before us, and in that time we must pass the Estimates and must listen to and criticise the Financial Statement. I think that we have to do something in connexion with the Federal Capital ; &#171;at least some honorable members on this side hope, and some on the other side have promised, that we shall do so. We have also to settle the question of the High Com.missionership. We have been told many times that Defence is a matter of trie utmost importance, which should be dealt with at once. We are told that the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States must be the subject of considerable discussion in this House, if an equitable decision upon them is to be arrived at. We are also to be called upon to amend the Old-age Pensions Act. All these are matters of very great importance, and when I see on the businesspaper a number of measures of the same class as the Marine Insurance Bill, I am satisfied that the Ministry intend to fool away the session doing unimportant business, and leaving important business unattended to. It becomes every day more evident that the local correspondent of the London <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> in cabling to that newspaper that the Minister of Defence had accepted the Deakin policy on the condition that every plank of it was to be postponed, aptly summed up the true position. We are being asked to deal with a Marine Insurance Bill. There is a notice on the paper concerning a measure to provide for the acceptance of Norfolk Island as a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth ; another relating to telegraphic communications in time of emergency ;  another relating to currency coinage and legal tender : a Bill for an Act to amend the Audit Acts of 1901 and 1906; and a Bill for an Act relating to an Australian Bureau of Agriculture. These are the measures of which notice has been given by Ministers. Reference to them appears on the business-paper at the present time, and evidently they are the kind of measures that the Government intend to go on with. One looks in vain for any reference to the introduction of measures of real importance - the passing of which would make some difference to the people of Australia. I enter my protest against the consideration, at this stage, of this measure, or of any other measure of a similar character, and I urge upon the Government that, in fairness to the House and to the country, they should let us do something of real importance to the people, and should not take up our valuable time in this last session of this Parliament in dealing with measures which remedy- no injustice, and which will do no good to any one. </para>

          <para>.- I hope that the Prime Minister, or somebody else, will let the House know why this particular proposal was made. The honorable member for Werriwa pointed out to the House what must be sufficiently obvious to every member. I am very much astonished that the Attorney-General should lend himself to a pretext of this kind. Nobody knows better than does the honorable and learned member that this measure does absolutely nothing. </para>

            <para>- If the honorable gentleman will say in what respect this measure amends the law, and not merely codifies it, and will say why such a codification of the law is urgent, and such a measure as a Government which secured office in the way in which the present Government did should ask this House, at this stage, to give its valuable time to, we shall know something worth learning. There are three motions on the paper - one a vote of want of confidence in the Government - covering, practically the same ground, and these have been disposed of. I venture to say that their discussion occupied Jess time thai* did the debate on any Address-in-Reply and motion of censure in the history of this Parliament. Yet when we propose to goon with business, we are met with this. Marine Insurance Bill. We are to deal also with a Bills of Exchange Bill, which is precisely of the same nature. It proposes a mere codification of the law. I do not say that the law does not need codifying ; but that at this stage we should not direct our attention to this class of work. These are measures for the benefit of that particular class of persons whom the Chambers of Commerce of this country fitly represent. They have already dictated the postal and telephonic policy of the country. They have declared what shall, or what shall not, be the policy of the country in a most important business particular that affects every person, even in the remotest corner of the Commonwealth. It is proposed now, as a further sop to Cerberus, that they shall have this measure in addition. I look down the list of business on the paper in vain, as the honorable member for Werriwa did, to find something that indicates the policy for which the present Government came into power, where they do not repeat, like an echo, the policy of their predecessors. They seem absolutelyafraid to come down with anything of their own. The proposed measure to amend the Old-age Pensions Act is one on which literally crowds of old men and women irc this country are depending. </para>

          <para>.- It might be rather hard to satisfy honorable members opposite on points of procedure; but I would remind them that, time and again, there have been complaints about the postponement, for the sake of later measures, of business which has already been entered upon. The Bill we wish to restore was considered in Committee as far as clause 23, the discussion being intelligent, though by no means prolonged. The measure is a technical one, and considerable applicationis needed to apprehend all its bearings. That may account for the expedition, which, I hope, will be still more marked in connexion with the restoration of the Bill to the notice-paper. </para>

            <para>- We propose its restoration in accordance with the rule which has so often been declared that partlyconsidered measures shall be got rid of to enable others, perhaps of greater moment, to be considered. It has been complained that the Government is not bringing forward measures in which the working classes are directly interested ; but I would remind honorable members that we cannot introduce all our legislation in this House. The assumption that our Bills are not ready is without foundation. They are ready, and some of them will be gone on with in the Senate at once. Our desire is to properly apportion the work of legislation between the two Houses; but we wish first to get rid of measures which have already been partly considered. The honorable member for Werriwa has, no doubt, given considerable attention to the technical subjects with which the Bill deals ; but he is a tit at sea when he says that we are not altering the laws of the States. As a nutter of fact, there are no State Acts. </para>

The Bill attempts to make our legislation correspond with that of England, where an Act was passed three years ago, after the subject had been under discussion since 1894. </para>

            <para>- In some respects, it does. I cannot refer to it at length on this motion ; but the position has been clearly stated by the Minister of External Affairs. What has been done in England is to take the essence of about 2,000 cases in which the common law has been laid down, modernize its expression, and embody it in an Act of Parliament. If it were really true that there is nothing new in the Act, that should not be an objection to it. No doubt some honorable members could extemporize on anything; but we are not empirics in regard to technical legislation such as this. All we have done is to take advantage of the expert knowledge and world-wide experience which guided the Imperial Parliament. I do not say that there is amy vital alteration of the existing law ; but the uniformity which is sought is desirable. I have made these remarks because I thought it due to the House to reply to the statements made, no doubt <inline font-style="italic">bon&#226; fide,</inline> but too hastily, by some of those who have spoken. </para>

          <para>.- Would it not be better, before introducing a Bill which will provide opportunities for discussion at several stages, to test by a motion the opinion of the House as to the advisability of accepting the agreement between the Prime Minister and the South Australian Government in this matter? I understood that originally the intention was that it should be treated in that way ; though, asthe Prime Minister shakes his head, I may be mistaken. I am informed that a Bill has been introduced in South Australia, so that perhaps it will be well to, proceed with a Bill here. </para>

          <para class="block">The main object of the Bill is to reduce, from twenty-five years to twenty, the number of years that a claimant for an oldage pension has to be in Australia. A second alteration of importance of the present law is that a claimant who is not naturalized, but is otherwise qualified for a pension, may become naturalized at any time during the current year. It is not proposed to permanently amend the existing la.w in the latter respect, but merely to provide that a person who would be debarred from a pension under the principal Act, by reason of his not having been naturalized for three years, may receive a pension, if otherwise qualified and he becomes naturalized before the date mentioned. This amendment will provide for all those unnaturalized persons in Australia now, but not for those who may come afterwards. </para>

              <para>- I cannot say, but as I am not likely to live in Germany, we need not discuss the matter. I am sure we all think that those who are now grown old, and are deserving, and who have borne the heat and burden of the day, ought to be treated as generously as possible. At any rate, the Government have considered the matter, and have arrived at the conclusion as set forth in the Bill. As I say, the contemplated amendment has been known for a good while; and it is probable that those who are otherwise qualified for a pension have been seeking naturalization during the last year. I have it on the authority of the Minister of External Affairs that a great number are applying for naturalization now ; and I should say that by the end of the year all those who are qualified and desire pensions will, if not already British subjects, avail themselves of the provisions of the Bill. </para>

              <para>- Such a person can be naturalized now, or at the time he becomes qualified for the pension ; and that is all that is necessary. However, we can discuss these points in Committee. Clause 9 of the Bill provides for the appointment of special magistrates, in order to facilitate the hearing of claims, there being no Commonwealth legislation at present authorizing such direct appointments. It is also proposed by Clause 13A to omit the word &#34;annually&#34; from the  prin- cipal Act, so as to dispense with the compulsory annual examination in regard to the qualification of applicants. This annual review of applications costs a good deal of money, and is considered by those in authority to be unnecessary. Instead, power is given by the Bill to make an investigation at any time that the Commissioner considers necessary, With this object in view, section  38  of the principal Act, which was copied from the New South Wales Act, is repealed. It is thought that in the case of aged people, their property and income are not likely to increase from year to year; and, therefore, it is proposed to give the Commissioner some discretion, and arrange at intervals for police reports concerning all the pensioners. If on these reports an investigation is considered necessary, it will be made. </para>

              <para>- I expect that it is made quite clear in the principal Act, which is not repealed in this respect. As, perhaps, honorable members know, the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act has been undertaken by the Treasury, and the Secretary and Accountant of the Treasury have been appointed Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner respectively. This was done by my predecessor, who, I am sure, was .largely influenced by the belief that it would lead to economy and efficiency in administration. A considerable saving will be made by allotting this work to Treasury officers, instead of appointing special officers for the purpose. </para>

          <para class="block">I can gather, it is working well. It is only natural that there should be difficulties at the outset, for it is no easy matter to administer such an Act over this large continent. I was informed the other day that the forms and other documents set out in connexion with it weighed some tons. Although some difficulty may be experienced at the beginning of the new administration, no one is likely to suffer by it ; if there is any delay in paying a pension, the pensioner himself will forfeit nothing. There are some minor matters dealt with in this Bill to which I need not refer in detail; but in clause 4 we have a provision designed to meet the administration of the Act in the Broken Hill district, from Adelaide rather than from Sydney, that being found the most convenient course to adopt. That clause provides -  where the Commissioner places a district situated in any State under the control of the Deputy Commissioner for another State, the Deputy Commissioner under whose control the district is placed shall exercise and perform in relation thereto all the powers functions and duties of a Deputy Commissioner. </para>
          <para class="block">That is to be a proviso to section  6  of the principal Act. Then, again, clause  15  provides for the repeal of section  39  of the Act and the substitution in lieu thereof of a new clause providing - </para>

            <para>.- It certainly seems like rushing legislation when the Treasurer begins to move the second reading of a measure before he has the measure ready, but it shows the conciliatory mood of the Opposition when we are prepared in those circumstances to proceed calmly to discuss it. Obviously this Bill is a legacy from the previous Government, which this Government have taken up and brought in. It is desirable that it should be dealt with expeditiously. </para>

              <para>- I do not object to the Attorney-General calling it new, but, so far as I have been able to see, there is nothing in it but what was discussed again and again by the previous Government with the Commissioner of Old-age Pensions, and approved of. I shall be glad to hear the Attorney-General later on regarding the differences. I agree with the Treasurer that it was a good arrangement which I made when Treasurer to depart somewhat from the strict interpretation of the principal Act, and, instead of making new appointments, to appoint as Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allen,</inline> the Secretary to the Treasury, who has had previous experience of the administration of an Old-age Pensions Act. Not only has the Commonwealth saved money in that way, but it has obtained a more competent officer than would have been got, I think, even by the payment of &#163;1,000 a year to a new man, whatever his experience might have been. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allen</inline> was the Chief Commissioner, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weir,</inline> I think, his principal assistant for Victoria. Obviously, however, the Minister is the person principally responsible for errors of judgment on the part of his subordinates. That is the usual rule under responsible government. I do not know who arranged the Victorian system. The principal Act provided that applicants should make their applications first, then go before a magistrate, then to the assistant Commissioner, and then to the Commissioner, before they could get their pensions. The rearrangement arrived at - I do not know whether it was quite within the provisions of the Act or not - was to get as many of the&#62; particulars- as possible at first, and, immediately they were accepted by the magistrate before whom the cases were to go, to make the pensions payable right off. That was the object aimed at. Whether it has been attained or not is difficult to say, for it would be impossible to bring in a big machinery measure like this without some hitches. I have no doubt that from time to time those who administer it will be able to improve the methods and make it less jarring than previously.

But for the action of those now sitting on the Ministerial side, this amending measure would have been before the House in May, and by this time the Act would have been amended so as to enable the payments to be made. This, however is not a party question, and I think all honorable members will agree that, as it was the intention to reduce the residence qualification from twenty-five to twenty years, it is only fair to those who are entitled by that reduction to a pension to make provision for them to receive payment as from the 1st of July. </para>

              <para>- Surely the Treasurer will not accuse me of suggesting that the Government have not an opinion on the point ! I simply asked the honorable gentleman if he would be good enough to make it clear in the Bill that any person who on the 1st July, 1909, had lived in the Commonwealth for twenty years, and who otherwise was entitled to an old-age pension, is included in its provisions, and will get payment as from that date. We should make the measure retrospective to that extent, so as to make it quite clear that the rights of such persons have not been destroyed bv the delay in the passing of it. </para>

This is not a measure to penalize persons who have lost their right to old-age pensions by reason of their own neglect. The whole principle of invalid and old-age pensions legislation is to provide for persons who have not been able to provide for themselves. Why should any persons be deprived of that to which they would be justly entitled but for some technicality which may have been overlooked, or some omission to comply with a part of the law ? </para>

              <para>- I think it is only fair that the person should be allowed to draw an old-age pension from the date of the application to be naturalized, if that date is subsequent to the ist July,  1909.  I make that suggestion to the Treasurer. </para>

              <para>- In every Bill some principle is involved, and the vital principle in this measure is the reduction of the residential qualification to twenty years. Its remaining provisions relate merely to machinery. There is another important point which I think should be taken into consideration by honorable members. The principal Act provides that if any person is possessed of property equal in value to ,&#163;310, he is not eligible to receive a pension. I think that that provision is an illogical one, seeing that under it a man possessed of that amount of property - assuming that otherwise he would be entitled to an old-age pension - would be deprived of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;26</inline> per annum, which sum, if capitalized, would represent far more than ^310. If we are going to deal equitably with those who have accumulated a little money, it will be necessary for us to increase the amount, and to adopt an actuarial sliding scale in accordance with the value of the property held by any applicant. The maximum value of&#39; property which an old-age pensioner might possess would then be about .&#163;500. In the case of applicants who are possessed of property of less value, there should be a sliding scale downwards. </para>

              <para>- Does the honorable member think so? In any case, when we come to deal with the matter in Committee, I think I shall be able to show that we are acting inequitably by reducing the pensions payable by <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> for every <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;io</inline> in excess of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> possessed by a pensioner. There is an anomaly in the whole scale of reductions to which we agreed in the principal Act. That Act, it will be recollected, was rather hurriedly drafted and passed through this House. Some of us know how that  occurred. But whatever was said by honorable members in opposition to it, not a single voice can be raised against it now, or against the principle which is embodied in it. </para>

              <para>- The Treasurer does not do himself justice in interjecting in that way. I said nothing of the kind. I said in effect : &#34;Here is the only means by which old-age pensions can be paid.&#34; It was a perfectly constitutional means to adopt, and the High Court has so declared. The whole of the members of the Labour party took that view, and I went so far as to say that I was prepared to suffer political annihilation in order to . enable such a Bill to be placed upon the statute-book. I say the same thing now. It is creditable to any party to have forced such a measure through Parliament. Now we desire to make the scope of this measure still broader. I quite agree that this is not the time to debate its details. Unfortunately the Government were not so ready to proceed with business as they told us they were, otherwise they would have had copies of the Bill in the hands of honorable members when the Treasurer was moving its second reading. </para>

I shall give the Government every assistance in passing the Bill, which is a legacy from the late Government. </para>

In the form in which the measure is now drawn, that result cannot be attained. Sub-section 3 of section 33 of the principal Act says - </para>

              <para>The determination of the Commissioner or the Deputy Commissioner shall, if in favour of the claim, set out the rate of the pension and the date of its commencement (which must not be prior to the date of the claim), and a pension certificate in the prescribed form shall thereupon be issued to claimant. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">That provision will not he altered by this Bill, so that persons who have not filed claims up to the present time cannot retrospectively obtain the benefit which will be conferred by the reduction of the residential qualification to twenty years. As the honorable member has sought my opinion upon the matter, I am simply stating what I conceive to be the effect of this Bill when read in conjunction with the principal Act. From the standpoint of policy, I do not know whether it would be advisable to make the amendment suggested, and for this reason : Suppose that hereafter - say, three years hence - we wish to reduce the period of residence to fifteen years. Ought we then to say that those who, under that provision, could have made a claim on the ist July of the present year, should be able to retrospectively date their claims? I do not speak strongly against the suggestion, because there is not much in itIt would only be a matter of a few weeks, and no one would grudge any poor fellow the amount that would be paid to him. The object of this legislation is, of course, to bring the whole of Australia into line with two States in regard to the period of residence. I believe, speaking from memory.,  that a rough estimate has been made showing that the cost of the reduction of the period from twenty-five years to twenty, amounts to something like &#163;20,000 for the whole Commonwealth. It is not a large amount. The numberof those who would be subject to our legislation in this matter would be practically the same, but the period covered only a few weeks. The burden would not be a great one to carry. But, speaking subject to correction, I do not think that the principle suggested is a good one to apply. Some honorable members would desire perhaps, to see the period of residence reduced to ten years. If hereafter the period were reduced to ten years, we should be met by the fact that we had created a precedent,and should be asked to make the amendment of the law retrospective from the 1st July, 1909. </para>

              <para>- No one, of course, knows the age of a lady ; but I know of a person who says that she is onlysixty-three, and she has been able to purchase such an annuity for &#163;1,000. Our legislation assumes that a person sixty-five years of age can purchase an equivalent to &#163;26 a year for &#163;310. The principal Act is based upon that principle. Of course, a person with &#163;310 who purchased such an annuity would lose the principal; but the Act says that he must lose it. </para>

            <para>.- Although it is very desirable that this measure should speedily become law, I think we ought to have a little more time in which to scrutinize in detail the proposed alterations in the law. My own opinion is that the principal Act was passed too hurriedly ; its provisions should have been more carefully studied. But, like other measures passed without sufficiently close examina tion, we have found that the operation of the law evolves rather serious defects. Certainly, some very hard cases have come under my own observation.  I  should like to mention a case which may be typical of many ; though I hope not. It is an example of exclusion from the benefits of the principal Act, under the section which provides for a twenty-five years&#39; continuous residence in Australia. That section is operating very harshly in certain instances. The typical case which I shall mention is that of an old couple who came to Australia as far back at 1866; that is, forty-three years ago. But for a short period - I think for about ten years - they resided in New Zealand. That interval, however, cut into the middle of the fortythree years, the result being that the old couple have not resided &#34; continuously &#34;  in  Australia for twenty-five years. If the section to which I allude be maintained  in  the principal Act, and no amendment be made under this Bill, the result will be to exclude these very worthy people, and  I  suppose others under similar circumstances, from the benefits of the law. </para>

              <para>- No, unfortunately,  it  does not ; the provision only allowsfor absence for a tenth of the period of residence. This Bill proposes to make the period of residence in Australia twenty years. But, even that amendment would not afford relief to such people as I have referred to. I should like that point to be considered,because even people born  in  Australia have had to leave the country, for a period, not from choice, perhaps, but from necessity. The particular couple to whom I have alluded, went to New Zealand because the husband accepted an appointment there. If there be any virtue in the length of term of residence at all, what does it matter whether that term happened to be intercepted by a short period of residence in New Zealand or elsewhere ? There is another matter of far greater importance, however. This is the necessity of bringing into operation speedily the provisions of the principal Act in regard to invalid pensions. While it may be admitted that some very hard cases will be relieved by the payment of old-age pensions, I can assure the House that other cases no less poignant and distressing will remain as a reproach to our common humanity, unless the invalid sections are brought into operation. What has been my experience will probably have been that of many others. Take the case of a man with a large family who is suddenly stricken by some accident, or by serious illness, or by loss of sight, or, as is unfortunately often the case in my electorate, by that frightful disease, consumption. Consumption is  a  disease which is creating great havoc amongst miners in Western Australia.  I shall not be accused of making any provincial appeal when I say that the cases of such men, crippled in early manhood by a wasting disease, and prevented from pursuing the means of. livelihood, are the saddest which one can contemplate. Although we may be very sorry indeed for the aged poor, I consider that the case of a man who has a house full of dependent children, whilst he is deprived of the means of maintaining them, is even sadder and more pitiable. </para>

              <para>- That is so. Usually the children of a man sixty-five years of age have grown up, and are no longer dependent on him. In most cases, if they are any good at all, they are able and willing to help him in his old age. I think it will generally be admitted that the case of a man with a family who has become incapacitated as the result of  an  accident or illness appeals most strongly to our sympathy and pity. I hope that the Government will eliminate from the Act what I call its more illiberal provisions. Under the Act a deduction is made from a pension where some charitable person, for instance, gives a pensioner his meals for doing odd jobs. Is it not somewhat petty, and even contemptible, to reduce a pension on that account? </para>

              <para>- It tends to dry up the springs of charity as well. It might lead people who have an old retainer dependent upon them to send him adrift. The little given in charity in this way would, in any case, make but a small addition to the  Dension.  I should like particularly to direct the attention of the Treasurer to the fact that a charitable institution taking charge of the aged poor, providing for their sustenance, and looking after their welfare, may reasonably claim to be entitled to some consideration. The right honorable gentleman is aware of a very useful institution in Perth, the Old Men&#39;s Home, and he knows that if what I suggest in this connexion is not done, the cost of maintaining the old men in that home,  and  in similar institutions, will be thrown on the State Government, and, as a result, the State will be doubly taxed. </para>

              <para>- That could not be done under our Act. Although under Pur law there is a little latitude allowed in respect of the identification of claimants for oldage pensions, to the extent that magistrates may dispense with proof of actual acquaintance with the claimant of two persons for twenty-five years, there is reason&#62; why the provision should be made even, more elastic. If these pensions are to reachthe class of persons most deserving of them, provision should be made to enablethe pioneers of this country to secure theadvantages of this beneficent legislation. I take the case of the typical bush worker,, whether miner, fossicker, shearer, or- agricultural labourer. In many cases, the surnames of these men are unknown. They are known to their mates as &#34;Bill,&#34; &#34;Jack,&#34; &#34;Dan,&#34; or &#34;Mick.&#34; They livea nomadic life, and it is very difficult, if not impossible, for them to obtain a cer-  tificate of identification from two persons who have known them for twenty-five years. </para>

              <para>- The difficulty is that those chaps may not always be able to find the honorable member for Darling when they want him. My honorable friend moves about a good deal and is deservedly wellknown, but even he cannot be ubiquitous. I have received a sheaf of letters in reference to old-age pensions, and I propose to read an extract from one that fairly reflects the feeling of the writers of them all. I quote from a letter received from a young friend of mine on the Western Australian gold-fields. He is an enthusiast in regard to this, as well as other, humanitarian measures, and has been very energetic in helping old people to obtain their rights under this law. Speaking of these pioneers, he says - </para>

            <para>The greatest horror of their lives, the haunting fear of their dreams, is that when nature robs them of their physical strength and thus deprives them of their means of independent existence they may be taken away to end their lives in the degrading pauperism of the Old Men&#39;s Home. What gives life some beauty for them, notwithstanding its sombre sordidness - phases only known to those who live the life - has been old-age pensions, the coming of which has been looked forward to by these old men as eagerly as Heaven is looked forward to by the religious enthusiast. But, unhappily, for many, the present prescribed regulations prevent that dream from being realized, and bitterness towards its generators is fast taking the place of gratitude. I have had the pleasure of filling in several forms of application, and it appears to me that in the drafting of them too little thought has been given to the after effects, especially when applied to a country such as this State, with its unsettled roving population. </para>

          <para class="block">I think that the system of Government registration is a little older than that, and has prevailed in Ireland since 1864 ; but, at any rate, it is of comparatively recent origin -  and many are unable to read or write, and are unable to tell their correct age. The clause debarring one obtaining the pension on account of imprisonment savours too much of Sunday school legislation, and is unjust, for thousands have been imprisoned for crimes for which they were innocent, and some for political offences committed in the interests of Democracy. . . The general opinion is that, when any one reaches the ripe age of sixty-five,they have earned the pension, and all the circumlocution contained in the application forms could be overcome by allowing the claimant to make a sworn affidavit, signed by two witnesses, before a justice of the peace, to the effect that he or she was sixty-five, &#38;c. The authorities could investigate the veracity of that statement, and if it were found to be false,a conviction or two would prevent any great infringement of that law. </para>

            <para>. - I thoroughly agree with the honorable member for Coolgardie that we should not go far with the measure this evening, but should have an opportunity to study carefully the proposals of the Government. I shall not discuss the measure at length now, though in Committee I shall have a word or two to say on the subject of naturalization. At this stage I wish to refer to what I regard as an improper omission from the Bill. I regret that the Government does not propose to give to charitable institutions the assistance which they undoubtedly deserve, as suggested by the honorable members for Coolgardie and Fremantle. The hospitals and benevolent asylums, of Victoria at any rate, are not State institutions entirely, and, in most of the States, trie Government contribution is small in relation to the whole expenditure upon the care of the sick, the injured, and the aged. </para>

              <para>- I think that Ministers, especially in view of the representations which have been made to them, should have proposed a similar arrangement under the Commonwealth law. I handed to the Treasurer a carefully written statement, emanating from the managing body of the Castlemaine Benevolent Asylum, which made some very reasonable proposals in regard to the treatment of those who are compelled to enter such institutions. Old men frequently suffer from ailments which, when living alone, they, are unable to treat.  They  have, therefore, <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> intervals, and sometimes for long periods, to seek treatment in charitable institutions. In Victoria the hospitals are not allowed to deal with these cases, so that it is only in benevolent asylums that  they  can obtain the attention which their condition demands. The Act, however, places them on the same footing as prisoners in gaols, except that upon leaving a hospital a person may receive the pension which has accrued to him for a period not exceeding four weeks. </para>

              <para>- These institutions are maintained chiefly by charitable subscriptions, and give charitable relief. We have been extremely careful to differentiate between that and old-age pensions. The Government might have made available part, if not the whole of the, pension, while the pensioner was resident in an asylum or hospital. By not doing so, we will compel those persons to remain outside of such institutions, because they know that inside they will be deprived of many comforts in the way of tobacco and so forth. 1 strongly urge the Government to give further consideration to this matter, with a view to making some provision whereby those who do enter the institutions shall have, at any rate, a portion of the pensions allotted to them. </para>

            <para>.- I should like to impress on the Treasurer and the Attorney-General the points raised by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the -first payment of the pensions. It is, I am sure, a. sincere pleasure to every man here to have the privilege of amending this Act, and righting a very grievous injustice - as it must be regarded, although it was committed inadvertently - to very many of our fellow-citizens, in no sense of the word is this a party measure, and we, therefore, may co-operate with great advantage for the purpose of making it perfect. The Bill must become law before any person can take advantage of the proposed amendment, and it will possibly be a fortnight or more before it passes both Houses. In addition, some weeks may elapse before a person otherwise qualified can become naturalized. The Department of External Affairs is admirably conducted, but, like other Departments, it has its little ways. There are by-paths in which naturalization papers get stowed away ; and, as I say, weeks may elapse before they can be dealt with. It is easy for us to understand how to become naturalized, but those concerned are foreigners, and are the very persons who are least acquainted with the necessary forms. The fact that they have not become naturalized is owing, not only to their love of their own countries, but to their ignorance of our forms; and, as the honorable member for Wide Bay  pointed out, they ought not to be allowed to suffer on that account. If such persons are entitled to pensions, they ought to have them from the day such a Bill as we are now considering would have become law had there been no change of Government. Never mind whether it was right or otherwise for the Government to be changed, the fact is that, for certain party purposes, there has been a change. If there had been no change - if the Deakin or the Fisher Government, for instance, had not gone out of office, or if there had been no parties at all in the House - the Bill would have become law, and these people would not have been called upon to suffer. Section 38 of the principal Act provides that the date of the commencement of a pension shall not be prior to the date of the claim, and I think that that ought to be repealed or amended on lines I shall suggest. </para>

              <para>- We all agree that they ought to have been naturalized, but, in any case, we are prepared to let that pass and give them a chance. Do we desire them to take advantage of the Bill? If so, we ought to give them every opportunity, and I would penalize no man merely because naturalization is a cumbrous and lengthy process, and he is unfamiliar with our forms. I have had personal experience in this matter, and I know that, with every good will in the world, to get naturalization papers issued in a fortnight is quite quick work. I have seen piles of naturalization papers waiting in the Department, though, of course, I have no doubt such is not the case under the present Government. I suggest to the Minister that the amendment I have drafted, though not necessarily in the same words, should be adopted. </para>

              <para>- The point I wish toemphasize is that we ought to enable these people to receive their pensions at the earliest possible moment. There are many points, but I feel that it would be wrong for us to speak as to the full extent we should like to go, because we have no means at our disposal to deal with invalids. No matter how deserving they may be, or how they may have been neglected by&#39; the States, we cannot provide for them until we can make an equitable arrangement with the States which will permit of the Commonwealth having sufficient revenue for the purpose. Whether the proposals indicated in the paper which we decided to print this afternoon, will enable us to do that, I do not know ; but until arrangements are made to place at the disposal of the Commonwealth a larger revenue, we shall be unable to do justice to a class of persons who, as the honorable member for Coolgardie says, deserve it even more than do the aged poor. There is one other matter that I desire to mention. A &#39;few weeks ago, before the Commonwealth &#39;took over the old-age pensions system, I was interviewed by a native of this State who is sixty-seven years of age, and entitled to a  Dension.  He applied for a pension, and his application was granted ; but, owing to his having thoughtlessly inserted in his papers a statement to the effect that he had been working for six months of the year, he was held to be entitled to, I think, only is. per week. Had he not been so neglectful of his interests - had he been loafing for the six months - he would have been entitled to the full pension. That is a glaring anomaly, and, as far as possible, we ought to remedy it. A man who has been industrious is penalized, while the man who does not work reaps a reward for his lack of industry. I cannot conceive of ?ny basis for such a system ; I cannot even conceive of its expediency. I communicated with the Old-age Pensions Department of Victoria, and the officers proved that their decision was right ; but T feel that it is quite wrong to perpetuate such a system. If we desire to save money, we ought to say so; if we have not sufficient money to do justice, we ought not to penalize a man in this way. We might very well make such arrangements as hav&#171; been indicated, in order to do justice to all classes concerned, subject to the means at our disposal. I hope that the Minister will agree to the amendment suggested by the honorable member for Wide Bay, and outlined by me, and also the amendment relating to accumulated wealth and annual earnings. A man ought not to be penalized in respect of income which is the result of personal exertion. If he has received it from an outside source, that is another matter ; but if it is the result of his personal exertion, I cannot conceive of any argument in favour of the perpetuation of such a system. </para>

              <para>- No ; the honorable member used words to the effect that those who opposed the Surplus Revenue 33ill showed that they were opposed to the principle of old-age pensions. It&#39; is to that statement I object. The justification for any other expression is quite a matter of opinion ; but I must strongly object to such a statement. If honorable members of this House since the first Federal Parliament have been unanimous on any question, they have been unanimous- on that of the payment of old-age pensions. </para>

              <para>- Those who opposed the Surplus Revenue Bill did so because, in their opinion, it transgressed one of the principles of the Constitution. That alone was the ground of their opposition to the Bill. If honorable members of the Labour party believed that we had the constitutional right to pass a Surplus Revenue Bill in order to provide for old-age pensions, how will they answer to the people of Australia for their lethargy during the last six or seven years, when ,&#163;6,000,000 were paid to the States, over and above their three- fourths of Customs and Excise revenue, without any attempt to ear-mark those millions for the benefit of the old people of Australia? </para>

              <para>- Why should the honorable member make such a statement as that? May I remind him that there are some distinguished legal gentlemen in the Labour party. Where is there a man of greater legal experience than the ex- Attorney-General, the honorable member for West Sydney? Then, again, there is the honorable member for Werriwa. I wish to point out, fur-  ther, that when the honorable member for Hume, as Treasurer in the Deakin Government, introduced and moved the second reading of the Surplus Revenue Bill, he mentioned the purposes for which the surplus revenue was to be appropriated and held in trust ; but he said nothing about appropriating one penny for old-age pensions. I have here the report of his speech on the motion for the second reading, and find that although he mentioned harbor defences and other public works for which it was proposed to provide in that way, he said nothing of an intention on the part of the Government to devote one penny of the surplus revenue so obtained to an oldage pensions fund. Not one penny was to be so used, unless we are to assume - and we have no right to do so - that the Treasurer had some secret intention of putting aside moneys for that purpose. We are sure that he had no such secret purpose. He would have been delighted to mention it to the House if it had occurred to him then, that the surplus revenue was to be used for such a purpose. I have not read the report of the whole debate on that Bill ; but I shall be glad if any honorable member will draw my attention to one word uttered during the consideration of the Bill by this House, reminding the Treasurer that the surplus revenue should be put to such a purpose. </para>

              <para>-I am coming to the motion in regard to old-age pensions moved by the honorable member for Wide Bay. It may. be that during the debate on the Surplus Revenue Bill, some one mentioned it. If any honorable member did, he deserves credit for it. But either honorable members of the Labour party thought we had the constitutional right to put aside these moneys, or theydid not. If they did not think we had the constitutional right to do it, then they were in the same position as I was, and we are equally to blame for having a wrong opinion. If they did think we had the constitutional right to do it, they slumbered on it, and allowed enormous sums of money to which we were entitled, beyond the three-quarters due to the States, to be handed over to the States, instead of being devoted to the payment of old-age pensions for Australia. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member may be perfectly right in that view. I have not considered the matter. On the second reading of the Bill the then Treasurer, the honorable member for Hume, pointed out that we had paid over to the States a sum of &#163;5,728,000 in excess of the amount which we were legally entitled to pay. There seemed to be a general impression, rightly or wrongly, that we could not use the power which was brought to light in connexion with that Bill. If it was an error, it was a general error, or I feel sure that honorable members, who were all desirous of passing that measure, would have taken this step long before. To show that it was an afterthought, the Treasurer never mentioned oldage pensions in moving the second reading of the Surplus Revenue Bill, so that at the time he had no idea of making use of the Surplus Revenue Account for that purpose. </para>

However, whether he did or not, it was a very good thing, in the light of what we know now, that he did put such a question ; but, as a matter of fact, we have all apparently laboured under a delusion in regard to the matter for a long space of time. In the very session in which the Old-age Pensions Act was passed into law, the honorable member for Wide Bay, who is now leading the Opposition, took advantage of a formal motion to go into Committee of Supply on &#34; Grievance Day &#34; to move an amendment on the subject. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 19th March, 1908, page 9300, shows that the honorable member moved - </para>

All I say is that the honorable member for Dalley moved that the matter should be given effect to &#34;this session,&#34; and that the honorable member for Newcastle, in moving a further amendment, explained that it was impossible to do it &#34;this session.&#34; In spite of the honorable member for Newcastle&#39;s statement, the Bill became law that session. </para>

              <para>- My only reason for rising was to point out that it is grossly unfair to endeavour to put any honorable member into the position of seeming to oppose oldage pensions because he had an opinion as to the constitutional effect of a certain measure which was of a new character. There is no necessity for those unfounded imputations ; but I have already heard of statements made in different States about honorable members in this House being opposed to old-age pensions. It is a mean way of political fighting <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> bear false witness in that fashion against honorable members, and I say to those who rely on the principle of the Surplus Revenue Act that the responsibility lies with them,, because if we had the right to pass that measure, it ought to have been exercised some time before. </para>

            <para>. - The Surplus Revenue Act had the effect of appropriating very largely for the purpose of old-age pensions money which previously had been given to the States, but which they were not entitled to under what is known as the Braddon section. A number of honorable members thought it desirable to provide for the&#39; payment of old-age pensions by appropriating the unexpended fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue belonging to the Commonwealth,instead of the money being returned to the States, as had been done previously ; and it was on that point that a division of opinion arose. Whatever might have been in the minds of those who opposed the Surplus Revenue Bill, they did not suggest that the scheme of old-age pensions could be advanced in any other way. In fact, up to that time, the WhOle cry against the provision of old-age pensions was, not that honorable members were opposed to the principle, but that they could not see how  the scheme could be financed under the conditions which then obtained. That was the position which was put to the House; but when it was discovered that, in the course of eight years, the Commonwealth had paid back to the&#34; States, ^6,500,000 over and above the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they were constitutionally entitled, it was considered that the time had arrived when the House should take some action with respect to that surplus revenue. The members of the Labour party deemed that the best use to which it could be put was to appropriate it for the purpose of old-age pensions, and also for the purpose of more efficient defence ; hence action was taken to have the Surplus Revenue Bill passed. Those who opposed its passage did so very largely on constitutional grounds. There was a big outcry made in the States against its enactment. The supporters of the measure were charged by the Premier of New South Wales with being &#34;political burglars;&#34; with taking away from the States money to which they were justly entitled. Since then, the States have had the opportunity of appealing to the highest tribunal in the land as to what were, and what were not, their rights. The Federal High Court told the States in no unmistakable language that this Parliament was quite within its rights in appropriating the surplus revenue as it did. It was because we made that appropriation that we were able to place on the statute-book a great humanitarian measure, providing for Commonwealth oldage pensions. I have been reminded that the honorable member for Flinders, who is a very learned authority on these matters, quite agreed with the members of the Labour party as to the legality of the action which was then taken, but opposed the passing of the Bill for other reasons. There is no need to debate that phase of the question now, as it has been settled, and those who were in doubt as to the constitutionality of the appropriation have had their doubts set at rest by an authoritative decision of the High Court. </para>

              <para>- If the Surplus Revenue Bill had not been passed, there could not have been any legislation on old-age pensions to-day. The Parliament would have been in the old position of not being able to finance the scheme. So far as could be ascertained, there was no desire on the part of the States to come to its aid in the direction of dealing with the subject from the Commonwealth rather than from the State stand-point. That is the position which the House has to face on the present occasion. Whatever may have been the opinion of some honorable members with respect to the Surplus &#39;Revenue Bill when it was being considered here, the members of the  .Labour  partywere animated at that time by the desire to give to the Commonwealth the principle of old-age pensions, and they took the course which seemed to them best calculated to secure that object. Our present position demonstrates amply and fully that the course which we then favoured and took was the correct one, and has resulted in giving, to the Commonwealth the system of old-age pensions, which otherwise it could not have had at the present time. The position in which we now find ourselves is rather a strange commentary on some utterances we have read in the press from members of the Ministry during the last two or three weeks. In New South Wales, at every week-end, we were favoured with an interview which set out the position of the Government, and which was far from complimentary to the Labour party. </para>

He came here to-day and threw upon the table of.  the House the manuscript of what purported to be a Bill. The Bill was only placed in our hands, hot from the printing press, after the dinner adjournment, and, of course, after its second reading had been moved. Still, we are told that there was no delay. We were told a little while ago by the Treasurer that it was expected that some other business would have occupied the time of the House, and that that was the reason for his unpreparedness. For three weeks we have been debating a motion of no-confidence. </para>

              <para>-That is for the right honorable member to say. The business on the notice-paper included the resumption of the debate on the AddressinReply to the Governor-General&#39;s speech, and the debate on the Ministerial Statement. The probabilities are that, despite the representations which the Government have been making through the press that those Orders of the Day ought not to be debated, they expected them to be discussed, and were not ready to proceed with the business which they had in hand. I wonder what position the House would have found itself in if Ministers had not had some inheritance from their predecessors to fall back upon. This Bill was placed on the stocks a month ago by the Labour Ministry, and the idea was that it should be dealt with before the beginning of the present financial year, so that certain persons who will be benefited under its operation might receive that benefit from the date of the proclamation of the principal Act. If the Government had not had this Bill upon which to fall back, it seems to me that they would have been completely stranded this afternoon. I maintain that a measure of its importance ought to have been further advanced than it was. If there were anything in the arguments which have been put forward by the Minister of Defence in Sydney during the past few weeks, the Treasurer ought not to have found himself in the position that he did this afternoon. </para>

              <para>- The circumstance merri y goes to show how hollow were the  protestations  of the Government that they desired to proceed with public business, and were being delayed by the censure debate. There are two or three points connected with this Bill which, in my judgment, are worthy of consideration. I trust that the Treasurer will give them his attention, so that when we reach Committee we shall not have to fight them as strenuously as we might otherwise have to do. Most of the provisions of the measure are mere machinery proposals, which are designed to overcome the difficulties which have been encountered in the application of the principal Act. But the amendments of sections 16 and 17 of that Act are of farreaching importance. In those sections the questions of naturalization and of a reduction in the residential qualification of aprplicants for old-age pensions are dealt with. In New South Wales particularly there has been a considerable discussion upon the question of naturalization, and a large measure of injustice has been inflicted upon a number of deserving residents by the provisions of the State Oldage Pensions Act which formerly operated. When that measure was under consideration&#39; in the New South Wales Parliament, I objected to the provision that a person must be naturalized for ten years before he was eligible to receive a pension, and I privately interviewed <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See, who was in charge of the Bill upon that subject. But, finding that he and his Government were strongly opposed to any reduction in the residential qualification, I was compelled to allow it to pass, rather than to jeopardize the safety of the measure. In the principal Act that period has been reduced to three years, and the proposal in this Bill is to enable that provision to operate straight away in certain circumstances. It is well known that in New South Wales - particularly in the early days - persons were attracted thither from all parts of the world by mining discoveries. They made their homes there, and contributed largely to the development of the State. But, owing to the fact that legal assistance was required to enable them to take out naturalization papers, a number of these miners were not eligible to receive a pension under the New South Wales law. Quite recently I received communications from some of these individuals - whom I have known from my youth upwards - asking me whether, under this Bill, they would be able to secure pensions. 1 replied that they would have to be naturalized for a period of three years, but that the late Government proposed to remove even that embargo. In some instances I was asked to advise whether applications should be lodged, in anticipation of the Bill becoming law. I told them that I did not think it was necessary to adopt that course, because in this Bill, I assumed, special provision had been made to meet such cases. For that reason I think that provision should be made in this measure to meet the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition in favour of claimants with a twenty years&#39; qualification being paid from 1st July. I do not foresee the difficulties which the Treasurer apparently foresees in this connexion. An almost analogous piece of legislation was enacted in New South Wales in connexion with the Land Act of 1895. Prior to that time unnaturalized persons could acquire land under the settlement conditions which then obtained. But that Act provided that these special provisions should be limited to British subjects and to those who had become naturalized. To overcome the difficulty which was apparent provision was made that the Land Board might satisfy itself that the claimant had lodged an application for naturalization with the proper authorities. I do not see why the same principle should not apply to these provisions, and if persons who are not naturalized now, but who are qualified by twenty years&#39; residence in the Commonwealth, make application for naturalization at the same time as they apply for the pensions, I do not see why they should be debarred from participating in the benefits of this legislation. I commend that suggestion to the Treasurer as one which, if adopted, would have the effect of placing a number of very deserving people upon a fair footing. </para>

              <para>- I do not see why it should not date from the 1st July. A number of applications for pensions have only been lodged, and are still subject to consideration; and a number of other persons who would have liked to lodge applications were debarred from doing so by reason of the provisions of the Act. When they sought for advice from the administrators of the Act, they were informed that under its terms they were debarred from participation, inasmuch as they had to show three years&#39; clear natural ization. Only yesterday I answered a letter from a miner whom I know very well, and who has been in this country forty or fifty years. He became naturalized about twelve months ago. He asked me whether he could lodge an application for an oldage pension now. I consulted with the authorities administering the Act, and had to write to tell him that under its provisions he had to be naturalized for a period of three years. But I also informed him that an amending Bill was in contemplation, and that as soon as it was passed, I hoped to be in a position to inform him that he could lodge an application. The Leader of the Labour party, and those who are supporting him, are asking that such men should not be penalized because of the provisions of the principal Act; but that they be allowed to lodge applications for naturalization now, or within twelve months, and then have the right to participate in the old-age pensions legislation from the 1st July last. The same principle applies to the reduction of the term of residence, except that it affects a wider area. </para>

              <para>- I am speaking on behalf of those who have been debarred under present legislation from applying on account of failure to naturalize, or because of their age. I contend that those who make application as soon as this Bill becomes law should have the pensions dated from the 1st July. Those who neglect to apply, say for three months, or even for a month, deserve to suffer for their neglect. I do not think that a person who applies in August, September, or October should have the right to have his application dated back. I am appealing on behalf of those who were debarred from applying on the 1st July, on account of the provisions in the principal Act regarding naturalization and the term of residence. As soon as this Bill passes, those people should be allowed to lodge their applications, as they would have done had their cases been provided for in the principal Act; and they should have the benefit of the pensions from the 1st July. </para>

              <para>- That is not ari argument against the application of the principle that I am urging. The honorable member may think that these persons are lucky to be able to apply for pensions at all. I was, at the outset, one of those who took part in the movement in favour of granting old-age pensions in the State from which I come. While the principle of this legislation does not meet with much objection now, at that time we were told that we were proposing to pauperize the community. All sorts of objections were raised. Those who had to bear the burden of the struggle know how severe it was, and how very timid leading politicians were about touching the subject at all. After the fight has been won, those who secure the pensions may consider themselves lucky ; but if some members of Parliament had not been progressive and prepared to put up a good fight in favour of social legislation, such enactments would not have been passed. </para>

              <para>- I am glad that they do not. The history of the movement only shows that some leaders of popular thought are very much at sea when they come to deal with wide humanitarian legislation. Those who come after are always ready to tell those who fought for a reform in its initial stages that they would have supported it from the beginning. Two points that were raised by the honorable member for Coolgardie are worthy of consideration. One is as to what are to be the conditions relating to the furnishing of witnesses who will certify to having known the applicant to be a resident of the Commonwealth for the period of twenty years. The second is with respect to the provision requiring that the applicant shall supply a birth certificate, or shall be in a position to prove that his age is what it is certified to be. Under the operation of the New South Wales Act, a great number of very deserving people were shut out from the benefits of the legislation because of their inability to comply with those requirements. Without particularizing, I might refer to one case which recently came under my notice. The applicant <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> a native of the State of New South Whales, and because in the early dais there <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> no State registration of births, and the registration records of little country churches were very often destroyed as of little value, this man could not furnish a birth certificate. He could not discover any of the people who were alive -when he was born, some sixty-five years before, and so was unable to supply the evidence which the Old-age Pensions Board required to satisfy them as to his age. He was, on that account, deprived of the benefits of the Act. </para>

              <para>- Yes, altogether too much red-tape. In many cases the members of the Board were perfectly satisfied that the applicants were over the prescribed age, but because they could not produce documentary evidence that they were, they were locked out. Equal difficulty arose in procuring certificates of knowledge that applicants had lived in the State for the prescribed time. As honorable members are aware, miners stay only a few years in one place. They are continually moving about, all over the Commonwealth, and they find it very difficult to discover people whom they knew in the olden days. I have known claimants for these pensions to go to considerable expense, in making inquiries, to secure the evidence of age and identification required. I remember one very hard case which came under my notice in New South Wales. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> may say that at first the administration of the State Act was very much more liberal than it afterwards became. A few years ago, when there was a call for retrenchment, the records of many persons who were drawing old-age pensions were looked up, and they were asked to furnish evidence of identification. In the case to which I refer, the authorities, on searching the records, decided that the pensioner had been improperly paid his pension for three years, and they asked for a refund of the money paid. The Department contended that he was not the agehe said he was when he made his application. I asked the man about his claim,and he told me that when he came into the State he was seventeen years of age. The authorities claimed that, according to the shipping returns furnished, he was nineteen years of age when he entered the State. I looked through the papers, and found that his age on entering the State was marked in figures, and it was a toss-up whether the figures were seventeen or nineteen - as the last figure might have been a seven or a nine. The Department de- cided that it was a nine, although the man said that he was informed by his parents that when he landed here he was seventeen years of age. and he had been accustomed to reckoning his age on that information. The Department decided that in the circumstances the pension had been paid to him for three years improperly, and they required a refund of the payments. Such strictness in the interpretation of the law should not be permitted to enter into the administration of humanitarian legislation of this kind. The case to which I refer arose out of a cry for retrenchment by a Government that claimed that their predecessors had been extravagant, and I have indicated one of the ways in which they set about retrenchment. In the administration of an Old-age Pensions Act regard should first be had to the need of the applicant for assistance, and, secondly, to a reasonable compliance with the provisions as to age and residence in the State. If there is a reasonable compliance with those provisions, there should not be too much red-tape introduced in requiring a certificate of birth in cases in which it is very often impossible to produce such a certificate, or a sworn declaration of continuous knowledge of an applicant for a period of twenty-five years. I have very much pleasure in complimenting the Government in taking up the good work of their predecessors. I hope that this amending measure will shortly find a place on the statute-book of the Commonwealth, as I am sure it will confer a great deal of benefit on a large number of very deserving people. </para>

            <para>.- The Bill before us is intended to amend the Invalids and Old-age Pensions Act of 1908. I have looked through it, and find that it contains practically two principles. One is in regard to procedure, delegating power to a Deputy Commissioner. No member on either side is in a position to claim credit for this proposal, or to make it the subject of debate for party purposes. Then it is proposed to limit the time for naturalization, and to reduce the residence qualification from twenty-five to twenty years. I take it that the latter proposal is submitted to bring our Old-age Pensions Act into uniformity with the law in Queensland. </para>

              <para>- The residence qualification under the New South Wales Act is twenty-five years, and I have always thought that too long. In discussing the Bill honorable members have made certain suggestions. The honorable member for Coolgardie, with a good deal of warmth, and with what at first blush appeared to be a good deal of force, suggested that section 47 of the existing Act should be amended. It provides that pensions shall not be paid to inmates of charitable institutions and benevolent asylums. It does not at first appear unreasonable to suggest that pensions should be given to inmates of charitable institutions who are otherwise qualified to receive them, but on reflection I think it would be a most dangerous thing for this House to allow. I shall give my reasons for using that language in regard to the suggestion. One of the principal reasons urged for the establishment of oldage pensions was that their payment would enable old people to avoid the barrack system in force in asylums and similar charitable institutions. In the early days of the advocacy of oldage pensions it was urged, with much force, that it was cruel and inhuman that our unfortunate old people should be placed in asylums, like so many cattle. It was contended that the barrack system should notbe permitted to continue. In many asylums husband and wife are separated, and it was urged that the payment of old-age pensions would enable old people to avoid the barrack system, and to live in a civilized manner. It was contended, also, that the upkeep of these benevolent asylums represented a great charge on the various States. The honorable member for Coolgardiehas failed to recognise that, unfortunately, the greater portion of the funds contributed by the charitable public for the building and maintenance of these benevolent asylums is used for the payment of officers&#39; fees. In many cases the unfortunate inmates have to accept a reduced dietary scale, to meet the expenditure in wages paid to officials. That is what happens when charity is not properly regulated. The public subscribe money for the benefit of those in benevolent institutions, but the funds thus provided are spent mostly on official administration. It seems to me that we might well say that the pensioners, male and female, may live where they like. I would not restrict their freedom in this respect, but I certainly would not hand over pension money to those controlling charitable institutions. I say that if pensioners like to live within the walls of charitable institutions, they should be paid their pensions just as if they were living outside. It is no concern of ours where they live, or what they do with their money. I cannot understand the Labour- party saying, &#34;We are the authors of old-age pensions legislation. Other honorable members have had nothing to do with it.&#34; Surely they are not going to make capital out of the destitution of their fellow beings. </para>

              <para>- I cannot be twitted with having opposed old-age pensions, in either this or the State Parliament. I did what I could to forward the cause long before it was a popular one. But I take no credit for that.  An objection to the Bill is that, like the Act, it is improperly branded. It is called the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill, although the provisions relating to invalids are not to come into force until a proclamation has been issued. If the Labour party wishes to do what is right, it should see that its legislation is correctly branded. There are many in this community who, by reason of accident or birth, suffer infirmities, such as blindness, which entitle them to public assistance, irrespective of their age. But it is a mockery to call these measures, which give them no assistance at all, &#34;Invalid Pensions&#34;, legislation. </para>

              <para>- That is so. It has been said that those who voted against the Surplus Revenue Bill were opposed to the payment of old-age pensions.. I supported and voted for the measure, because I have always been ready to do what I could to make provision for the payment of pensions. But the Labour party must admit that it might have discovered eighteen months earlier how to make this provision. The States have done very well out of the Commonwealth, but it was only during the operation of the bookkeeping section of the Constitution that we were compelled to return all surplus, in addition to the threefourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, and I am sorry that since then the surplus has not been ear-marked. If it had been, there now would be ^6,000,000 to the credit of the Commonwealth, a sum which would cover two-thirds of the value of the transferred properties. </para>

The honorable member submitted a motion on &#34; Grievance Day,&#34; and, as already said, I moved an amendment to that motion. It was suggested that there was a sting in the amendment, but, so far as I am personally concerned, it was moved without collusion with any honorable member. I suggested to the honorable member for Parramatta, when he was combating the state- ment made by the honorable member for Wide Bay, that he ought to submit a motion himself to effect the purpose, my only desire being to see it accomplished.

          <para class="block">It was the opinion contained in that last interjection which caused me to move an amendment in order to clinch the matter. The honorable member for Wide Bay was submitting a motion as a mandate to the Government, asserting that old-age pensions were within the Constitution, he not caring for any financial difficulty ; and I simply moved the amendment. But the Labour party, apparently, consider the exigencies of party government of superior concern; and I am pleased to say that, although they opposed my amendment, the Bill itself was carried that, session. I have no desire to dwell on the matter, but merely to place the facts on record. I have heard honorable members opposite take credit for this legislation ; but surely there is not a single honorable member who would not take a generous view in regard to the treatment of the aged poor. Surely no man is so bereft of political capital that he has to fall back on questions such as this ! I am pleased that the Government have introduced an amending Bill ; and I desire to say here that, if the Labour party are so very concerned as to the aged and infirm, I cannot understand how a Labour Ministry could allow such regulations as were issued under the principal Act. These regulations emanated not from a Conservative Ministry, but from a Labour Ministry ; and how a Labour Minister of Home Affairs could allow such a proclamation to go broadcast </para>

For . instance, there is the question as to where a claimant&#39;s children are or what has become of them.

              <para>- Some were not. As I have already said I have no wish to dwell on the matter, beyond saying that if the Opposition desire to do a good act on behalf of the unfortunates of Australia they will seek to simplify these regulations. The minds of those who have struggled and have not been treated too well by the world, are not very keen or alert; and it is certain that they would find it absolutely impossible to answer nine-tenths of . the questions. In some cases it would be. most painful to applicants to seek outside assistance in such a matter; and on the ground of humanity their personal feelings ought to be considered. The whole object of the regulations should be to prevent collusion or fraud, and they ought to be simplified. If these regulations had been issued by the present Prime Minister or the Treasurer there would have been an outcry on platforms throughout Australia about the Conservative class putting indignities and burdens on the unfortunate poor. It may be, perhaps, that the exPrime Minister was busy, and allowed the regulations to go through because it would be hard to believe that, if he had given any attention to them, they would have been issued. This is a simple measure of procedure - I am thoroughly in accord with it; and if the principal Act can be amended on more liberal lines no one will be more anxious than myself for the early proclamation of the coming into operation of the sections dealing with invalid pensions. </para>

            <para>.- I am glad of the opportunity to make an effort to liberalize the Invalid and Oldage Pensions Act. When the honorable member for Dalley referred to the scope of the Bill as not being very wide, I said that I would submit an amendment which would have the effect of bringing the invalid sections of the principal Act into operation at once; and I may say that  I  tabled that amendment before the honorable member rose to speak, so that he will have an opportunity, of voting on that and other points. The right honorable member for East Sydney sought to fasten some blame on the Leader of the Labour party, because the idea of a Surplus Revenue Bill had not suggested itself to him sooner, but, as I interjected, the right honorable member might as well throw blame on George Stephenson for not having invented the locomotive before he did. I wish now to refer to the point which has been raised as to whether or not those who voted against tlie Surplus Revenue Bill believed that, in doing so, they were voting against old-age pensions. I find that the honorable member for Flinders,  a  very eminent lawyer, in the course of the debate on the motion for the second reading of that measure, said that, in his opinion, it was entirely within the limits of the Constitution. According to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> page 9865, on the 31st March, 1908, he said - </para>

But I do not regard this proposal in that light.

              <para>- The right honorable member .knows that the honorable member for Hume, who introduced the Bill, is not the most fluent of speakers, and does not always put his case as well as it might be put. But it was mentioned by the Leader of the Labour party when he rose in this House that that was one of the objects of the Bill. As  to the measure now before us, I may say at once that I shall support those provisions which will tend to liberalize the principal Act, and that I shall endeavour to extend them. On the other hand, I shall vote against some of its provisions, which would, in my opinion, contract the few liberal sections of the principal Act. I agree with those who say that naturalized citizens who become entitled to pensions should receive them as from 1 st July, and that the same treatment should be extended to those who come within the twenty years&#39; residence clause. The pertinent objection has been raised that such persons might not apply for six months or twelve months after the passing of the Act, and that under such proposed amendment, their pensions would date back to 1st July. My contention, however, is that a three months&#39; limit might well be fixed. One month&#39;s notice is far too short. Australia is so large a territory that more than a month&#39;s notice is necessary to enable residents of all parts of the continent to become acquainted with these provisions, and three months is the shortest possible notice that we could fairly give. Those who apply for pensions within three months from the date of the passing of this Act should have their pensions ante-dated to 1st July. The honorable member for West Sydney referred to a grievance for which we might well provide a remedy. He pointed out that a person who had been working for six months preceding his application would have his&#39; pension so reduced that for the rest of the year he would be entitled to only about one shilling per week. The Old-age Pensions Act is designed to meet the immediate needs of those who apply for pensions, but if it is declared that those who have been earning something during the six months prior to their application shall have a corresponding reduction made in their pensions for the rest of the year, we shall not carry out the spirit of the Act. I should also like to see the age at which a person may receive an old-age pension reduced to sixty years. The &#39;Commonwealth Public Service Act provides for the retirement of public servants at from sixty to sixty-five years of age, and it is well known that those who have been engaged in the most laborious work, and have been in receipt of the lowest rates of wages, are more likely to be retired at sixty years of age than at sixty-five. If men who have been receiving the lowest rates of wages are retired at the age of sixty years, they will be left practically destitute for five years. And so with some of the State public servants. I have in mind more particularly the employes of the Railway and Tramway Department of New South Wales. Under the State Railways Act, &#39; the employes have to retire on reaching the age of sixty years, and I know of numerous cases in which the lower paid men, who are compelled to retire at that age, would be practically destitute for the five years during which they would have to wait for Commonwealth old-age pensions. Oh their retirement from the service &#39;they are too old to turn their attention to other avenues of employment, and they would not be retired if they were able to follow&#39; their usual avocations. In the circumstances, therefore, I think that the Act should operate so automatically as to apply to persons of sixty years of age who are not able to earn a livelihood. I am also of opinion that a person who is incapacitated from earning a livelihood should become entitled to a pension on reaching the age of fifty-five years. I have &#39; given notice of amendments covering these points. I have also given notice of my intention to move an amendment which will provide for the immediate payment of invalid pensions. The Government might well show its adherence to progressive principles by agreeing to so reasonable an amendment. Another point that I wish to bring before honorable members is that the proofs that applicants for pensions have to present in support of their claims should be less stringent than they are. An applicant should not be compelled to present declarations by persons who have known him personally for twenty years. It should be sufficient to provide that an applicant shall prove to the reasonable satisfaction of a common-sense individual that he has been resident in Australia for the specified time, and that he is of the age at which he is entitled to draw a pension. I am in perfect agreement with the honorable member for Dalley regarding the payment of old-age pensions to charitable institutions and asylums. It would not be wise to enable them to collect the money due to old-age pensioners. If the pensioner likes to board and lodge at any particular place, that is his business; but the pension should be payable to him direct, and not to institutions on his behalf. Consequently, if an amendment is proposed which raises that point, unless something very strong can be adduced in its- support, I shall feel compelled to vote in the direction I have indicated. I quite agree as to the necessity of liberalizing the forms of application and the questions submitted to the applicants. I raised that point in the party to which I belong, and asked why regulations so stringent, and questions apparently so needlessly searching, were framed. I was told that the Act prescribed that certain regulations shall come into force, and necessitated certain questions being asked, and that the framers of the regulations were powerless, in face of the provisions of the Act. I hope we shall be allowed a little time after the second reading is carried to consider the regulations and the questions thereunder, with a view, if necessary, to so amend the&#39; principal Act that the questions can be simplified, and the regulations made much easier to  work, and to enable applicants to prove their claims. We have an opportunity, now that this Bill is before the House, of considerably liberalizing the principal Act, and showing not only Australia, but all the world, that the Commonwealth Parliament is prepared to deal fairly with its old people, and to carry out the Scriptural idea by indicating, at least as regards our aged citizens, that every man in Australia is his brother&#39;s keeper. </para>

            <para>.- If is pretty clearly understood in the House, and I hope will be understood by the country generally, that if there is any blame for delay in dealing with&#39; the old people&#39;, and granting them pensions, it is due to the influence of the State Rights idea; because, very early iti the history of the Commonwealth, as <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> records, the honorable member for Darwin asked <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton if he could not use the surplus revenue, which was then being largely given to the States, for paying old-age pensions. The reply was that the Government could not do so, and that the money had to be paid over to the States. Honorable members will remember the great care that was taken by the then -Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, to consider the interests of the States, so that the State Rights&#39; idea is the cause of the delay in paying old-age pensions. The point I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer has&#39; been already mentioned ; but I wish him to look into the point whether the principal Act makes- &#39;it&#39; mandatory that the particular questions asked, arid the line of examination &#39;adopted; should be as set forth in the regulations, or if it is within the power of the Minister to alter the regulations, and how far they can be altered to meet the circumstances which I intend to mention. There is a. big difference between those who will be- claimants under the Commonwealth Act . and those dealt with under the State Acts. Under the Victorian State Act, an applicant had to be resident for twenty years, and under the New South Wales Act for twenty-five years, within the borders of the particular State, and that very limitation made it easier to get the necessary evidence to prove residence within a State than it can be in the case of those who have been shut out of the provisions of the State Acts by having  resided in more than one State.  This is the stage at which to call . attention to these facts. A very large number of those with whom I have been connected for many years - men who are generally called bushmen - not only travel very much, but have resided but a short time in any one place. Think of the trouble that they would have in getting any evidence at all. </para>

              <para>- It applies particularly to miners, and even more to those connected with the pastoral industry. Many of the latter are frequently known by different names. That is not anything to be ashamed of, for sometimes, in connexion with the pastoral industry, a man has secured what is called a stand, and perhaps his mate or some one else that he knows goes and takes his place, with the consent of the employer. Sometimes the name is changed; but at other times it may not be. Men are often known only by nicknames. Some men have names tacked on to them, and do not take the trouble to tell anybody their real names ; and in another place the\ may have other nicknames. The whole question of dealing with those w&#39;ho are now coming under the Old-age Pensions Act is surrounded with difficulties; and I am afraid that officers who have only had experience of a State law have, when drafting the regulations and questions, overlooked the difficulties associated with the administration of Commonwealth pensions. Another difficulty is that of proof of age. I know df a good many cases where there is great difficulty in getting sufficient evidence in connexion with the State pensions. There was no registration at all in New South Wales until it obtained responsible govern ment, and even since registration was established, the births of an immense number of children have never been registered. If the Ministry intend to adhere strictly to the forms that are to be filled in, they will debar many of those for whom the Act was intended from securing that to which they are entitled, and through no fault of their own. They are asked to produce that which it is impossible to get, because it does not exist - the register of their birth. These points should be looked into. </para>

              <para>- They should be looked into now, so that any amendment&#39;. which are necessary in the principal Act may be drafted &#39;*and proposed before this Bill goes through Committee. I make this appeal on behalf of the pioneers, who really deserve pensions more than do any other class in the Commonwealth, because they have done a great deal of rough pioneering work. Many of them, for instance, have opened mining fields. All  these men, have, by the very nature of their occupation, been confronted with difficulties which render it practically impossible for them to comply with the regula-_ tions under the Act. It should not be very &#39; difficult, however, to make it possible for magistrates to receive reasonable evidence as to the age of a claimant. I suggest that a very wide latitude should be allowed to the magistrates, so that in dealing with evidence they may be guided by a sense of equity, and not by any technicality. I feel sure that whatever Government may be in power, it will administer the law, not with a view to trying to read seven into nine, as indicated by the case referred to by the honorable member for Calare, but rather with a view to give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant, and to say that the seven is nine, so long as the friend concerned has sworn that, to the best of his knowledge, the claimant is of the prescribed age. In a great many cases, the sworn declaration of a person as to his age is accepted as sufficient evidence. When a claimant under this law submits evidence that he is a respectable person of the prescribed age, it should be received. It will be somewhat rare, I think, to find a case where two friends can honestly certify that they have known the claimant for twenty years, simply owing to the fact that he may have resided for a few years in one State, and the rest of the time in other parts of the </para>

          <para class="block">Commonwealth. How can any two friends of a man, unless they take his word, say whether or not he has been in the Commonwealth for the whole period of twenty years ? If a magistrate has to depend upon the filling up of two forms by two friends, a claimant will not be able to find any two friends who could honestly discharge that duty. In the desire to help some person who they, feel was deserving of an old-age pension, friends might be tempted to say that they had known him for twenty years, and, therefore, the document would not be so valuable as it ought to be. I ask the Treasurer to see that there is sufficient elasticity in the law to enable the officers to draft regulations which will meet such cases as I have been referring to. Otherwise, I am satisfied that only a very small percentage of the deserving nomadic class will be able to comply with the conditions. Surely the right honorable gentleman must realize that otherwise claimants will not be able to adduce the necessary evidence. We have not yet had sufficient experience of cases before magistrates to realize the difficulties which many claimants will have to surmount. I feel certain that, so far, not more than a small number of such cases as I have been dealing with have occurred. </para>

              <para>- The position of a claimant under a State Act is utterly different from what it will be under the Federal law. Surely the Treasurer can understand that under a State Act a claimant has only to prove that he has resided within its boundaries for twenty years. In Victoria a man has no difficulty in proving that he has been a resident for that period, because he has never at any time been far removed from some friends. . </para>

              <para>- Surely the right honorable gentleman knows the provisions of the Federal law better than his remark implies. The object of that Bill is to meet the cases of men who have resided in the Commonwealth for twenty years. Take the case of a man who has lived for different periods in various States. No two friends of that person can honestly say that they have known where he has lived during the whole of that period. One man may know that he lived for a certain period in Victoria, and another that he resided for a time in New South Wales. </para>

              <para>- I am sure that the Treasurer&#39;s officers will tell him that in very many cases no two friends of a claimant can swear to the fact that he has resided in the Commonwealth for twenty years, simply because they have not been following his movements during that period. Suppose, for instance, that one friend has been domiciled in Victoria, and that the claimant has been travelling all over Australia during twenty years. How can he honestly swear that the claimant has resided within the limits of the Commonwealth for that period ? It is absolutely ridiculous to require a declaration of that kind. </para>

All persons who have been claimants under a State Act are transferred, and the evidence given to the State authorities will be accepted by the Commonwealth, officers. It is the cases of those who are not qualified by residence in one State for twenty years which we have particularly to consider. I do not know what instructions have been given to the magistrates who will be charged with the administration of this Act. If they are to be allowed a reasonable degree of latitude the difficulty which I have mentioned may be met. I think that the Treasurer might well agree to adopt the suggestion of the honorable member for Wide Bay by permitting persons with a twenty years&#39; residential qualification, . but who may not yet have registered their claims, receiving the advantages of the old-age pensions as from the ist July. The alteration would not involve a large sum, and it would constitute a graceful act on the part of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>. - :My view is that the Invalid and Old Age Pensions Act, which we passed last year with the extensions which are proposed in this Bill, will by no means represent the last word that is to be said upon this question. Personally, I am in favour of universal old-age pensions, and believe that until we get them we shall not meet the real necessities of the case, nor deal out even-handed justice. </para>

              <para>- That. is my own view. That being so, I&#39; shall vote for every liberalising amendment which may be submitted. There is one point to which I wish to direct special attention, namely, the desirableness of including residents of Papua within the scope of the Bill. I ask the Treasurer to look into this question be* fore the House meets to-morrow, with a view to seeing whether he cannot support an amendment which I desire to effect. in&#62; the interpretation section of the principal Act. When I was recently in Papua this matter was brought under my notice by a deputation, and also by the Governor, whoexpressed the hope&#34; that when the principalAct was amended the disability to which I have referred would be removed. As honorable members are aware, Papua is a Territory of the Commonwealth. Practically alf its white residents are Australians, and irc the natural order of things most of them will return to their homes before very longIt would be a distinct injustice to exclude 0them from participating in the benefits conferred by this Bill, seeing that they are assisting in the development of one of our own territories. All our public offices there are filled by Australians. . We invite applications for positions In the Possession, and as we appoint public officers from the Commonwealth to administer its affairs, it is obviously unjust to debar them from becoming eligible to receive old-age pensions. Whilst I was in the Possession I promised to move in this matter. I have no doubt that the Government will agree to my suggestion. I shall also endeavour to remove from the principal Act one of its worst blots - I refer to the provision which excludes Asiatics from becoming recipients of old-age pensions merely because they are Asiatics. If we admit them to full citizenship we are doing an absolutely contemptible thing by excluding them from the right to obtain a pension merely because they are Asiatics. I hope that in Committee the principal Act will be so amended as to remove this blot. </para>

              <para>- That is quite another thing. To show how courteous honorable members on this side have been, let me say that when the Supply Bill was being1, discussed at the request of the Leader of the Opposition, and because an arrangement had been made and agreed to between the leaders on either side to allow the Government to have a vote on a particular night, I resumed my seat without completing my remarks. What was the result of that courtesy ? We immediately found the honorable members for Wentworth and Fremantle, and even the Prime Minister himself, getting up and delaying business after that courtesy had been extended from this side. But that did not end our courtesy. In the middle of my utterances on the want of confidence motion, and at the desire of  the Government, I was requested to ask leave to continue my remarks, and I did so. If any of the statements which I have quoted from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> article were true, these things would not have taken place. I think that it is only due to the members of this House to show the country the disgraceful tactics that are being adopted by the press to misrepresent honorable members on this side. </para>

          <para class="block">The new coinage proposed is intended to circulate only in Australia. If it were proposed that it should be an Empire coinage, or that it should circulate in India, where the title Emperor might properly appear on coinage, there would be something in the proposal. We know the title of &#34; King,&#34; and we know that it has a constitutional meaning which has been the growth of cen turies. It is the only title used in the Commonwealth Constitution, and the useof the title &#34; Emperor &#34; may impose to the extent that that title exceeds the title of &#34;King,&#34; some autocratic power differing from that of the constitutional Sovereign we know, and whose position is recognised and understood. If on the new coinage to be cir culated in Australia, the word &#34;Emperor&#34; appears, it may be assumed to involve all sorts of things in the way of the power of autocracy in excess of the power of a constitutional King. I protest against what is proposed to be done ; andI wish now to give notice that should the Coinage Bill make provision lor whatI understand is proposed, so far as I can influence any votes in this House, I shall endeavour to have a clause inserted in the Bill which will provide that the word&#34; Emperor &#34; shall not appear on the coinage. </para>

              <para>- I do not accept that interjection ; but I hold that is bringing into the Constitution an unknown force and power. The King I am loyal to. The &#34; Emperor &#34; is an Asiatic assumption. The  matter  is one in connexion with which I think a protest should be made, just as I made a similar protest on the firstlay on which the Federal Parliament met against any attempt to use this title to describe the Sovereign of a constitutional people. </para>

            <para>. - Before the Prime Minister replies, I should like to ask whether he has noticed an article in this evening&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> headed, &#34; Our Defences. Is the Service Rotten? Startling Statements. An Inquiry Demanded. Sergeant-Major Daly&#39;s Request.&#34; Sergeant-Major Daly was in the Defence Force in New South Wales for some considerable time ; and, so far as I know, had a  very  good record. Recently he was placed under arrest, and has since been court-martialled. I had a conversation with him, during which he informed me that he intended to take the step which he has taken. He went from Molong to Sydney, and there placed his resignation in the hands of the military authorities as a preliminary to having his case investigated. He was charged with behaving in a discourteous fashion, and was put under arrest, it being stated that he had informed his commanding officer that he would not be &#34; found dead in such a rotten service.&#34; I gather from the newspaper account that he has formulated some very serious charges. I shall not read them ; but as, for several years past, our military service has been in an unsatisf actory condition,I ask Ministers whether the time hasnot arrived for a searching inquiry by a Commission of experts to ascertain the causes? </para>
