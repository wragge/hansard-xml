I would point out, however, that the remarks of the right honorable member for East Sydney were made yesterday during the debate on the second reading of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bui, and the honorable member for Hume, when speaking, in that debate, will have a fuller opportunity to explain his previous conduct than he has under cover of a personal explanation. </para>

I desire the public to know that, at the time of the introduction of the Surplus Revenue Bill, and, previously, it was my intention to provide for old-age pensions. My late colleagues know that that is so. I stated that intention in reply to some remarks of the honorable member for Wide Bay ; and the second readings of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill and the Surplus Revenue Bill were both agreed to on my motion on the  10th  June of last year. </para>

                    <para>.- The statement which I made yesterday is absolutely correct. Before making it, I took the precaution to read again the speech made by the honorable member for Hume in moving the second reading of the Surplus Revenue Bill. I made a precisely similar statement in the debate on the second reading of that Bill, but, although it was made in the presence of the honorable gentleman, it was not contradicted. Last night I repeated what I had said at length on that occasion. My words are to be read in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The statement was absolutely correct. </para>

                        <para>- I say that there was not. The memorandum drawn up by. the honorable member for Bourke was not agreed to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> so that the statement of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is absolutely incorrect. When a newspaper deals with a return which has been laid on the table, it should place the contents fairly before the public; it is not just to publish only so much as suits its policy, thereby placing certain honorable members in a false position. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> has published the names of the members of the Postal Commission, and the amounts that they have received in expenses, but it has not published&#39; the record of their attendances, so that the electors could see who have .ind who have not attended to their duties. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> report is absolutely unfair. A return of this kind, if made public at all, should be dealt with truthfully. </para>

                <para>On Guard - Advice to Orangemen - Federal Minister&#39;s Offer. - Inverell, Sunday. - The Inverell Orange Lodge celebrated the anniversary of the 1 2th of July by a demonstration in the Town Hall yesterday. An address was delivered by the Rev. D. H. Dillon. He said that Orangemen were charged with stirring up strife, but in the course of all his addresses he never said a word against individual Roman Catholics. The men who stirred up strife were Cardinal Moran and Archbishop Redwood. In one sermon they stirred up more strife than all the Orangemen put together. He believed a serious crisis was approaching in the Commonwealth. The Church was working hard in a quiet way. </para>

From men of this character more danger was to be apprehended than from straight-out Roman Catholics. The Church was making a tremendous bid for this fair land. Orangemen must stand shoulder to shoulder. At the next Federal elections an attempt would be made to oust five members who belonged to their order. Money had already been subscribed with that end in view. They should remember the past, and be true to their convictions, as he believed that before many years the Church would have tremendous power.

                            <para>- I do not know whether any question was asked yesterday on the subject, and <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> saw nothing in the press to indicate that any had been asked, but when I was in Launceston, I observed a published statement that the Minister of Defence had accepted a tender from an American firm in regard to the small-arms factory at Lithgow. I saw that the difference in price between the American and English tenders was practically nothing. The only difference was that in one case the work was to be done in twelve months, and in the other in two years. I&#39; desire to ask the Minister of Defence if any query has been sent to the English firm who tendered, as to whether they could do the work in a shorter time. If that has not been done, and no tender has yet been accepted, will he take that step? What is to become of preference to Great Britain if the Government give preference to American work of that kind? </para>

                        <para>- I can only amplify the reply that I made to the honorable member for Franklin. It is not usual for the Attorney-General to give legal opinions in answer to questions put in the House ; but I may tell the honorable member that if charges imposed in connexion with the inspection laws of the States are not necessary, to that extent there may be a violation of section 92 of the Constitution which prescribes Inter-State Free Trade. I promised the honorable member for Franklin that I should ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to ascertain whether the charges in question were really necessary ; and whether the proceeds are, in accordance with section 112 of the Constitution, paid to the Commonwealth. I may add that there is a power of disallowance of them by Act of Parliament. </para>

When the House has assented to the introduction of a measure, at any time thereafter, when opportunity offers, the Minister or member in charge may bring it forward. Just now I called on the honorable member for Melbourne to resume the debate on the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill ; but, as it seemed to me that it would conduce to the convenience of members if, as soon as possible, printed copies of the Bill or Bills it was desired to introduce, were made available for perusal, I permitted the Treasurer to proceed. </para>

                        <para>- Twenty years ago, during my first electoral campaign, when I advocated old-age pensions, I little thought I should live to see universal franchise distinguish the first Parliament of the Commonwealth, a Conciliation and Arbitration Act distinguish the second Parliament, and an Invalid Old-age Pensions Bill distinguish the third Parliament. In the matter of old-age pensions, as in all other matters, we must be prepared for a great many mistakes and errors. Though I should be the last to formulate any charges, yet I regret that in the Department, red tape too frequently holds sway, and unnecessary trouble is given to those whom I have always maintained have a right to old-age pensions. The regulations, I understand, can be altered and amended by the Ministry of the day, and I have much pleasure in supporting many of the remarks made by the honorable member for Coolgardie last night. In this connexion I do not think I can do better than read a communication, addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allen,</inline> the permanent head of the Department who is charged with the administration of the Act. There was a conference of the representatives of benevolent asylums and similar institutions held in Melbourne last week; and it was from that conference that the following letter was sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allen</inline> :  - </para>

                            <para>By sub-section i of section 43 of the Act, in case the  Deputy  Commissioner is satisfied that, having regard to &#34; age, infirmity, or improvidence of a pensioner, or any other special circumstance,&#34; the pension may be paid to others than the pensioner for the latter&#39;s use. This refers to pensioners living outside of charitable institutions. Yet, since this State&#39;s Pension Act came into force, several hundred persons receiving pensions have been admitted as inmates to this asylum, thereby losing their pensions. The reason given by them for desiring admission was that through ill-health or infirmity they could not possibly live on 10s. a week, as, after paying for a room, food, clothes, medicine, &#38;c, there was nothing left for paying, some one to look after them. These were invariably hospital cases, and the asylum received no special payment for these inmates from the State, as they came under the State&#39;s general annual grant to the asylum. Why, therefore, should charitable institutions be excluded from disbursing the pensions by keeping &#34;a part, say eight shillings a week for the pensioner&#39;s board and lodging, clothes, nursing, medical attendance, &#38;c, and paying them the balance, two shillings a week, for what is generally called pocket money ? </para>

                    <para class="block">That letter concisely puts the advantages which would be gained by allowing inmates of asylums to draw pensions. But Parliament must insist that residence in these institutions must be the voluntary act of old-age pensioners. Briefly put, such pensioners would receive 2s. per week for pocket money, no matter what amount might be allowed by the magistrates. They would enjoy two days&#39; leave a week, have every Sunday and general holidays, and three whole days every three months, with two weeks at Christmas and Easter, during which, I take it, they would draw the whole amount of their pensions. It is impossible for a decrepit man to live on a pension of 10s. per week without the assistance of friends or relatives. In the asylums, pensioners would get regular hot baths, they would hare companions with whom they&#39; could chat or play games, their meals would be served  regularly,  their sleeping accommodation would be comfortable, and in every way their lives would be rendered more pleasant. If an old-age pensioner disliked residence in an institution, he could at once leave, and, on doing so, draw the full amount of his pension. Of course, pensioners able to earn a little for themselves would probably prefer to re-  main out of institutions. I shall have pleasure in supporting the suggestion of the honorable member for Coolgardie, if it is made certain that pensioners who are in any of the innumerable institutions which stand throughout the length and breadth of Australia as monuments to the charity of our people, are there of their own free will, because of infirmity by reason of illness or accident. Then, in regard to the blind. It is pitiful to see them in the streets, sometimes accompanied by children or other relatives, begging alms. Twenty-seven years ago, I was a bank clerk, and know that blind men, even in Melbourne, have held good banking balances, while I have read that, in some of the larger centres of population, such persons have accumulated comfortable fortunes. I understand that those employed in the Treasurer&#39;s office have to listen daily to the strains of an indifferent musician who plays outside. This community, however, is great enough to provide for such unfortunates, and should take them off the streets. We should pay them pensions under the invalid pension section of the Act. I hope that no magistrate appointed to administer the Act will be permitted to forget, with impunity, his humanity, as many magistrates administering the State Act- have done. It is the desire of Parliament, and of the people, that the aged should be given pensions, not as a charity, but as a right, and no magistrate, stipendiary or honorary, should be permitted to insult such citizens, who are in every way his equal. The naturalization question will be raised in Committee. In my view, all citizens who have been given the franchise - which is the highest right a human being can enjoy in our community - should be permitted to draw pensions when, aged. No Asiatics can now be naturalized, but those who have been living amongst us, and have become naturalized, should .be permitted to enjoy all the rights of citizenship. A letter which I have received from Tumbarumba, in New South Wales, raises this very peculiar point : Is a man, born in Hanover, when that country was under the rule of the British sovereign, a citizen of Great Britain? I am informed that the local magistrate has foolishly declared that the wife of such a man is not entitled to an old-age pension, notwithstanding that section 16, subsection 2, of the Act, says - - </para>

                        <para>Seeing that you, sir, are an important member of the Federal House, I take the liberty to trespass on your attention. Before the Battle of Waterloo, England held out overtures to officers of the Hanoverian and Prussian army to come over to England. My father went, leaving his two brothers, who were also in the army. Father fought at Waterloo, Martinique, Dominique,  Guadaloupe, Barbadoes,  Africa, and Canada. He retired at the end of 25 years, got a grant of land in Labrador, went there, but found the climate too severe after being wounded and crippled and weak- through yellow fever, &#38;c. He wanted to go south, but the English Government refused to send his pension into the United States, but he could go to Hanover, where I was born. The House of Commons holds : - That any one born of British born parents will be considered a British subject. Father remained British, until he died, to draw his pension. Britain could claim me to-morrow. I want to make application, together with my wife, who is Irish born, for the old-age pension. My wife, who is bedridden since over three years, is 70 years of age. I am 75. We have abstained until now from applying. Could I not apply without applying to get naturalized? I have already made application to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allen</inline> and other places, and cannot get any answers, to get naturalized. I am referred  to Melbourne by our magistrate. Our magistrate also holds that my wife is not entitled to pension through being married to me. Hanover belonged to England at the birth of my father. The two brothers whom father left in the Hanoverian army lost their lives at  Quatre  Bras under Blucher. </para>

The honorable member for Ballarat will be interested in a letter which I am about to read, though before doing so I wish to draw attention to the infamous manner in which, in this State, aged citizens have been subjected to unnecessary questioning. Their very infirmity makes it difficult for such persons to answer questions. I do not blame either this Administration, or its predecessor, but if these practices are continued, the Government responsible must share the infamy. The honorable member for Bendigo agrees with me that the question list could be simplified. Will the Treasurer kindly consider what the Victorian Government did ? Never was a pension system administered with such little cost to the community. Up to the time that the applicants appeared before the Court, I have&#39; no fault whatever to find with the Victorian system, although I disapprove of the manner in which the  applicants were treated in the Courts.

                    <para>That is what I object to. The average man or woman of 65 years of age can rarely handle a pen very easily. They have often to get somebody to fill in the answers for them before they can sign them. Then they have to run round and get two friends to fill in thirty questions each. In front of those thirty questions appears the following notice - livery claimant is expected to send to the Registrar of Pensions declarations (on separate forms) made by two persons who have known claimant for a period of at least 25 years, but if no such person can be found the declarations may be made by persons of shorter acquaintance. </para>

Every morning, except one, of my week is occupied in attending to this work, or I have some one in my place to do it. I object to the applicants being required to go round and find two persons who have known them for twenty-five years. It is all very well to tell them that friendship of a shorter duration will do. Their friends may be at Bendigo or Ballarat. I may be met with the argument that these formalities are all in accordance with the Act, but no one knows better than the Treasurer that an acute legal mind could find material for a thousand questions within the four corners of the Act. </para>

The difficulty is that the head of the Department has tried to frame a series of questions that will cover both old-age and invalid pensions. The invalid pensions have not been instituted yet, and why should an old-age pensioner be burdened with questions that  relate to that matter? lt is within the realms of possibility that the invalid pensions may not be established this year, yet every applicant for an old-age pension is annoyed by these unnecessary questions, based upon a portion of the Act which has not yet been proclaimed, and which the Treasurer may not have the money to enable him to proclaim for some time to come. </para>

Having lodged your apply papers - then the police take a hand. It soon becomes known that Snooks is, going in for a pension, any way well advertised, and in no way private. Another weary wait of a fortnight, and the police personally serve upon the applicant a form to attend at Court. Once again, the weary questions are put and answered - papers are scanned that have been shown to the police in making their report to headquarters. When nothing can be advanced by the police why the old folks should not receive the pension after a searching inquiry, what need for a Court and magistrate - no property involved? In my own case, another three years and one month would make me eighty years of age. One year and three months I am then sixty years in Australia, fifty years third day of December next wounded at Eureka, Ballarat; showed the magistrate proof of everything in the shape of printed and written documents, miner&#39;s rights, Stc., from forty odd years old downwards. The old fossil showed his importance, of course - seemed to be hard put to it to find a flaw in a long and honorable existence of many ups and downs. Tt is seven weeks since I lodged my application, and nothing but worry each week since. When shall I get a few pennyweights to begin with ? </para>

Nothing more should be necessary, as long as we have the present half-way house for old-age pensions. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It would be far simpler if the various postal officers were directed to follow the system that was adopted in Victoria, under which Clerks of Court fead to applicants a simple set of questions, and telling them that they were required to furnish true answers, called upon them to sign them or, if they could not write, to &#34;place their mark upon them. That would be a much better system than that now in force, under . which an infamous list of questions has to be answered. I can only describe that list as a lineal descendant of the hundred and one insulting impertinences that prevailed under the old poorhouse law of England. Honorable members may be interested to learn that I spent two nights and a day in an English poorhouse, and that my memories of it are such that I would rather go into the worst prison I have ever seen than live in such an institution. When I visited the institution subsequently, as a friend of the medical attendant, I found a very great difference in the treatment extended to me. We do not desire to perpetuate such a system in the Commonwealth. Our wish should be to. build up a higher civilization, and to make Australia - which has gone farther than any other, part of the British Empire has gone in the extension of the franchise - renowned for its humanitarian treatment of aged citizens, who have grown grey in its service. I am not taking a party view of this question. Such a measure as this should be above party considerations, and, therefore, if any remarks I have mad&#167;,are taken askew by the Treasurer, the fault is not mine, but his. An infamous system may prevail of which a Minister may be quite innocent, but when it is brought to light steps should be taken at once to remedy it. If a Minister, having the full facts before him, allows an infamous state of affairs to continue in connexion with an Act, with the administration of which he is charged, he will be for ever disgraced. 1 ask the Treasurer to consult his colleagues, some of whom are fully aware of . the simplicity of the old Victorian system, and to endeavour to reduce as much as possible the present Court procedure. The honorable member for Yarra has brought under notice the excellent way in which a certain magistrate is discharging his duties under the principal Act, and I trust that magistrates generally will be requested to follow his example, so that our pioneers, in their declining years, may be able to obtain a well-earned pension as easily as good administration can insure it. </para>

                            <para>- I have been thoroughly sincere in every statement I have made, both inside this House and outside, in regard to the payment of old-age pensions. Many old men in my electorate said, when I returned after the close of the first Federal Parliament, &#34; God ! How long are we to wait for a Federal old-age pension.&#34; Some of these old men are over eighty years of age. They have borne the heat and burden of the day in pioneering and blazing a track across the western districts of Queensland, so as to make them readily accessible to those who follow. If there is one duty more than another to which we ought to attend, it is that of seeing that the old pioneers are properly provided for. I have always advocated that the only qualification for an old-age pension should be that of age. To my mind, the question of what a man&#39;s past has been is immaterial, provided that he has lived an honorable life. Many bushmen are very like sailors in the way that they spend their money. They work on a station for two or three years, earn a cheque, and then go to town and knock it down. Having done so, they return to their work for another twelve months or two years, and then repeat the performance. These men have contributed largely to the revenue. Every penny they earn they spend in the country, and in their own way they have been really good citizens. It is hard that they should be pauperized when they become old. I know of many persons who, at one time, owned property - and some who owned stations - but are now in reduced circumstances. Circumstances over which they had no control have reduced them to the lowest ebb of poverty and distress, and it would be damnable to pauperize them. We should do what we can &#39;to alleviate the suffering of these old people, and ought not to pauperize them in any way. An honorable senator has handed to me a letter from a resident of Rockhampton that I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer, with a view to his intervening in the direction indicated. The letter reads - </para>

I wish you would get some member in the Representatives to draw attention to the scandalous method adopted by the post office here in paying the pensions. Under the State arrangements the old people were paid in a room in the old Court buildings with some little &#39; show of privacy ; but now they have to congregate and parade their poverty on the verandah of the post-office like so many beggars awaiting their dole of charity. Surely the Commonwealth Government are not so hard up that they cannot afford to engage a suitable room ford the purpose, considering that they can afford presenting <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> to a wealthy nation of landlords like England. </para>

This is not a private letter, and you can make what use you like of it. Another matter to which I wish to draw your attention is : some of the old people who were receiving pensions under the State are now told that as they have not been naturalized for the full period of three years they cannot receive any pension until the Amended Act is passed;. this is a great hardship, as these few old people had settled down comfortably under the State Act, and now find themselves reduced once more to abject poverty. Had the Commonwealth not taken over the duty these old folk would still have been receiving their pensions, and any right thinking person would say it was incumbent on the Commonwealth authorities to pay them until the Act is amended. I am sure that will be your view also. </para>

                            <para>- No; but they do not think they ought to be paraded in the main street as paupers. I am sure the honorable gentleman is so humane that he would not like to see any citizen compelled to parade his poverty. I ask him to direct that in future payments shall be made in privacy. A room can be had for the asking in the old Court House at Rockhampton. That building is separated from the post-office by a green, and the postal officials will not experience any difficulty in paying the pensions there. The amendments in the  principal  Act that this Bill is designed to make are, as fa.r as they go, very good ; but the desire of every honorable member is that we should make good better. Those who know of any anomalies under the principal Act ought now to endeavour to remedy them. I am sure we should all be glad to see every old-age pensioner receiving <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per week if the Commonwealth had at its disposal the necessary fund&#39;s. My hope and desire is that this Bill, as it finally leaves the Chamber, will be so framed that it will not only be beneficial to the old people of Australia, but a credit to the Parliament. </para>

                        <para>&#163;3.54&#93;. - I have listened with attention to the speeches made during this debate. Whilst it is  easy  to sympathize with human difficulty and sadness, in dealing with a measure of this kind the difficulty experienced by a responsible Minister is that if he clare say anything on the other side of the question, personal motives are often attributed to him. I do not know that in the matter of personal feeling, there is much difference between one honorable member and another. We all, I should think, desire to help those who are not so well off as others, and those who are in distress. </para>

                            <para>- But the difficulty is that if this question be placed before honorable members, as one of business and of duty, a risk is run of their being misrepresented, and having attributed to them feelings which, I am sure, neither I nor any other honorable member possesses. It is my duty to place this matter before the House as it affects&#39; the people of Australia, and especially as it affects the public finances. This beneficent measure was introduced eighteen months ago, although it had been said over and over again before that time by those who were responsible, that it was impossible to finance it so long as the Braddon section of the Constitution was in operation. That view was accepted for a long time; and I need, hardly remind honorable members that the Bill was introduced and passed with great hurry. There was no one opposed to the principle of die Bill, and, as those who were responsible were willing to take the financial burden on their shoulders, all those who were in favour of old-age pensions, and were necessarily not well acquainted with the financial aspect, agreed to it. </para>

                            <para>- The only reason that prevented us from having old-age pensions was the reason which exists at present, and has existed ever since the Bill was passed, namely, that no special provision was then made, or has been made up to the present, to finance it, except the pro- vision from a source, which no one anticipated would be available, in the shape of the trust fund created by the Surplus Revenue Bill. By that Bill &#163;650,000 was placed in a trust fund, and made available at the beginning of this financial year. i am not in a position to say what the obligation will be during the current financial year. We are making inquiries, but until we get returns from all the States, we shall have no certain information. But I take it that if I estimate the cost of old-age pensions for this year at &#163;1,500,000, I shall be within the mark. I am speaking now of the obligations under the provisions of the principal Act. Last year, 1908-9, the estimated expenditure in New South Wales was &#163;515,&#176;&#176;&#176;; in Victoria, &#163;260,000; and in Queensland, .&#163;135,000, though I am informed that up to the time the Government of Queensland ceased payment, the expenditure was at the rate of &#163;160, 000 per annum. It will be seen, therefore, that the amount expended in the three States has been about &#163;950,000 a year. The Commonwealth Act is in many respects much more liberal than the Acts of Victoria or New South Wales. One important provision in the Commonwealth Act is that friends and relatives are not called upon to contribute, so that every needy person, whether or not he has rich. relations, may receive a pension. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member will tell us how, I shall be very glad. But I should have thought that the Labour party, under whose special care this Act came into force only the other day, would have done their best in that direction. The amendment of the principal Act, to which the Government intend to agree, reducing the term of residence from twenty-five to twenty years, will involve additional expenditure of, approximately, &#163;25,000 a year, while the clauses permitting naturalization up to the 31st December next will mean further expenditure of about &#163;7,000, and the retrospective provision to the 1 st July, to which the Government are agreeable, will add another &#163;2,000. It  will be seen, therefore, that the amendments in the Bill proposed or accepted by the Government involve an additional expenditure of about &#163;34,000 a year. I may say that, before the Government had agreed to adopt the retrospective view, the Victorian Government had asked the Commonwealth Old-age Pensions officers to pay all the old-age pensioners, including invalids, who were on the Victorian list, and who were disqualified under the Commonwealth Act by reason of their not having resided in Australia for twenty-five years, so that the amendments do not affect existing pensioners in that State. I have not had an opportunity of going into the matter as it affects  Queensland,  but it appears that the Government of that State have not continued to pay the pensioners already on their list after the 1st July ; and the result is the complaint by the honorable member for Maranoa - a complaint which, I think, is justified, because we should not allow persons already on the list to suffer, even if we were not going to make the measure generally retrospective. For more reasons than one, we should not be anxious or willing to increase expenditure at the present time by means of this Bill. In view of the  responsibility and difficulty of the Treasury and of Parliament in regard to the financial position, we must be careful not to allow our sympathies to run away with our judgment, as it is very easy to do, when we hear of hard cases, which could be assisted by a small provision. Complaint has been made in regard to the number of questions asked, but I am informed that in many cases the questions actually assist the claimant, because what may appear to be a small detail is very useful in tracing his age, and his length of residence in the Commonwealth. For instance, the information as to what ship an applicant arrived in very often . furnishes a clue which enables him to make good his claim. One must remember that those who administer the Act have not plain sailing, and especially those who scrutinize the claims. Every applicant is not particularly careful in the statements he makes; there are all sorts of claims which have to be sifted. If all that were done was to allow some one to sign a paper, I do not think it would be fair to- the country, or even fair to the applicant. There are many cases in which persons who have no right have tried to obtain pensions. For instance, one applicant had about 178 acres of land, with a house, 100 sheep,- and other property, valued at &#163;830, after deducting mortgages. Unless care had been exercised in that case, the pension might have been granted. The law says that any one possessed of property valued at , &#163;310 shall not be eligible for a pension, and those administering the Act must see that effect is given to it without fear or favour. They must neither harden nor soften their hearts, but must faithfully do what is right. Another applicant had an income of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;59</inline> per annum and free board and lodging. His property was valued at . &#163;745, including a house worth &#163;500. The wife of another, from whom there had been no legal separation, possessed &#163;2,000 worth of property. The wife of another was earning &#163;117 a year, and had property worth , &#163;475. Another claimant had property worth &#163;700. Another had a wife possessing land worth &#163;530 and other property. Another had transferred three houses, in one of which he lived, valued at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,600.</inline> He received the rents from them, and, in addition, 8s. 6d. per week from a benefit societv. These applicants may have been very deserving, but they were not qualified by the Act, and their claims were, of course, rejected. All claims must be investigated, but, no doubt as the provisions of the law become better understood, administration will be easier, and claimants will also find it easier. As to the complaint that delay now occurs in. the . settlement of claims, I point out that pensions are paid on the pay-day following the making of a claim. Delay in getting the claim certified to does not affect the payment. In Committee, the Government will add amendments to give effect to the desire to make the law retrospective in regard to claims made within forty days after the passing of the Bill.- Any person who, on the 1st July would have been qualified if the measure had been in force will get his pension from that date. In conclusion, I remind honorable members that the financial burdens of the Commonwealth are now very great. </para>

                            <para>- It is estimated that the proposed amendments will increase the expenditure by , &#163;34,000 per annum. In addition to the expenditure on old-age pensions, it is necessary to spend a large additional amount in connexion with the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department and on defence. Therefore, we should allow time for the Old-age Pensions Act to get fully into working order before amending it materially. After the end of 1910, the Commonwealth will have a greater revenue than it has now, and, until then, it is not too much&#34; to ask Parliament not to unreasonably increase our financial difficulties, which are, as the honorable member for Wide Bay knows, acute enough at the present time. </para>

                    <para class="block">We should face our difficulties, whether they be financial, economical, or political. The public officers of the Commonwealth and of the States have to. retire at the age of sixty years, being then considered unfit for longer service, and, generally speaking, private firms adopt a similar rule. It must be remembered that applicants for old-age pensions are, for the most part, persons who have been engaged in much more arduous and less healthy occupations than those of public servants. I think that the age at which an invalid pension could be obtained should be earlier. That has always been my view. While in politics, one must be prepared to take what he can get, he must also take advantage of every opportunity to ask for more, until he has got what he considers sufficient. I think that the age at which women should be eligible for pensions should be reduced. Women ought to  be  eligible for pensions five wars earlier than men, for reasons contained in the -evidence of the Old-age Pensions Commission, and the statements .of medical men and other writers, which are available to every member of the Committee.

The Treasurer will agree with me that the Commonwealth is able to meet an addition of 25 per cent, or 30 per cent, to the present expenditure on old-age pensions if it makes the Act efficient beyond cavil. The extra money, of course, will not be lost. </para>

                            <para>- I quite recognise the difficulties. I have often said in the House that old-age pensions should be paid to persons when they attain an age at which they have to retire from work, irrespective of their actual age. The point, however, in this case is that we retire our public officers at sixty years of age on the assumption that they are no longer fully fit to discharge the &#39;onerous duties imposed upon them. Surely the same thing would apply.  with greater force to a workman toiling in a more arduous occupation. When he attained the age of sixty years he should be entitled to an old-age pension if otherwise qualified. </para>

                            <para>- Evidence taken by the Old-age Pensions Commission, and other evidence which I can show the honorable member, tends to prove that in Australia women, speaking generally, are relatively five years older than men at the same age, from a health point of view. That is a justification for allowing women to be eligible for pensions at an age five years earlier than in the case of men. I therefore ask the Treasurer to accept the amendment. </para>

                            <para>- I rise to a point of order. It is not a question of whether the Government will accept the amendment or not. It is a question of whether the  Chairman  can accept it. The honorable member for Wide Bay has admitted that its intention is to increase the charges upon the people by &#163;500,000. Under such circumstances, no Minister or member can, under the Constitution, Standing Orders, or practice of Parliament, move such a charge on the people without a preliminary message  from the Governor-General. </para>

In spite of that objection, I, as a private member, was allowed to move the amendments. That is a very good precedent for the acceptance of the amendment now proposed. </para>

                        <para>- I would point out first that this measure is drafted not only as an amending, but also to some degree as a consolidating Bill, and it is most difficult for me to say what the principal Act does provide. I cannot be expected to have the principal Act here, and to be studying it in conjunction with these amendments. I am placed in a very difficult position in being asked to give rulings where Bills are introduced in ,this way, with nothing to guide me in the shape of letters in large black type as to the effect of the amendments on the principal Act. I understand that the Bill admittedly involves an increased expenditure of &#163;34,000, and that up to the present no message has been received from the Crown to cover that. An amendment is now proposed by a private member which, in his opinion, will further increase the expenditure by &#163;500,000. Honorable members will see that if the Government can introduce a Bill involving an increased expenditure of &#163;34,000 without a message from the Crown- </para>

                            <para>- I wish simply to show the difficulty in which I am placed. It is quite true that up to the present we have not yet reached the clause involving the extra expenditure to which I refer, but it was quite possible for us to have reached that clause, and for this amendment to have been moved afterwards, so that the objection now raised by the Treasurer is not worth considering. In dealing with this measure, we are in quite a different position from that in which we are placed when considering the Estimates, or measures imposing taxation, which are covered by messages from the Crown,, and which have definitely for their object the placing upon the people of certain burdens. The honorable member for Wide Bay has stated that, in his opinion, his amendment will increase the burdens upon the people by &#163;500,000. I have from time to time ruled that it is not within the province of private members to increase the burden upon the people. If that were allowed, there would be nothing to guide the Government for the time being as to the amount of revenue that they would receive in the year. The Government, for instance, might bring down taxation proposals to yield a certain amount of revenue, knowing exactly what they required, and if private members were allowed to increase that revenue by moving amendments, it would not be possible for the Treasurer to have proper control over the  finances.  In the circumstances I rule that the amendment would not be in order. The Committee, however, now have the matter entirely in their own hands to establish a precedent or not, as they choose. </para>

                            <para>- Without expressing any opinion on the amendment, I wish to point out that it is out of order upon another  ground, which, however, is only of a temporary character. An amendment must not only . be relevant to the Bill, but it must be relevant to the clause which it is proposed to amend. This amendment is not relevant to the clause in this Bill, although it is relevant to a section in the principal Act. I know that that is not a fatal objection to it, and I only raise the point in the interests of orderly procedure. It would be quite competent for the honorable member to submit a new clause which would be relevant to the title, but the amendment now proposed would not be relevant to the clause before the Committee. I raise that point, not as being fatal to the amendment itself, but as one showing that the amendment should be submitted in the shape of a new clause at another stage. At present it is proposed as an amendment of a clause to which it is not relevant. Sub-section 3 of section 15 has nothing to do with the ages at which a pension shall be payable, and I suggest that fact to the  Chairman  as another reason why the amendment would be irregular. </para>

If you have not, then I wish to point out that, despite what the right honorable member for East Sydney has said, the real gist of the question at issue is whether or not it is possible, in the case of a Bill which is not submitted under a message, to move an amendment that would increase a burden on the people. I do not wish to dissent from your ruling, except with your concurrence; but I think the practice has been to allow such an amendment to be made in a Bill in connexion with which no message . has been received. I know that it is not competent for an honorable member to move an amendment so as. to increase the public burdens in the case of a Bill preceded by a message, but that is not the position in this case. This Bill simply provides that certain . things shall be done, and it will be open to the Government to bring down or to refuse to bring down a message covering any additional expenditure that the adoption of the amendment may involve. I am not carping at your rulling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> but I thought it well to put these facts before you. </para>

                            <para>- I would point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the practice of constantly referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> for determination questions arising in Committee is a dangerous one. By the adoption of such a bad precedent, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the  Chairman  of Committees may come into conflict concerning matters that ought to be decided by the Committee itself. On one occasion a reference was made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> with the result that he gave a ruling opposed to that which I had given. I was not at all sore in connexion with the matter, but I repeat that it is a well -authenticated practice to refrain from doing anything that may bring <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the  Chairman  of Committees into conflict.- Hence we have a standing order which provides that a Committee of the House may make and settle its own procedure. In the circumstances, I cannot agree to the question being referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> I should prefer the Committee itself to decide it. </para>

                            <para>-The question is of sufficient importance to justify the opinion of the Committee being taken upon it. If your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> be upheld, it will mean that it will be impossible for non-official members to submit any amendment which may be considered to increase a tax or burden upon the people. I intend, therefore, to dissent from it. The question as to the receipt of a message in connexion with the Bill was not introduced until late in the discussion, and the point whether the Bill itself is properly before the Committee might also be submitted for your decision. But since it has been considered in Committee, and has been accepted as being properly before us, we should tie our hands by accepting the ruling that, it is impossible for a non-official member to move an amendment that may ultimately involve increased taxation. Standing order 171, on which you, sir, have doubtless based your ruling, provides that - </para>

                            <para>- That does not materially alter the position. I claim, in the first place, that this measure is. not an Appropriation Bill, or one in which the appropriation of certain moneys is in any way directly involved. It simply declares that certain treatment shall be extended to certain persons, provided that Parliament is agreeable later on to provide the necessary funds. I recognise that if the Ministry were seeking an appropriation of, say, &#163;1,250,000 for the purpose of old-age pensions, it would not be within the province of a non-official member to move to increase that amount, nor &#39; would it be within the province of a Minister to move to increase it without a. further message from the Crown. It is quite within the province of this Committee, however, to determine what form a particular allocation shall take, and for Parliament subsequently to provide the necessary funds. </para>

                            <para>- If they had the requisite majority they could refuse to bring down an Appropriation Bill to enable the functions for which this measure provides to be carried out. But this is not a Bill providing for an appropriation within the meaning of standing order 171, nor is it a Bill&#34; directly imposing taxation on the community. If honorable members opposite, because of party interests, are  prepared to accept a ruling in this matter which will tie the hands of Parliament for all time, they will find that the decision will have a boomerang effect, and will recoil upon them. If the Chairman&#39;s ruling be sustained, the liberties of honorable members will be curtailed to a degree that was never contemplated when the Standing Orders were being framed, and incalculable injury will be done to the right of free discussion of Bills before Parliament. I have no feeling in the matter towards the  Chairman,  but I respectfully move - </para>

In Committee a number of amendments were moved bv private members, some of which, if carried, would have had the effect of increasing the payments from the Treasury under the Act. The honorable member for Boothby, for instance, moved an amendment to omit the exclusion, under certain circumstances, of Asiatics from participation in the benefits of the Bill. That amendment was put, and, although you, sir, were in the chair at the time, you did not rule it out of order. </para>

                    <para class="block">That would have . had the effect of including a number of persons resident in the Northern Territory, and in Papua; and that amendment was discussed and lost. A further amendment was moved by the honorable member for Cook, that sub-clause 3 be left out; and it was left out on the voices, with the effect of increasing the demand upon the Treasury. Further on in the same debate, the honorable member for New England moved to strike out the words &#34; for drunkenness,&#34; which, had it been carried, would have . had the effect of increasing the amount to be paid by the public. Then the honorable member for Cook moved, and the amendment was accepted, to include holders of State certificates, and that had the effect of increasing the burden upon the community. It is clear that the principal Act was treated as it ought to have been treated, namely, as a machinery measure; and if the present Bill is not a machinery Bill, it is improperly before the Committee,because it has not been preceded by a message. The mere fact that, incidentally, the amendment will have the effect of increasing the payments to be made under the principal Act, which was covered by a message appropriating money, is not at all to the point ; and I submit that your ruling is not in accordance with your previous decisions, or the practice of this Chamber before you occupied the chair, and neither is it in conformity with the right of honorable members to move relevant amendments in all measures excepting those specifically confined to the imposition of taxation in which case amendments having the effect of increasing the burden of the community cannot be moved by private members. In regard to a Tariff, or a tax, we clearly understand our limitation ; &#39; and in the Constitution Act there is particular provision regarding such measures. Sections 53 and 54 of the Constitution contain the following - </para>

                    <para>Clearly all&#39; that this Bill does is to rectify anomalies in the machinery Act under which old-age pensions are paid. On the clear admission of members of the present government, and of the then Opposition,.&#39; when the principal Act was before us, old-age pensions could not be -paid because there was no money available; and therefore the whole question turned on the appropriation of sufficient money. This Bill&#39; appropriates no money, and, therefore, we must get revenue in some way before we can pay any more in pensions. The honorable member for Wide Bay has submitted an amendment that may, perhaps, involve additional expenditure; but, clearly, on the statements of the Treasurer, and on the admission of the facts, there is not sufficient money to pay additional pensions without a further appropriation. If you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> look at the notice-paper, you will find there a Land Tax Assessment Bill, to which is attached the name of the honorable member for Wide Bay. It is proposed under that Bill to include certain persons, and exclude others from such taxation; and I contend it will be quite competent for honorable members to include or exclude any &#39;other classes from the operation of that Bill, in view of the fact that a Bill actually imposing a tax will not then be before the Committee. Under the circumstances, I feel that you ought not to rule as you have. Although you have been led away by excessive . caution, and a desire not to allow the Committee to get itself into an awkward position, I submit that you have inadvertently clone a very grave injustice, and that the Government, no matter what they may believe, ought to refer the question to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> for an authoritative ruling so that we may know precisely where we are. For my own part. I cannot see that there can be two opinions on the point. It is perfectly clear that if we have no right to deal with this amendment, there are only some 10 per cent, of measures submitted to this House with which we should have been able to deal. </para>

If the honorable member is one of those gentlemen who consider that the time of Parliament is wasted by the discussion of measures, he ought to be outside talking to some of the Women&#39;s Committees. As will be seen at once, every measure that comes before this Chamber is liable, at the instance of some private member, to amendment, which may increase the cost to the taxpayer. For instance, supposing that under some Bill the appointment of two public officers is proposed, and an honorable member moves that there should be three ; it is seen at once that there is incidentally an increased charge on the revenue. </para>

                        <para>- Then we will say &#34;must&#34; ; but,&#39; in any case, this is not an Appropriation Bill. The Prime Minister will agree that 90 per cent, of the amendments which honorable members may move on any Bills would increase the cost to the country of the new law. I hope the Committee will take up a strong position - that honorable members, in the interests of parliamentary debate, will vote for the motion of the&#39; honorable member for Kalgoorlie to dissent from the ruling of the  Chairman.  I am sorry to have to advocate dissent; but I have to regard the more important matter,. of the rights and privileges of honorable members. </para>

                            <para>- The sum of &#163;750,000 has been appropriated for the payment of old-age pensions, but the expenditure which will be incurred is not yet known. It may be proposed later on to move an amendment in the direction of saving expenditure. For the purposes of this argument, let me assume that some one may propose to strike out of the Act the provisions relating to invalid pensions. Of course, no one is  likely  .to do that; but such an .amendment would reduce expenditure by a sum larger than that by which the amendment of the honorable member for Wide  Bay  would increase it. We recognise that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#34;Chairman,</inline> rarely make a mistake, and that you are doing your duty in keeping our procedure within the rules of Parliament. But if we did not disagree with the present ruling, our hands would be tied so tightly that we could not properly do our business. It seems to me that such a ruling should apply only to amendments of Bills dealing with taxation. It must not be forgotten that, in any case, the expenditure on old-age pensions will constantly increase, because there is no prospect of our conditions becoming so good that there will be no claimants for old-age pensions, and there is every probability that the claimants will increase with the population. If we cannot increase expenditure, how is the increase in the number of claimants to be provided for ? This is not a taxation measure. The amendment affects merely an Act authorizing an expenditure which cannot be accurately estimated. The honorable member for Wide Bay has given the opinion that his amendment would increase expenditure to a large amount; but that does not follow. Should the ruling of the  Chairman  be upheld, it will be impossible for the Committee to exercise its proper constitutional powers in dealing with the legislation submitted by the Government. </para>

                            <para>-  I agree with the honorable member for Boothby that in the consideration of important matters affecting the rights of the Committee there should be no element of party feeling, a consideration which, of course, must apply on both sides. But, in interpreting the rules of procedure, we must not act on rigid technicalities. The point that the amendment might result in the reduction of expenditure does not commend itself to common sense. The amendment must largely increase expenditure. &#39;That is a very important consideration.. For many years, where measures involving public charges have been concerned, the powers of the Parliament have been strictly limited, in the interests, not of the Crown, but of the people. Should any improper provision be inserted in the Bill, it would be open for any honorable member to raise a point of order in the House, which, if sustained, would be fatal to the measure. No Bill imposing a charge on the people can be introduced until leave has been obtained by a resolution of a Committee of the whole House. Of course, where the charges are merely incidental and triv&#39;al, there are precedents for dispensing with the Committee stage. But the charge which would be imposed by the carrying of the amendment would involve a very large sum. Of that the honorable member for Wide Bay made no secret. I do not profess to speak confidently in this matter, because there is much to be said in favour of the view taken by the honorable and learned member for West Sydney. Not much importance is to be attached to the point relating to the Governor- General&#39;s Message, because such a Message can be put before the House at any time, though the want of it might be sufficient to cause a Bill to be ruled out of order. </para>

                            <para>-  The authorities do not limit to Appropriation Bills the rule to which I have referred. Every Bill imposing a charge upon the people comes within it. Should the rule be broken by an amendment, the point may be taken in the House that a provision of the Bill goes too far, and if upheld, the point would be fatal. If the Bill itself imposes a charge on the people, the Government has done wrong in not obtaining leave to introduce it by the resolution of a Committee, though I- do not see anything in the Bill imposing such a charge, beyond, perhaps, what is subsidiary and trivial. </para>

                            <para>-  That is so; but the Government seem to have taken the course of separating this particular Bill from the Appropriation Bill. That separation in form, however, does not . at all affect the broad principle to which I have referred. The question is not that of the Appropriation Bill. It is a question of any Bill that creates any charge upon &#34;the public. If the House decides that persons between fifty-five and sixty, years of age . shall be qualified to. receive a pension, surely that is creating a charge upon the public. It creates by law a right in a person to receive? a certain sum of money. </para>

                            <para>- Parliament would surely look upon the passing of such a law as meaning the&#39; provision of the money. We must not descend to such puerilities. If we pass a Federal law to that effect, it is a puerility to say that we are creating no charge upon the &#34;people. In what more solemn form could we create a charge upon the people than by passing a law entitling certain persons to receive certain sums of money ? The passing of an Act to provide the money is merely writing a cheque to meet that&#39; obligation. It is a mere matter of making financial arrangements to honour the obligation. </para>

                            <para>-  I should like to read a few extracts, because I was in great doubt upon the matter until I referred to this authority. I regret that the debate is taken at this stage, because the amendment is, in any case, out of order, on the ground that it should be submitted as a new clause, and not as an amendment to this clause. </para>

I did not put the point forward as another point of order.I simply expressed my regret that this motion will not dispose of all the objections to the amendment. There is a general provision in our Standing Orders that when we have no standing order expressly bearing upon any matter, we shall resort &#34; to the rules, forms, and practice of the House of Commons.&#34; </para>

                    <para class="block">I am testing the amendment in that way, and it is a good way of testing it. Suppose the amendment had been in the Bill as introduced, suppose that instead of pensions to those whom we all desire to benefit, the Government had introduced in the Bill a provision involving an extra expenditure of &#163;500,000 in conferring privileges on some wealthy favoured class in the community, without the safeguards of a Royal message and of a Committee before the Bill was brought in. I think in that case my honorable friends would see the necessity for those safeguards. We must not allow our minds to be influenced by the excellent object which the honorable member for Wide Bay has in view. In such a case, my honorable friends opposite would have considered those safeguards of vital importance. They are, indeed, of vital importance in any case, whether the object is a good one, as it is in this case, or a bad one, as it would be in the case I suggested -  resort must be had to this procedure before the Bill is introduced, and upon the  report  of the resolution of the Committee of the whole House thereon the Bill is ordered to be brought in. If the charge created by a Bill is a subsidiary  feature therein, resulting from the provisions it contains, </para>
                    <para class="block">That is a sort of indirect charge which results from a proposed enactment in the Bill. For instance, the appointment of an assistant Commissioner would be held to be a subsidiary matter, because he having been appointed, his salary would have to be provided. It would not mean a direct charge, such as this is -  the Royal recommendation and preliminary committee are not needed in the first instance, and the Bill is brought in on motion. But before the clauses and! provisions for the creation of incidental charges can be considered by a committee on the Bill, those clauses and provisions must be sanctioned by the resolution of a Committee appointed upon the recommendation of the Crown, and agreed to by the House. </para>
                    <para class="block">So that even incidental charges must be sanctioned by this procedure. In my long experience in another Parliament, it was my constant anxiety, as Premier, to see that these messages were brought clown. Too often I have had Bills ruled out of order because one of my Ministers omitted to get the necessary message introduced and dealt with in Committee, although, perhaps, the expenditure for which the Bill provided was not large. Consequently, I have had the painful experience of the necessity for taking these steps. </para>

I agree with the right honorable&#34; member for East Sydney that, under the House of Commons practice, such a Bill as this must first of all be referred to a Committee by a message from the Crown, and be dealt with there. The right honorable member also urged that, since we have no . definite standing order to guide us in this &#39;matter, we must resort to the rules, forms and practice of the House of Commons. Upon that point, I am in agreement with him, but no one knows better than he does that our constitutional practice is exactly the opposite of that of the House of Commons. </para>

                            <para>-  Yes; but such a message has not yet been introduced, and, therefore, the representatives of the people have not had an opportunity  to deal with it. If such an opportunity had offered, it would have been in order, at a certain stage, to proceed to enlarge the scope of the message, or, in other words, the amount that it covered. I submit that there is a time when honorable members have an opportunity in Committee to extend, as well as to reduce, the scope of such a message. The Treasurer nods dissent, but, with all due respect, I disagree with him. When a message is being transmitted from the  Speaker  to the Committee, there is a time when a motion extending the amount proposed to be appropriated under that message may &#39;be moved and carried. That, at all events, has been done more than once in other Parliaments. </para>

                            <para>-  The passing of such a motion, before we proceeded to deal with the Bill to which the message related, would be a clear direction to the Crown as to the desire of the House. The argument advanced by the right honorable member for East Sydney absolutely fails, at any rate, on the ground that in the House of Commons an appropriation must always precede the Bill to which it relates. We have no such form in connexion with this House. The right honorable member has said that &#39; he thinks that this Bill, apart from the question raised, ought to have been preceded by a Committee on a message from the Crown. It is immaterial to the object we have in view, whether or not the amendment is accepted in the particular form presented, since we can attain its object by the omission of one word. I regret that the amendment has been ruled out of order. The point involved is a very delicate one. In you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonald,</inline> we have a  Chairman  who will give his decisions according to his intelligence, quite irrespective of party feeling. We have reason to congratulate ourselves on having officers who will consider in that way the principles that should guide us, and I .am sure that those who vote to disagree with your ruling will not be actuated bv any personal feeling. If a Committee of this Parliament cannot extend a proposal of this kind in the direction T have already moved, it will he impossible for the Committee to do its work properly. </para>

                            <para>-  I do not wish to delay the Committee, because the right honorable member for East Sydney has nut the matter, I think, very clearly. It is really not so much a technical question as a matter of substance. I know of no standing order that makes the decision of the  Chairman  technical. What he has to do is to be guided bv a general sense of expediency as to whether or not an amendment involving such a very large expenditure as, say, &#163;,Too,000 per annum, ought to be initiated on the motion of a private  member. As a matter of substance, that ought not to be done. We know that, if the amendment be carried, another Bill will have to be passed to provide for the expenditure. Thus the whole financial policy of the Government might be absolutely changed on the initiation of a private member. The amendment would so alter this Bill as to add to the proposed expenditure by some hundreds of thousands of pounds. </para>

If 1 am not mistaken the Senate increased a proposed burden on the people by simply changing the date of the application of that measure. </para>

                            <para>- That is purely a matter of courtesy. If a message is necessary, it is not competent for a private member, under section 56 of the Constitution, to move an amendment unless there is a promise that a message will be forthcoming; and T think that that is the limitation of the powers of honorable members opposite. In the case of the Sugar Bounties Bill. I think the decision was against the contention of the Senate, and it was held that the mere widening of the scope, by altering the date,  was a sufficient&#39; increase of the burden to deny their right to make the amendment. If we apply the same test now, it becomes, not a mere question between the two Houses, but between the Ministry, who have the control of, and who only can initiate, expenditure, and private members, who have no responsibilities of the kind ; and I think the  Chairman  has rightly decided that a private member cannot propose an alteration which may add hundreds of thousands to the burden of the people. What is a message but simply a demand by the Government for a certain amount of Supply ? </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it is. Assuming a message is necessary, the stage at which a Minister can obtain one is not yet passed ; and, so far as that is concerned, the Bill is properly before the Committee. I have indicated the point on which there may be a doubt ; but on the broader ground, it can scarcely be considered within the competence of a private member to so widen the Bill that the Ministry may have to make provision for the expenditure of&#39; hundreds of thousands of pounds. I think that the precedent set in the case of the Bounties Bill practically shows that the rul&#34;ing of the  Chairman  is right. </para>

                            <para>- I am indebted to the right honorable member for East Sydney for the care he took in placing before us his views of the present peculiar situation, and for doing so without any feeling of a party character. I sincerely hope that the decision of honorable members, in respect to the ruling, will be quite free from party feeling. The decision arrived at by the  Chairman  is very far-reaching; and, if it be upheld, it will place a limitation in the case of 90 per cent, of the Bills submitted to us. A Bill which in any way may cause an appropriation of revenue, however small, will come under the ruling of the  Chairman  ; and honorable members will be prevented from making any amendment which is not satisfactory to the Government, or which even suggests the appropriation of revenue. It is possible that a large number of Bills which come before us may involve slight charges on the revenue; and, under the ruling now given, honorable members will be prevented from submitting amendments. </para>

                            <para>- It may be, but the right honorable gentleman knows that most of these matters are taken- up in a refined spirit - that objectors in Parliament are generally those who raise technical points, and object to rulings which, if upheld, may subsequently lead to a great waste of time, and cast reflection on the Chair. I submit, first, that all Bills are submitted with a general understanding respecting the powers of the Committee; in fact, our Standing Orders are word for word those of the House of Commons. That is, the Committee have power to make such amendments in a Bill as they shall think fit, provided they be relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill, but if any such amendment shall not be within the title of the Bill, the title shall be amended and the same reported specially to the House - that is, the title may be altered so as to bring the amendments within its scope. While I am indebted to the right honorable member for East Sydney for the way in which he put his view before us, I must say that the serious part of his remarks were not directed to&#39; the ruling of the  Chairman,  but to the point whether this Bill is properly before this . Committee. The whole of what he quoted from <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> went to show that the Bill, because it meant an increase in expenditure - I do not like the word &#34;charge,&#39;&#39; regarding it as applying more directly to taxation - was not properly before the Committee, seeing  that it had been brought down without a Royal recommendation. If you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> rule that the Bill is properly before us, then the whole of the right honorable gentleman&#39;s argument, I respectfully submit, falls absolutely to the ground, and we have a Bill that we can in general terms amend, provided the amendments are relevant to the subject-matter, and even though they be not within the title or present scope of the Bill. So far as I understand, the procedure of the House, the necessity for a Royal recommendation prior to any Bill or resolution for the appropriation of moneys being carried, has been obviated. Even though a Bill may require a recommendation from the Governor-General, such recommendation may be obtained subsequent to the Bill going through most of its stages, and prior to its final passing from the House. I understand that that is the position taken up by the Ministry with respect to this particular Bill - that they anticipated that a. Royal recommendation would be indispensable, but adopted the ordinary custom in at least some of the States, and were prepared to allow the Bill to go through certain stages before the recommendation was brought down. If that be the case, and it is ruled that the Bill is properly before us - and that the Ministry propose to ask for the necessary recommendation prior to the Bill passing through all its stages - then I submit that the ruling is not in keeping with the practice of the House of Commons. I understand that where our Standing Orders are silent on a&#39;ny point, we have recourse to the practice of that House. The right honorable member for East Sydney read portions of pages 527 and 528 of the tenth edition of <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> referring particularly, to the regulations adopted by the House of Commons; but if the honorable gentleman had gone a little further and looked at page 532, he would have found that we are at full liberty, until a ruling is given, to continue making amendments even though the amendments, provide for an increase in the public expenditure. </para>

                        <para>As is subsequently explained, the constitutional principle which vests in the Crown the sole responsibility of incurring national expenditure, forbids an increase by the Commons of a sum demanded on behalf of the Crown for the service of the State. This principle, however, is apparently disregarded when the recommendation of the Crown is given to a resolution empowering the expenditure of public money which, framed in general terms, places no limitation on the amount of expenditure to be authorized by the resolution. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not think that there could be more authoritative language upon the point under consideration. There has been no recommendation in regard to this Bill, and even had there been one it would have had to be in general terms, and, consequently, the practice laid down above would apply. As there has been no recommendation, and we do not know what recommendation there will be, we are justified in adopting the practice of the House of Commons, which permits members to make amendments in the provisions of the Bill, no matter what the cost resulting therefrom may be. Of course, if the amendments made in the Bill are not satisfactory to Ministers, the Government need not ask for a recommendation covering the necessary expenditure. The admission of the Treasurer makes it clear that a recommendation of some description must be brought down before the Bin can finally pass. Your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> would prevent the submission of any amendment, however trivial, if likely to cause an increased expenditure. Therefore, following the clear practice of the House of Commons, by which we are bound when our Standing Orders do not apply, the Committee ought to dissent from it. Possibly if further time is given for consideration, you may be able to suggest some alteration of your ruling which will get us out of this difficulty. Although I wish to see amendments made in the Act, I am more deeply concerned about the far-reaching effects of your ruling, because, if upheld, it will greatly limit our powers in dealing with important measures. </para>

A measure has been referred to us, but we may deal with it only in the manner laid down by the Standing Orders, or, where they are deficient, in accordance with the practice of the House of Commons. The Committee is supreme within its own sphere, and I was glad to hear you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> say that the point at issue is to be decided by the Committee itself. It has been said that the ruling, if upheld, would cramp and limit the powers of the Committee. I deny that. It would limit the powers of .private members, but not those of the Committee. No one would desire to give to private members the powers exercised by those who hold positions of responsibility. </para>

In my opinion, the proposed new clause is in the same position as the amendment of the honorable- member, and I think, therefore, that the Government should have brought down a message from the Governor-General. I know that such messages may be brought down after a Bill has been dealt with in Committee, but the proper time to introduce them is earlier than that, so as to give the fullest opportunity for the discussion of proposals of expenditure. </para>

                            <para>-  Yes. During the course of the discussion, both on the motion and on the second reading, a number of amendments were moved by private members, many of which had the effect of still more greatly increasing the charge upon the revenue. In. face of this, the most recent authoritative precedent as to the procedure in the House of Commons, your ruling ought not to stand. I admit that the matter might be open for argument if the case were not so clearly established, both in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> and by the actual practice of the House of Commons. The latter is much more to the point and ought to be given greater consideration than any declaration by <inline font-style="italic">May. May,</inline> of course, is an authority, compiled from the rulings and the precedents laid down in the- House, but here is a recent precedent directly applicable to the case before us, where a member of the Commons proposed to increase the charge upon the revenue. A private member was permitted to move an amendment which would increase that charge by &#163;800,000 a year. I submit that we must follow that precedent, the more especially when to depart from it is to take from honorable members a right which they have always enjoyed, and which they exercised without challenge during every stage of the consideration of the principal Act. The right honorable member for East Sydney said the point to be. decided was not a technical one at all. He submitted that the Bill did impose a charge - that, in consequence, the Bill was not properly before the Committee - and that it followed as a matter of course that Parliament would have to honour the obligation which it incurred by passing the Bill. I say most emphatically that that is to mis-state and misunderstand completely the nature of parliamentary procedure. It is to say, in so many words, that an assessment measure and a taxation measure are practically the same. We know them to be distinctly different. It is notorious that legislation has been passed in many cases imposing obligations on the Parliament which Parliament later on has not honoured. This measure is either a measure imposing a charge - in which case it is improperly before us - or it is not, in which case it is a mere machinery Bill, which there can be no possible doubt as to our power to amend. In either case we may amend it, because if it be a Bill imposing a charge in the same way as the British measure was, -then, upon the precedent clearly created in the House of Commons, we can amend it in the direction of increasing the charge, and if, on the other hand, it be a mere machinery measure, we can clearly amend it by the exercise of our right to amend legislation in general. Your ruling, sir, creates a most monstrous condition of affairs. If it be upheld, we must either accept the Bill as a whole or reject it as a whole, far the only* way in which we can amend it is to make every old man and old woman who is a beneficiary under this legislation worse off than they are to-day. During the whole course of my parliamentary experience, such a ruling has not been given in connexion with a matter of this kind. If it were a direct taxation measure, I admit that your ruling would apply. The honorable member for Adelaide quoted a case which showed that where the resolution was in general terms and not specific it was competent for a private member to move an amendment which increased the charge upon the revenue. What is the position at the present time? The principal Act was assented to on 10th June, 1908, and on the same date the Royal assent was given to the Old-age Pensions Appropriation Act, under which an appropriation of &#163;750,000 was made. That is the only appropriation for this purpose of which .we have any knowledge, and if it preceded the passing of the Old-age Pensions Bill, then the amendments that were made in that Bill were made after the appropriation had been agreed to. In any case, amendments which might have had the effect of increasing the proposed charge or burden on the people&#39; were moved, and no objection was taken to their submission. The Government propose by their own measure to increase the amount payable under the principal Act to an unknown extent, but they have absolutely no authority to pay one penny beyond that which is specifically appropriated by the Old-age Pension Appropriation Act of 1908. I submit, therefore, that the proposed amendment would not create a charge upon the Treasury of id. more than that appropriation permits. Before id. more can be paid, there must be a further appropriation, and since that appropriation must be initiated in this House, it follows that what we are proposing now is to agree to a proposition which may or may not subsequently be ratified.  1  submit, therefore, that the amendment is in order At page 580, of <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> tenth edition, we have the statement - </para>

But this is not a Committee of Ways and Means, and we are not proposing to create a. charge. Subject to the approval of the House later on, we propose to give to certain persons not now included in the Bill a right which they formerly did not possess. Whether or not that right involves an impost upon the revenue will depend upon whether or not we have the money to permit it to be observed. The amendment is, in effect, the same as the provision in sub-section 2 of section 15 of the principal Act, which declares that, upon proclamation by the Governor-General, that &#39; sub-section under which women shall have the right to claim pensions at the age of sixty instead of sixty-five years, shall come into force. The section was worded in that way so. that when the money was available, women would be able to draw the pension on reaching the earlier age. I  ask the Attorney-General, whether there is any appropriation other than that of the 10th June, 1908, under which &#163;750,000 is set aside for the payment of old-age pensions?

                            <para>-  I submit that we ought to follow the practice of this House as well as the practice of the House of Commons. If your ruling be upheld, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I can hardly conceive of a measure in connexion with which honorable members will not be deprived of the right to make an amendment in the direction you have mentioned. How can one say what will be the effect of the amendment? The honorable member for Darling has pointed out that further amendments may be proposed which will have the effect of decreasing the proposed charge. We have either to accept what the Government bring down, or we have to vote against any amendment. That is the situation under your ruling, and it would place the Committee in a very unfortunate position. As it is, it would be perfectly competent for an honorable member to move the omission of a clause, the absence of which would render the Bill void for want of particularity, since it would not prescribe to whom the pensions should be payable. We may do that yet - we may not liberalize the measure in any way. Those who vote in support of your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> will saddle themselves with the responsibility of taking from the Committee the right to make this measure that which the people are entitled to expect. </para>

                            <para>-  It is absolutely true. If such a method of restricting discussion were carried out generally, Parliament would be reduced to a nullity; we should merely be able to vote like automata. I am anxious to ascertain whether we are not able to pay pensions to those who have reached the age at which the Commonwealth and the States declare their servants may be retired; yet we cannot obtain such an expression of opinion in this Committee. Yet an ordinary resolution might be moved, putting on record the opinion of honorable members, in precisely the same way as is proposed in the amendment, and it would have the same force at law; unless it were backed up by an Appropriation Bill, it would not enable the pensions to &#39;be paid. I hope that your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> will be dissented from, and that we shall have an opportunity to test the feeling of the Committee. Whether the amount is large or small the principle involved is the same. Honorable members cannot justify their action in supporting your ruling by the excuse that the amount involved may be very great. There is a big principle at stake. It is clear that it is recognised in the British Parliament, and that it was followed this time last year in the British House of Commons, where a member was permitted to move an amendment involving an expenditure of &#163;800,000. I hope that the same right will be extended to honorable members of this House. </para>

                            <para>-  I think that the precedent which the honorable member for West Sydney quoted from the House of Commons practice is unanswerable. The Attorney-General also put the position very clearly when he pointed out that the Bill,, as it stands, is in order. To my mind, the Government acted rightly in introducing it before bringing down a message from&#62; the Crown. It is impossible to say what expenditure it will involve, and, consequently, they have deferred&#34; bringing down the message until they can ascertain what the additional expenditure is likely to be. I fail to see how honorable members can agree with your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman.</inline> I remember introducing a Bill into the South Australian House of Assembly, to provide- for the payment of a minimum wage of 7s. per day. There was then on record a resolution of Parliament that the minimum wage should be 6s. per day. That being so, the Bill that I introduced provided for an increased charge upon the people; but it was not challenged. </para>

                            <para>-  From 6s. a day for labourers up to 9s. There was not a word of dissent during the whole of that debate, although the Government were opposed to the measure on the ground that the finances were not in a condition to stand the strain. I feel quite sure that had the parliamentary practice been such as is now sought to be laid down, the Government would have taken very good care to stop the discussion. Do we come here only as destroyers of any measure the Government may bring forward - unable to amend a measure, no matter how defective it may be, or how just may be the proposed alterations? </para>

                            <para>-  The difference is that we, on th.s side, are in favour of doing justice, whereas the Chairman&#39;s ruling, if upheld, will prevent justice being done tq a large section of the community. The position is so impossible that I cannot understand a single member voting in favour of a ruling which means our abrogating our functions as representatives. In my opinion there is nothing to prevent any amendment the Committee may choose to make in the Bill; the only point is that the Government later on may, or may not, decide to bring down a message to cover the expenditure. I have heard no argument to destroy the previous ruling to which I have referred, or to cause us to disregard the practice of the House of &#39; Commons, and the practice of every State Parliament. </para>

                            <para>-  The Treasurer does not do himself justice in suggesting, that a second brief effort is not warranted on such an important question. This importance may not appeal to the right honorable gentleman at the present moment ; but possibly, at a later period, it may, and in such circumstances I am sure his normal generosity will return, and he will be the first to thank those members who endeavoured, successfully or otherwise, to place before the Committee the position in the fullest possible light. If honorable members bear in mind the fact that the ruling touches, not only the Bill under discussion, but also a very large percentage of the Bills which must subsequently be submitted, it is possible their decision may be different from what it otherwise might be. The ruling will be permanent, and will, in the future, control and guide every Bill wherein the question of &#34; expenditure, large or small, is raised. This is a feature honorable members should bear in mind, &#39;as a. reason for submitting the question to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> for a final decision which we can all accept as binding, instead of our having a decision &#39;of the Committee only, which&#34; may, in the immediate future, on some other Bill, be questioned, and then have to be submitted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> Honorable members may, in the future, have a Bill before them which proposes expenditure in some direction, and in which they seek to make an amendment, slight or otherwise ; and the ruling of the Chair, if to-night upheld, may result in an entirely different situation from that in  which we now are. Such a Bill may, in its main features, be approved of by other sections of the House, but their liberty will be confined and cabined by the ruling given ; and, manifestly, if they happen to be in a majority, the ruling will not be allowed to guide them, and, as I say, there will be an immediate appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> The point having been raised, it seems to me that we might, on this first occasion, secure as far as we can a final decision, so as to prevent future discussion. However, I have grave doubts whether honorable members will uphold the ruling, which, as I understand it, means that no non-official member is permitted to move such a resolution or amendment as will impose taxation or make an increase in the charges on the general revenue. If that be the situation, singularly enough there was a precisely , similar one brought about in 1901 on a motion submitted by the honorable member for Kennedy, the present  Chairman  of Committees. That motion of the honorable member was distinctly and without any equivocation to increase taxation, and was more pointed in its effect than are the amendments proposed to-day, whereby the charge on the revenue is of a doubtful character, and is not to be enforced in any shape or form unless the Ministry afterwards, of their own volition, bring down a recommendation from the Governor-General. </para>

I believe that the honorable member for Parramatta would be one of the first to object to any curtailment of the privileges he at present enjoys, or of any of the rights of Parliament ; from my reading of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the honorable member took the fullest possible advantage of all the privileges the Standing Orders gave him when he was on this side of the House.

Even if every amendment submitted this evening upon the Bill is carried, and makes an additional charge upon the people or the revenue, it lies with the Government to secure a recommendation from the Governor-General that those charges should be imposed, and if they neglect or fail to do so, or disagree with, the policy of doing so, those amendments will- have absolutely no more effect than would an abstract resolution covering the pious aspiration of some private member. &#34; The ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> on that occasion, was as follows : - </para>

                        <para>I may say  1  have known for some four weeks past that this question would arise at some stage of the proceedings on the Tariff, and I have, therefore, given it very careful consideration. When first this was made known to me, I at once conceived that the idea of any. unofficial member proposing an increase of an item of taxation asked for by the Crown was contrary to the spirit of parliamentary government, the spirit of parliamentary government being that the Crown asks for an impost to be made on the people, and the- people&#39;s representatives in Parliament consider the request of the Crown, and mav grant the request, or may grant a lesser amount, but would not conceivably give &#60;o the Crown a larger sum than the Crown asks should be imposed. When, however, I went from the question of the spirit of parliamentary government to the practice which has grown up as parliamentary institutions have developed, I am obliged to admit that in the House of Commons, which is the standard of our proceedings, where it is not otherwise set out in our Standing Orders the practice of proposing imposts on items not suggested as subjects of taxation by the Crown, and of proposing increases on items which are suggested as subjects of taxation, has sprung up, and that on several occasions, without any objection being taken, new taxes have been proposed by unofficial members, and increases on details of new taxes suggested by the Government. . . . There are cases which I am quite prepared to quote, but which, I understand, the  Chairman  has already cited. One case dates back to 1S40, and another can be seen in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> vol. i, 218, page 1041. Striving to interpret the practice of the House of Commons by the practice in other Parliaments, I find that in Canada the same course has been followed ; and also in Victoria, where attention was called to the importance of the matter. In South Australia, according to Blackmore&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Practice of the House of Assembly,</inline> the practice was followed in 1870 and on other occasions. Therefore, ruling as I have to rule, that neither Standing Order 171 nor Standing Order 247 applies to this case - as we <inline font-style="italic">are now</inline> dealing with a resolution in Committee only, and the Bill stage will come later - and falling back on Standing Order No. 1, which incorporates the practice of the House of Commons, I am bound to decide that the  Chairman  has correctly determined the practice in this House, which is that duties on items may be increased, and that other items which are mentioned in the Tariff on which no duty is proposed may be proposed as subject for duty, and that in that way the House will have the freest possible hand in debating the Tariff. </para>

The whole subject is embraced within that ruling, which, by a peculiar coincidence, arose as the result of a motion submitted by yourself. I hope that in the circumstances honorable members will reconsider any decision which they had already arrived at, in order to secure a final decision from the  Speaker.  Unless we do so, whenever a Bill involving a . question of expenditure is submitted, and an amendment is moved, we shall possibly have hours of debate on its admissibility. It is even possible that at some future time you may not be in the chair, sir, and that we may again have in the chair the honorable: member who, in 1901, held your position to his credit and to the honour of his electors and the House. We may then have him giving an entirely different decision from that which <inline font-style="italic">you</inline> have given tonight.

The right honorable member for East Sydney quoted from the tenth edition, but the wording is precisely the same there as in the eleventh. If he had gone a little further and had read what appears on pages 563 and 564 of the eleventh edition, under the heading of &#34;No increase of sums demanded on behalf of the Crown,&#34; he might have come to a differentconclusion. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> there says : - </para>

As the resolution sanctions, without any specific limitation, the application of money to be provided by Parliament to certain purposes, when the clauses in a Bill founded upon such a resolution are before the Committee, the freedom of action sanctioned by that resolution can be exercised. </para>

                    <para class="block">We have no such message. There is no limitation placed on the amount of expenditure, and consequently, we are justified, not only in assuming, but in saying, that we do not know what the limitations of the message will be when it comes down. In the first case, it is a question of a message coming down in general terms, and in such circumstances a private member is permitted to move to amend the Bill, so as to increase the charge upon the revenue. In this case, however, we have no recommendation whatever from the Crown, and, therefore, we do not know whether, when it does come down, it will be in specific or general terms. As a matter of fact, the Ministry themselves are not able to limit their recommendation. Had they brought one down prior to the introduction qf the Bill, it must necessarily have been in general terms, for they do not know themselves the extent of their proposals. We have merely a rough estimate from the Treasurer that the increased expenditure will be about &#163;34,000. If any more definite declaration is required, it is supplied in these words : - </para>

                            <para>- The practice has grown up in this House that messages need not precede Bills of this kind. That, indeed,  is clearly laid down in section 56 . of the Constitution. When the Attorney-General assists me by saying that, even when the messages are brought down, they are not specific, I can only reply that it is reasonable to believe, as <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> states clearly, that the recommendations may&#39; or may not be specific, but that the reverse is the practice in the House of Commons. What shall be the practice here is a matter entirely for Ministers, because they are not limited in any shape or form. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> states that - </para>

                            <para>-  I think not. The right honorable member for East Sydney, in order to substantiate the position he took up, quoted from <inline font-style="italic">May.</inline> I also have referred to the same authority, and have shown that it is clearly laid down that, so far as our present situation is concerned, at all events, the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Wide Bay does not of itself impose a burden upon the taxpayers or a charge upon the revenue. Such a burden is only imposed if the proposal meets with the approval of the Crown, and Ministers in their wisdom, seek a recommendation from the Governor-General. I am sorry to have spoken at such length, but the importance of the ruling is so great, and its effect will be so far-reaching, that  1  think we are justified in searching all the authorities, and exhausting all possible avenues, in order that we may obtain a decision which will be final, and can be accepted by the House. I hope that on this occasion &#39; honorable members will not give anything approaching a party vote, but that they will, if only to conserve the time of the House in future, allow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> he being the only authority, the final decision of such an important matter. </para>

There is no edition published in 1902, as he jocularly suggested. In such circumstances, his condition of mind will be exposed, and not to his credit. I hope that the motion will be agreed to, in order that we may obtain a final decision. If the point is not now referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> your decision, sir, must of necessity be debated hereafter, because of the fact that in 1901 the honorable member for Wakefield, who still presides over the deliberations of the House, gave a different ruling, and it is not known whether his opinion on this most important subject is changed. In the circumstances, I can, with the greatest confidence, ask that, irrespective of party considerations, the motion to disagree with your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> be approved of. </para>

I am sure that the honorable member did not. deliberately seek to convey such an impression, but probably he had not read the whole of the debate that took place. On referring to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> he will see that there was considerable discussion as to the right of a non-official member to propose an increase of duty. In the circumstances, I told the honorable member for Wide Bay that I would deliberately move an increase of duty, in order that the question might be settled.

                            <para>- The excellent speech delivered by the honorable member for Adelaide was somewhat marred, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> by a. personal reference to yourself, and to the position you occupy. The honorable member suggested that in the next Parliament the position of  Chairman  of Committees would probably be occupied by some one else, who would reverse your decision on the point of order now raised. Such a remark might well have been left unsaid. I am certain that had it been made by an honorable member on this side of the House, it would have been construed by the Opposition into a veiled threat that something would happen if a decision adverse to the view of our party were given by you. I do not suggest that the honorable member had such an idea in his mind at the time, but his remarks were certainly likely to give rise to that impression. Our debates should be entirely free from any statement that might be construed or misconstrued into a veiled threat of reprisal against an officer who conscientiously gives a decision, which may be opposed to the opinions that we ourselves hold. </para>

                            <para>- In this case there was no suggestion of jocularity. The remark was made seriously. But even jokes can be, and are often, made a vehicle for veiled threats. I am not suggesting that the honorable member desired to make anything in the nature of a veiled threat, but I sincerely hope that we shall not have recourse to such a method of procedure. We have also been urged to deal with this question from a non-party point of view. That is certainly most desirable, for the same point may arise in connexion with any Bill. There has been, however, a distinct attempt, cn the part of the honorable member for West Sydney, to give a party complexion to the votes of honorable members on the question of your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman.</inline> He went so far as to say that if honorable members dared to sustain your ruling, no matter how conscientiously they might vote, their action would be taken as adverse to the pensioners. That is a very improper attitude for the honorable member for West Sydney to take up, and it shows that there is an attempt on the part of certain honor able members of the Opposition, for electioneering purposes, to give a non-existent party complexion to this question. I resent their attitude very strongly, because it is well known that honorable members on this side are just as sympathetically disposed towards old-age pensioners as are members of the Opposition. But we would scorn to revert to such unworthy tactics. We can give a vote quite honestly adverse to the proposal before the Committee, and yet still be in thorough sympathy with the object of the suggested amendment. </para>

As to the power of private members to propose&#34; amendments, which, although not directly in the nature of an increase, may have the effect of increasing taxation, I have followed carefully the arguments and quotations of the honorable member for Adelaide, and I think that he slopped short in some of the extracts he read us from <inline font-style="italic">May.</inline> Had the honorable member read a little further, he would have seen that another complexion was put on the matter - that the authority quoted seemed to sustain the ruling that has been given.

In like manner, no increase can be considered by the House, except on the initiative of a Minister, acting on behalf of the Crown, either of an existing, or of a new or temporary tax for the service of the year; nor can a member other than a Minister move for the introduction of a Bill framed to effect a reduction of duties, which would incidentally effect the increase of an existing duty, or the imposition of a new tax, although the aggregate amount of imposition would be diminished by the provisions of the Bill. </para>

                            <para>-  I do not see that what is written on the next page has really anything to do with the matter. The point  1  wish to make is that, although the amendment is not a direct proposal to increase taxation, it is of such a character that in its operation it will possibly, and very probably, have the effect of increasing taxation. Indeed, that it will do so, has been admitted. It certainly will have the effect of greatly increasing the charge on the public revenue ; and that, I take it, is tantamount in all respects to an increase of taxation. So far as I remember, the practice ever since I became a member of this House has been that no private member may propose an increase of taxation or of duties. The honorable member for Hindmarsh argued that it was quite permissible for a private member to move an increase of duties or taxes; but we find it specifically laid down in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> that no increase can &#34;be proposed except by a Minister. That principle was laid down in discussions on the Tariff, and has always been acted upon when we have been dealing with the Budget or Estimates. </para>

                            <para>-  I do not propose to follow the example of the honorable member for Lang, and other honorable members opposite, in quoting long extracts from authorities which have, in very many instances, but a remote bearing on the question. Under the circumstances that presented themselves this afternoon you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonald,</inline> were wise in taking a somewhat conservative view of the privileges of the Committee, and in throwing on honorable members, either in Committee or through the  Speaker,  the responsibility of saying what shall be the practice. The Committee is invited by your ruling to make a precedent for themselves - to lay down a rule for your guidance. The question is whether the <inline font-style="italic">Committee is</inline> going to deprive themselves of powers, or to arm itself with the amplest privilege. A good deal is to be said in <inline font-style="italic">favour of extending the</inline> powers of the Committee. Any rule laid down at the present time must govern our proceedings in regard to, not only the Bill now before us, but all other Bills. The Committee would, therefore, be wise in taking the largest powers. It would be absurd to tie its hands merely to burk the discussion of the proposal of the honorable member for Wide Bay. If that is not discussed now, it can be discussed subsequently on a specific motion. Therefore, I appeal to honorable members to look  at this matter entirely as it affects the powers of the Committee, and to deal with the proposal of the honorable member for Wide Bay on its merits. </para>

                            <para>-  Whenever I have acted as temporary  Chairman,  I have endeavoured to give expression to the views of the  Chairman,  not to my personal views. It would be ridiculous for a temporary  Chairman,  &#34;drest in a little brief authority,&#34; to give a ruling contrary to that of the  Chairman.  This is not a matter for party strife. Does not the right honorable member see that if, as he admits, there is a doubt, the decision should lie in the interests of freedom? Why should we limit our powers? In dealing with a Defence Bill we shall be in the same position as we are in with regard to this Bill. We shall be unable,&#39; not merely to obtain a decision on proposed amendments, but even to get an opportunity for their discussion. Whether the proposal of the&#34; honorable member for Wide Bay be right or wrong, it is certainly wrong that he should be prevented from discussing it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman&#39;s</inline> ruling strikes at the roots of parliamentary freedom, and gags the Committee. If it is to hold good, we shall not be able to do anything more than accept or reject the proposals o&#163; the Government. This is not a party question, though the Treasurer has made it so. It is despicable for the Government to use a temporary majority to destroy the privileges of the Committee. I would not be guilty of such conduct. </para>

                            <para>-  I agree with the honorable member for Boothby that the question is one of abstract principle, as affecting the practice of the Committee, and will have application beyond the immediate issue upon which it has been raised. I agree with your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> and think it ought to be upheld in the interests of parliamentary practice. The honorable mem- % ber for Adelaide used a long argument regarding the increase of items in the Tariff. He seemed to think that that settled the question, because it had been ruled that the Committee might increase taxes which had been proposed. He thought that applied to this case; but I apprehend that it does not. This is a case of a proposal made bv the responsible Government, who have to provide the ways and means, and if any private member in the Committee can secure a majority to impose an outlay of ten or twenty thousand pounds, or more, without having the responsibility of finding the money, it is a most dangerous principle, which it would be most unfortunate to establish. At the present time, especially, I would warn honorable members that they ought to walk warily. We are proceeding at an alarming rate of progression in our public expenditure. </para>

                            <para>-  I wish merely to point my argument, which is that honorable members ought to be careful how they interfere with the responsibility of the Government to find the money. If we vote expenditure in the way proposed, without making provision for it, we place the Government in a wrong position. That is a very awkward principle, and when I tell honorable members that the public expenditure of the whole of Australia has increased in seven years by &#163;7,500,000- </para>

If expenditure is allowed to be increased by irresponsible parties in the House, we may involve the country in very serious financial trouble. That is why I mentioned the extent to which our public expenditure is increasing. Your ruling is sound, and in accordance with all parliamentary principles. I should be sorry if the Committee, apart from party feeling altogether, and apart from the sympathy which we all have with the old-age pensions scheme, were to stultify itself &#34;By disregarding a well-recognised and absolutely necessary principle of parliamentary Government. </para>

The honorable member poses as an authority, but he has quoted no authorities, and the answer to his assertions is clear. The Government still have control ; they have not brought forward the appropriation; they have not brought down the Governor-General&#39;s message; and they can decline to carry out the decision of the Committee. Let us consider what the position would be on any similar measure. I want to keep clear of a discussion of the Bill itself, and I regret that some honorable members opposite find it impossible to do so. We ought to decide this important point on its merits. If the Committee went further than the Government were prepared to find the money for, the honorable member knows that the Government could refuse to act. They could even drop the Bill, in defiance of the decision of the majority of the Committee. </para>

                            <para>-  The honorable member should keep clear of the Bill. Why should the Government side bring in the. question of the Bill, when they have so big a majority? No matter how solidly this side voted, we could not force the Government to do anything that they did not want to do. I do not know how members are going to vote on this question, but the situation is a serious one, and the effect will be most serious if  your ruling is upheld. We all have great confidence in you, and in your knowledge of parliamentary practice; but, after listening to the debate, I feel that we are bound to vote against your ruling in this case if we are to observe the Standing Orders that we have ourselves adopted, because one of those Standing Orders provides that where the Standing Orders themselves are silent, we must follow the practice of the House of Commons. Cases have been quoted tonight to show that recently, when an Old-age Pensions Bill was before the House of Commons, a private member actually moved an amendment involving an additional expenditure of  &#163;800,000,  and that no objection was raised to his action. The honorable member for Adelaide also quoted from <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> to show that private members have power in these cases to propose such amendments - a point which the honorable member for Mernda quite ignored when referring to the honorable member for Adelaide&#39;s argument, although I do not see how he could ignore it. Nothing could be more explicit than the pas. sages which the honorable member for Adelaide quoted from <inline font-style="italic">May.</inline> Our case has been absolutely proved, and there has been no reply to it. The practice of the House of Commons undoubtedly shows that we have the right to propose amendments to increase expenditure. </para>

                            <para>-  It seems most dangerous to limit ourselves in the work that we have to do, especially as the Government still retain control of the purse. They need not provide an appropriation, and in that way they still have power to defeat the decision even of a majority of the Committee. I do not know that they would be justified in doing so, but they undoubtedly have that power. If we uphold your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> we shall close the door on ourselves with regard to many Bills that are already on the business paper. We shall not be able to add a line to them, unless the Government themselves agree to do it. We shall not be able even to move to do so, or to discuss the question. Every thing will have to be done by the Government. The Committee will have no say, and it will be of no use for us to sit here at all. We can only do less than what the Government propose, and it will be necessary to have an extremely Radical Government, which goes miles ahead of the wishes of the House. In that case, we should have a chance to cut down their proposals for expenditure. Under this ruling, we could not add to the Government proposals an amendment involving any additional expenditure whatever. Take as an illustration the proposal to establish a Bureau of Agriculture. Even if we all agreed that it would be desirable to add another Department to it, the Committee could not do so. No private member could propose it, and it would be left for the Government to move it. They might say that they had not the money, and the , Treasurer would hold the key of the position. We should be putting ourselves in the hands of an autocrat. The same question would arise in connexion with defence, which is a very big matter, involving large expenditure. The difference in our proposals might run into thousands of pounds, and yet the Committee dare not propose an amendment involving additional expenditure. Although we can give away battleships that cost millions, we could not propose the addition of a torpedo boat. </para>

                            <para>-  It would mean that the representatives whom the people have elected would be of no use, and that the only man controlling the Commonwealth would be the right honorable the Treasurer. If he said that he had not the money, we could not propose any thing which cost even an additional pound. &#34;That position, which some honorable members have declared themselves ready to vote for, is absolutely ridiculous and an outrage on the common sense by which we are supposed to be guided. The alternative position leaves us free always, although we are not likely to do anything rash, and at the same time it takes away no power from the Cabinet. It gives the Committee the power that it ought to have. As we ourselves have the right to decide this issue, I cannot understand honorable members voting to curtail their own powers, and to prevent themselves from doing something which they want to do now, or may want to do next week. I should be sorry to think that there was in any honorable member&#39;s mind a desire to prevent a vote on a specific issue. I hope there is nothing of that kind, but, although I have not a suspicious nature, I am very puzzled by the attitude 0/ certain honorable members on this occasion. The right honorable member for East Sydney, after discussing the question very ably, admitted that it was quite debatable, and by no means clear. He is the only one on that side who has gone into the question. From the Attorney-General, who would have given us from his old position a very carefully-thought-out address, we have heard nothing to-night which anybody could make head or tail of. Why did he not speak out? Why have not some Ministers risen to discuss the question ? Their silence is not fair to the Committee. We on this side have done our best, and a number of honorable members have taken a great deal of trouble in ransacking the authorities and the records of the House of Commons to arrive at the correct view, but we have had. no help and no enlightenment from the experienced Ministers opposite. I cannot understand it, nor can I understand any honorable member voting in such a way as to tie himself up. Certain honorable members on the Government side, who on other occasions shout loudly for freedom, have been conspicuously silent this evening. In this case, judging by their attitude, they intend to deprive themselves of freedom. We must all give you credit, sir, for being consistent. You pointed out, in giving your ruling, the difficult position in which you were placed. You reasoned out very well the position that you took up, and said that, having regard to a previous decision, you must rule in a certain way. You certainly indicated that you would not consider that any reflection was cast on you by our voting against your decision. I have always a tendency at meetings and conferences to stand by the  Chairman,  but no such consideration arises in -a case of this kind. There is an important principle at stake, and it is for the Committee to lay down a precedent for its future guidance. I cannot conceive of there being more than a small minority of honorable members in favour of voting to cut down their own power. If your ruling be agreed to, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> we shall have to accept whatever the Government choose to bring down. The honorable member for Mernda misunderstood the object with which a quotation was made in regard to the course adopted in a certain case. If we do not disagree with your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> we shall vote against a principle that we have already adopted for our guidance. The passing of the proposed amendment would not necessarily mean the imposition of an increased burden on the people. No message has been brought down, and no one is able to say what will be necessary to finance the Bill. The amount to be allotted for the purposes of the Bill will depend upon the estimates that are made, and it will be voted from time to time upon Appropriation Bills. I hope that the Committee will vote against the decision of the  Chairman. </para>

I would point out, however, that one discussion took place upon a resolution, and that an amendment was moved for a definition of the amount that was to be appropriated- It is quite competent for any honorable member to take such an action on a resolution in Committee. </para>

There was a discussion on the Bill in the House of Commons and the Government gave a very plain notification that if any such an amendment as was suggested were adopted, they would drop the measure. </para>

                            <para>-  I think that the honorable member is wrong. The. balance of proof in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> is in favour of those who believe that the power to propose an increased burden should not be exercised by a private member. I urge that the debate which took place upon the Bill in Committee of the House of Commons should not be absolutely relied upon, because no decision was given. The most that can be argued is that there was a &#39;failure on the part of those interested to raise the question on a point of order. </para>

I have already expressed my opinion as to what ought to be done in that regard, so that honorable members opposite will surely acquit me of any desire to take advantage of them. Clause 12, providing as it does for an increased charge, makes it imperative that the Bill should have been preceded by a resolution. But because that was not done, it is not to be said that honorable members are entitled to disagree with the Chairman&#39;s ruling, which, in my opinion, is substantially correct, and ought to be upheld. </para>

                            <para>- A change of tone has come over the discussion which requires some observation. There is now a disposition to regard the matter under your notice, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> as if an interference with the rights possessed by honorable members as representatives of the people were involved. The rights of the representatives of the people are controlled by the laws which govern our proceedings. Their rights are limited. They have no right, for instance, by physical force to drag Ministers from the Treasury Bench. That is an. interference with their liberty. There is another provision in our Standing Orders, which have all the force of law, that we are to be guided in certain circumstances by the rules and forms of the House of Commons. That, too, is an interference with our liberty. Some honorable members might like to have it removed; but whilst it exists we must respect the laws under which we are governed. So far from your ruling distinguishing between the rights of private members and those of Ministers, it would prevent the Prime Minister from moving an amendment of this sort just as it would prevent a private member from doing so.. Ministers themselves cannot move to amend a Bill which is not a money Bill, so as to make it a money Bill. There is a class of Bills which are not money Bills, and there is another class that are money Bills. No Minister can introduce into: a measure that is not a money Bill a clause that would make it one. A money Bill cannot be considered by this House unless the subject of it has been introduced and a resolution passed in a &#39;Committee of the whole. There must also be a message from the Governor-General- before that Committee can deal with it. The Committee cannot consider a resolution as the foundation of a money Bill until the Governor-General has sent a certain message to this House. That is an interference with our rights, but it is the law. Then, this House must, in Committee, affirm the propriety of introducing <inline font-style="italic">3.</inline> Bill which involves a charge upon the people before such a Bill can be introduced. That is a limitation upon the rights of Ministers. A Minister cannot introduce a money Bill unless he follows the course I have mentioned. On your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> it is clear that this Bill is not properly before the House. It should have been preceded by a message and by a Committee. The rule that makes it irregular to consider an amendment which would increase a burden upon the people by &#163;500,000 also prevents the Government from increasing a burden on the people by &#163;34,000 a year, unless a certain course is followed. These are the rules by which we are to be guided, and it is absurd to say that in endeavouring to uphold those rules we are seeking to deprive any honorable member of a right he possesses. An honorable member does not possess the right to initiate taxation, to create charges upon the people, and Ministers do not possess the right to do so except in a specific way. My objection to the honorable member for Wide Bay&#39;s amendment goes very much further. It appl&#39;es equally to an amendment moved by a Minister, as it would to an amendment moved by a private member. We are losing sight of the fact that no Bill in the nature of a money Bill - that is to say, which creates a charge on the people - can be dealt with except certain precedent steps have been taken. The Old-age Pensions Bill in the House of Commons, to which attention has been drawn, was preceded by a message from the Crown, and there was a resolution in </para>

                            <para>-  I only mention the fact that there was a message from the Crown, which there has not been in this case. We have had no authorization by resolution from a Committee of the Whole for the introduction of such a Bill; and that is my objection to the amendment. If this Bill had been preceded by a Governor-General&#39;s message of a general character, which is the usual form, then, I think this Committee might very well be held to have complete power under that message. </para>

                            <para>-  In dealing with the ruling I am anxious to show what the rights of the Committee would be if the foundation of those rights were there ; but the misfortune is that there is no foundation for this Bill as a money Bill - a fact which applies equally against the Minister as against the honorable member for Wide Bay. In my view, if any objection were taken to the Bill <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> account of the proposal of the Minister to reduce the qualification for a pension, the objection would be equally fatal. I am dealing with this as a matter of principle, and with  jio  desire to fetter the rights of honorable members. I have had painful experience of the effect of following the rule of the House of Commons. I remember on one occasion, at least, I introduced a very important measure, and. because there was a provision for appointing an officer - not an appropriation of money for his salary, but simply provision for his appointment to perform certain duties - the  Speaker,  following the usage of the House of Commons, ruled that it became a money Bill, and that it was improperly before the House, seeing that it should have been preceded by a message and a resolution of the Committee of the Whole. If these conditions had been fulfilled, there would have been no objection either to the proposal of the Government, or to any amendment being proposed by an ordinary member. My point in this case is that the foundation does not exist for the freedom of the Committee in dealing with the Bill - that the Bill, having been introduced as one which is not a money Bill, we have no power by amendment to convert it into a money Bill. </para>

                            <para>-  And we can understand the reason for that. Ministers are responsible for finding the ways and means for carrying on the Government. How can we carry on our system of government if the finances of the Government depend on members dealing with Bills in this Chamber? There would be nothing but chaos. There is a well-understood limitation of the rights of private members, bv which we are bound. It may be, perhaps, advisable some day to consider a different style of government; but we are bound by the parliamentary government which has been established in the House of Commons, and, so far as I know, in all the Australian Legislatures. </para>

                            <para>-  I intend to vote for the motion dissenting from your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman.</inline> That, is a very intricate matter, and we must give some attention to the experience of the right honorable member for East Sydney, having regard to his trained mind. I am well aware that you, sir, are more than the  chairman  of a public meeting, and that you have certain rules and practices for your guidance; but, as a private member, I am not always going to be guided absolutely by practices elsewhere. Time after time this House, to suit its own purposes, has had to depart from the practice #f the House of Commons; and on the present&#34; occasion we have simply to exercise judgment. If the Bill has been introduced wrongly, even in view of the British precedents, it ought to be thrown under the table. This is not a matter of sentiment; and I certainly do think that the ruling which has been given is an invasion of our powers as representatives. If the ruling shuts out the introduction of certain amendments, I am, so far, prevented from casting a vote. The question whether an amendment means taxation or a charge on the Treasury could be dealt with when the amendment itself is before the Committee. Why should we not make a precedent without in any way casting a reflection on the Chair? I cannot understand any man saying that this is a party matter, because to do so is simply begging the question. Honorable members on this side, who say that if we vote against the Chairman&#39;s ruling we are taking away the Government&#39;s responsibility, are equally silly with those who talk about this being a party question. My vote may be ill-advised; but I think it desirable, not only in view of the measure before us, but of other measures which will be subsequently introduced. The common sense of honorable members, whether in House or Committee, will always assert itself in regard to amendments ; and I see no reason why we should be led by the practice of the House of Commons, or the practice of any other Legislature. It is my intention to endeavour to obtain further power as a private member, and, therefore, I must oppose the ruling. </para>

                            <para>-  My parliamentary experience is limited, and I have listened attentively to the arguments for and against the motion. I have been considerably impressed by the remarks of the right honorable member for East Sydney, and also by what we have been told of the practice of the House of Commons last year when dealing with the Old-age Pensions Bill. The right honorable member said that this is either a money Bill, or it is not ; that if it is a money Bill, it has been wrongly introduced, and is wrongly before us ; and that if it is not a money Bill, we have no power by amendment to make it a money Bill. The amendment proposed is to reduce the qualifying age of pensioners from sixty-five years to sixty; and if it is alleged that this would make it a money Bill, then surely the clause which reduces the qualifying period of residence also makes it a money Bill. It would appear to be a money Bill ; and, therefore, to be wrongly before the Committee. At the same time, we are bound by the practice of the House of Commons; and we have from the honorable member for Laanecoorie the fact that when the Old-age Pensions Bill was being discussed in England, private members did move amendments in Committee which would have considerably increased the charge on the people. It is all very well to say that the point was never raised in the House of Commons ; but we know that on that occasion the Government were met with tremendous obstruction and long discussions; and we cannot imagine that, if there had been the slightest hope of the discussion being stopped, the point of order would not have been taken. We find, however, that pages of discussion are recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and that, in order to put an end to the talk, the Government had to use the closure. That seems to be the last precedent, and it is the precedent by which I shall be guided. At the same time, I agree with the right honorable member for East Sydney that the Bill has been wrongly introduced ; and if the Government did right they would withdraw it, and reintroduce it. </para>

                            <para>- We have already had a very long discussion on this question, and, therefore, I am prepared to give my ruling at once. Let me begin by pointing out that the system of amending and consolidating legislation at the same time places me in a very difficult position, and throws upon me work which I should not have to do. Not only have I to give my attention to the Bill before the Committee; I have also to compare it carefully with the principal Act, in order to ascertain what its clauses mean. Unless read with the principal Act, the clauses of Bills such as that now before the Committee convey no meaning. I understood from the honorable member for Wide Bay that the effect of the amendment he has just moved would be practically the same as that of the last amendment. If it is intended merely to bring about a reversal of my decision, it is distinctly out of order. Of course, the honorable member has merely moved the insertion in the clause of a proposal fo omit words from the principal Act. &#34;That amendment by itself means nothing. I cannot know the intention of the honorable member for Wide Bay until I know what subsequent amendment he intends to move. </para>

                        <para>.- I am sorry that the honorable member for Wide Bay seems to desire to amend this beneficent measure in a way that is unacceptable to the Government. The Government have met the wishes of honorable members to the utmost extent in proposing to make the alterations which they considered, and! the House thought necessary yesterday, but if the proposals of the honorable member are to find favour in this Committee, all I can say is that it will be impossible for the Government to proceed with the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- -Why all this disorder? I am merely stating the facts, and before I sit down I shall show (hat the honorable member&#39;s proposals are not reasonable. I should like to ask him whether he had in his mind when he was Treasurer and Prime Minister any such proposals as he made this afternoon, and is making to-night. I had no notice, until the honorable member proposed them this afternoon, that they were even contemplated. No one told me, or suggested to me, or even whispered to me that the Bill was to be enlarged in the way now proposed, and the expenditure increased  to such an enormous extent. The honorable member for Wide Bay claimed last night that the Bill was in draft when he left the Treasury. I&#39; interjected that I did not think it was in draft, and he replied that that was only trifling with the question, as it was settled before he left office. As a matter of fact, it was not in draft, but the terms of it had been arranged before the honorable member left. I do not think it has been altered in any material way, but it was actually drafted by the Law officers after I assumed office as Treasurer. The honorable member also said that the delay in passing the Bill was caused by the action of honorable members on this side. He, therefore, not only took credit for the Bill as it was in draft, and I can say that the draft, as submitted to me, has not been altered in any material way. I again ask him if the provisions that he has proposed to-night were in his Bill when he left the Treasury. If he did not . suggest their inclusion to those who were drafting the Bill, what induces him now to propose them? I am not going to mince matters. I consider that his proposals are mischievous, and he knows as well as I do that under existing conditions they are impossible. </para>

That would mean that instead of women receiving them, as in the case at present, at the age of sixty-five, they would receive them at the age of sixty. The estimate of the Treasury is that that would involve an additional expenditure of about &#163;400,000 per year. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but it is not possible just now. Before submitting proposals for largely increasing the ex1penditure, honorable members might reasonably have been expected to await the delivery of the Budget so that they would know what is the exact financial position of the Commonwealth. The utter recklessness of the honorable member for Wide Bay - I can use no milder term - in now desiring to increase immensely the burden on the people, although when Treasurer he did not propose to increase the expenditure in this way, shows, I think, that he must have been actuated by some party motive in submitting these proposals. Had he thought of making them when he was Treasurer he would have announced the fact at the time. But the responsibility of financing them was then upon him, and he was afraid to face it. He knew that it was too great. Now, however, that the responsibility has been removed from him he does not care what burden is placed on the people. The honorable member&#39;s proposals on their merits are impossible. </para>

                            <para>- That will be a matter for the Cabinet to consider. But with the funds at their disposal it would be impossible for the Government to find this year the money necessary to give effect to all these proposals. I make that statement with a full knowledge of the financial position. If honorable members elect to wreck the Bill by making  the expenditure under it heavier than we can provide for, the responsibility will be upon them. I hope, however, they will not do so, We have tried to meet the views of honorable members by making certain provisions retrospective, although in that way alone the expenditure will be- increased by over &#163;30,000 per annum. We have been most anxious to secure the passing of the Bill at the earliest date possible, and I appeal to honorable members if they are really anxious that the principal Act should be amended in the way we propose, to assist us. It is impossible for one to obtain at once all that one wants. Speaking in the most friendly manner possible to honorable members opposite, I think that they will be acting in the interests of those whom&#39; they claim to specially represent - although I do not think that they do - by accepting what the Government propose instead of trying to secure something that is not at present obtainable. </para>

                            <para>-No such proposal as this was made by the honorable member for Wide Bay in his Gympie speech ; and he did not subsequently indicate that he intended to make any such proposition as he has submitted to-night. I have not been able to find anything to show that the honorable member intended, had he remained in office, to provide for the payment of invalid pensions this year. I hope, therefore, that the Opposition will not do anything to make the position of the Government more difficult than it is. </para>

Those who were prepared to take exception to the original Act may be expected to take exception to an amendment that would liberalize it by enabling women to obtain pensions at an earlier age than is now possible. </para>

                            <para>- The late Government, on account of their many difficulties and embarrassments - fighting for their very existence, although they were supposed to have friends in the corner - had very little time to do anything. But they did intend to considerably improve the lot of the recipients of old-age pensions, as they now seek to do. What are honorable members opposite going to do, now that the proposal is submitted? The Treasurer holds out the threat that we had better be careful about proposing amendments, but I challenge him to throw this Bill under the table, if he dare. The chief objection of the Treasurer is the difficulty of finding the money, and he calls the proposal reckless and mischievous. The Departmental officers estimate that the cost would amount to  &#163;390,000  per annum, and the Treasurer called that &#34; reckless and mischievous,&#34; though he does not apply the same description to the proposal to give  ,&#163;2,000,000  for a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline></para>

                            <para>- The honorable member can give no more information than he usually does.  It is quite fair that I should cite the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> against the .argument that .money is not available for these pensions. Then invalid pensions were contemplated in the Act, and figures have been quoted in connexion therewith; but the fact remains that these pensions have not been proclaimed ; all we can get from the Treasurer is that he is going to mention the matter in his Budget. No doubt the Budget will be most interesting, but the attitude of the Government in opposing provision for pensions for. women at sixty years of age is, in my opinion, contemptible. It is, apparently, considered desirable by the most competent authorities, as shown in the evidence given before the Royal Commission, but the Government put forward any excuse to evade -the payment. In my opinion, the Government cannot justify their position, and I hope they will not find a majority to support them. </para>

It is quite correct that I desire to meet the honorable gentleman as far as possible, but, as a matter of fact, the Treasurer came over to me, and asked if it was not a fair thing to report progress. I said at once quite frankly that I was quite willing to agree to that course being adopted. </para>

Under the circumstances, I think it would be regrettable if we separated to-night without knowing what is to be the order of business to-morrow. Most of us regard the question of old-age pensions as of such importance that we are prepared to forego any little business of our own to enable the Bill, which has been under consideration to-day, to be disposed of. I admit that with the honorable member for Hume the question of Tariff reform is a sort of&#39; political old-age pensions. I do not know whether the Prime Minister is able to assure us that we shall be called upon to deal with the important measure, the debate upon which was interrupted just now by a reckless proposal on the part of honorable members opposite- </para>

                        <para>.- It is amazing to hear the Government pleading that honorable members should forego their right to have their private business discussed, in order that they may push on with the Old-age Pensions Bill. It is only by the merest accident that they have been enabled to proceed with that measure at all. After having been in office for seven weeks, they were not in a position to supply honorable members with copies of the Bills which they wished us to discuss. In my judgment, the honorable member for Hume is quite right, and is acting practically as a benefactor to the Government in proposing to take up time to-morrow afternoon, in spite of what they have stated, so as to enable them to get ready to place the business of this country before the House in, at any rate, an intelligent form. </para>
