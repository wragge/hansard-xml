            <para>. - After the adjournment of the House on Friday, Ministers, in pursuance of their promise, took into consideration the consequences of a vote which had been given against them on the previous afternoon, and on Saturday I paid an official visit to  His Excellency  the Governor-General, and stated to him that, in consequence of that vote, we thought that the best thing for the country would be the dissolution of this House. I asked  His Excellency  to give me time to present a written statement of our case, which he was good enough to allow me to do. Yesterday, Ministers communicated to him, in writing, an account of the facts as they understood them, and to-day, by command, I again waited upon  His Excellency,  when he intimated that he would notbe able to grant our request.  His Excellency  further promised to give me a written reply to the memorandum which I had submitted for his consideration. I thereupon tendered my resignation, and that of my colleagues. I have since received an official intimation that the honorable member for Ballarat has been sent for, and has been commissioned to form a new Administration. </para>

        <para class="block">It is with more than the usual regret occasioned by a duty of this kind that I move this motion. For a great number of years I was a personal acquaintance of the deceased gentleman, and intimately associated with him in social and political movements. All who knew him as an active member of the Labour Party, and as Premier of the State from which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> come, know that he was a man of whom any community might be proud.  His  reputation extended, hot merely over South Australia, but throughout the Commonwealth, and I have been personally informed from the centre of the Empire that, during his recent visit to Great Britain, he gained many friends there for himself and for Australia. I doubt if any one has won the hearts of the toiling masses of the United Kingdom more thoroughly and permanently than did he, and I am sure that I echo what is in the minds of every honorable member when I express my sympathy and condolence with his widow and family, and the desire that the blessing of Him who can soothe all sorrows may be upon those to whom he was near and dear. As for the service of the State, other men will no doubt be found to take up the work in which our deceased friend and colleague sogreatly distinguished himself, but a worthy and good citizen has undoubtedly passed from amongst the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>.- The encomium that the Prime Minister has passed upon the late Premier of South Australia is well deserved to the knowledge, I think, of every honorable member and of a very large section of the people whom we have the honour to represent. The honorable gentleman has spoken not for himself or his colleagues alone, but for the whole House. I feel sure that the ability of the late Premier of South Australia is appreciated by all who have watched his career, whether as a member of the Labour Party, as a leader of that party in the State Parliament, or, finally, as the Premierof that State, for a period, during which matters of the utmost moment were coped with by his Government. He has made his mark on the pages of South Australian history, and therefore on the history of the Commonwealth. In himself, he possessed, besides administrative ability, those gifts of speech to which the Prime Minister has properly alluded. These not only brought him into touch with the great bulk of those whom he addressed, but, as has been observed, won their way at once with men of all classes and of all shades of political opinion. This was due to the happy circumstance, that with him the heart and the head were never severed. When he spoke, he touched the feelings of his auditors because he was expressing his own, and when he pursued his arguments, in no case did he forget that he was a man speaking to men on important interests dear to all of them. We have reason to feel gratified that it fell to hislot to visit theMothercountryre- cently as a representative of his State. Those who know the real demands of such a visit, so far as they affected his physical strength, will realize that there, as elsewhere, having paid no heed to considerations of self, he spent himself too freely, as he did in his own State, in what he believed to be the public interest. It is not only as a Premier and as a leader, but as a man, that he won and held the esteem and regard of Australians. We know the trying circumstances under which he came to this country to distinguish himself in his own calling as an expert artisan. We know that his family relations and domestic life were all that could be desired, and great therefore must be the loss that has fallen there. This morning, I have ventured to communicate with those who have been left to mourn his death ; but am greatly pleased to have the opportunity of seconding a motion in support of which this House knows no divisions. We speak with one voice, as the people of Australia will speak in the future, in regard to a man whose sterling character, singleness of purpose, simplicity, and ingenuousness, commended him to their hearts. </para>

          <para>- Perhaps as one who sat for many years in the same House of Parliament as the deceased statesman, I may be permitted, before putting the motion, to add two or three words. In the first place, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price&#39;s</inline> personal qualities, as much as his public services, have commended him to the people of South Australia ; and next, I can assure the House that in that State, amid all political divisions, and among all classes of the community, there is but one expression of feeling to-day - an expression of extreme regret that so great a man should have passed away. </para>
