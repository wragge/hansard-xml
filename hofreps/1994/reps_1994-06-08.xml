<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The primary purpose of this bill is to facilitate South Australia's compliance with some of the principal conditions attached to the special assistance package which the Commonwealth is providing to South Australia over a period of three years. These conditions relate to the sale of the State Bank of South Australia&mdash;SBSA&mdash;subjecting the bank to Commonwealth taxation, and the transfer by legislation of prudential supervision powers over the bank to the Reserve Bank of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 17 February 1993, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) issued a press release stating that the government was prepared to provide special assistance to South Australia, with a present value of $600 million, in recognition of the extraordinary financial burden imposed on the people of South Australia as a consequence of the losses incurred by the SBSA. The severity of this financial burden was such that, in the absence of the special assistance package, South Australia's ability to participate in the economic recovery now under way would have been severely constrained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In return for the provision of the assistance, South Australia gave certain undertakings to the Commonwealth, including that<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the SBSA be sold as quickly as practicable consistent with achieving a fair market price; that the SBSA be brought into the Commonwealth's tax net free of tax losses from 1 July 1994; that the SBSA be subject to the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia no later than 1 July 1994 by legislation; and that a debt management strategy designed to restore South Australia's finances to a more sustainable position be implemented. The South Australian government is moving to comply with these conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process of preparing the SBSA for eventual sale involves the creation of a new corporatised entity from 1 July 1994 to be named the Bank of South Australia Ltd, or BankSA. BankSA will carry on the core business of the SBSA, including housing loans, credit cards, deposit facilities, and rural and business lending, and will continue to operate some interstate business in areas such as small-scale leasing and commercial lending. These activities are being transferred to BankSA under South Australian and complementary interstate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the conditions of South Australia's special assistance package were being agreed to, the previous Commonwealth Treasurer undertook to facilitate South Australia's compliance with the conditions through Commonwealth legislation where necessary or justified. In this context, amendments to Commonwealth legislation are required to accommodate the referral of banking supervision powers over the bank to the Commonwealth and to facilitate the process of subjecting the bank to Commonwealth taxes. In fulfilment of this undertaking, the bill contains amendments to the Banking Act 1959 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The bill also contains a number of other minor amendments to various acts, which will streamline and reduce the administrative costs associated with the transfer of assets from the SBSA to BankSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the Corporations Law will allow bulk notification to the Australian Securities Commission of the change of chargee of a group of registered company charges, and to enable the Australian Securities Commission to deregister subsidiaries of SBSA which have been dissolved under South Australian legislation. These amendments have been approved by the Ministerial Council for Corporations for introduction into parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 provide relief from the provisions relating to the passing of customer information from the SBSA to BankSA. The modifications are designed solely to facilitate the corporatisation of the SBSA and do not otherwise affect the operation or interpretation of the Privacy Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Fringe Benefits Assessment Act 1986 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 2) 1992 address transitional issues associated with the transfer of assets from the SBSA to the new bank, including to allow the transfer of SBSA customer tax file numbers to BankSA, and the imposition of Commonwealth taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments are also proposed to the Financial Transactions Reports (FTR) Act 1988 and the Proceeds of Crime (POC) Act 1987. These acts impose an obligation on banks and other financial institutions to maintain records relating to the opening and operation of accounts. The proposed amendments to these acts provide for the transfer of this obligation where accounts are transferred from one bank to another. The amendments are not limited to the SBSA but are of general application to all banks where accounts and records are transferred. Without the proposed amendments, the SBSA would be criminally liable for not complying with the provisions of these acts where it transferred such account records to BSAL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 include provisions to deny deductions to BankSA for superannuation contributions or eligible termination payments in respect of unfunded liabilities accumulated as at 30 June 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is determined to ensure that the banking system is the most efficient possible. Accordingly, this bill includes a number of minor amendments to the Banking Act 1959 to streamline its administration. These include amendments to:</PARA>
<PARA>.require branches of foreign banks to notify the Treasurer of any proposed arrangements, agreements or reconstructions of a foreign bank. If the Treasurer and the Governor-General are satisfied that these arrangements would not be in the national interest, this amendment gives the Governor-General in Council power to revoke the foreign bank's licence; and</PARA>
<PARA>.remove the need for the Treasurer, under section 70, to formally agree to the institution of proceedings against an offence under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends the Reserve Bank Act 1959, so that the responsibility for granting leave of absence from Reserve Bank Board meetings passes from the Treasurer to the Reserve Bank Board. In the past the responsibility of granting leave of absence to Reserve Bank Board members fell to the Treasurer. The arrangements served little useful purpose and were an unnecessary ministerial burden. Mr Speaker, I know this bill would be of considerable interest to you, as it would to other members of the House. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the Banking (State Bank of South Australia and Other Matters) Bill, I would like to put in some context why this action is necessary to resuscitate, as far as possible, the remnants of the State Bank in South Australia. It is easy to look at the bill which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) has just detailed at the dispatch box as an exercise in a technical sense. But we have to look in the long term at the reason why we are discussing this bill and we have to look at the reasons why the State Bank of South Australia became such a financial wreck.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for this go back some years to the stewardship of this Labor government in Australia. I remember the heat and argument that surrounded a vote in this House some years ago which was aimed at facilitating the action of the entrepreneur Mr Holmes a Court in his takeover offer for BHP. At that stage, we reached the apex of this government's involvement in the paper machinations of the entrepreneurs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hawke government was working hand in hand in developing that entrepreneurship in Australia. In fact, it was an active partner, as was illustrated by the admission of the government at the time that seven ministers had conferred with Mr Holmes a Court in relation to his adventures in moving in on Australia's biggest company. May I say how pleased I am that he failed in his attempt&mdash;an attempt which, if it had been successful, in the wreckage that ensued out of the recession caused by this government, would have resulted in the splitting of Australia's major company and selling it piecemeal to overseas owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all part of this background of the Labor Party in Australia, which was determined in its first rush of deregulation of the financial system to assist and encourage the activities, which brought so much ruin to this country, of entrepreneurs such as Skase, Bond and Holmes a Court. They borrowed simply on nothing more than the value of the shares they were purchasing with those borrowings, thoroughly and utterly encouraged by the Hawke Labor government and the ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bannon is a very prominent member of the Labor Party in South Australia and was at one time its federal president. Certainly he was one of Labor's much touted younger premiers around Australia. He was thoroughly infected with that same entrepreneurial attitude fostered by the Hawke government&mdash;the attitude of which you, Mr Speaker, know full well, having been a very effective chairman of the committee which investigated banking in Australia; and may I pay tribute to you, sir, on your leadership of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We found one of the gravest derelictions of duty by managers of Australia's financial institutions that we could ever expect to find. Upon questioning as to why they entered into these ventures and supported the paper investments in Australia, they simply had nothing more in answer than a schoolboy's retort, `We thought it would be okay. We just did it. We didn't know any better. There was too much competition.' All the charts on the walls and all the economists in their back rooms did nothing to dissuade this schoolboy attitude of `Let's go for it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the former Premier of South Australia did. His attitude to his State Bank was that it would make him millions, if not billions, of profits so that he could be the wonder Premier of South Australia and distribute these profits during his stewardship and management of South Australia. He would provide all these great things for his electors by these huge profits, which he, as a fellow government entrepreneur in parallel with the Holmes a Courts, the Skases and so on in this country, would also get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened? The bank was unleashed and encouraged to lend overseas, to lend anywhere&mdash;take the bank of last resort. If people could not get a loan from the already overstretched private banks, they could go to the State Bank of South Australia. Of course, when it crashed it was found that so many of these billions had ended up overseas. They have never been repaid. South Australian money ended up overseas, and we had the greatest corporate-government failure in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government stands responsible, make no mistake about it. It fostered this attitude. The main person in this, as I have said, is the former Premier of South Australia. The South Australian Treasurer simply failed to supervise the bank. He let it run and he encouraged it to run. It was supposed to have some unofficial supervision by the Reserve Bank. That too points to the failure of that institution to do its duty in looking fully at the situation in South Australia. But the main failure was political: it was failure of government administration, failure of a cabinet to question its Premier and failure deeply rooted in the outlook and policy decisions of the federal Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make that point with some vehemence because today South Australia has a government&mdash;it is a little over six months since it took the reins of office&mdash;having to do things which are difficult to sell to the community, having to take action, following an audit report which will hurt some members of that community, which is utterly necessary for the survival of the South Australian economy. Why is it doing so? Because of the failure of this bank. The Labor government in South Australia was recently defeated because of the failure we are now discussing and to which the minister brings this bill in as some partial remedy. Because of that failure an audit report is in place and the government now has to take tough action. Yet such is the hypocrisy of politics that this government and the very individuals in the Labor Party who caused this problem can turn and criticise the remedies that are now being put in place in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no fairness in politics, I suppose. Whoever can explain the best and has a run of luck can survive the longest. But let the people of South Australia make no mistake that the reason for this bill and for the tough decisions that are being taken by the government in South Australia goes back deep into the soul of the Labor Party; it goes to the immediately defeated government in South Australia and it runs back into the Hawke government in the national parliament and to the very actions it took in this parliament, such as the bill that I referred to which was passed to assist in the takeover of BHP by Mr Holmes a Court. There was no mention of the rescue of Holmes a Court by the Western Australian government. If it had not bought from the then financially derelict institution at a hugely inflated price the property in Perth, that company would now be alongside the Skases and the Bonds in the many failures that were left behind when the recession burst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go to the detail of this bill, except to say that it must be seen by itself as a desirable action. The government is to be commended, in a technical sense, for coming so far to the rescue as it has in this instance. A decision was made to assist to this degree. Without this assistance it would be very difficult to have the bank put into a position where, evolving from the wreckage, it can be sold and, hopefully, maintained largely, depending on the course of that sale, as a South Australian institution. South Australia has lost too many of its head offices over previous years. I hope in the sale of the bank that the head office does remain in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to the minister's statement that, by this bill, the government is determined to ensure that Australia has the most efficient banking system. He referred to the supervision of foreign banks. I have always been doubtful of the ability of the authorities in Australia&mdash;the Reserve Bank, the federal Treasury and the government itself&mdash;to properly understand the financial details of a foreign bank operating in Australia. It is all very well for the minister to say that, if the government or the Reserve Bank is doubtful of the credentials and the financial stability of a foreign bank operating in Australia, it will revoke the bank's licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just in passing, I express my extreme doubt that any authorities in Australia will be able to ascertain the finer details of a foreign bank to the degree that they would know whether it should be allowed to continue in Australia. History, especially in relation to the BCCI bank, has proven that regulatory authorities are at an extreme disadvantage in many cases in knowing the ramifications of international transfers and international ownership. Therefore, if the government proceeds along this line, I expect that there will be further difficulties some time in the future. But that is another factor that the government, or the Labor Party in opposition in the future, will have to place alongside its political conscience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would know, Mr Speaker, the history of the State Bank in recent years has been a very unpleasant one. The banking inquiry had before it an annual report, which was signed by the deputy chairman and of a most optimistic nature, for seven or eight days before the dam burst and the announcement was made that the bank was in extreme difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a bank within Australia can put up such a deliberate deception to a parliamentary institution, God knows what a foreign bank can do in its reporting to an Australian government. But I must again put on record reference to a simple deception which was part of the whole report placed publicly before the banking inquiry. For the management of the bank to proceed to adopt such an optimistic report knowing internally that the bank was in a shambles and facing ruin without rescue&mdash;although rescue in the first instance was provided by the state government and ultimately by the taxpayers of South Australia&mdash;was probably the lowest thing it could have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly endorse this bill. I commend the government for its assistance to South Australia and for the stability it will enable the state government to bring to this institution. But let me say that the greatest burden is being met by the new managers of the South Australian government. The measures that that government has to take to preserve the financial integrity of my state are being met by the taxpayers and the electors of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that those electors will always understand who is and was responsible for this great adventure of financial deregulation in Australia&mdash;an adventure that went too far and created a recession and so much unemployment that the employment numbers in Australia are not yet restored to those held prior to the recession. South Australia will take its medicine knowing that that situation was imposed on it by the philosophy of Labor in the 1980s which said, `Go for it, regardless of the result,' and by the inevitable crash of the paper entrepreneurs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) for his contribution to the debate on the Banking (State Bank of South Australia and Other Matters) Bill. I will just briefly make one or two points. First of all, given your interest, Mr Speaker, the interest of the honourable member for Boothby and my interest in matters to do with the banking inquiry, we should look at the period involved and the inquiries that we undertook in relation to the State Bank of South Australia. Hopefully, we can all then see some of the major issues that arose and some of the shortcomings that occurred involving the owner, the board and so on of the State Bank at that time. Everyone would acknowledge that there were major deficiencies, and they have been identified in our reports and in other reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the broader issues of banking supervision, it is worth noting that none of the banks that were under the supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia and where the Reserve Bank had formal powers have seen one cent of depositors' money lost no matter how deep the recession might have been or what other financial difficulties both the banking and non-banking financial sector might have got into. That certainly is still the case today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things recommended in that parliamentary committee report was that all state-owned banks be removed from state ownership over time. That is occurring. We also wanted to ensure that supervision powers were transferred to the Commonwealth of Australia through the Reserve Bank under the Banking Act. That has been completed with the various state banks as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the House ensures that there will be Reserve Bank supervision of the new arrangements in South Australia. Going back to the parliamentary reports and other reports of inquiries that have been conducted into these issues, I think that is fundamental to effective supervision in the future. The Reserve Bank has to take its role in that new process very seriously. I know that is what is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Boothby has been absolutely consistent in his view on foreign banks. I will grant him that. He certainly did maintain that view about foreign bank issues through that parliamentary inquiry process. Everyone would share the observation of the need to maintain the strongest supervisory arrangements with foreign banks, particularly in the broader arrangements that have been outlined since that parliamentary committee report. Equally, the competitive opportunities foreign banks bring need to be balanced against those conditions. This was what the parliamentary committee recommended, as you would recall, Mr Speaker. All members of the parliamentary committee supported those recommendations, with the exception of the honourable member for Boothby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People would acknowledge through that parliamentary inquiry process that a fairly steep learning curve occurred in the mid- to late-1980s. I think we can now be confident about the arrangements set in place by the Reserve Bank with its supervisory and prudential arrangements. We also now have a council of supervisors that coordinates with other financial supervisors in relation to their role. That process is also working effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have changed the conditions relating to foreign banking to give foreign banks a competitive but well-scrutinised role in our banking and financial system. A process has now been adopted with the state banks to set those processes on a sound financial footing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package of bills is a recognition by the Commonwealth of the continuing need of the state of South Australia to be able to play its part in the economic recovery in a sustainable financial way. That is why the assistance package was developed. It is urgently sought not only by the people of South Australia but particularly by the government of South Australia. It is important that these arrangements come into effect from 1 July this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this package is a fair and realistic one that has been adopted by the Commonwealth in response to those measures which will set South Australia on a sound financial footing to have the services that the people of South Australia require, at the same time ensuring that neither in South Australian or in the broader nation is there financial adversity that cannot be met through competent financial management. With those remarks, I would ask the House to support the second reading motion. I commend the motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA>The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 will amend 10 acts coming within the Attorney-General's portfolio.

They are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the bill. </PARA>

The amendments in the bill to the Cheques and Payment Orders Act 1986 will improve procedures for the physical and electronic presentment of cheques. The amendments will facilitate greater use of electronic presentments. The amendments were sought by the Australian Payments Clearing Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cheques and Payment Orders Act currently enables a demand for the payment of a cheque&mdash;presentment&mdash;to be made electronically by the collecting bank to the drawee or paying bank without the physical movement of the cheque itself between the two banks. However, electronic presentment has not been widely used. This has been partly because the banking industry, in considering how to implement electronic presentment at the practical level, has concluded that the act should clearly distinguish between electronic presentments within the one bank and those between different banks. Therefore, the proposed amendments will provide for a distinction between the internal and external presentment of cheques. This will enable a drawee or paying bank to present internally to itself, without the restrictions set out in the amendments as to places, times and means of communication, which will apply to external presentment between banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new provisions applying to internal and external presentment will also apply to the presentment of payment orders drawn on non-bank financial institutions. The amendment to the Family Law Act 1975 will correct a drafting error in section 22. The bill will amend the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to widen the powers of a single judge in appeal procedures. The bill will confer upon a single judge the power to join or remove parties of an appeal; make orders by consent disposing of an appeal, including orders for costs; and give directions relating to the conduct of an appeal generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also amend the Federal Court of Australia Act to give the Federal Court the ability to take evidence by video link, telephone or other appropriate means. The bill will also provide the Federal Court with a discretion to take unsworn evidence by video link, telephone or other appropriate means from a person in another country. This will allow the Federal Court to overcome the difficulty of taking foreign evidence, particularly where the laws or conventions of other countries prevent the administration of an oath or affirmation by Australian courts. Where unsworn evidence is taken, the court can give such weight to that evidence as it thinks fit in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Court of Australia Act will also be amended to enable rules of court to be made so that the court will have a discretion to amend documents in a proceeding even though the effect of the amendment would be to raise a new cause of action that would, if proceedings in relation to it were commenced at the time of the amendment, be out of time. The amendment is intended to overcome the rule in Weldon v. Neal (1887) 19 QBD 394, which prevents such amendments being made. </PARA>

The bill will include CSIRO in schedule 4 of the act, with the effect that certain research documents of CSIRO will be exempt from applications under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will consequentially amend the Privacy Act 1988 to ensure that the information privacy principles in that act will continue to apply to the Australian Statistician in the collection, storage, use and disclosure of information collected in the census and other surveys. The protection given by sections 91 and 92 of the FOI Act will be extended to situations where agencies are required to consult third parties before releasing documents to applicants. Section 91 of the act provides protection against specified civil actions where applicants are given access to documents in accordance with that section.

The bill amends seven acts within the portfolios of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). The bill is stated by the government to contain amendments of a minor policy nature to make minor technical amendments to existing legislation and to correct a drafting error. We accept this, and we do not oppose the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends the Acts Interpretation Act to enable an instrument of delegation to apply to a class of officers to catch offices created after the instrument of delegation was made. This is a non-controversial amendment. There are amendments to the Cheques and Payment Orders Act 1986. These amendments have been requested by the Australian Payments Clearing Association and will implement different procedures for internal and external presentments. We support these amendments. We also support the amendments to the Family Law Act, which simply correct a numbering error in the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act are also supported by us. The bill will broaden the power of a single judge to make certain orders rather than such orders only being exercised by the full court. The bill once enacted will also allow evidence to be obtained by video link, telephone or other means. The bill also gives the court the ability to make rules allowing the court to amend documents in a proceeding, even if that would have the effect of raising a new cause of action that, if the proceedings in relation to it were commenced at the time of the amendment, would be out of time. The amendments overcome the concerns of a High Court judge in a 1992 decision. They are procedural improvements and are supported by us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Judiciary Act will be amended so that when the full court of the High Court delivers a judgment only one justice need be present. It is currently the situation that, when the full court delivers a judgment, two judges must be present. That concludes the acts that are dealt with by the Attorney-General's Department. The amendments are all fairly straightforward and non-controversial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two pieces of legislation are dealt with by the Minister for Justice. It is the amendments to the Freedom of Information Act that have been somewhat more controversial in the other place. Firstly, the amendments to the Financial Transaction Reports Act are non-controversial. The changes to the Financial Transaction Reports Act will enable the Director of Austrac to have the powers of a departmental secretary under the Public Service Act 1922, so far as the act relates to Austrac, as if that branch were a separate department of the Australian Public Service. This is not a contentious amendment. It will ensure that the Director of Austrac will have not only increased responsibility and accountability but also broader powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments which have caused some controversy in the other place are those that amend the Freedom of Information Act. This bill tries to undo something that was done some time ago which amended the provision for consultation. The original amendment would have provided that consultation with a party about whom information is sought will no longer be mandatory before releasing documents unless the person mentioned in the documents might reasonably contend that the documents are exempt. The minister indicated that the requirement to consult has become unduly onerous. The provision will now mean that the minister will be required to consult only where it appears to the officer or minister dealing with the request that a person might reasonably contend that a document is exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, factors which will need to be taken into account include the extent to which the person to whom the personal information relates is well known; whether the person to whom the personal information relates is known to be associated with the matters dealt with in the document; the availability of the personal information from publicly accessible sources; and any other matter that the minister, officer or reviewer considers relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns about this matter were raised in the Senate. However, after some discussion, my side did not have any serious concerns with the clauses, as it was felt that the balance had been appropriately struck between, on the one hand, ensuring that the government had not been left with an unnecessary burden to consult and, on the other hand, providing the opportunity for people to realise that information about themselves is the subject of an FOI request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the FOI Act will also mean that the grounds for review to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be broadened. Effectively, the amendment will mean that there can be review of an agency's decision where an agency alleges that it has given the applicant copies of all the documents. Under the amendments, officers and agencies will be protected from certain civil and criminal actions while undertaking their duties. As I have indicated, we support these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments were moved in the committee stage of the bill in the other place. The government moved amendments to the bill relating to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. The amendments numbered 1 to 4 are not controversial and, as I understand it, were not opposed in the Senate. These amendments will provide for the fact that the president of the tribunal, Deirdre O'Connor, has accepted an appointment as President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The amendments will enable a judge to be appointed to the position of President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal during the period that Justice Deirdre O'Connor, who is currently president of the tribunal, is President of the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an amendment to the Bankruptcy Act which I should mention. As I recall, the minister touched on this. This amendment will mean that grants made under the rural adjustment scheme cannot subsequently be sequestered by the trustee in bankruptcy when those who receive the grants become bankrupt. If such a situation were allowed, this would mean that taxpayers would be paying for the RAS grants only to have that money suddenly taken by the trustee in bankruptcy to pay off creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 116, as amended, will now specifically exclude amounts paid to the bankrupt for re-establishment support under the rural adjustment scheme within the meaning of the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. The coalition has been concerned about this amendment for some time. I believe that the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) has raised this issue in the House in the past.

The principal change removes a drafting error from the 1992 omnibus bill, and I am pleased to see that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to make a few comments about the family law area, in which I am taking a particular interest. Firstly, I want to commend the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) for their report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to justice: an action plan</EMPHASIS>. By and large, I think it has been pretty well received. From my perspective, it seems to me that access to justice is not an issue of better competition policy or even micro-economic reform at the fringes. I think the real test is whether or not we are going to afford the citizens of Australia the ability to exercise their legal rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there are some people who are very concerned about the amount of money being spent on legal aid and suggest that governments should dramatically increase this amount in order that citizens can exercise their rights. It is fair to say on both sides of the House that governments are not going to have access to that sort of money. Therefore, just funnelling more money into legal aid is not going to be a solution to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have suggested that in the family law area it is worth while considering not only the present judicial system that we have through the Family Court but also a no-frills family tribunal. It would be a tribunal from which members of the legal profession would be excluded and where the emphasis would be on either ratifying agreements previously arrived at or conciliating agreements. Finally, where it is not possible to have all areas conciliated then the court would arbitrate a decision. A feature of the tribunal would be that it would not have the restricted sitting hours of the family courts but would sit at times convenient to the clients. I can readily imagine that it might sit from 9 o'clock in the morning to 9 o'clock in the evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is these types of approaches that will really start to address the principal issue of allowing citizens to exercise their rights. I note that the Chief Justice of the Family Court feels that instituting a magistrates court in the family law area would go a long way towards achieving some of the objectives I have announced. A good example of this system is the small claims tribunal in my own state, where the participants to the tribunal do not have legal representatives and there is an upper amount of money that can be decided. That tribunal has an excellent record of producing results that citizens can afford. So where the citizens do have rights they are able to exercise their rights and have access to justice. I feel that that is very much the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues has a reference to inquire into the funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia. I believe that the committee will have an opportunity to ensure that those persons appearing before the Family Court are actually able to exercise their rights or, more particularly, get some handle on the latent number of citizens who do not have the ability to argue or present their case before the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that there has been a great deal of interest on both sides of the House in the child support inquiry, and whilst the Auditor-General tabled his report yesterday, I am pleased to advise honourable members that I will be giving a draft report on the child support scheme to the committee. This report will go much further than the Auditor-General's recommendations, valuable as they were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members that it is no longer just a question of wishing to fix the administration of the scheme, bad as that has been, but that very significant policy areas also need to be considered. Those areas will not be dodged in the draft report. I have every confidence that the committee will improve on those recommendations and will improve on the consideration of the report. When that report is tabled&mdash;by no later than August this year&mdash;it will give the committee the opportunity to pursue the reference of the funding and administration of the Family Court. I trust that that will be a very productive exercise. I know that the Attorney-General is anxious for the committee to get on with it and I know that the chief justice is anxious to get on with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill addresses a number of areas and I do not want to reiterate the points that the honourable member for Kooyong has already elaborated to the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition's position in relation to this legislation has been outlined by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), and I do not propose to add to it. I seek to comment on only one particular aspect of the legislation, and it relates to its course through the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill was introduced in the Senate. Senator Spindler of the Australian Democrats had some concerns regarding the amendments proposed to the Freedom of Information Act. These concerns related to privacy matters. Senator Spindler wrote to the Privacy Commissioner, Mr Kevin O'Connor. The response Senator Spindler received from Mr O'Connor was to the effect that Mr O'Connor had provided advice to the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and indicated that it was his practice not to canvass concerns about bills with non-government members or senators. Senator Spindler then wrote to the Minister for Justice, and I understand that the minister provided Senator Spindler with the advice Mr O'Connor had given to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler was rightly of the view that this was an unsatisfactory situation and, in the Senate, he moved amendments to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 and the Privacy Act 1988. The objects of the amendments to the former act were to enable parliamentarians to request the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to report on proposed Commonwealth, state and territory enactments, and to provide that reports to a minister or a parliamentarian by the commission be laid before parliament. The objects of the amendments to the Privacy Act were to enable parliamentarians to request the Privacy Commissioner to report on proposed Commonwealth, state or territory enactments, and to provide that reports to a minister or a parliamentarian by the commissioner be laid before the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition did not support those amendments. They were considerably detailed and were proposed at the last minute, not giving adequate time for consideration, by either the shadow ministry or the party room. However, the coalition's position in the Senate, which remains, is that consideration needs to be given to securing the independence of the Privacy Commissioner. There should be a way for the parliament to have the benefit of the Privacy Commissioner's advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is currently under way&mdash;and there has been for some time&mdash;a review of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In the course of that review, it is appropriate that consideration be given to the concerns expressed by Senator Spindler. I add that concerns have been expressed not only by Senator Spindler. I have previously encountered the policy of the Privacy Commissioner in relation to his not providing non-government members with his advice on a bill. After Senator Spindler had given notice of his amendments, but before they were moved, I wrote to the Privacy Commissioner seeking his views on his role. He wrote back a helpful letter with which he enclosed a copy of a speech he had delivered in New Zealand, which dealt in part with the provision of advice to parliament. A relevant part of that speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A related pressure that my office has faced is whether my confidential advices should be made more widely available to interested members of parliament. The practice I have followed, in line with usual conventions that apply to the giving of advice to government, is to decline requests for access to my advices. The requests often flow from non-government members at the time a bill is tabled. I have indicated that my advice is given to the relevant Minister in confidence, and that they should address their queries to him or her in order to gain access. The non-government members have indicated their dissatisfaction with this state affairs. Once pressed, the government usually, but not always, makes available the advice. I have declined to make my advices available directly, as, one, my statute only gives me a power to advise the government and, two&mdash;and more importantly&mdash;my ability to participate effectively in the deliberative process would, I believe, be hampered if Ministers thought that their political opponents might be given that advice unbeknown to them or while policy was still being developed.</PARA>
<PARA>The Privacy Commissioner indicated that there had been in operation in the Senate in the period 1989-90 a practice referred to as the `Macklin procedure'. He indicated it was the convention of the then Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, to table or make available advices from the Privacy Commissioner. He was not aware whether this was an understanding between Senator Tate and Senator Macklin of the Democrats or something more formal. But he does make a positive suggestion as to what might be an appropriate procedure to follow. He said in his letter to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may be also interested to note that cl. 22 of the Privacy and Data Protection Bill recently introduced into the NSW Parliament is not as restrictive as my Act in relation to the Privacy Commissioner's advice role. Clause 22, functions (g) and (n) allow for advice or reports to be given to `any person'. No doubt the proposed NSW Privacy Commissioner would have to develop some conventions in relation to the exercise of these functions.</PARA>
<PARA>This seems to be a sensible and pragmatic approach that should be endorsed and implemented by the government. Before concluding, I want to express one further concern in relation to the Privacy Commissioner. It is a concern that relates not only to him but also to other commissioners within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the internal review, several of the terms of office of commissioners have come to an end. The government has seen fit to extend those terms of office for 12 months in the case of continuing officers or officers who seek to continue but has left open what might occur after the expiry of a 12-month period pending the results of the review. Given the important and sensitive roles played by each of the commissioners within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, to have those commissioners exercising what are meant to be functions independent of government while subject to a 12-month extension of contract is most unsatisfactory. The limited term of office provided, with no promise of either reappointment or termination, means that the appearance of independence is seriously jeopardised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to take steps to bring the review to a prompt conclusion and to take steps in accordance with the appropriate results of the review, subject to legislation, to ensure that not only are the commissioners within the commission independent under statute but they appear in the performance of their functions to be independent as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I formally congratulate you on the attainment of your half century yesterday. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is one of an increasing number of omnibus bills which are being introduced into the parliament. I suppose we can argue one way or the other as to whether this is the appropriate means for amending a very large number of acts when quite often those acts are totally unrelated and apply to different portfolios.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill we are discussing today amends 10 bills, seven relating to the Attorney-General's portfolio and three relating to the justice portfolio. As was mentioned by the shadow minister representing the shadow Attorney-General, the opposition is not opposing what the government proposes. Included in the acts to be amended is the Acts Interpretation Act 1901&mdash;one of the very early acts of the Commonwealth parliament. The bill amends this act to enable a delegation to a class of officers to catch offices created after the instrument of delegation was made. There has been wide consultation in relation to this matter and I understand that there has been no adverse comment. Consequently, the amendments proposed to the Acts Interpretation Act are not being opposed by the opposition. I understand that there is no major concern in the community in relation to these proposed changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cheques and Payment Orders Act 1986 also attracts the attention of this bill. The bill modernises rules about the presentment of cheques by banks. It is designed to improve the procedures for physical and electronic presentment of cheques. Although the act currently allows for this to occur electronically, those provisions have not been widely utilised because the Australian banking industry has considered that the acts should clearly distinguish between electronic presentment within one bank and those among different banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments, which have actually been requested by the Australian Payments Clearing Association, or APCA, implement different procedures for internal and external presentments. The provisions also apply to the presentment of payment orders drawn on non-bank financial institutions. The specifics, which have arisen from a very close consideration of the Cheques and Payment Orders Act 1986, are detailed and complex, and I suppose that is understandable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the bill amends the act to enable a drawee or paying bank to present cheques internally to itself as drawee or paying bank, whether the bank is the collecting bank of a cheque or is acting as agent for other collecting banks which have handed cheques to the drawee or paying bank at the clearing house, without the restrictions in the act applying to external presentment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments enable the drawee or paying bank to specify to another bank the place, times and means of communication which the other bank must use when presenting cheques by exhibition or by particulars. The amendments further enable the collecting bank to specify to another bank the place, times and means of communication which must be used by that other bank when requesting exhibition or further particulars of a cheque, and provide for the internal and external presentment of payment orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these amendments were proposed, there was widespread consultation by the coalition and, I presume, also by the government, and I understand that there has been no adverse comment received by either the government or the opposition in relation to the amendments. The Australian Bankers Association has noted that the provisions are consistent with the requests of the association's previous cheques committee and the requests of the APCA. Consequently, as I mentioned earlier, the coalition is not opposing these very complicated amendments to the Cheques and Payment Orders Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As referred to by the previous government speaker, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), the Family Law Act is also being amended. It is very much a technical amendment, correcting a subsection numbering error in the act. Unfortunately, quite often, too many of these errors are made and not picked up prior to legislation passing through the parliament. It is better to consider properly and closely look at the numbering and wording of acts to make sure that we are not put in the position of having subsequently to rectify an error. The error having been made, it certainly has to be fixed up; the coalition does not at all oppose this amendment. We do, however, comment that the government should be very much more careful in ensuring that legislation is right before it is pumped through the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next piece of legislation to be amended is the Federal Court of Australia Act. This bill broadens the powers of a single judge to make interlocutory or consent orders in relation to pending appeals. Currently, the enumerated powers may be exercised only by the full court of the Federal Court. This bill allows evidence to be obtained by video link, telephone or other appropriate means. If the witness is present in Australia, the evidence must be sworn; if the witness is overseas, the testimony may be sworn or, in limited circumstances, unsworn. Power is given to enable rules of court to be made dealing with the way evidence is given in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are not opposing this legislation, I do have some concerns to ensure that we have in our court system fairness and equity. One of the basic tenets of the British and Australian court systems has been that witnesses should be present in court wherever possible; that they should be available to be cross-examined. Of course, when a witness can be seen in person, it enables everyone in the court to assess the witness's reliability. The demeanour of a witness can often tell you whether he or she can be believed and trusted. I understand that, on occasions, it can be helpful to be able to use video link evidence, but I certainly hope that this evidence is used only as a last resort. Once we start to chip away at the guarantees of justice in our court system, ultimately our courts will not have the confidence of the public&mdash;the confidence that they have largely enjoyed since this nation's inception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation gives the court the ability to make rules allowing the court to amend documents in a proceeding, even if that would have the effect of raising a new cause of action that would, if the proceedings in relation to it were commenced at the time of the amendment, be out of time. The ability of the Federal Court to make such rules was questioned by the Hon. Mr Justice Toohey of the High Court in a 1992 decision. The amendments overcome these doubts and bring the Federal Court into line with most other Australian jurisdictions. That is eminently appropriate, given the very high regard in which the Federal Court has been held in this nation over the time since it was formed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, these amendments to this act were widely canvassed in the community. There was ample opportunity for people who had any concerns at all to come forward. My understanding is that there has been no adverse comment in relation to the amendments, and that the amendments properly facilitate procedural improvements. Consequently, the opposition is not opposing this portion of the bill either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next act to be amended by this bill is the Judiciary Act. The act currently provides that, when the full court of the High Court delivers a judgment, at least two justices must be present. The bill allows such a judgment to be delivered by one justice. The amendments are for administrative convenience. While we are not opposing them, I feel that, when the full court delivers a judgment, it is better that there should be more than one judge in attendance, but that is only a personal inclination. I understand that the court should be allowed to organise its affairs as best conveniences it. When a full court judgment is being handed down, one would imagine that, if there were a dissenting judgment, the dissenting judge would have to be present. Presumably, judgment by one justice would be delivered in cases where there was no dissent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two other acts being amended are the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 and the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The amendments to the Financial Transaction Reports Act are non-controversial. A change to that Act will enable the director of Austrac to have the powers of a departmental secretary under the Public Service Act 1922, as far as the act relates to Austrac, as if that branch were a separate department of the Australian Public Service. This is not a contentious amendment. It will ensure that the director of Austrac will have not only increased responsibility and accountability but also broader powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Freedom of Information Act 1982 has some amendments which have created a little more controversy than some of the other matters which are the subject of this particular legislation. The bill seeks to undo something that was done some time ago which amended the provision for consultation. The original amendment would have provided that consultation with a party about whom information is sought would no longer be necessary before releasing documents, unless the person mentioned in the documents might reasonably contend that the documents were exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has indicated that the requirement to consult has become unduly onerous. That is the minister's conclusion and, of course, the amendments we have before the House have resulted from it. The provision will now mean that the minister will be required to consult only where it appears to the officer or minister dealing with the request that a person might reasonably be able to contend that a document is exempt. Factors that will need to be taken into account are the extent to which personal information is well known, whether the person to whom the personal information relates is known to be associated with the matters dealt with in the document, the availability of the personal information from publicly accessible sources, and other matters that the minister, officer or reviewer considers relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Australian Democrats have had a number of concerns with the provisions requiring the agency or minister to consult with the persons concerned where there may be a disclosure of personal information and the person concerned might reasonably wish to contend that the document was exempt from disclosure. The Democrat concerns revolved around the amount of discretion which could be applied in deciding whether to release information. However, the coalition does not have the same concerns as the Democrats in relation to these clauses, as it was felt that a balance had been struck between ensuring that the government had not been left with the unnecessary burden to consult and the opportunity for people to realise that information about themselves is the subject of an FOI request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the FOI Act will also mean that the grounds for review at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be broadened. Effectively, the amendments will mean that there can be review of an agency's decision where an agency alleges that it had given the applicant copies of all of the documents. Officers and agencies will be protected from certain civil and criminal actions while undertaking their duties under the amendments, and that is certainly understandable. The result is that the coalition supports what the government is seeking to achieve in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people criticise the opposition for opposing everything all of the time. I think most opposition members of parliament would occasionally receive phone calls from people saying, `You people always oppose what the government is doing. It doesn't matter about the rights and wrongs of the situation. You simply are there to oppose. You're always being negative and, indeed, you don't consider matters on their merits. The suggestion is that whenever a piece of legislation comes into the parliament the government members strongly support it and opposition members strongly oppose it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before the House today indicates that, when reasonable legislation comes into the parliament, members on this side are prepared to look very closely at the legislation and, where the legislation is good legislation, we are prepared to support it. Consequently, I am very pleased to join with the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock)&mdash;the shadow minister representing the shadow Attorney-General&mdash;and other opposition speakers in supporting the omnibus bill before the House. On that basis, I trust that the House will support what the government proposes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank honourable members who have contributed to this debate this morning. I thought it was a pleasant change to have such constructive contributions from both sides of the House. It certainly shows the parliament working at its best when people can make the sorts of positive, sensible and thoughtful contributions that we have heard this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought a number of issues were raised which are worthy of a response. I want to deal with them more or less in order of their being raised. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who I think it can be said has been a great visionary in the area of family law, raised a number of issues and I thought his contribution to the debate was thoughtful and interesting. The government certainly looks forward to receiving the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues into both the administration of the Family Court and the child support scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contribution that that committee has already made in the area of reforming family law is well known. The government's response to its report was wholly supportive and positive. We will be introducing legislation to the parliament in the near future to give effect to the work of that committee. I am sure that the honourable member for Chifley will look forward to that with some enthusiasm as the government looks forward to receiving his committee's report into the administration of the court and the child support scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) raised a number of issues in what was his usual thoughtful, sensible and sensitive contribution to any debate. The issues that have been raised about access to the Privacy Commissioner's advice to the government are important and they need to be considered carefully by the parliament. I have some sympathy for the point of view that he has expressed, but it is a complex issue and it has important policy considerations. As such, I do not think it is the sort of issue that ought to be dealt with in this type of omnibus legislation. It is the sort of major policy change that ought to be dealt with in a separate piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that it was complex. The government does see it as a complex issue because it would have potentially important resource considerations for the Privacy Commissioner. If each member of the House of Representatives and the Senate were able to approach the Privacy Commissioner directly for advice on a wide range of matters, the Privacy Commissioner could well find that he was weighed down and bogged down in such responses. So it does need to be thought through carefully, and it does need to be resourced properly if any changes are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the commission is subject to an internal review&mdash;not just the Privacy Commission but also the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I have no doubt that that matter, having been raised in the parliament, will be brought to the attention of the human rights commission. I am quite sure that, as a result, consideration will be given to the suggestions that were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that was raised by the honourable member for Tangney&mdash;again, raised in his usual thoughtful manner&mdash;involved his concerns about the fact that a number of commissioners or officers of the human rights commission have been appointed for short terms rather than longer terms whilst the internal review of the human rights commission is being undertaken. He raised the point that this could be seen to be an interference with the statutory independence of the human rights commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to that, anybody who knows Commissioner Brian Burdekin would think that the idea that he would brook any interference with his independence was a laughable proposition. I cannot think of a more feared person, in terms of propriety, than Mr Burdekin. Whilst I appreciate the concerns that the honourable member for Tangney has expressed, I think no-one should have any concerns that the independence of the human rights commission will be compromised in these circumstances. I think the commission is basically working well. I look forward to the internal review, which I am sure will lead to the commission being able to operate more effectively and more efficiently, thereby providing better services and even better protection for the human rights of citizens of this nation than possibly has been the case to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, whilst it may be of minor concern in policy terms, is important to many citizens of this nation. Many of the things that are dealt with in this legislation, whilst they do not have wide policy implications, quite obviously have important repercussions for individuals: for example, the references to the rural adjustment scheme in relation to bankruptcy. I am sure that each and every member of the House would know that some individuals have been sadly affected by the situation at present. That is one of those classic examples of unintended consequences of legislation. I am sure that no one member of this House who turned his or her mind to the issue would have wanted RAS payments to be absorbed in bankruptcies. But that was an unintended consequence, and it has now been corrected. There are many other examples of that sort, but I will not go into detail now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, one honourable member raised his concern that so many matters were being dealt with in one piece of legislation. This is an excellent example of the sort of legislation that will be dealt with in the second chamber in the future so that possibly more detail can be taken into account and more time can be made available for discussion. I think it does provide a good example of the sort of legislation that will benefit from the time that will be able to be made available in the second chamber for debating the detail of this type of legislation which, while it may not be particularly sexy, nonetheless is important in terms of the rights of individuals in this nation. I commend this bill to the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA>This bill proposes the payment of a bounty on the production of certain fuel ethanol in Australia to assist in the development of a competitive, robust and ecologically sustainable fuel ethanol industry. The bill is part of a package of lead abatement measures announced in the 1993 budget which will complement initiatives announced in the environment statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of December 1992 relating to a guarantee of the excise free status of alternative fuels for a further four years, as well as support for new ethanol production technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol can be blended with petrol and diesel to extend transport fuel and therefore reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Its octane enhancing properties may offer some potential benefits towards the reduction of lead in petrol as well as increasing the sustainability of the energy sector through the use of a fuel based on a renewable resource. Ethanol also has the potential to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes that $25 million be provided over the next three years for bounty payments at a rate of 18c per litre. Some $6 million will be dedicated to the first year of the bounty, $8 million to the second year and the remaining $11 million will be used for the third and final year. Where the money apportioned for either of the first two years is not paid out as bounty, it will be rolled over to the next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be eligible for bounty, producers must be registered under the scheme. Registration will be effected according to specified criteria under the legislation which will ensure that all registered producers will be able to make a significant contribution to the desired competitive, robust and ecologically sustainable fuel ethanol industry. Under the proposed scheme, all registered producers will be granted a production allocation which will guarantee them an amount of bounty on the condition that they maintain certain production levels and satisfy other specified criteria. The allocation process is intended to provide existing producers with incentives for capital investment whilst also allowing new producers to enter the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is confident that the measures in the proposed bounty scheme will encourage the establishment of a competitive ethanol transport fuel industry in Australia, developed on an environmentally sustainable basis. The government will also assist in overcoming the technical and administrative barriers to the use of ethanol as a transport fuel with a $3.94 million research and development program over the next two years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will not be opposing the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill 1994. Listening to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) summing up the debate on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill, it seemed ironic that he spoke about the opportunities that exist with the second chamber starting today for bills like the previous bill to be allowed to be more extensively debated. The reason I found it ironic was that the bill we are debating now and the previous one are under the guillotine. We have an extraordinary situation where the government on the one hand is saying, `Isn't it great that we have a second chamber?' but on the other hand is saying, `We are going to guillotine the legislation through anyway.' I do not think that point should go unnoticed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will not be opposing this bill. Nonetheless, there are a few things that I would like to say about it. This bounty is part of the government's lead abatement strategy, and we support attempts to try to reduce the amount of lead in our atmosphere. Clearly, this is a major problem which has been well recognised. Obviously these attempts will be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the House to some of the difficulties that may arise from this bill. By way of background, it is worth noting that the use of ethanol to extend petrol and diesel is not new. It is being done in a number of countries overseas. For example, both the United States and Canada use ethanol blended with petrol and diesel to extend fuel and to help reduce the amount of lead emitted into the atmosphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States, where ethanol blends have been used since 1970, over 3.8 billion litres of ethanol is blended with petrol each year in the ratio of 10 per cent ethanol to 90 per cent petrol. In the United States, these fuels are sold throughout the country and over 39 major cities are required by law to use what is known as oxygenated or ethanol blended fuels in certain months of the year when the air quality standards fall below those required by the United States Clean Air Act. This procedure has been well and truly trialled in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brazil has the world's largest alcohol fuel program, which is aimed at substituting ethanol for fossil fuels. Brazil adopted a mandated ethanol program as early as 1985. Brazil's alcohol fuel program has been subsidised by its very high petrol prices, its favourable taxation and its direct government subsidies. Brazil has gone very heavily down this path of reducing its reliance on petrol. In Brazil, the ethanol is manufactured from domestically produced sugar cane, resulting in the production of approximately four billion gallons&mdash;that is, 4,000 million gallons&mdash;per year. It is quite a major industry in Brazil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol is a colourless, highly flammable liquid which is generally produced from the fermentation of agricultural crops, including cereal grains, sugar cane, sugar beet, sweet sorghum and casaba. It is fairly obvious that a 10 per cent blend of ethanol and petrol is preferred&mdash;that is why the United States has gone that way&mdash;because no modifications are required to the standard car engine. This blend increases the octane rating and hence the efficiency of the engines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to note that the inclusion of ethanol reduces the emissions and the lead levels in the atmosphere, with a 10 to 30 per cent reduction in carbon monoxide emissions. This is very significant because 90 per cent of the lead in the atmosphere today comes from petrol. Ethanol also has the advantage that it is a renewable energy source. This is another very strong reason for encouraging this development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently in Australia the majority of ethanol that is produced is for use in the chemical industry. It is worth noting that the Manildra Group has recently opened a plant at Nowra in New South Wales with the potential to utilise 100,000 tonnes of wheat in the production of 28 million litres of ethanol for fuel annually. It is also very important to note that there are enough agricultural crop residues in the Macquarie, Gwydir and Namoi valleys to produce 820 million litres of ethanol annually&mdash;significantly more than is currently being planned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also very important to note that blended fuels are already being trialled in Mackay, here in Canberra in the buses and in other parts of southern New South Wales. The Manildra Group, together with Caltex, is selling blended fuel, with 95 per cent of motorists stating that the car runs as well as, if not better than, it does on straight leaded fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems is that currently ethanol is expensive to produce in Australia, mainly due to the low volumes being produced and the lack of existing infrastructure. The industry says it expects that, once the economies of scale are reached, ethanol production could cost as little as 24c per litre, which is very comparable with the cost of producing petrol. Caltex believes its trials have been made economical because the ethanol currently being produced by Manildra has been a by-product. As well, to its credit the New South Wales government has forgone the 5c a litre fuel excise that it is currently levying on petrol. Obviously the whole thrust of this bill, which is a move for a bounty, is to encourage the production and blending of ethanol for car fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of this bill is to give additional support for what is an infant industry and at the same time offer a very useful and significant benefit for the environment. It puts in place, quite simply, a bounty for producers of ethanol. As has already been stated, this bounty is to operate over the next three years, beginning on 1 July this year. The rate of payment will be 18c a litre for bountiable fuel ethanol and a total payment of $25 million. This is to be spread over three years, as I have said: $6 million in the coming financial year, $8 million in 1995-96 and $11 million in 1996-97. It has also been pointed out that the bill allows for a rollover of this bounty if it is not all utilised in each of the first two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the bounty is payable only for new, non-existent production in Australia. It is also obvious, then, that those existing producers&mdash;that is, mainly the Manildra Group&mdash;will receive a bounty only for production that is above the levels they currently have. Those existing levels are assessed by averaging the last two years, 1992 and 1993, to set a base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also stated in the bill that there is a maximum per producer, but this maximum can in fact be increased if the minister accepts an application to do so. The bill ensures that proper commercial records are kept. An annual return will have to be tabled in the parliament each year on the amount of bounty paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some irony, not only regarding the guillotine but also in the fact that at the same time this bounty is being offered for the production of ethanol&mdash;the coalition will not be opposing this&mdash;the excise the government is charging motorists is to rise by 13 per cent this year. That is on top of an 18 per cent increase last year. So, while there is encouragement to produce ethanol, at the same time the government is not running short of money when it comes to taxing fuels. The government is increasing taxes on fuel at the same time as it is introducing this bounty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly mention a couple of concerns the opposition has. One is the fact that the bounty is to be paid over three years. The Manildra Group has made it clear that it believes this is too short a period. It believes that the bounty should be paid over five years because by the third year the industry will only just be starting to come into proper production because of the long lag times associated with building the new infrastructure for the production of ethanol. That is the first concern that I raise with the government in this debate. The second concern is that the bill, because of the way it has been framed, appears to handicap the existing large-scale producer of ethanol. I think it is important that those points be raised now and put on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, this bill is part of the government's lead abatement strategy and therefore is to be encouraged. The total funding for the lead abatement strategy will be $36 million over three years. Obviously, part of that strategy includes the $25 million for the bounty on production of ethanol fuels. On top of this there will be the national lead education program. There will be funding for research and development of ethanol based fuels, and there will be a survey to determine lead levels in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of this strategy includes development of a national environment standard for petrol. Clearly this is to be commended, but I hope that at the same time the government will take into account the fact that overseas countries such as Brazil, the United States and Canada have extensive experience in ethanol additives to fuels and I would hope that we look very closely at some of that experience and some of the research that has been done so that we do not have to duplicate it here. I again say that the coalition does not oppose this bill, and we look forward to seeing the progress of the development of ethanol in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great sense of excitement that I support the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill 1994. This is the sort of legislation through which everyone is a winner, and I certainly congratulate the opposition for its support of this legislation. The $25 million that will be paid out in the bounty for the production of fuel ethanol should be seen as an incentive, as seed capital that will give new technology the opportunity to develop a highly desirable industry on a scale that we have not previously had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am excited because this bill represents one of the more progressive steps taken by the government since I became a member of parliament. This bill shows the government's genuine commitment to establishing a sustainable fuel system and at the same time protecting our environment by the reduction of lead levels and greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to spend just a little time explaining the advantages of an ethanol fuel industry for Australia. Ethanol is a renewable fuel that can be used as a replacement for liquid hydrocarbon fossil fuels. It is currently used as an extender and as a total replacement for such fuels and has achieved some enormously beneficial results. When mixed with petrol, it enhances the octane rating. Seven per cent ethanol will boost performance by three RON points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol has the potential to reduce the lead in petrol. This is a stated objective of the government. If mixed with diesel in an 85 per cent to 15 per cent mix using an emulsifier, it produces a new fuel called diesohol which dramatically reduces the sooty emissions of diesel burning engines. However, performance of motors is not reduced, and the technical specifications of diesel motors do not have to be modified to enable them to use this fuel. The great advantage of ethanol as a fuel is that it uses biomass or living plant tissue as its source. It uses a renewable resource. This can be any vegetative matter that can be fermented&mdash;a natural process&mdash;with the ethanol recovered from the resultant ethanol water mix. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently ethanol is being produced in Australia by the fermentation of wheaten starch at the Manildra plant at Nowra. APACE Research is completing a feasibility study in my electorate of Paterson to produce ethanol from forest wastes and other woody or fibrous materials known as lignocellulosics. The great thing about this project is that it is capable of using a wide spectrum of source materials. It does not have to use forest wastes; it can be cotton stubble or sugar mill waste bagasse. Wastes such as grain hulls and sawdust can be processed&mdash;even wastepaper and other municipal solid wastes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report in this week's newspapers indicates that a firm in Tasmania intends to establish a plant adjacent to a potato processing plant where 100 tonnes of peelings a day will be converted into ethanol. Already the bounty is creating windows of opportunity for investment and employment. But the good news keeps coming in. Australia is a world leader in ethanol fuel technology. APACE Research holds the world patent for the chemical emulsifier that allows the blending of ethanol with diesel. This is a real breakthrough technology on a world standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Residents of Canberra would be aware that ACTION buses were used to trial diesohol only last year. It was a trial that was very successful and ACTION buses are keen to continue the use of this fuel. A similar trial is ongoing with the State Transit Authority in Sydney. Buses taking tours to the Olympic Games site at Homebush are using diesohol. On World Environment Day, a bus using diesohol was a feature of the New South Wales government display. How fantastic it would be in the year 2000 if we had developed the ethanol industry, with this fuel infiltrating into all forms of transport, so that visitors to the Sydney Olympics could be transported with a fuel developed by Australian technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently the Swedish government is trialing diesohol in Stockholm. In March this year garbage trucks and street sweepers started using diesohol because of its environmentally friendly properties. Everywhere in the world where diesohol is trialled an Australian company is involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before the House today is exciting and innovative. It gives us the opportunity to move into a completely new dimension of fuel technology. Under the bounty scheme that will operate for the next three years, we will see new uses for ethanol. Because of this subsidy, industry will automatically experiment with this new generation fuel. Research and development will be carried out into the ethanol-petrol and ethanol-diesel blends on a grand and practical scale. The $25 million will be paying for results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next three years internal combustion engines in Australia will consume some 140 million litres of subsidised ethanol. Data will be collected on the performance of the fuels used and, at the end of the period, we will have collected a large amount of valuable information. At the same time, we will see ethanol producers expanding&mdash;whether it be from wheaten starch, potato peelings, or forest waste. But we will see new technology come on line. I am also confident that the new technology being developed for the production of ethanol, particularly from ligno cellulosics, will be able to produce ethanol at a price that will be competitive with fossil fuels. I have spoken about Australia as a world leader in ethanol fuel technology and I have touched briefly on the environmental advantages of this fuel. Let us compare ethanol with traditional fossil fuels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As most school children are aware today, fossil fuels are storehouses of carbon that has been held either as solid carbon or liquid or gaseous hydrocarbon for millions of years by geological processes. When they are burnt, however, carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. In this way the world has been steadily increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution, with alarming consequences of climatic change and global warming. The volume of carbon dioxide has increased in our atmosphere by 25 per cent in the last 200 years and it is currently increasing at about 0.5 per cent per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scientifically speaking, nature can respond. Carbon dioxide can be taken out of the atmosphere by an increased rate of plant growth. The process of photosynthesis will lock the carbon dioxide away again as cellulose or starch. Records show that the response cannot keep pace with the increased production of carbon dioxide by human activity. The continuing rapid destruction of forests in the world is also not helping the situation. The ocean is also a major absorber of carbon dioxide but does not appear to have the capacity to absorb the greater quantities that we are producing. That is why the conversion to ethanol fuels is vital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Biomass, the source of ethanol, is renewable. It can be converted to ethanol and lignin with no net release of carbon dioxide. The development of such a biomass fuels industry also has important positive implications for the agricultural economy, for the treatment of land degradation and for reafforestation programs. Currently in Australia sufficient waste biomass is available for the immediate production of ethanol. Many food and fibre production industries have a waste stream, be it peelings, fibrous tissue or leaf matter. It is something to be disposed of&mdash;often at high cost. By treating such material as a potential source of ethanol, it is possible for it to become an asset with associated economic and environmental advantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The payment of bounty on the production of ethanol will encourage the development of such a rethinking. The government has structured the bounty scheme so that existing producers are provided with incentive for capital investment and new producers will be able to enter the market. Australia is well positioned to draw from the extensive experience of ethanol fuel industries in the United States, Sweden and Brazil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot emphasise enough the benefits to Australia of the use of a fuel based on a renewable resource. In Australia the use of diesel fuel for road transport is expected to rise. Australia is incapable of producing sufficient diesel from its own crude oil sources to satisfy its demand. Immediately diesohol replaces pure diesel as a fuel we as a nation reap enormous savings in foreign expenditure, for no loss in performance and at the same time we gain significant environmental advantages. The 15 per cent ethanol component in diesohol immediately reduces the demand on diesel by the same amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I said when I began to speak, this bill initiates an exciting process. Ethanol technology gives our nation the opportunity to develop a sustainable fuel industry of our own; to move towards self-sufficiency in fuel; to maintain our world leadership in this technology; to make a global contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; to reduce our dependence on lead additives in petrol; and to create jobs in an industry that lends itself to decentralisation. I will expand on that point, because this is an industry that can locate on the forest industry, the sugarcane industry, the vegetable growing industry and the cotton industry. The waste stream from any industry that processes vegetative matter can be used. Such industries are spread all over the country, depending on geography and agricultural practices. That is where such an ethanol plant would obviously be favoured to be located. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have never believed that something is too good to be true. But it would appear that ethanol certainly comes close to being such a substance. I am extremely pleased to be supporting this bill, which helps us take a giant leap forward. I congratulate Australian scientists such as Dr Russell Reeves from APACE Research, who has spent many years in painstaking research to perfect the diesohol technology. He had the faith in his research. It is now time for us to have faith in him and the many other Australian researchers who are helping us to lead the world in developing a competitive, robust and ecologically sustainable fuel ethanol industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to address the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill, I must preface my remarks with an examination of the government's failure to properly address the greenhouse issue, as this is particularly relevant in the context of the legislation before the House. It is common knowledge that the government was rolled at the recent Basel conference on hazardous wastes. The government's delegation went into that conference with a carefully prepared position which had been discussed and agreed to by all members of the delegation. When it came out of the conference, the government had agreed to a completely different outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not dispute that there will be times when Australia will fail to persuade other nations of its position on a sensitive international environmental issue. What is of concern here is that the government did not maintain its position through the negotiations and, eventually, actively agreed to a position at odds with its original views. In the complex world of international diplomacy, I accept that there will be times when it is desirable to give ground on one issue in order to preserve a reputation or gain ground on another issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not my intention to delve deeply into this issue or pass judgment on the government's performance in Basel at length today. But there are real implications and lessons to be learnt for the upcoming greenhouse conference in Berlin in March next year. This will be the first crucial conference of the parties to the United Nations framework convention on climate change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention recently came into force following ratification by the 50th member. The international community will be watching with intense interest as the Berlin meeting considers progress on the greenhouse issue and discusses the setting of targets for greenhouse gas reductions by the parties at the conference. The debacle at Basel has heightened concern throughout Australian industry that the government will give way in Berlin and will agree to an outcome seriously damaging Australia's trade competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, as a resource rich nation, has attracted and developed industry based around fossil fuels. Agreement to a worldwide cut in greenhouse emissions would undoubtedly fall harder on Australian industry than the industry of almost any other country. Worse still, Australia will be under severe pressure at the Berlin conference because of its record of failure on domestic greenhouse measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has a dismal record of reducing greenhouse emissions. The failure of the domestic greenhouse measures has been a running sore for the government for some time, with a series of investigations demonstrating that insufficient resources have been applied. No leadership is being provided by the federal government for industry to fall in behind with regard to energy consumption reduction. It is these no-regrets measures which have been identified as having a net benefit in terms of cost savings, efficiency improvements and greenhouse reductions that will be of interest to the Berlin conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The conference parties will be critically examining Australia's in-house greenhouse outcomes to confirm Australia's credibility on environmental issues. Sadly, the government's failure to implement an adequate domestic greenhouse program will put Australia on the back foot right from the start of the Berlin conference. It must not then try to appease the other countries, as it appeared to do in Basel, and agree to greenhouse reduction targets which hit Australia hardest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent admission by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) that cabinet is yet to consider Australia's approach to the Berlin greenhouse conference is jeopardising the opportunity to develop alliances with other countries with similar views. It is up to the government to take a lead in this area. To date, all we have are bland generalised assurances from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the matter is in hand and that cabinet will finally reach a position in plenty of time. That is simply not good enough, because time is slipping away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, at the moment we are squandering an opportunity in the lead-up to the Berlin conference to build alliances with countries that share Australia's views about the no doubt extremist positions of a lot of participants at that conference. The government, in handling the international aspects of greenhouse policy, is showing the same ineptitude&mdash;in fact, outright negligence&mdash;that it has shown with regard to domestic policy on greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government must involve effective domestic greenhouse programs, encouraging the no-regrets measures. As I say, they satisfy all parties because they result in savings of cost to industries by the introduction of, for example, the best type of plant and machinery, be it motors or drives, as well as at the same time benefiting the environment by reducing greenhouse emissions. So the government must encourage these no-regrets measures whilst at the same time internationally ensuring that Australia's trade competitiveness is not affected by international agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the context of the government's appalling performance in implementing domestic greenhouse reduction measures, there is some merit in the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill. The bill before the House provides for the payment of a bounty on the Australian production of certain types of fuel ethanol. The rate of payment of the bounty will be 18c per litre. This will be payable on defined new production of fuel ethanol, where it is produced in Australia from biomass feed stocks sourced from plants grown in Australia and where production exceeds 350,000 litres per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> An amount of $25 million has been allocated to the bounty scheme with an expected payment of $6 million in the 1994-95 financial year, $8 million in 1995-96 and $11 million in the 1996-97 financial year. It is important to note that the scheme will only run for three years commencing on 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Encouragement in the use of ethanol for fuel will be one way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In view of the government's terrible record with other measures, this benefit may well outweigh the negative aspects of this bill. Let no-one be under any misapprehension: very important implications for sound and consistent economic management are contained in this bill. So while the coalition will not oppose the bill, a number of aspects merit serious consideration and provide some concern as to government actions in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well known, and not disputed by government members, that this bill arose from the government's negotiations with the Democrats and the Greens over the 1993 budget. Let me be perfectly candid: the coalition would not have initiated this proposal. I am quite certain that the government would not have put up this bill either, except for its desperate need to get the 1993 budget through the Senate. It was part of the horse-trading that went on as the government saw its 1993 budget collapsing around its ears because of a hostile Senate. However, having said that, the coalition is willing to give this scheme a trial, partly in the hope that it can bolster the government's dismal record on domestic greenhouse measures. Interestingly, the second reading speech stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is confident that the measures in the proposed bounty scheme will encourage the establishment of a competitive ethanol transport fuel industry in Australia developed on an environmentally sustainable basis.</PARA>
<PARA>The theory behind this is that the ethanol industry is viable by itself but just needs a kick-start to get it going. Unfortunately, experience in the United States and Brazil has shown that ethanol is not cost competitive with petrol where crops are grown specifically for ethanol. It is clear that the same situation, the same economies and the same practicalities would apply in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To state the obvious, petrol is derived from crude oil. So the price of petrol is fundamentally dependent on the cost of oil, bearing in mind that in Australia over half of the price of petrol or diesel is tax. Crude oil would have to be in the region of $US50 per barrel for ethanol to be cost competitive. Over the last several decades, the long-term price of oil has stayed significantly below this figure, even taking into account the various oil shocks and the Gulf War of 1990. These thankfully rare events only temporarily pushed the price of oil sky-high. Otherwise, the price of crude oil has never got within striking distance of $US50 per barrel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am anxious to make the point that I do not discount technological innovations which may significantly reduce the cost of ethanol production in the future. It is certainly encouraging that the United States is looking at halving the cost of production of ethanol in the medium term. However, inescapably, with the price of crude oil unexpectedly low and likely to stay under $US20 per barrel for the foreseeable future, there is no reason to expect that ethanol can be produced cheaply enough to be cost competitive with petrol. This is not the only problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, demand for petrol in Australia reached 17,000 megalitres. Due to the different chemical properties of ethanol, some 26,000 megalitres of ethanol would be required to match the demand for petrol. Australia simply does not have enough suitable agricultural land available to produce anything like this quantity of ethanol. Estimates of the land available indicate that some 6,000 megalitres of ethanol could be produced annually, or about a quarter of the existing requirement to completely replace petrol. We can, therefore, rule out ethanol as a complete petrol replacement on cost and availability</PARA>
<PARA>grounds. To be fair, I do not know that anybody makes an argument that ethanol could ever completely replace petrol in Australia&mdash;or, for that matter, in any other country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that we can rule out the total replacement of petrol with ethanol in the foreseeable&mdash;and long-term&mdash;future, it is worth considering how best to use the ethanol that Australia already produces. Vehicles with engines dedicated to ethanol are not currently commercially available. As such vehicles could only sensibly be used in regions where ethanol is produced, there is little or no incentive for commercial development of these vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As many members of the House would know, however, it is possible to blend ethanol with petrol without major engine modifications being required or performance and maintenance requirements being significantly altered. Petrol with up to 10 per cent ethanol by volume does not require extensive modifications to be made to a vehicle. This raises the considerable, but not overwhelming, difficulties of blending petrol and ethanol. While a number of these issues are highly technical, I shall indicate a few of the less involved issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Blending outside the refinery is not simple, as there are a number of variables, including the purity of the ethanol, which affect the quality of the blended product. Petrol refiners and ethanol producers are rightly proud of their product and seek to maintain the reputation and quality of their products through strict quality control. However, it could be difficult to maintain reliability of the product where blending occurs outside of the refinery. On the other hand, blending within the refinery is also subject to complications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most important, refineries would need to be reconfigurated to accept ethanol into their production processes. Once this had occurred, the refineries would not be able to accept variations in the ethanol content without further time consuming and expensive reconfigurations. They would then be susceptible to shortages in the ethanol provided for blending. Additionally, there could be complications involving spillage, handling and storage. None of these difficulties are insurmountable, but they indicate that blending is not a straightforward process and would involve some cost penalty over petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any extension of the bounty beyond the three-year period will need to be very carefully considered. There can be no advantage to anyone in the industry of replicating the experience in Brazil, where massive subsidies became necessary when the oil price dropped to its present level in 1990. In the United States a significant subsidy is provided at state and federal levels. In Australia, ethanol is already free of the 31c per litre excise burdening petrol and diesel consumers. A trial under way by Caltex has also been assisted by the New South Wales government forgoing the five per cent franchise tax usually levied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must be very careful not to create an industry that needs large subsidies to exist but does not provide an appropriate environmental benefit. Having said that, there is a niche market for the use of ethanol as a fuel in Australia. This market is supply driven at the moment because ethanol can be produced at a reduced cost from other industrial processes. For instance, ethanol is produced from sugarcane in Queensland and as a by-product of the production of wheat starch and gluten by the Manildra Group at Nowra in New South Wales. This company is likely to receive most of the bounty payment over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manildra's experience with ethanol plants dates from the acquisition of a plant in Iowa in the United States in 1988. In 1991 Manildra began recovering the waste from the operation of its wheat starch plant at Nowra to produce ethanol. In this way, what otherwise would be considered waste is transformed into a worthwhile by-product. Importantly, the cost of the process is significantly lower than if a special crop were grown only to be used to make ethanol. Naturally, such production is to be encouraged, as there is a clear efficiency gain from value adding to the entirety of an industrial feed stock and, as well, eliminating waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, there has been a tremendously exciting development in this area with the use of Australian technology to combine ethanol and diesel. Unlike petrol and ethanol, diesel and ethanol will not mix by themselves. They need the addition of an appropriate emulsifier. Such a mixture, containing 15 per cent ethanol, has proved very successful in the limited trials undertaken so far. It is developments such as this which point the way to an expanded use of ethanol in the future. In that regard, I am pleased that another strand of the lead abatement strategy will see increased funding for research into the use of ethanol as a fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the proposed bounty does help this industry to become viable, then that will be of considerable benefit to Australia. However, the government must be mindful not to extend this bounty beyond its three-year time frame and not to enter into any uneconomic subsidies for an industry which is not providing sufficient environmental return. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill 1994. I am pleased that the opposition has decided that it will also support the bill. I think it is important. As the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) indicated in his final remarks in the House this morning, it is important that policies that promote the use of alternative sources of fuel for fuel production are followed, not just by the government but by the whole of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill will be implemented for only three years. It will provide the payment of a bounty to producers of new fuel ethanol. For this reason, the whole process is to be commended. I was surprised that the honourable member for Gippsland was so forthright in his demand for the government not to extend the payment of a bounty at some future stage, even if the industry should require a little more propping up. It is true to say that the industry requires some encouragement, and that is what this bill is all about. Rather than putting all our eggs in the one basket&mdash;to use the old cliche&mdash;the country is moving away from relying totally on fossil fuel as our main source of energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the development of this industry in Australia. It is true that our present supply stock will not support an industry which would, to a large extent, substitute for fossil fuel. However, it is true that in certain areas sources of biomass feed stock can be made available to produce substantial amounts of fuel ethanol. While on a national basis this might not be seen as a significant amount of the total energy consumption in Australia, it does mean that we have industrial knowledge and are capable of expanding, when necessary, this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During World War II, during the oil crisis and even when there have simply been low sugar prices, there have been calls for the fuel ethanol industry to get going. But it does take things such as an oil shock for us to look a little further afield than the ready availability of the fossil fuels that we use as a source of fuel today, particularly for our transportation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is certainly putting in place a springboard for this industry. Hopefully, in three years we will see an industry of sufficient size which will have the momentum to continue to grow. In those three years, we can gather a greater amount of knowledge about this particular industry. The industry will have its own head of steam and will be able to grow from there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members of the government, the honourable member for Gippsland and no doubt other speakers recognise, we are not about trying to produce an industry that is the same size as that developed in Brazil, and I have already mentioned the reasons for that. Growth which is achieved through the provision of a vast number of subsidies to industry has its own inefficiencies. As was indicated by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gippsland, when the price of oil per barrel decreases, we run into problems. That particular subsidy has to be increased in order for the industry to compete with other competitors. If we can get industry to the point where it can stand on its own two feet, compete and be an overall part of our sources of energy and fuel, then we will have a viable industry. We hope to achieve this in the three years that the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill will provide the payment of a bounty to the manufacturers of new fuel alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a representative of a sugar growing area, I am certainly pleased to support the bill proposed by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook). Whilst a number of sources other than sugarcane could be used for the production of ethanol, I intend to concentrate on the production from this crop as it is of direct interest to my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol has been talked about for many years as an alternative source of energy, especially as a replacement for diesel and petrol. Ethanol has been used on and off in Australia for most of this century as a source of fuel&mdash;not as a source of beverage. World War II, the oil crisis and low sugar prices, as I mentioned, have at separate times led to fresh calls for the expansion of this industry. However, because of the economics involved and the relatively high costs in comparison to fuels produced from oil, extensive use of ethanol has never been achieved. Current estimates put the cost of producing a barrel of ethanol at double that of producing a barrel of oil. As I said before, it does not take much of on oil shock for the price of oil to skyrocket. Conversely, in the case of world peace, particularly in the Middle East, it does not take much for the price of oil to come down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With our nation's growing realisation that the environment has to be looked after if we are not to suffer a major catastrophe, there has to be a renewed interest in alternative clean fuels, which is what we refer to this one as. With its potential to limit dangerous emissions from exhaust systems, as well as being a renewable energy source, ethanol offers just such a choice. This bill dovetails well into the federal government's lead abatement strategy. It received some criticism from the opposition speaker preceding me, the honourable member for Gippsland, but I am delighted that the bill has come before the House. The allocations were foreseen in the previous budget of 1992-93. I was delighted to be part of a group assembled by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) to look at ways to reduce lead in petrol through the lead abatement strategy. There were very good reasons for that, particularly the health of children and the ongoing impacts of higher blood lead levels nationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the sugar growing industry in my electorate. In my area of northern New South Wales, several studies have already been undertaken into the production of ethanol for fuel purposes. In a proposal investigated in one of the studies, the Condong Sugar Mill looked at setting up a two-megalitre Biostil to supply the needs of the mill's vehicles as well as farmers who are shareholders in that company. The Biostil process is currently used by CSR at the power alcohol plant at the Plane Creek Mill near Sarina in Queensland. Due to problems in obtaining the necessary equipment, the venture was unfortunately never undertaken. I also understand that, due to the present costs involved in the technology, the amount of biomass available in my area would probably preclude the building of a particular plant. Let us hope that, with the gathering of information and scientific knowledge on this process over the next three years, the costs of production will come down so that the amount of throughput available from the Northern Rivers area in New South Wales would permit the mill to move into this alcohol production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, despite the promise shown in these studies, large-scale production of ethanol in northern New South Wales would at this stage be hindered by that lack of molasses. Molasses is a by-product of sugar production which is utilised for ethanol production. The Sarina plant, which I mentioned, is in a better position to take up the Commonwealth's offer, as it has a large molasses pool to draw from, with a number of mills in the Mackay area as well as the potential to transport large amounts from Proserpine and the lower Burdekin. I am reliably informed that it is planning on producing about five million litres of power alcohol so as to participate in the scheme. The plant currently exports a major component of its product overseas and uses the rest for domestic industrial uses, such as methylated spirits and ink. I am sure that honourable members will be aware that Bundaberg utilises alcohol from molasses in the production of that fine drop known as Bundaberg Rum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some earlier environmental problems which have been experienced as a result of the production of ethanol have, to a certain degree, been overcome. Much of the effluent can now be pumped back onto sugarcane fields and other crop fields as a fertiliser. Bagasse, which is the husk of the sugarcane left over after the juice is extracted, is a very valuable fuel which the mills utilise in their boiler rooms to generate electricity and to power machinery. I believe that some sugar mills are currently having discussions with the Queensland government over the sale of that excess electricity produced by sugar mills when they burn the bagasse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn my attention to the economics involved in producing alcohol. As I noted earlier, it is estimated that the cost of producing a barrel of ethanol is almost double the cost of producing a barrel of fuel from oil.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Technological demand has aided in lowering the costs of ethanol production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure honourable members who have experimented in brewing their own beer would be familiar with the old process of ethanol production where basically molasses, yeast and water are added and fermentation allowed to take place, thus producing alcohol. Whilst not having the technical expertise of some in the brewing game, I am reliably informed that this process is somewhat cumbersome. The Biostil process, which I referred to earlier, utilises vacuums and other mechanisms to increase the yields whilst saving time, thus cutting costs in the production process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal elements of the bounty scheme are to operate from 1 July 1994 until 30 June 1997, a total of three years. It will involve a total of some $25 million, with annual caps in the three years of $6 million, $8 million and $11 million consecutively. The bounty itself is to be paid on a new production basis in Australia of ethanol from biomass feedstocks sourced from plants grown in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that production does not rely just on feed stock from the sugarcane industry and that, as has been mentioned by previous speakers, some of those feedstocks will include the grain industry. We are all probably aware of the plant that has been started up at Nowra by Manildra Feeds which relies on gluten and starch. That plant is in a fine position to capitalise on this bounty. We will no doubt see that plant obtain a large amount of the bounty. I wish it well. I am not making any allegations, but I hope that the technology and the information that the Manildra plant gains are made available at not too high a cost to new players in the industry, for the reasons that I have mentioned. The sugar industry in my area, despite the very large and considerably beneficial income which it derives from sugar, is not able to participate in something like this. The amount of feed stock available through the molasses pool does not at this stage allow the building of this type of plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bounty is to be paid at 18c per litre of bountiable fuel ethanol. Any unused funds from a bounty year will be carried over to the following year. The bounty is to be payable to the producer of bountiable fuel ethanol provided that the producer at the time of production is a registered producer who has been granted an allocation and the production for which bounty is being claimed is within that allocation. During any particular year of the bounty the payment of bounty is subject to and payable from money appropriated from the parliament for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gippsland surprised me in his almost strong call that we not renew this particular bounty. The honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) obviously also heard the remarks of the honourable member for Gippsland, who indicated that the opposition would be supporting the bill. I was surprised at his grasp of what the greenhouse gas emission issue is all about. It was surprising that the honourable member for Gippsland turned around at the end of his speech and actually called for this to be a one-off bounty. I call on the government to be more strongly involved not just in this type of bounty but also in other areas of energy production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only with good initiatives like this from the government&mdash;where it is actually supporting, if you like, sunrise industries to make sure the technology is available and developed in Australia so that we can own the technology and it can be available for other businesses within Australia&mdash;that we will have diverse sources of energy available and we will not have to rely solely on the fossil fuel industry as our energy source. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the honourable member for Gippsland was painting his party in great shades of dark green, I was a little disappointed that he finished his remarks in that way. Nevertheless, I appreciate the fact that the opposition is supporting this bill. Like all members, I certainly hope not so much that this bounty will be extended three years hence but that it does achieve what it is aimed to do&mdash;that is, kick off the industry and get it going. That is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all understand the danger of having an industry such as this start off with a bounty. There is the danger that it will become dependent upon government subsidies. The bounty is paid on a production basis. In a sense, the bounty does not restrict production. While the measure can be lightly criticised, it does not mean that the industry will be wholly dependent upon the bounty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any industry, obviously, needs some government assistance. The honourable member for Gippsland and members of the National Party would, no doubt, like to see the government involved in putting money into industries in country areas. This certainly has a benefit for country and regional Australia. We are all aware of its dependency on fossil fuels, and anything that can go towards finding an alternative to fossil fuel, which the ethanol industry if it is developed will be able to partly replace, is a good thing. It also means that industries in regional Australia can have a further source of income. Essentially, molasses is a waste product. In some places, and particularly in my area, it goes into producing stockfeed, which is an excellent source of energy for stock. In other areas&mdash;I have mentioned North Queensland&mdash;the molasses waste by-product actually goes into producing industrial products such as ink and methylated spirits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a better industry on the ground in regional Australia&mdash;Nowra and mid-Queensland will probably be the two areas that will benefit straightaway&mdash;country areas will be much more economically independent and the industry will give them another source of income. I think Australia is particularly well suited not so much to see a big industry grow up but to have a section of industry which can operate and utilise what essentially have been waste products and by-products and cash in on those. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to speak on the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill. Being an environmentalist many years ago, I am extremely pleased that our government has taken this step. In the 1993-94 budget, the Commonwealth committed funds to establish a lead abatement strategy. Part of the strategy included the provision of a $25 million bounty to support the production of ethanol for use as a transport fuel, and $3.94 million to support research and development of ethanol-blended fuels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard quite a bit this morning about how various parts of Australia are starting to produce ethanol. Ethanol has been used in New South Wales for a couple of years now and it is starting to take off. I will give a little history about ethanol and then discuss how I believe it can enhance the lifestyle of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol has been used for fuel in the past in Australia. During World War II, sugarcane was used to produce ethanol as a petroleum substitute. This happened quite extensively. The interest in the fuel at the moment is derived from a range of environmental import replacement and waste product utilisation motives. The words `waste product utilisation motives' are very important. Not enough focus has been given to this part of the ethanol debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what is done with sugarcane waste. I imagine it is just put on the ground and burnt. Wheat stubble is usually burnt. I can recall it being burnt in South Australia and New South Wales. However, farming practices are changing, and I think wheat stubble is now being ploughed back into the ground. Just recently, we have been informed that Tasmania has huge volumes of potato peelings and is looking to use them to produce ethanol. I can recall alcohol from potato peelings being drunk at various establishments in Victoria and New South Wales. I have never drunk it but I know people who have&mdash;when they have been desperate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol is usually considered as an adjunct or extender to be added to petroleum or diesel fuel rather than a complete fuel source. When ethanol is added, it is usually added at a rate of around 10 per cent, and no carburettor or exhaust modifications are required. Thus, the fuel can be readily slotted into existing fuel supplies. I believe that ethanol was added at a rate of about 10 per cent in New South Wales. However, there was a bit of a problem with Ford Falcons. It was found that, if ethanol were added at a rate of 10 per cent, it would affect the fuel gauges. That level has now been dropped to about 7 1/2 per cent and it is working quite well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol is replacing fuel&mdash;a lot of it is imported, so import replacement is important&mdash;and it is using up waste products. Ethanol is also an octane enhancer. The addition of around 10 per cent ethanol to fuel results in an approximate octane increase of three RONs. We have all heard of lead being phased out in petrol, but ethanol can also be used as an alternative to benzene. Benzene is becoming a very great issue. I think everyone knows that it is carcinogenic and causes all sorts of problems. I think that, as more focus is put on petrol companies around the world, benzene will be phased out. There is a market here for ethanol which, at the moment, is being filled by a product which is very bad for our health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> An environmental reason for using ethanol is that petroleum products are fossil fuels which have accumulated naturally over millions of years, and this bank of fossil fuels is decreasing very rapidly. No-one knows the current amount of oil reserves but they are finite&mdash;they are not making any more oil as far as I am aware; it is all in the ground now&mdash;that is, what reserves there are will no doubt run out. However, ethanol can be replenished all the time. That is an excellent reason for us to look at it, include it as an additive, do more research on it and make more use of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences of releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are well known. The greenhouse effects have been mentioned. The levels of carbon dioxide have increased from around 280 parts per million in 1750 to 350 parts per million in 1994. Some honourable members might wonder how we know what the level of the greenhouse effect was in 1750. This has been determined by drilling ice cores in Antarctica. The atmosphere has been trapped in little air bubbles in those ice cores and, when analysed, have given that result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol is derived from sustainably grown biomass and, theoretically, produces no net release of carbon dioxide. This is another good reason for using it. Assuming there is a renewable biomass, ethanol has the potential to reduce net carbon dioxide emissions by 100 per cent, thus impacting upon the emissions of greenhouse gases. The implementation of the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill will go a long way in arguing that Australia has gone a step towards meeting its commitments to the Earth Summit in Rio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol is used in diesel fuel, and other advantages include a reduction in carbon monoxide emissions by about 40 per cent, a reduction in visible smoke and particulates by about 50 per cent, and a reduction in the oxides of nitrogens. If we follow a diesel truck or a bus, we can see black smoke coming out of it. If ethanol were used, it would reduce the smoke by around 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traditionally, ethanol has been produced by using sugarcane, such as in Brazil at the moment or in Australia during World War II. This method of production utilises a valuable resource which may be better applied elsewhere for other products. New technology being developed in Australia produces ethanol from lignin and lignocellulosic biomass&mdash;that is, forest waste&mdash;without producing another waste stream. This new technology is being developed by APACE in the Hunter Valley&mdash;this has been mentioned before&mdash;and a planned pilot ethanol plant at Raymond Terrace plant near Newcastle is currently undergoing a feasibility study at a cost of about $50,000. Pilot scale work on this type of technology has also been carried out in the United States and in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Acids are used to break down the fibres to produce sugars which are subsequently fermented in the same manner as conventional feedstocks. The biomass means that anything from rice husks, cotton stubble and ginning trash, woody weeds, forestry wastes and thinnings can all be processed into ethanol. The cost and supply limitations of conventional ethanol production from sugarcane are overcome by utilising this waste product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brazil has been using sugarcane as the base for ethanol production for quite some time now. About six months ago there was a big debate going on in Brazil about whether the subsidy should be stopped. An article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS> in relation to ethanol states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The world's biggest experiment in alternative fuel, Proalcohol was set up in 1975 as a response to the oil crisis of the 1970s, and now provides ethanol from sugar cane to power around one-third of Brazil's 12 million cars. It produces fewer pollutants than petrol and does not contribute to the greenhouse effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project's problem is not basic costs or space. Making ethanol from sugar cane has become about 40 per cent cheaper since the program got under way in 1979, and sugar producers say there is potential to reduce them further. But world oil prices have fallen so far as to make ethanol too expensive without substantial government subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA>This problem will impact on ethanol production here in Australia. One of my concerns on this bill is that we have got the oil companies involved. For many years now in speeches I have made in this House I have not been an advocate of the oil companies. I have had a go at them. I believe there is collusion between the oil companies; they have formed an oil prices cartel. They set the prices and dictate exactly what you and I have to pay. We all know that, and we all know that they dictate to the government. These oil companies have quite immense power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premier of Victoria recently visited a small town in south Gippsland. Before he arrived the oil companies told all the oil distributors in that town to drop their prices. Within one or two hours before the Premier's arrival all the prices displayed on the price signs were dropped by about 10c per litre. After the Premier left they put the prices up again. No-one can tell me that BP, Caltex, Ampol and Shell all had this great thought at the same time to drop the prices. A company representative rang up and said, `Drop the prices. The Premier is coming. Let us make it look as though there are lower prices in this town.' That sort of thing goes on and that worries me with this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, some of the petrol companies in New South Wales are taking ethanol from the bowsers. It is being blended and then sold in special pumps for about the same price as petrol. If the petrol companies decide not to distribute ethanol&mdash;a direct competitor with their product&mdash;I wonder what will happen. Who is going to stand up against these petrol companies? Who is going to start another distribution supply so that people can go and get ethanol blended fuel? I am worried that these companies might use some of their huge monopoly powers to restrict the sale of ethanol, and we cannot do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that this bounty will last for only three years with the provision that, if there is any money left over, the bounty will continue until that money runs out. I would like to see the government review the situation after about two or 2 1/2 years. If it were found to be working, we could extend it further. Let us give some of these monopoly petrol companies a bit of competition. Let us force them to take this blended fuel. Instead of having it only in the smaller markets, let us get it into the Sydney and Melbourne markets. Let us set up ethanol producing plants. In Victoria there is plenty of potato peel waste and plenty of wood fibre that could be converted into ethanol. Let us get it into the major markets so we can make a strong contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gases and pollutants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol has been economical only in countries which have had substantial subsidies. That is what the bill we are dealing with at present is about. However, I am quite certain that if waste product utilisation of ethanol were developed further, we should be able to make it work without subsidies. The United States has converted 10 million tonnes of grain into 40 billion litres of ethanol per annum. A huge amount of ethanol is being produced over there. It is equivalent to about 10 per cent of the total US fuel consumption. The benefits derived are enhanced due to the reduced carbon monoxide emissions during cold winters, as ethanol is a fuel oxygenate. The European source is called rape methyl ester and is derived from oilseed grape. Countries in which the fuel is used include Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. There are many more countries using this particular fuel, and there are many more people benefiting from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the technology improves, the prices of ethanol will drop, it will be available to more people, and it will be able to better compete with oil. No doubt, oil prices will rise again. There will be another resources shock somewhere along the line. If we have moved into ethanol production in a big way, we will be able to ride out that shock a lot better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 10 per cent reduction in the amount of petrol or oil that goes to Tasmania could be a huge saving for that island state. This new idea in Tassie of using potato peels should be encouraged. The government should put more money into making certain that Tasmania has an ethanol production unit. It would be situated near the Edgell-Birds Eye potato processing company at Ulverstone&mdash;the Southern Hemisphere's largest potato processor. There must be a huge amount of peel there that could turn into a valuable fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol is a good fuel. It is a clean fuel, a fuel that does not create problems for our atmosphere. This is an excellent bill. We should have implemented the measures it contains years ago. I am very proud to be able to speak on this bill. I am quite certain that in the Senate, the Australian Democrats and the Greens will be exceptionally pleased about this bill. They have been advocating the measures contained in it for some time. I am disappointed that the opposition has said that if it ever came into power, the bounty would cease after its three-year period of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmers of Australia should have access to this type of technology. They should plant crops in the knowledge that the by-product from the waste of those crops can be used, thereby enabling them to get more dollars per acre of ground. This is an important piece of legislation. I am pleased I am a member of the government that has brought the legislation into the House. The Australian public will be able to use ethanol in the near future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill, I will take the opportunity of indicating to the House the experience we had as a National Party touring team in Brazil, where we looked very thoroughly at the sugar industry and at ethanol production. The bounty in this bill has a three-year term. The opposition has quite rightly said that, after that three-year period, we would want to see how the bill had been implemented, what money had been spent and what profit had come from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we strip away the veneer and all the good things it has been proven that ethanol can do, we have to come back to the basis of the cost of production. I understand that one of the conditions a licensee must fulfil is to prove, after the expiration of the three-year term, that it can sustain the production of ethanol without the 18c bounty. While the licensee has the encouragement of two things, that 18c per litre bounty and also the exemption of 30 to 31c per litre on the fuel excise, of course, ethanol production in Australia can be profitable. What it needs, more than anything else, is a long-term commitment by the government that fuel excise will not be charged on the production of ethanol. That gives the production of ethanol a huge advantage over traditional oil products which are being used at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This $25 million is being spent because of the pressure brought to bear by the Australian Democrats and the Greens on the passage of the budget 12 months ago. But this does not prove ethanol is viable or that it can work profitably for the amount of money being spent. In fact, in my own industry, the sugar industry, which I know so well, many comments have been made to me such as, `Of course, you'd be very thrilled with this $25 million program.' The fact is I do not believe that the sugar industry will benefit to any great extent, because that industry already has a factory in place producing ethanol for industrial purposes. In the past, about seven or eight years ago, it produced ethanol as an experiment to be mixed with petrol and, I think, called the resultant blend `petranol'. It knows the techniques, technology and conditions under which it can manufacture ethanol, but it also knows the other side of the equation: what is required to change production from sugarcane in Australia to ethanol, as a major product as against sugar. It comes down to dollars and cents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, this industry requires an indication of how these people who will be licensees can prove, in the space of three years, that they can successfully produce ethanol without that subsidy. It also has to have the guarantee of the fuel excise. To compare it with the other uses to which these products can be put is a matter of interest to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot speak with authority on wheat. But already, I understand, some 100,000 tonnes of wheat has been put aside for the production of ethanol. This is mainly benefiting one company in New South Wales, the Manildra Group, which has just recently opened a plant. There are certain suggestions that the $25 million could quite easily be absorbed just by this one licensee itself. If that is the case, I think it would be a major disadvantage to other interested people. So the application of these funds will be very important as will, at the end of the day, the proof that manufacturing can continue without the bounty and also without the fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been a great stalwart over many years of the production of ethanol for the very good reasons that people indicate here: it is known to be a clean source of power and is certainly far better for the environment than the oil produced product we have at the moment. It also has great advantages for engines not only because the exhaust emissions are cleaner but also because the engines have a better torque, a better capacity for power. But, as I said, the technology is known. The $25 million has yet to be proven to me to be worth while and well spent, when we think of competing needs in this country and how that amount of money could be better spent in other regards, particularly in cleaning up the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now have the opportunity to speak about what I referred to earlier: a visit we made to Brazil, where my major interest was in the sugar industry. I will quote a few figures. Brazil is certainly set up to produce ethanol, with major encouragement coming from the government, which sets the quotas for ethanol production in any one year; it also sets the price. Of course, the price which is set determines the price at the bowser. So the subsidy is one from the individual motorist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the city we visited, Sao Paulo, the air environment, in Latin American terms, is probably as clean as that in any city in South America. The Brazilian government has refined its assistance to the production of ethanol to a great extent in the manufacture of vehicles. At the moment, all petrol, where it is used, has an enhancer of a 22 per cent ethanol mix. That is the maximum which can be used in coordination. Over that amount there is a problem of water penetration in the petrol, which makes the engine inefficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, the Brazilian government is also committed to the use of pure ethanol engines, with a major production of motor vehicles and engines in Brazil by the four manufacturers. While we were there, we went to GMH and saw two engines: one with a blend of 22 per cent, and one with a pure ethanol mix. The pure ethanol mix engine is more expensive than the traditional gasoline engine. But, again, the government has seen fit to make sure they are manufactured by giving a subsidy. The additional requirements for pure ethanol increase the price of the vehicle by one or two per cent, which the government meets by way of subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We came away with the belief that Brazil is so committed to the production of ethanol that we should have no fear of a transfer of its massive cropping to sugar production and, hence, onto the world market. With the type of production Brazil has&mdash;eight times the size of Australia's&mdash;if Brazil were to put that into the export market, onto the world market, we could say goodbye to the Australian industry; efficient though it is, we could say goodbye to it. So it is of encouragement to us that the Brazilian government is so committed to ethanol production that that event is not likely, although the individual producers of sugar, the sugar mills, with the discipline that is exercised on them, sometimes break ranks. When the price of sugar on the export market is favourable, it would be a simple process to transfer from ethanol production to sugar production. If it ends up as sugar, the ethanol production is lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are some of the figures we were given. A tonne of raw sugarcane produces about eight litres of ethanol. With molasses, it is considerably enhanced to about 25 litres per tonne of cane. That is what CSR is doing at Plain Creek Mill at the moment. But, if we take the cane juice straight from the cane and convert it to ethanol, it would produce about 81 litres of ethanol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went onto properties and talked to people in Brazil. The price that they have arranged for ethanol in Brazil allows it to be sold at the equivalent of $US40 a barrel. When compared with oil at $US27 a barrel, it becomes competitive. We can also look at other aspects of the Brazilian industry, where the price per tonne of cane&mdash;that is in the field&mdash;is about $US12, or $A16 or $A17. In comparison, the Australian ethanol producers would have to pay about $30 or $32 per tonne of cane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a huge difference in the price that makes it acceptable for the Australian sugar industry to start changing from its normal production of sugar to the production of ethanol. When we look at the size of the Brazilian industry, as I said, we are looking at an industry eight times the size of the Australian industry and two-thirds of its production is converted to the production of ethanol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia it has been estimated that it would take the total Australian sugar industry to supply a 10 per cent enhancer through ethanol to petrol. Obviously, the Australian sugar industry will not be looking at that, even in spite of the bounty incentive of 18c per litre. I know that the sugar industry is not unsympathetic to the approach of the government to look at the subsidy arrangement as supported by this bill; the sugar industry, the Sugar Research Institute and all relevant bodies in Australia know all about the technology. If it were profitable at this stage, they would be producing ethanol instead of sugar. I believe that the 18c a litre incentive will not encourage somebody to start a product that in three years time will lapse because there is no subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), who spoke before me, made great play about the fact that we have said as an opposition that we would not encourage the continuation of the subsidy in three years. In actual fact, the government itself is not that enthusiastic about its own legislation. It has not guaranteed anything beyond the three years in any case. I see that as a bit of a mischief in terms of the reason for the legislation. As I mentioned earlier, I believe that the money could have been spent elsewhere. The money could have been spent more profitably on cleaning up the environment than on encouraging people to take out licences, which unfortunately in three years time, unless the price of oil skyrockets to about $60 a barrel, they are going to be left with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I can talk about sugarcane, but I cannot talk about what to do with the spare cropping of wheat and what price a bushel of wheat has to be before it is better converted to ethanol. Obviously, some New South Welshmen see that profit at the moment. But the question is: how do we guarantee a regular supply unless we do what they do in Brazil, and that is set down quotas, give guarantees and provide the subsidies that are necessary, not on a one-, two- or three-year basis but on an ongoing basis? As I said, there is no doubt that the commitment by government and industry in Brazil is total. Let us hope that, for the sake of our own sugar industry, it remains that way in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite a few of the conditions that people have to comply with are mentioned within the package. I have already mentioned&mdash;and it is my understanding&mdash;that there has to be proof that in three years time the particular licensee can continue to produce without the advantage of the subsidy of 18c per litre. The bounty will only be payable to a producer and the bounty will not be payable unless a producer is registered at the time of production and remains so until the claim is made. The bounty will also not be payable where the Comptroller-General of Customs is satisfied the fuel ethanol was or will be exported directly or indirectly to New Zealand. In respect of the other conditions, I believe that if the department is fair dinkum it will make sure that the conditions are adhered to and will not let the money out in some fashion or other that advantages an already existing supplier as against a supplier in other places of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that more encouragement was not given to the production of ethanol. We will find in Australia, as has already been mentioned, a great objection by the major companies that provide fuel&mdash;motor fuel at the moment&mdash;that know the techniques, that have experimented with the blend but are still persevering with and controlling the current pricing of petrol. Until those major companies are encouraged to do something about their production and become involved with the production of ethanol, I believe that at the end of the day the $25 million will be seen to have not been well spent. It was spent only in the interests of getting last year's budget through. I think any government member would acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the House for the opportunity to put on the record what I believe is the production and efficiency of an Australian industry that I feel will not be taking advantage of this because there is no advantage to be taken in comparison to the manner in which it produces sugar. I wish the government well. I will be looking forward with great interest to the outcome of this legislation to make sure that the money is properly applied and well spent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and my good friend the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) in contributing to this debate. I will just pick up the last point of the honourable member for Dawson. Whatever the government may have said about last year's budget, the increase in the excise was all about getting extra revenue. I regret that we did not suggest to the Australian people up-front that that was our approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I also think there were some good environmental reasons for doing so. Had we adopted that approach I think we may have had a little less bother and aggravation than what we actually had. I think I am going halfway to agreeing with the honourable member for Dawson. I would certainly like to thank him for informing the House first-hand of his experience in Brazil. The Brazilian approach to what I think it calls gasohol&mdash;a blend of petrol and ethanol, which allows them to extend petrol use over there&mdash;has always been of great interest to me. It is certainly a very successful operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to acknowledge the interests of one of my constituents, Mr Peter Van der Ryden. He takes a great interest in the issue of ethanol, as I do. I know that he will be very pleased to see this legislation coming through the House. As has been mentioned by previous speakers, $25 million will be provided over the next three years for a bounty payment at the rate of 18c per litre&mdash;$6 million in the first year, $8 million in the second year, $11 million in the third year, and whatever moneys are unexpended in one year will be rolled into the second year. I think it is very important that Australian industry remains in touch with this. I have no doubt that in the future, given our concerns about the environment and the possible volatility of fossil fuels, we will increasingly see other countries, as well as Australia, resorting to ethanol as a way of extending their limited reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought the contribution of the honourable member for Dunkley, in particular, highlighting the plight of Tasmania and its dependence on fuel being shipped from the mainland and the potential Tasmania may provide in terms of converting some of its waste products, was very interesting. Ethanol, as the honourable member for Dawson suggested, can be produced from sugarcane, wheat and a whole variety of primary products. I think there is an opportunity for us, particularly given the high point of sale costs in places like Tasmania and also in rural and remote Australia, to be a little more imaginative and think in terms of value adding some of the things that are done locally as a way of containing those relatively high costs and providing value adding to primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the point that the honourable member for Dawson made that it would be nice to see a longer time on this bounty bill. But, again, like the honourable member for Dunkley, I would like to think that the government, prior to the scheme ending&mdash;I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), would agree with me&mdash;would want to review the situation and the success of these measures and also to ascertain whether or not there is a need for their extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dunkley was speculating  whether or not at some future date petrol companies, the established oligopolies in Australia, might wish to pick up ethanol or, indeed, whether or not we need to compel them to do so. I have spoken on the issue of distribution a number of times, and I have no reason whatsoever to change my stance&mdash;that is, if proponents are happy to force down competition policy in so many areas of our activities in the economy and if we are to realistically address the issue of petrol distribution we need to get the petrol suppliers out of the distribution chain. It should be impossible for the petrol company oligopolies to actually own the retail sites; that is the only way to get proper competition. That used to be the case but, unfortunately, past federal governments allowed petrol companies to buy independent retailers. As a result, they now hold the whip hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I totally reject the conclusion of the Industry Commission and of the commissioner of the Prices Surveillance Authority about the reality of competition. If there were one thing that frustrated people in metropolitan electorates, or even regional electorates, it would be the fact that the price of petrol goes up and down for no particular rhyme or reason. In fact, someone suggested that there is a distinct pattern of a decrease in prices at the beginning of the week and an increase in prices at the end of the week. Ordinary people find that rather incomprehensible and suspect that they are being diddled, and I think that there is some truth in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons there is not a greater take-up of ethanol is the low cost of oil. In fact, the cost of oil has just fallen to about $17 per barrel. It is a significant fall because it was up around $28 or $30 per barrel during the oil crisis. When I happily go back to my electorate I try to convince my good voters of a couple of things. I point out to them that if they compare the cost of petrol&mdash;notwithstanding all the government changes, both federal and state&mdash;it is still relatively cheap. They do not perceive the cost of Australian petrol as cheap; in fact, they feel it is very expensive. If any honourable members in this House have some clues about how to convince people that Australian petrol is relatively cheap, I would be most grateful if they would pass them on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the tyranny of distance that Australia has, people feel that cheap petrol ipso facto must be a good thing for Australia. I can understand and relate to that argument. However, it is true to say that whilst you have a very cheap commodity and whilst you develop many new uses for it not all of those uses will be most efficient. There is a very strong argument that perhaps the cost of petrol needs to go up in Australia. I am not foolhardy because if I said to the Australian people in an election campaign, `We need to increase petrol by 10c or 20c a litre,' I know exactly what their reaction would be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of all this is to pick up the points that the honourable members for Dawson and Dunkley were making: the low price of petrol makes the introduction of alternative and more sustainable fuels such as ethanol much more difficult. I hope that in the foreseeable future we will see a commitment by the government, even though it requires a commitment beyond these three years, to significant ethanol production in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has quite a number of advantages vis-a-vis world competitors. In all forms of agriculture our relatively pristine environment is seen as a significant advantage, and our use of solar energy is seen as a significant advantage also. Australia can have a significant advantage in energy efficient industries. A very important issue is our dependence, maybe even overdependence, on the motor car, which makes it the best vehicle to use alternative fuel. It also reinforces the other point I would like to make: we cannot get into industries without there being a legitimate role for government policy and, in some instances, government money. I know this goes against the fashion, and I apologise for advancing it. Some may argue $25 million is not a lot of money but I would argue that it is a significant commitment by the government. I would like to see the government undertake a review of the bounty prior to any decision being made to completely phase it out. Even if after the review the government were to say it should be phased out, I would argue that it is worth while having an independent review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important issue for Australia is the fossil fuel reserves because they are running low. We have significant shale deposits in Australia, which were at one stage exploited for the production of kerosene. There may be a case for the government to consider not only funding some research but also ensuring that Australia has the technology to exploit its very vast shale reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I am very solidly behind the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill 1994. I regret to say that the low price of petrol, from its highs of $28 or $30 a barrel, makes the introduction of alternative energy sources much more difficult. Be that as it may, all members of the House should be supportive of this initiative. I can only hope that those producers that take advantage of the bounty will be able to demonstrate some breakthroughs in technology such that the cost disincentive that exists with ethanol may in the future be removed. I would like to see a commitment by the government for a review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would like to thank the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne), the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell), the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) for their excellent contributions. It is clear that each of those speakers recognises that there will be substantial benefits from the scheme proposed in this legislation. The fact is that studies both in Australia and overseas have demonstrated the adverse health effects that occur at even lower levels of lead exposure than were considered previously to be a cause for concern. This legislation therefore is recognition by the government that it shares these concerns and is committed to a lower and safer lead content in petrol in the short term and an eventual phasing out of lead from petrol completely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ethanol bounty scheme is designed to complement the lead abatement strategy by supporting the development of potentially more environmentally benign alternative fuels. It will, therefore, contribute to alleviating the health problems attributable to lead emissions. We all know that the aim of the bounty scheme is also to encourage a commercial ethanol transport fuel industry in Australia that will eventually be able to compete on a viable economic basis with established petroleum fuels. We know that this will eventually happen through advances in technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bounty scheme complements other measures such as the petroleum product excise exemption for alternative transport fuels, which was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his statement on the environment of December 1992. Queries have been made, particularly by some of the opposition speakers, as to why there is a bounty on ethanol production. We all know that there are a number of barriers to the widespread use of fuel ethanol, including its cost, the lack of standards in fuel ethanol and its non-compatibility with some vehicle components. Some speakers have addressed those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When ethanol is produced by conventional technology, production costs are estimated to be around 70c per litre compared to 20c per litre for petrol. The issues of compatibility and lack of standards are being addressed in a fuel ethanol research and development program associated with the bounty scheme. While the costs of current non-renewable petroleum based transportation fuels are low, there are few incentives to seek environmentally friendly alternative fuels. As a consequence, the very valid concerns expressed by speakers during this debate and by other members of the community with respect to health issues may not be adequately addressed in the absence of some form of government assistance. The honourable member for Richmond, in particular, addressed those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, as ethanol fuel blends are currently being used, the basic vehicle technology and fuel distribution infrastructure make ethanol an attractive alternative to the non-renewable fuel sources currently available. The blending of ethanol with petrol is being trialled, as other speakers have said, by Manildra at Nowra in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the potential for contribution of ethanol production compared to Australia's overall transportation fuel requirements, it is important to acknowledge that, assuming that all of the bounty funding is allocated, the volumes of domestically produced new ethanol entered for consumption as a transportation fuel should total approximately 33 megalitres in the first year, 44 megalitres in the second year and 61 megalitres in the final year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of current ethanol production, these new volumes represent increases of between 100 and 300 per cent. That is a significant increase in the volumes of new ethanol produced. New South Wales, as was said by a number of speakers, is by far the largest domestic producer of fuel ethanol, with current production levels of about 17 megalitres per annum, but with the capacity to increase production to 50 megalitres per annum, principally through the Manildra plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a comparison, current annual consumption of leaded and unleaded petrol totals approximately 17,500 megalitres and, therefore, the new ethanol production arising from the bounty scheme can have only a limited impact on current transport fuel consumption patterns. This, in itself, indicates the experimental nature of the ethanol bounty program and a recognition of the large production cost differential between the existing transportation fuels and ethanol. The ethanol bounty scheme can, therefore, be seen as a pragmatic approach by the government to the pursuit of an ecologically sustainable, renewable resource based transportation fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should mention Manildra's production capabilities and some other aspects in relation to that particular company, as a number of speakers have already alluded to that company. Manildra is the only fuel ethanol producer at the moment which is in receipt of the lion's share of the funds from a $3.94 million research and development federal government program. This in itself will contribute greatly to the establishment of a commercial market for fuel ethanol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be stated that the Manildra company made a commercial decision to produce fuel ethanol before the bounty was envisaged. Accordingly, there is no way that the company will be handicapped in any way by the introduction of this legislation. As is acknowledged by other speakers and indeed in the legislation, it is a bounty to encourage new production in Australia, including production by existing producers that exceeds their average level of production for the calendar years 1992 and 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bounty is certainly not a subsidy to existing producers. Although Manildra's production is presently relatively small, as I said earlier in my remarks, Manildra is considering a major expansion to 50 megalitres per year. That is approximately more than 10 times the current production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Virtually every speaker mentioned what would happen when the bounty ended. The government considers that three years is sufficient time for the industry to show that it can compete with petrol and diesel. The bounty scheme will be evaluated in mid-1996. By that time, producers of fuel ethanol will have received a substantial proportion of the bounty assistance of $25 million that will be made available. By the time this scheme ends on 30 June 1997, those producers which have effectively managed their business and reduced their production costs may well be on track towards being able to compete with established petroleum based transport fuels without the need for government subsidy. Only time will tell. Others may be less viable and may have to make a commercial decision whether or not to stay in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All applicants for bounty payments must recognise, from the outset, that there is no commitment to bounty subsidies after the three years of the scheme. This government is not going to proceed down the irresponsible path of subsidising uneconomic ethanol production indefinitely. We believe that this legislation provides a realistic trial of this program to enable this technology to advance much further than it has at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an exciting time for ethanol producers. I know that even in North Queensland Tully Sugar Ltd, for example, has been trialling ethanol production for a long time, and I am confident that that particular mill will look at this legislation to see if it can participate in it. As many speakers have said, it is an historic piece of legislation. I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill 1994 gives effect to the undertaking given in the 1993 budget to strengthen the capacity of the Health Insurance Commission to pursue fraudulent claims under Medicare. It represents the second instalment in a series of measures being taken by the government to minimise abuse of Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was the case in the development of the measures to combat overservicing&mdash;that is, the measures that are specified in the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994&mdash;the amendments outlined in this bill are the product of a close consultative process with the Australian Medical Association. Once again, the AMA has demonstrated an admirable willingness to come to grips with the issues and to offer positive suggestions for resolving current deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new measures in this bill are necessary because the current arrangements for dealing with fraud have proven to be deficient. The Australian National Audit Office, ANAO, found in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No. 17 1992-93: Medifraud and excessive servicing: Health Insurance Commission</EMPHASIS> that one of the principal impediments to an effective level of prosecutions was the inadequate investigative powers available to the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO expressed concern about the length of time for completion of cases referred to the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions, and noted that in Victoria the average time taken by the Australian Federal Police after the referral of a case was 224 days and that taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions was 324 days. The ANAO also noted that some prosecutions had failed because of the length of time it had taken to get the cases to court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While concerned that the Health Insurance Commission was dependent on the priority allocated to cases by the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions, the ANAO did acknowledge that it had recommended in a 1990-91 audit report on the efficiency and effectiveness of fraud investigations by the Australian Federal Police that the investigation effort be directed to frauds that justified police resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO concluded that the investigative powers of the commission should be significantly enhanced, and recommended that consideration be given to the Health Insurance Commission being given the power to deal directly with the Director of Public Prosecutions. The government has accepted that recommendation, which is given effect in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides for Health Insurance Commission investigators to be given reasonable powers to obtain relevant evidence. Those powers are progressive in nature in that the power to seek warrants to search for and seize relevant documents represents the extreme end of the powers to be given to the commission. Other, less intrusive, methods will be adopted whenever possible. Only if it appears that cooperation in obtaining relevant information is impossible, or if there is a serious risk that evidence may be destroyed, will the right to search and to seize documents be sought. Moreover, to ensure that there is consistency in decisions to seek such warrants, those decisions will be made centrally and will be limited to no more than a few senior commission officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event that some observers see the legislation as a sign by the government of a lack of confidence in the Australian Federal Police, it should be noted that this is not the case. The Australian Federal Police is expected to make its own judgments on what is the most effective way of using its investigation resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one of the features of the Medicare benefits arrangements that individual instances of abuse of the system frequently involve relatively small amounts of money. It is often not appreciated that the real extent of abuse is considerably more than would be suggested by the cases that have been brought to court. The same may be said about cases of overservicing that have been referred to the medical services committees of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem in dealing with fraud cases under Medicare is that the nature of the activities that are subject to investigation is such that they are often technical medical ones, subject to complex legislative provisions. This makes understanding the intricacies of certain cases particularly difficult. It is an unfortunate, albeit unavoidable, fact that many of the measures that have had to be taken in recent years to tackle abuse of the Medicare arrangements have served to add to the complexity of the legislation governing the payment of Medicare benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result is that, apart from the practitioners affected and the officers in the Health Insurance Commission who are required to have a detailed understanding of the technical and legal issues, many persons find it difficult to understand the health legislation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's view that it takes an adequate understanding of the Medicare Benefits Schedule and a sound understanding of the relevant legislation to effectively investigate Medicare fraud and to determine precisely what evidence is needed. Only the Health Insurance Commission is properly equipped to do this. Furthermore, unlike the Australian Federal Police, the Commission is in a position to direct its endeavours exclusively to the investigation of Medicare abuse and thus to reduce significantly the time currently taken to put a case to the Director of Public Prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill now before the House has already been the subject of considerable debate in the Senate. During a public hearing on the bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on 11 February 1994, it became evident that certain provisions in the original bill were of serious concern to both the committee and certain organisations and individuals. The principal concerns were that the powers granted to the commission were not sufficiently restricted to the investigation of Medicare fraud, and that there was insufficient protection for the privacy of patients' records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As there was a consensus that there was an imbalance between the powers of the investigators and the rights of the investigated, the government proposed a series of amendments to the bill, designed to redress that imbalance. A majority of the committee subsequently recommended that the bill be enacted, incorporating the amendments proposed by the government. During the debate on the bill in the Senate, the government accepted a number of further amendments. I commend the bill, as amended, to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill has been a long time coming to the House of Representatives and, as I shall make clear in the course of my speech, its final form owes a great deal to the efforts of the coalition. The genesis of this bill can be found in reports in the mid-1980s by the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts. More recently, in December 1992, the Auditor-General produced a report calling for legislative reform to address Medicare fraud and overservicing. The Auditor-General found that there was a lack of prosecutions and of disciplinary action taken against unethical practitioners and that there had been little improvement since the early 1980s. A bill was finally introduced into the Senate in mid-December last year. I would like to reiterate the comments made by Senator Newman in the other place regarding this need for reform. These were that the coalition strongly supports the need to address legislation shortcomings highlighted by the Auditor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year we supported legislation specifically dealing with the issue of overservicing. Such support, however, does not mean that we are uncritical of the legislation itself. Indeed, in its initial form the legislation was entirely unacceptable. It proposed the transfer of investigative powers from the Australian Federal Police to the Health Insurance Commission. However, the commission was to be granted powers in excess of those available to be exercised by the Australian Federal Police. As well, the bill appeared to take no account of privacy of individual records. One of the matters discussed in the Senate was a constant complaint, indeed an important issue that we in the opposition raise consistently, and that is that the Privacy Commissioner is accountable to the executive and not to the parliament. If he were accountable to the parliament, I believe we would have much better protection for individual privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of these concerns, the bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in February. Perhaps anticipating the barrage of criticism which the bill ultimately received at the committee's public hearing, the government announced, 48 hours before facing the music, that it would be drafting amendments to the bill. These were not ready in time for the public meeting. The hearing itself produced almost universal criticism of the bill, from representatives of the Australian Medical Association, the Australian Association of General Practitioners, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Australian Federal Police and the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two principal concerns were highlighted. The first was that the bill, as presented in the Senate, gave the Health Insurance Commission sweeping compliance powers. It allowed authorised officers of the Health Insurance Commission to enter the premises of a doctor or pharmacist and search the premises, take photographs and take extracts or copies of books or documents. For all intents and purposes, as the Privacy Commissioner pointed out, these were search and seizure powers without a warrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, under the bill as presented, the Health Insurance Commission would need no justification for entering the premises. That is an extraordinary situation, given the history of parliamentary and community concern on this issue on so many other occasions. Indeed, I am reminded of the concern that we showed in the inquiry into the Midford Paramount affair, where search and seizure procedures did result in an injustice being brought about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second principal concern with the first version of the bill was that no regard was paid to the confidentiality of individual patient records. The government came up with a series of amendments on 21 February. These were sent out for comment to witnesses who appeared before the Senate committee. These amendments address the issue of confidentiality of private records in a way which satisfied the Privacy Commissioner, the medical profession and the coalition. However, we were not satisfied with the amendments directed at the compliance powers of the Health Insurance Commission or with the accountability of actions of the Health Insurance Commission under the proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We highlighted these concerns in a dissenting report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The government responded with further amendments but still failed to go far enough. In particular, we believe that if a Health Insurance Commission officer was unable to obtain access to desired information by way of agreement with the occupier of the premises then a warrant should be obtained to conduct the search. In the end, the government had 34 amendments to the bill. We had seven proposed amendments and the Democrats six. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very important coalition amendment was the inclusion of a sunset clause in the bill. Such a clause is absolutely appropriate, given the sensitive nature of the bill. It will allow the parliament to evaluate, after a reasonable period of time, the effectiveness of the legislation and of the Health Insurance Commission in administering it. This amendment was accepted by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also sought to amend the bill so that it was restricted only to fraud occurring in the present sense. This was particularly important if Health Insurance Commission officers did not need warrants to enter premises. The Australian Federal Police are able to enter premises without a warrant only if they reasonably believe that some offence is being committed, not if they believe some offence may have been committed in the past. The government was not prepared to accept these amendments. The Democrats put forward compromise amendments, which were accepted by the Senate. The Health Insurance Commission officers will be able to enter premises to investigate fraud which is being committed, which it is thought is being committed or which has been committed within the last 60 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats also successfully put forward an amendment requiring the Health Insurance Commission to report in detail on its activities in its annual report. The coalition has already won a concession from the government that this would occur, so we were happy to support this amendment. Easily the most contentious amendments considered by the Senate were those moved by us. They were seeking to achieve two things: first, that pursuant to section 8S the Health Insurance Commission would be compelled to obtain consent of the occupier before entering premises; second, that in the event that consent was not obtained the Health Insurance Commission would be required to obtain a warrant from a magistrate. These amendments prompted considerable debate in the Senate. The issues were substantive, with concern being expressed that without these amendments yet another step was being taken in the diminution of civil liberties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end our amendments prevailed because Senator Crowley was unable to convince the Senate that the significant encroachment on fundamental civil liberties could be justified. And this is despite the government seeking, at the last election, to radically overstate the level of savings which will flow from these reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that election the Labor government claimed that its new spending promises on health could essentially be met from savings flowing from a reduction in fraud and overservicing. It suggested that there were savings of $400 million to be made over four years and that in the first two years savings would be around $160 million. We immediately challenged that figure, and with some justification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the August budget last year the estimated savings for the first two years had amazingly been pared back to $90 million, and this amount was identified in the explanatory memorandum to the bill. It stated that measures to reduce fraud and overservicing&mdash;that is, this bill and the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994&mdash;will save $25 million in 1993-94 and then $64.9 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that the government's figures be challenged so that we get nearer the truth of the matter. The only hard evidence we have comes from the Auditor-General's report No. 17 of 1992-93. There it states that in 1991-92 four successful prosecutions took place&mdash;only four&mdash;and that $1 million was recovered, a far cry from the election promises made and, indeed, the pared down figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the government is concerned, the larger the estimated cost of fraud, the easier it is to take this figure and argue for quite significant legislative provisions that have serious implications for civil liberties. In other words, we are told it is in the public good and we should give up a little bit of our freedom in order that this aim can be achieved. When we look closely, it simply cannot and must not be allowed to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another fatal flaw in the government's argument was that, without the Health Insurance Commission being granted powers greater than those exercised by the Australian Federal Police, it would be severely hampered in successfully investigating fraud. But the real problem has not necessarily been that the Australian Federal Police did not have adequate powers to investigate; it was just that the AFP did not give Medicare fraud a very high priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Support for our amendments came from Senator Harradine and the Greens senators. There was also a brief but very timely contribution in the debate on these amendments from Senator Cooney. Senator Cooney chaired the committee which examined the bill. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we are really saying to the people we represent who are listening to us today is this: what do they think is the right balance between these things? It is my view in regard to a lot of legislation coming through at the moment that the balance is going too far in the direction of detection. If we wanted to bug every bedroom, if we wanted to examine every household, there is no doubt we could suppress a lot of crime, but at what cost?</PARA>
<PARA>Implicit in these comments is the view that without the coalition's amendments the bill before us would simply have gone too far and would have removed an important freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that present arrangements for the investigation of Medicare fraud are inadequate, but there can be no doubt that this bill raises fundamental questions in regard to civil rights. In protecting the interests of the taxpayer we must not violate the rights of patients, health care professionals and health care organisations. That is why the coalition has approached this bill in a very serious and very rigorous manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the bill referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitution Affairs, and we have consulted widely. We have pressed the government to address shortcomings identified in the original bill. Where the government was not prepared to meet us on outstanding issues, we successfully moved our own amendments in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to receive from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) assurances that the government was prepared to accept the bill as it was amended, in its entirety, by the Senate. I welcome this decision. However, I must say I find it interesting that in this place we seem to have a practice where the minister who is responsible for legislation chooses not to attend and sends instead the Parliamentary Secretary. I think every time that we diminish the institution of parliament we do our citizens a disservice. I think it is a shame the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has not attended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there has been considerable cooperation in the progress of this bill. As a result, a better piece of legislation will ultimately be enacted. It will allow the Health Insurance Commission to immediately begin the task of investigating Medicare fraud. The commission will be able to do this with its new powers&mdash;powers that have rightly been moderated out of a need to respect the civil liberties that are still and must remain of high priority. The coalition and the parliament generally will be closely watching the effectiveness of these new powers and the way in which they are exercised by the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in support of the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill 1994. This bill is the second leg of the government's legislative reform measures, announced in the 1993-94 budget last August, to combat medical fraud and excessive servicing. The first leg was the passage of the Health Legislation (Professional Service Review) Amendment Act, which put in place new measures to deal with excessive servicing and inappropriate practice by doctors, and that included the establishment of professional services review committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This second part of the government's measures deals with improved measures to combat medical fraud, as opposed to excessive servicing. It is important to draw the distinction, of course, between fraud and overservicing. Medical fraud is a practitioner billing Medicare for a service on the medical benefits schedule which was not actually provided&mdash;in other words, straight-out fraud&mdash;or billing Medicare for the wrong item number. Excessive servicing, on the other hand, occurs when the service is actually provided but is an inappropriate service or a service that is not reasonably necessary for the adequate medical care or the clinical needs of the patient. It is important to understand the distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking to this bill, which of course is the second leg dealing with the fraud side, I might repeat some of the points that I made in the debate on the professional services review amendment bill last year in relation to the history of attempts by successive governments and by various government agencies to deal with abuses of Medicare and indeed with abuses of the predecessors of Medicare, the previous health insurance systems that existed under coalition governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members might be aware that I have had a long interest in and involvement in this particular issue, having worked in the relevant section of the then Department of Health back in the 1980s and also having been involved in preparing submissions to the public accounts committee inquiries that the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of medical fraud and overservicing first came to public notice in the early 1980s during the term of the Fraser coalition government. Prior to 1982 very little priority had been directed to the problem of abuse of the various health insurance systems by doctors. There had been no official recognition of the magnitude of the problem, despite various warnings by concerned officers within both the then Department of Health and the Health Insurance Commission, going back as far as 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two basic reasons can be advanced for the lack of activity in addressing this problem. Firstly, the Fraser government was unwilling to offend its friends in the medical profession, upon whom it relied for political support. Secondly, the medical profession itself had an historically very strong influence within the then health department's administration in those days. Of course, one had to be a doctor to be director-general or a state director of health in those days. Those officers had a very big influence within that department, which had responsibility for controlling abuses of the various systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first public acknowledgment of the extent of medical fraud and overservicing came in February 1982. It was reported that a leaked health department document received by the then shadow health minister, Dr Blewett, estimated that the level of abuse for the financial year 1980-81 was $100 million. This figure represented about seven per cent of total Commonwealth and fund benefits paid in 1980-81 under the previous health system. It is important to stress that that figure applies to the time before Medicare was introduced. It was under the Fraser government's health system, which involved private health insurance, subsidised to a significant extent by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimate was about seven per cent of the total dollar figure. It is important to stress that figure of $100 million, because that was before there was universal bulk-billing. The coalition on the one hand often wants to say that doctors are all honest people and do not rip the system off and on the other hand it says that yes, doctors do, but it is all because of Labor's socialist, ideological bulk-billing. Of course, the facts do not bear that out at all. As I said, there was an abuse figure of seven per cent before Medicare was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA at the time, in 1982, immediately issued a press statement which supported that figure. The figure was based on a formula calculated with the aid of the fraud and overservicing detection system, known as FODS, a highly complex computer based system which produced statistical data showing servicing patterns of medical practitioners. It is extremely significant to note that the AMA endorsed the estimate of that time and that its endorsement was based on analysis by its own actuaries in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two important points need to be noted about this matter. Firstly, the AMA, through its then president, Dr Lionel Wilson, supported the department's estimate of $100 million. This is particularly interesting when one looks at the AMA's position on this same issue in later years, after there had been a change of government and Medicare had been introduced. Secondly, as I have already said, the estimate of $100 million, or seven per cent of the total, was in relation to a time well before the introduction of Medicare&mdash;at a time when bulk-billing was available only to social security beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following public concern arising from these announcements, the public accounts committee initiated an inquiry into medical fraud and overservicing. Public hearings commenced in July 1982, and an interim report, tabled in parliament in December of that year, was extremely critical of the performance of the health department. It expressed the view that the level of abuse was likely to be even higher than the official estimate; that the seven per cent may well have been a conservative estimate. This report also resulted in the immediate sacking of the then Director-General of Health, and the inquiry had already led to the resignation of the Victorian Director of Health. The report was truly embarrassing to the Fraser government, as it closely followed the release of the Costigan report into tax avoidance and came at a time when the Fraser government was planning an early election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the very valid criticisms of the health department, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts also found that there were problems caused by the fact that several federal agencies were involved, particularly in cases of medical fraud. Suspected fraud cases were referred to the Australian Federal Police and prosecutions were carried out by the then Deputy Crown Solicitor's office. I can recall the frustration expressed in those days by health department investigators at the delays and inefficiencies this caused and the criticisms of the performances of the AFP in dealing with medifraud cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to be too critical of the role of the AFP, especially as my experience was of a period some years ago. Indeed, as the parliamentary secretary has pointed out, this bill does not seek to criticise the role of the Federal Police at all. However, it is fair to say that there was a perception that medical fraud cases were not exactly regarded as high priority matters for the Australian Federal Police, who were responsible for dealing with a wide range of crime. Many of the medifraud cases referred to the Australian Federal Police were for relatively small amounts of money when compared with others forms of crime. Of course, many Medicare fraud cases are for small amounts of money, though the small amounts do add up. The nature of the system and legislation was that each separate item number had to be prosecuted separately, which caused some problems. Consequently, it was probably true that medifraud cases were not always afforded high priority, although there were notable exceptions. That situation has remained until today, which is one of the reasons why this bill is so important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most significant aspects of the bill is that the Health Insurance Commission will now assume those investigative powers which are currently the responsibility of the Australian Federal Police. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) pointed out, this step is being taken not because of lack of confidence in the AFP but in order to bring better coordination and greater effectiveness to the investigation of fraud against Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Health Insurance Commission has since 1985 had the main carriage of investigation of medifraud and excessive servicing. At that time, following continuing criticisms of the performance of the then Department of Health, that department's surveillance and investigations program was abolished by the government and the functions transferred to the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken about that in this House previously. There were many reasons why it occurred, not least of which was the incessant and politically motivated attacks by the AMA at the time, after the introduction of Medicare. The association objected to any suggestion that there was something wrong or that there could be too many doctors who were ripping off the system. So it continued to attack the surveillance and investigation program of the former Department of Health just at the stage when it was starting to bring some results and embarrass the medical profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That program was transferred to the commission in 1985. As has already been pointed out, however, the Auditor-General's report No. 17 of 1992-93 examined the Health Insurance Commission's performance in combating fraud and overservicing. It concluded there had been little, if any, improvement evidenced since 1985, when the function was transferred from the former Department of Health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the report suggested that the estimate of seven per cent of medical benefits as the extent of abuse may still be appropriate. Although the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) pointed out that only $1 million was recovered, the Auditor-General's report says also that the level of abuse of seven per cent, estimated back in the early 1980s, could still be a valid figure. Medicare benefits&mdash;medical benefits only, not including pharmaceutical benefits&mdash;for 1991-92 were over $4 1/2 billion. At seven per cent, this would put the estimated level of abuse at over $300 million. For 1992-93, with Medicare benefits of $5 billion, this would represent abuse of over $350 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the audit report in 1992, at that time the Health Insurance Commission commissioned a consultant, Mr Harvey Bates, to review its investigation unit. His report dealt with investigation of medical fraud in particular, rather than overservicing. It is interesting to look at statements in that report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the need for a significant cultural change in the attitude of several management levels within the Commission. Secondly, that the level and seriousness of medifraud is likely to have increased since the investigation function was transferred to the Health Insurance Commission. In part this could be attributed to a reduction in effort and lack of expertise currently allocated to this task since the function was transferred from the Department of Health in 1985. Thirdly, that the function and responsibility for detecting and prosecuting medifraud had never been successfully integrated into the Commission's operations.</PARA>
<PARA>Given the public statements made by the commission in 1985, including those before the public accounts committee, I guess it is fair to say that both the Auditor-General's report and the Harvey Bates report gave the government, and indeed the community, cause for legitimate concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that this concern has led, first of all, to the passage of the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Bill, dealing with excessive servicing, and now to the expected passage of this bill, which will occur because it has already gone through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to support this bill, although I note the comments of the honourable member for Mackellar about what happened in the Senate, with the Senate examination of this bill and the examination by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Although I have concerns about some of the issues raised there, I am assured that the amendments that the government has agreed to will not in any way damage the ability of the commission to investigate successfully and to prosecute cases of medical fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although civil liberties are important, it does sometimes worry me that the coalition has a different attitude on civil liberties when it is talking about the protection of some of its more wealthy supporters, such as doctors and other groups, than it does when it is talking about other members of the community. I would be very pleased if the coalition took a consistent line on this and had the same attitude to civil liberties when it was talking about social security fraud or when it is alleged that the less well off in the community are ripping off the system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not respond to the interjections. I think it is pretty clear that, when it is the rich and powerful who are under threat from legitimate investigations from government agencies, suddenly civil liberties are being mentioned. Having said that, unlike the honourable members opposite, I will stick to the issue of health and medical fraud. While I have some concerns about the need for the amendments, I accept that they are the reality and that they will go through. I am also assured that the effectiveness of the Health Insurance Commission will be much enhanced by this legislation, amendments included.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two main points that were raised in the Senate, as has been pointed out, were the powers of search and the access to confidential patient records. Certainly civil liberties are important and we only need to have access to records when those records are needed to assist in an investigation or a prosecution. I would point out that this is about abuse of taxpayers' money. The civil liberties of the taxpayers who fund Medicare to the tune of $5 billion a year also need to be taken into account. Honourable members opposite, who are very interested in tax and who reckon that we pay too much tax&mdash;which is a nonsense&mdash;should be equally interested in how that money is spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare is the best health system in the world, but it does risk being placed in jeopardy when a small percentage&mdash;and it is a small percentage&mdash;of practitioners are allowed to rip off the system. It needs to be accepted that, like any other group in the community, the majority of medical practitioners are honest people, but there are some who are not so honest, and so we need to be able to deal with them in the most effective way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record shows, both under the Fraser government and under this government that, while successive federal agencies might have made an effort, the results have not been too flash. Indeed, the figures have been quoted and there were very few prosecutions. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) pointed out, it has taken a great number of days for an average case to go before the DPP and to be processed by the Australian Federal Police. That is deplorable. It has not changed much since about 1982, and it is time that it did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully, the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill and the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Act in relation to excessive servicing, and the new committee that has been set up to replace the old Medical Services Committee of Inquiry, will finally enable the commission, which has the responsibility, to do its job and to ensure that Medicare, which is one of the cornerstones of the Labor government's policies for families and for social justice, is able to deliver and is not being ripped off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it is of concern that the level of abuse might be around seven per cent, which would be in excess of $300 million or $400 million a year. Nobody is suggesting&mdash;and I do not want to be misrepresented here&mdash;that these measures will recoup $300 million or $400 million a year. Of course they will not. That would be like saying&mdash;as I think I have mentioned before&mdash;that, if the fine for speeding on the F5 Freeway between Sydney and Canberra were $150 and a million people speed along there in a year, then there would be a revenue of $150 million. You will not get that amount because very few people ever get caught. The same applies to this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I think it is at least appropriate, after all this time, for the government to have decent legislation and for the commission to be given its best chance, through this legislation, finally to be able to apply the appropriate amount of resources to this issue. I think it is fair to say that it has not happened in the past. Medicare has, in terms of its culture and its role, seen itself as a paying office. The priority has been to pay bulkbilling claims quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Medicare also has a compliance side. It also has the responsibility to ensure that claims are legitimate and that the taxpayer is not being ripped off by doctors, or by anybody else for that matter. I commend the bill to the House. I look forward to seeing much better results being attained by the Health Insurance Commission, both as a result of this bill and as a result of the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Act that was passed last year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was really just expressing a sincere point of view that, because this bill has been long in coming, has been much heralded and has had quite a bit of public attention, it would have been good if the minister had been here. It is no way demeaning the role of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous). It would have just seemed appropriate, given the importance of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition supports moves to protect the public purse and to ensure that dishonest operators do not have their snout in the Medicare trough. Medicare operates as a system which provides health care to patients at no obvious cost to them. That is understandably attractive but it also creates an environment or fertile ground for activity which may not always be desirable. In protecting taxpayers' money, the rights and liberties of patients and health care professionals must also be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the coalition has tried to give this legislation fair scrutiny. There have been four coalition amendments, six Democrat amendments and 34&mdash;or six pages&mdash;of government amendments. This debate was originally scheduled on the day that the former minister, Graham Richardson, announced his resignation. The government amendments in their entirety were received only that afternoon because the minister's office had not signed the release any earlier. I confess to having wondered at the time if they were not on a whiteboard. Of course, we now know that the then minister had other things on his mind. It is of real concern to me that the government, in drafting the original legislation, totally failed to make privacy provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time, government members in this place have made derogatory comments about our colleagues in the Senate. This legislation is a classic example of how close scrutiny and amendments will very much improve legislation. I pay tribute to my colleagues in the other place for the improvements they have made&mdash;improvements that now mean the coalition is in a happy position to support this legislation. The work of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and submissions from peak bodies such as the AMA, Private Doctors of Australia, the Australian Association of General Practitioners, the Royal Australasian College of General Practitioners, the Australian College of Nutritionists and Environmental Medicine, the Victorian Medical Practice Defence Committee, the Australian Association of Pathology Practice and the Health Issues Centre, all have drawn attention to the shortcomings of the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that in the former minister's second reading speech he spoke about the close consultation with the medical profession. This claim has been denied by the AMA, which met only once with the minister. The legislation at that stage did not reflect the content of that conversation. Senator Newman summed up the coalition's position very well when, in the Senate on 4 May this year, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this particular piece of legislation, for example, it was not until the opposition looked carefully at this bill and alerted the medical organisations to some of the hidden difficulties that they started to realise that the rights of both their practitioners and their patients could be in jeopardy under the bill as originally printed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We alerted them to the concerns which we had. They then took the bill to legal advisers, and they were advised that our concerns were reasonable and that there was a need for improving this act.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While we all support the purpose of the act, there are genuine concerns as to civil liberties. The privacy issues have been addressed. It remains to be seen in practice whether they are adequately addressed, but it appears on the surface that those issues have been improved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, we are concerned, as I said yesterday, that people are being given police authorities without the controls which the police in this land are subject to. We do not believe that we can rely on the doctors' wish to clean up the fraud as being so overwhelming that civil rights concerns can be ignored. We are committed to cleaning up the fraud in the medical area, where it exists. In fact, the opposition has been keen, and expressed its views, on this issue long before this legislation came in. So there can be no way in which it could be suggested that we are soft on crime in connection with medical fraud.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that Senator Newman speaks for all of us in the coalition. Key issues are the protection of the public purse while protecting the traditional rights of citizens against the arbitrary use of power. Questions arise as to how we protect the Medicare trough. There is no question that we need to do so. This legislation has been long heralded, so let us hope it works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem that the present arrangements for the investigation of Medicare fraud are inadequate. In the mid-1980s there was a Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquiry into fraud and overservicing. In December 1992 the Auditor-General found that there was a lack of prosecutions and disciplinary action taken against the unethical practitioners and that there had been little improvement since the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has claimed, interestingly, before the last federal election, that there would be savings of $400 million over a four-year period if fraud and overservicing could be dramatically reduced. These figures have not stood up to scrutiny and now the claim is $25 million in 1993-94 and $64.9 million in 1994-95. It is also just possible that there are more ethical practitioners than the government imagines and that these savings will not be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through my own consultations on this legislation I have received the crystal-clear message from ethical practitioners that any fraud should be dealt with so that collective reputations would not suffer further. So often, powers are introduced and the good, honest players get hurt and the strong and powerful who can buy expert legal advice still outwit the legislation. In fact, the Medical Director of the Health Insurance Commission, Dr John Nearhos who, I note, is here in the chamber today, said in relation to fraud in the pathology industry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is clear that legislation is not enough in this area. We can patch the legislation, and there will always be someone there who can find a way around the legislation and particularly with the power that some of these pathology companies have. In terms of legal representation, they are able to circumvent the intentions of legislation fairly quickly.</PARA>
<PARA>Small general practices will be exposed to the new full powers of the Health Insurance Commission in the same way as the more powerful. In my consultations I have heard of a Dr Peverill who owns a large pathology set-up in Brisbane. He has gone all the way to the High Court to defend what he perceived as his rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Officers of the Health Insurance Commission who will be significantly empowered with this legislation have not always acted reasonably. The Health Insurance Commission should not just go for the easy targets so as to be seen to have runs on the board. Several years ago women general practitioners in Adelaide&mdash;and, I understand, in other parts of Australia&mdash;were called on by the Health Insurance Commission to explain why they were ordering too much pathology. It was later discovered, after many of them had been very upset, that there was a good reason for this. These women practitioners saw more women patients who had tests associated with pregnancy and pap smears. Interestingly, the government was at the same time running a campaign encouraging women to have two-yearly pap smears. Commonsense had not prevailed. It had not even been recognised that women patients were more likely to seek out women doctors for such care and testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are real crooks&mdash;and I have been advised in my consultations that there are&mdash;then they must be caught. The point has been made to me that it takes two to tango where general practitioners and the pathology companies are involved in transactions which are against the law. As this legislation and other similar acts do not make light night-time reading, the Health Insurance Commission should embark on an education program for general practitioners. It would be sensible for the AMA to do likewise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this legislation is to give to public servants the same powers as the Federal Police. In its submission to the Senate committee of inquiry, the Federal Police Association stated the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . expresses a deep and growing concern over the increase of public service investigators who are far less accountable than police with very few guidelines as to appropriate investigational behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA>The submission continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accountability to the community, to the Government and to the Ombudsman is a matter that the Association has always been keen to see implemented. The Australian Federal Police has two divisions exclusively deployed to ensure members of the Australian Federal Police's integrity. Couple this with stringent disciplinary regulations, fixed term appointments and performance management programs and it can be seen that members of the Australian Federal Police are heavily accountable. This is not the case with public service investigators generally, and specifically those attached to the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>Accountability is important and that is why Senator Newman's amendment to make this sunset legislation is so important. In passing this legislation, we as a parliament are in effect saying to officers of the Health Insurance Commission, `We are trusting you to guard the public purse but do not abuse these powers and do not hurt innocent individuals.'

It would seem essential that specific guidelines be developed to govern the way in which searches are conducted. The precedent of the guidelines established by the Australian Federal Police and the Law Council of Australia is a good one. Amongst other things they should provide, as the ones regarding lawyers do, procedures whereby documents can be held in safe storage while any legal issues regarding whether or not they are properly subject to inspection, for example on the grounds that they contain clinical details, are resolved. </PARA>

In practical terms, this is a requirement to keep such records for 18 months. There are some quite good arguments for keeping such documents for a longer time. NATA, for instance, requires that results be kept for five years. Many pathology services would keep them longer and see benefits in matching the original request form with those results. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the provisions of the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill 1994, which provides the Health Insurance Commission with powers to monitor compliance with and investigate breaches of requirements relating to medical and pharmaceutical benefits. The bill also incorporates in the Health Insurance Act 1973 requirements aimed at reducing Medicare benefits fraud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill fulfils the government's announcement in the 1993-94 budget to introduce, in cooperation with the Australian Medical Association, an enhanced peer review scheme with powers to investigate the practices of medical practitioners suspected of overservicing and the capacity to apply effective penalties where overservicing is found. It is difficult to cite accurate data on the extent of overservicing in Australia. In 1992-93 the Australian National Audit Office estimated fraud and overservicing at seven per cent of the Medicare budget, but this figure was based on estimates from the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accurate statistics are available only on the number of medical practitioners prosecuted for Medicare fraud and the moneys recovered. Between 1985 and 1992, 50 medical practitioners were prosecuted and $5.6 million was recovered in Medicare benefits. The measures set out in this bill are estimated by the government as saving $64.9 million in 1994-95. Clearly, overservicing and fraud in the Australian medical system are issues of considerable importance, both ethically and financially. They need to be set in a broader context, however, of structural reform of medical services and insurance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health policy has become one of the most difficult issues in Australian public life, and the shadow minister, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), is just finding that out. Scarce resources are expected to meet the growing health demands of a community accustomed to the highest standards of medical care. No aspect of public policy has higher public expectations. Most Australians expect access to first-rate medical services at all times under all conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as much, no party has failed the challenge of health policy formulation in the 1980s and 1990s as thoroughly as the Liberal Party has. The honourable member for Mackellar is the eighth Liberal spokesperson on health in 10 years, inheriting the policy legacy and failures of&mdash;among others&mdash;Peter Shack, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), Michael Baume, Jim Carlton and Senator Bob Woods. Like her predecessors, she has a barren ideological obsession with strengthening the private sector and reducing the role of government to a minimum. The honourable member for Mackellar measures all issues in the extreme, either individualist or collectivist. While black-and-white simplicity may be popular among the Tory matrons of her electorate, it is hardly the basis of effective health policy in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian health system blends the interest of the individual and the collective. All hospitals, public and private, are the product of individuals pooling their resources, through either the taxation system or private health insurance, to facilitate the collective provision of services which individuals then use on a needs basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a decade, the Liberal Party has failed to develop policies which attract customers back into the private sector without unacceptable outcomes in cost, coverage and equity for the public system. Only Labor, and only this government with a pragmatic view on the role of the public and private sectors, can further reform the Australian health system around the twin principles of equity and efficiency&mdash;the all-important twin principles ignored by the shadow minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Managed competition&mdash;and the shadow minister should listen to this&mdash;can produce enormous efficiency and equity gains in the Australian health system. Medical services should not be exempt from modern management methods to make the public sector more responsive to client needs. Health should not be exempt from the separation of the demand and supply functions of government into a purchaser-provider split. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Internationally, health policy makers have grappled with the problem of securing greater efficiency and cost control in the delivery of services, while maintaining universal insurance. In many cases, this has resulted in the national government establishing service contracts with both public and private hospitals for the provision of core services&mdash;and I am glad to see that the shadow minister is taking notes. A single national insurer offers a range of options for health coverage linked to the principle of capacity to pay. This system could be used to integrate the public and private hospital systems in Australia, just as the federal government two decades ago ended the distinction for funding purposes between public and private schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of public beds in private hospitals would address the problem of underutilised resources in our national hospital system. The direct funding role for hospitals would be administered by regional authorities, allowing the federal government to allocate funds on the basis of need. The service provider role would involve competition between public and private health institutions to win performance based contracts from the regional authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By taking up the responsibility which the 1946 referendum conferred on this parliament to provide medical services, the government can establish a national health system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Managed competition would address three inadequacies within the Australian health system. The first is overlapping federal and state responsibilities and programs. In the current system the coordination of planning and service delivery is difficult, efficiency gains are inhibited and cost shifting remains a substantial problem. Secondly, the lack of coordination between public and private sectors has fostered incentives for cost shifting, recurrent cost increases and risk selection. Thirdly, there is an absence of financial incentive for efficiency gains in both the public and private systems. In all states except Victoria, the system of global hospital budgeting is unrelated to the efficiency of service delivery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Managed competition and the purchaser-provider split would bring the functions of the private sector into the national system and promote three important efficiency features. Services for every individual would be covered by one budget holder or purchaser, thereby preventing cost shifting. Government subsidies would take the form of risk related capitation payments to service providers, thereby limiting risk selection. Most importantly, the income of all service providers would consist of payments by budget holders at prices reflecting the rigour of competition and full costs of efficient production. In a more efficient system you would have less overservicing and fewer unnecessary medical procedures, which is the objective of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Casemix or output related payments are essential to quantify the concept of cost under a regime of managed competition. Case payment and managed competition involve complex aspects of data collection and use which have become feasible only in the last decade through advances in health information technology. My interest in the true significance of a casemix approach was aroused by the last speech in this parliament by the founder of Medicare and former member for Bonython, Neal Blewett, on 10 February, one day after I was sworn in as member for Werriwa. Dr Blewett had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The central issue for the health system is the working of the public hospital system . . . I believe that the hospital reforms introduced by Mrs Tehan in Victoria are the most imaginative set of reforms to deal with the hospital system in this country in the last half a dozen years. I notice that they are now likely to be taken up by other Liberal and Labor governments around the country. Those reforms will do much to sustain the public hospital side of Medicare, provided they are not used simply to save money, and one always has to watch that danger. By using the casemix approach, Mrs Tehan has inaugurated a whole new development in hospital systems in this country. The Commonwealth has always supported that casemix approach and I hope we as a government will continue to work with Mrs Tehan and other reforming state health ministers in supporting the casemix approach.</PARA>
<PARA>Case payments represent a simple but effective change in the financing of hospitals. The traditional method of funding, fixed annual allocations unrelated to output, simply institutionalises hospital inefficiency. Casemix funding, which pays hospitals according to the services they perform, provides a strong incentive to increase activity and cut waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of case payments should not be a matter of partisan politics, and I am sure even the shadow minister could agree with me. It is a commonsense and practical measure to provide the necessary incentive and management motivation for improved hospital efficiency. The Australian health system can cope with increased demand and community expectations only through either increased revenue or efficiency gains. The success of case payments in Victoria shows that an increase in the Medicare levy is unnecessary provided the other states no longer ignore such obvious measures for cost efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the introduction of case payments by the Victorian government, waiting lists fell by 10 per cent, from 28,618 in July 1993 to 25,850 in April this year. Waiting lists for urgent cases fell by 78 per cent, while overall hospital productivity or efficiency rose by 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can all learn from the Victorian experience. The federal government has tendered for an independent assessment of the implementation of casemix in Victoria, with a final report scheduled for the end of October. Hopefully, this report will bring to a head the government's incremental consideration of this issue. Let me provide some of the history.

The term `discovery' refers to the requirement for the production of documents, the term `interrogation' refers to the compulsory questioning that is authorised under the bill, and the term `coercive' obviously indicates that it is done under compulsion. In this context, I want to mention broader issues concerning the powers of coercive discovery and inspection in legislation generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon the introduction of the bill in the Senate, a number of libertarian and privacy concerns were expressed. As a result, the bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. During the course of the public hearings, the government supplied to the committee draft amendments which the government indicated it proposed to move in order to satisfy a number of the concerns raised during the hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the committee recommended that the bill be enacted, incorporating the amendments proposed by the government. However, the coalition members of the committee were not satisfied with the proposed amendments and dissented, raising a number of outstanding concerns. The then Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, subsequently proposed further amendments to satisfy most of those concerns, but the minister did not accept all the points made in the dissenting report. As a result, coalition members moved a number of their own amendments at the committee stage of the bill. With the support of the Greens and Senator Harradine, those amendments passed in the Senate. In addition, a number of amendments were moved and passed by the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of this bill to that point is an absolute disgrace. It resulted from a lack of concern on the part of the government for the privacy and civil liberties of those who were to be investigated. We had in this House just recently an example of legislation dealing with a serious social issue involving criminal offences and dealing with procedures for the trial for those offences. I refer to the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill. That was brought to this House in what may only be described as an unsatisfactory state. It was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which effectively, unanimously on a bipartisan basis, made 37 recommendations. The effect of those amendments, if implemented, will be to incorporate a fair trial into the provisions of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have had to seek to do outside this House in relation to this bill is to incorporate provisions that provide for a fair investigation. There is no doubt that on both sides of this House there is concern for what is referred to as medifraud, which costs the community a lot of money. But on both sides of this House there should be&mdash;but it seems it is on only one side&mdash;a concern that any means of investigating alleged criminal offences should be done fairly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) made the puerile suggestion that on this side of the House we were concerned to protect the rich and the famous. Fair trials and fair investigations are for the rich and for the poor. Fair trials and fair investigations are for the famous and for the infamous. The difficulty which appears not to be recognised is that fair trials and fair investigations will result in conviction of the guilty; that fair trials and fair investigations will not result in conviction of the innocent. Any means we have for coercion in an investigatory process must adequately protect the innocent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains comprehensive provisions relating to coercive discovery and inspection. Those powers are in part IID of the bill. That is divided into five divisions, one dealing with preliminary matters, the second dealing with a general power to obtain information, the third dealing with searches in relation to possible offences and the fourth dealing with offences relating to searches and seizures. Finally, division 5 contains provisions relating to execution of search warrants. Divisions 2 to 4 contain the substantive coercive powers of discovery and interrogation, and with each division the progressive powers become more significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 2 authorises the managing director of the commission to give notice to anybody to give information or to produce a document where the managing director believes that there are reasonable grounds that an offence has been committed and that the information is relevant to the offence. The information is not limited to written information and the division requires persons to answer questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note also that the common law privilege against self-incrimination that would allow a person to refuse to hand over self-incriminating documents or disclose self-incriminating information is specifically abrogated by the division. However, a safeguard is provided in that any self-incriminating evidence obtained may not be used against that person in a criminal proceeding. This is not an uncommon provision in the obtaining of information by investigatory authorities, and is applicable, for example, in relation to evidence obtained by the Australian Securities Commission pursuant to its act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 3 goes a step further and allows officers of the commission to enter onto premises in order to search the premises. The original scheme of the division was to facilitate searches without warrant and without the specific need to obtain the consent of the occupier unless the premises were a residence. In amendments moved by the coalition and passed in the Senate, the scope of the division has been significantly curtailed. The amendments require the consent of the occupier to be obtained. If consent is not obtained, the commission must obtain a warrant to enter the premises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the division, officers may, amongst other things, take photographs and take samples of pharmaceutical benefits. Items may not be seized, nor may copies of documents be taken. The search may be undertaken only if the officer has reasonable grounds for believing that a relevant offence is being committed or has been committed in the previous 60 days. The 60-day reference results from an amendment moved by the Democrats, consequent upon an amendment moved by the coalition which would have required that the offence was in the process of being committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 4 contains the most extensive category of powers. It allows for search and seizure with a warrant. The prerequisite for obtaining a warrant is that the commission officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting that there may be evidential material on the premises. Once the warrant is obtained, or if the occupier consents, the premises may be searched and evidential material seized. Division 4 and division 5 are modelled on the search warrant provisions in the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act, which has just been passed by this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the protection of individual rights, the current bill is a distinct improvement on that originally proposed. Another safeguard that now exists as a result of a coalition amendment in the Senate is a sunset clause which will allow the operation of the bill to be reviewed after a two-year period of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might ask: how is it that so much legislation&mdash;this is just an example&mdash;is brought to this parliament without the appropriate protection within its terms of individual rights? It is understandable that a government department would want to be able to investigate breaches of legislation under its administration and it is understandable that for that purpose it would seek the widest possible powers. But the onus must be on a department to ensure that the proposals it prepares for a minister adequately protect the privacy of those involved and, if investigation or trial is involved, adequately protect the right to a fair trial, the right to a fair investigation. A minister should not be bringing to cabinet a proposal for legislation that does not contain appropriate provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coercive discovery and interrogation contemplated under this bill is very intrusive. It was much more intrusive under its previous form without adequate protections. That safeguards are not put in seems to be a regular failing of legislation emanating from the health area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was really only as a result of the process in the Senate that the crimes search warrant arrangements were incorporated in the sort of detail that they now appear. It should not be up to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to rewrite a bill in a manner not consistent with its instructions because it does not contain appropriate safeguards of the relevant type.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill  has taken so long to reach this stage in the parliament. In my short address on this bill today, I want to cover a couple of issues: the intent of the bill to beef up powers of investigation and the investigative powers and the actions that the Health Insurance Commission has taken over the years. Earlier this year I made a speech during the grievance debate. In that speech I referred to a Health Insurance Commission investigation of a particular pharmacist who was allegedly selling generic brand drugs illegally. I also referred to the way in which the Health Insurance Commission went about that investigation and ultimately served a summons at the end of last year. I will refer to that speech a little later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has had a long gestation period. It was based on the back of a report of the Auditor-General of December 1992 and an accompanying consultancy report of June 1992. Before that, hearings of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on fraud and overservicing were held in the early to middle 1980s. Since that time there has been very little improvement in combating fraud and overservicing, and the bill has been in the Senate for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, the coalition strongly supports the addressing of fraud and overservicing which, as I said, was based on the back of the Auditor-General's report and the Bates report. The Auditor-General, for instance, found that there was a lack of prosecutions and disciplinary action taken against unethical practitioners and that there has been little improvement since then. The Bates report found that the responsibility for detecting and prosecuting fraud has never been successfully integrated into the commission's operation. It also found that existing legislation does not support any positive approach to fraud control. So there can be no doubt that fraud is a problem and that a legislative response from the government is necessary. There is considerable doubt, however, as to how much would be saved by the measures outlined by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government intends to beef up the powers of the Health Insurance Commission. What sort of watchdog will be placed over that? What monitoring and accountability will there be in the exercise of those powers? In my grievance debate speech I mentioned that just before Christmas last year a pharmacist in Wingham in New South Wales who was providing generic drugs&mdash;we all know that they can be sold at a cheaper rate than schedule drugs&mdash;was investigated by the Health Insurance Commission and subsequently issued with a summons. I am not sure where that court case is up to. I suppose it is not really up to us to deliberate about that here; it is a matter for the court. I am drawing attention to the way in which the Health Insurance Commission investigators dealt with that situation and with the pharmacist involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my speech in the grievance debate, it was ironic that on one occasion when the health insurance investigators turned up at that pharmacy to investigate those allegations my father was acting there in a locum capacity. He was certainly dealt with in a far less than professional manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We are talking about the bureaucracy and investigators operating within the bureaucracy. It is apparent that on many occasions they deal with professional people in different circumstances on the basis that those people are already guilty. The officers have already made up their mind that those people are already guilty without giving them the opportunity to put their case before a court. So it is very important that we do not see a recurrence of what has happened to Mr Keen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following those investigations and the fairly poor treatment that the investigators dished out to not only Mr Keen but also my father when he was there is the issue of the way that the summons was ultimately issued. It was drawn up at least two or three weeks prior to Christmas and was served on Mr Keen either on Christmas Eve or on the day before that, when he had no hope of getting any advice from counsel for probably at least three or four weeks. It will be interesting to see the result of that case. It is important that the officers of the Health Insurance Commission operate in a professional manner and do not prejudge what has been going on. They should not go along with a preconceived idea as to whether someone is innocent or guilty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will diverge for a moment. We have seen a number of other cases where officers of the Commonwealth have acted on that basis. Look at the Midford Paramount case. What officers of the Commonwealth perpetrated on those people was disgusting. They broke a business and the spirit of a number of people. </PARA>

Mr Deputy Speaker, I appreciate the point that you raise. I will get back to the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other cases are floating about where officers of the Commonwealth have acted in a less than prudential manner. This needs to be addressed. We need to be far more mindful of it. In that regard&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, you have drawn me back to the bill&mdash;we should be very mindful that those circumstances, which are now recorded in history, do not occur in this area by increasing the powers that are being issued here. We are mindful of the accountability and transparency that are needed in this exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody is decrying the fact that we need to look at this area or that we are spending a lot more than we need to in this system at the moment. There are areas where compliance can obviously be tightened up and savings can be made. But let us not forget that the basic tenet in this country is that a person is innocent until proven guilty, not the reverse. If we bear that in mind in the carriage of this legislation, we will be satisfied that those changes will have been made when we get to the stage of the Commonwealth officers implementing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">History tells us that it does not always happen that way. Ultimately, when it does not happen that way, who wears the cost? The Commonwealth&mdash;which means that the taxpayer bears the cost. It is recorded in history that it has happened that way in a lot of cases. The taxpayer has borne the monetary cost, but the people in the community of Australia bear the personal and the physical cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate what I said about the very ordinary treatment that Mr Keen received at the hands of the officers of the Health Insurance Commission in the dispute over generic drugs last year. In my speech in the grievance debate, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply cannot believe the bureaucratic heavy-handedness that Mr Keen has had to put up with throughout his solo campaign to improve the health care system in Australia. Mr Keen has been subjected to extraordinary intimidation and abuse by members of the bureaucracy, by members of the Health Insurance Commission. I instance this one story which, only by a strange coincidence, I have been able to hear. On 12 January 1993, two officers from the Health Insurance Commission&mdash;one by the name of Owen Moore&mdash;stormed into Stuart Keen's pharmacy at Wingham, and began verbally abusing the man they thought to be Mr Stuart Keen. After realising that the man was not Stuart Keen, but the pharmacist in charge of the pharmacy at the time, they stormed out of the pharmacy as quickly as they had arrived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strange twist to this story is that Wingham, being a small town and also being my home town, the locum in attendance that day just happened to be my father. He received the verbal abuse from the officers of the Health Insurance Commission. It was he, as I say, who copped the tirade of these officers. They should not be allowed to do this.</PARA>
<PARA>They should not be allowed to conduct themselves in this unprofessional manner. My speech continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The taxpayers in this country pay their taxes to pay these people their wages. It does not take much to act in a civilised manner. These officers certainly have not acted in a civilised manner in the way they have dealt with this issue. Such bureaucratic heavy-handedness should never take place in Australia, regardless of the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>The ultimate outcome of this exercise was that the summons that was ultimately issued was drawn at least two or three weeks prior to its serving. I believe that the timing of the serving of that notice was to inflict as much discomfort on Mr Keen as possible. I urge the government, in presenting this bill and the measures that are contained therein, to be mindful of the conduct of the Commonwealth officers in this regard&mdash;that they act professionally; that they do not prejudge people whom they are investigating; and that they conduct their investigations on the basis that those people are innocent until proven guilty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does not&mdash;any more&mdash;oppose this legislation, simply because, as other speakers have drawn to the attention of the parliament, over time we have managed to restructure the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill 1993 in a way that guarantees the fundamentals of human rights and justice as we understand them in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, too frequently, under the guise of protecting the revenue&mdash;and it is a peculiarity of our system that we seem much more inclined to override the rights of people when we are protecting the revenue&mdash;we are inclined to put much larger fines on people when we are protecting the revenue than when we seek to protect public or personal property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should never be an occasion when this parliament seeks to empower our bureaucracy beyond the rights it has under our justice system. When we do that, we go back to the circumstances which we have discussed and recognised in this parliament this week and for which our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is overseas; that is, the circumstances which caused people to cross the English Channel to liberate countries which by power of arms had come under the control of a totalitarian regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person who enters someone's premises without a warrant should be labelled a commissar. It is totally improper that any parliament in this country should consider at any time empowering bureaucrats in this fashion. Unfortunately, we have done this to a degree. We have heard about it being done in the customs department. I read in a recent issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> that, unfortunately, it was also done in the tax department. A business was sent broke, through garnishee, because the tax office never managed to get the issue to a Magistrate's Court. Surely, in all of these cases, the right to enter premises, the right to garnishee and the right to confiscate should be authorised only by our courts. In this case, we are referring to the right to investigate. We require that this be authorised by proper warrant. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will get back to this bill because I have a great interest in it. When we talk about overservicing, we must consider exactly what it is. Is a local GP who would probably prefer to reject a lonely pensioner who makes regular visits to him considered to be overservicing? It is use of the GP's valuable time, but he has a family to keep. Is that considered to be overservicing because that lonely person has nowhere else to go and, if you like, abuses the goodwill of the general practitioner? We know it happens. Before I get to my next point, let me say that I accept that people abuse this system genuinely and determinately. Schemes of this nature always cause great problems in our society. There will always be somebody who sees it as easy money. That is the tragedy. But there are other people who find themselves `overservicing' simply because people demand that overservicing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time we were spending similar amounts of money on health, education and defence. I do not say that we should necessarily have done it that way, but that was how the money was distributed and that is how the costs added up. I look at the present budget and find that we have gone from a situation in 1984-85 when we spent $4,500 million on education and a bit over $7,000 million on health to a situation today where we are spending $10,000 million on education and $17,000 million on health. All budgets are finite. I think in the process some kids are missing out on education. The balance is starting to get out of hand and I believe that behind closed doors the government is equally concerned about its costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House of an eminent public hospital administrator from New Zealand, a keynote speaker at one time, who said on one occasion that New Zealand had 50,000 people on its public hospital waiting lists and that waiting lists were the means by which public hospital services were rationed. That is a universal fact where these systems operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the introduction of Medicare, private health membership was of the order of 70 per cent. The March 1994 figure is 37.6 per cent. When one measures the private health contributions in those days, one can see where some of the $17,000 million is coming from. The simple fact is that the government has continuing and increasing waiting lists, it is not servicing the community with its scheme, it is now worried about the money and it is therefore proposing a universal attack on the provider. The government is going to send the commissars in. The opposition has prevented the government from doing that by demanding that it meet the normal standards of justice. I remind the House that it is only this week that we celebrated 50 years of preventing that sort of activity in most of Europe. We do not want commissars and legislation that will send the commissars in&mdash;be it to protect revenue in the health arena, the tax arena or anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the government was convinced&mdash;only because we got the support of the minor parties in the Senate&mdash;to change its legislation. The government was not convinced to change because it believed in it. It was convinced to change because it knew that it otherwise could not win. It is a great pity that a system that was brought down in good faith by the other side of politics is now struggling because it is running out of money. The facts are carried by the statistics I have given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has problems with Medicare. It will not recognise some of those problems. The parliamentary secretary told us that the age profile is changing. That is correct, but the government's system does not recognise the varying demands. In this system people can forum shop.

For the last four years in a row the honourable member for Bennelong has taken his little trip to Geneva to attend ILO conventions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been some discussion in recent times about trends in terms of income and equality in this country and in other countries. A lot of that discussion has been rather misleading, particularly in this chamber. It is an area where international comparisons and comparisons over time are difficult, because a whole range of factors have to be included. As well as earnings and cash incomes, we have to take into account social security transfer payments, the effect of the tax system and the effect of the social wage. Compiling internationally comparable statistics in those areas is extraordinarily difficult.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But many of the figures that have been quoted are just thoroughly misleading. A couple of days ago in this House, the Leader of the Opposition referred to some ABS material which explicitly referred only to earnings. There was no reference to movements in the social wage, improvements in the social security system and changes in the tax system over the course of the 1980s. When those factors are taken into consideration, the situation changes quite markedly. How can we possibly talk sensibly about an issue like that, without taking into account the introduction of Medicare and the impact on people's living standards that flows from that, or the huge increases in the real value of family payments and other social security payments that have occurred over the course of the 1980s? It is ludicrous. There is no doubt that, if we factor those considerations in, the picture changes quite markedly.</PARA>

Over the course of our tenure of office, all social security payments directed to low income earners have improved significantly as against the Henderson poverty line. There is no question about that. The Henderson poverty line itself has risen by 16 per cent in real terms.

Under us, with the changes in rent assistance, for an unemployed person renting privately, it is up 57 per cent in real terms. During the Fraser years payments to sole parents were down by four per cent in real terms.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many honourable members no doubt receive representations in their electorate offices from those seeking to become civil marriage celebrants. There has been a system in place where the views of individual members of parliament have been sought on the suitability of marriage celebrants. This system has had considerable problems. The most particular problem has been a very large backlog in processing applications. As at November of last year, when a moratorium was placed on the receipt of further applications, there were something like 2,500 outstanding applications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have initiated a review of the program under the day-to-day control of the parliamentary secretary, the honourable member for Makin. That review is looking at the processing of a new system, including the level of charges imposed by celebrants, whether the existing restrictions on celebrants advertising their own services should remain, and whether possible changes to limitations on the style and conduct of ceremonies should be reviewed. It is expected that the outcome of this review will be finalised and that the new system will be in place early next year.</PARA>

The article said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am, of course, very interested in this particular scheme and I would like to know how we could possibly operate such a one-year ban on marriage. No doubt there would be some sort of registration and licensing scheme for engaged people so the government is notified. Once we had that sort of scheme, no doubt a marriage avoidance industry would develop. Maybe couples after their first date, to cut the waiting time, would surreptitiously get themselves registered just on the off-chance that they want to be married in the future. Maybe we could get a scheme like that put into place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past we have had the honourable member for Bennelong wanting to take Australia back to the days of the white picket fence and the Kingswood in everyone's driveway. It seems that the honourable member for Menzies wants to take us back a little beyond that&mdash;maybe back to the days of Jane Austen and her great novels and the joys of the very long engagement. This might be very good stuff for novels, but I do not know if it is a particularly realistic way to appraise what are very serious issues. The fact is that the average age for marriage in Australia is 27 for men and 25 for women. I think we can safely assume that Australian men and women are old enough to make their own decisions as to whether they think it is appropriate for them to be married, without the government deciding for them.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The repatriation private patients scheme comes into operation when there is an integration to a state system or a privatisation of a repatriation hospital.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we expected, before integration the veteran intake at Concord was approximately 50 per cent of the total number of patients. That has now decreased to 35 per cent, which means that veterans are taking the option of going along to their own public hospital, the place that is closest to them, throughout New South Wales, and the ACT for that matter.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Two weeks ago I represented the Commonwealth at a meeting of the Australian Police Ministers Council, at which I put forward a proposal on the Commonwealth's behalf to strengthen the provisions of the Customs Act that would prevent the importation into Australia of some dangerous weapons. The motivation for this action on the Commonwealth's behalf is that, currently, a number of dangerous weapons such as pistol grip crossbows, nunchakus, blow pipes and ballistic knives are capable of being brought into the country, transferred across state boundaries and sold into state jurisdictions where under state law their possession is illegal. That obviously represents a considerable threat in relation to law enforcement and community safety. It was a matter which state and territory governments were quite concerned about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the discussions that occurred at the Police Ministers Council, police ministers agreed with the Commonwealth's proposal, and the situation is now clear. From henceforth, those weapons of the kind that I have described will be listed and prohibited from entry into Australia unless a specific lawful authority issued by the state firearms authority is made known to the minister for customs so that that particular weapon can be imported in particular circumstances. Legitimate collections and the like might be exempted in particular circumstances. Obviously, I believe this is a matter which goes towards better and more effective protection of the community's interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other matters were followed up as a result of the police ministers' discussions of these issues. Most importantly, the decision was taken to look at the present situation where there are eight different jurisdictions, each with different lists of dangerous goods which are prohibited in state jurisdictions. That is confusing. It will also mean that, from time to time, dangerous goods can be brought into this country and be sold across state boundaries in those circumstances I have described. All police ministers have agreed to go back to their jurisdictions and to report to the next Police Ministers Council to see whether we can get greater uniformity so that that circumstance does not arise and community safety is better improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, police ministers also agreed to look at the question of replica weapons. Currently, model or replica weapons are allowed to be brought into and possessed in Australia, some of which are extraordinarily lifelike and can hardly be distinguished from the real item on superficial inspection. Whilst the replica itself represents no danger, I think it needs no little imagination to realise the potential for tragedy that exists when such replicas are in the hands of persons. Mistakes may be readily made and lives may be lost as a result of mistakes being made. All police ministers have agreed to look at the question. They believe there is a real issue as to whether or not the importation, ownership, possession or sale of such replicas should be permitted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday the honourable member for Tangney asked me a question, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, which read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister is aware that since 1982 the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations has been drafting a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. At the 11th session of the working group, in 1993, the draft was recast so that it states that indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination, including the right freely to determine their political status. In other words, the draft declaration provides for indigenous peoples to have the right to secede from sovereign states and to form independent nations. Will the minister confirm that while the draft declaration contains a provision to that effect the government will not be supporting it in any international forum?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question. The government supports the right of self-determination of indigenous peoples consistent with national sovereignty. This right was recognised by the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments in their response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At previous sessions of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations, the Australian delegation has called for the inclusion, in that part of the draft declaration dealing with self-determination, of a reference to the Declaration on Principles of International Law on Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. That declaration states that self-determination `shall not be construed as authorising or encouraging any action which would dismember or impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity of sovereign or independent states', so long as the governments of those states are representative of their peoples as a whole. I note that that language was also included in article 2 of the Vienna Declaration adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is in draft form only at this stage and will be the subject of a thorough process of negotiation which we expect will take some years to complete. There will be ample time for careful consideration of all the issues and for input from interested parties both at the national level and at the international level. When the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is finally adopted, moreover, it will not be legally binding on any country but will rather be an aspirational document which establishes standards that governments throughout the world can work towards. Given that the process of consultation will not take place until the draft is finally adopted by the Sub-commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, the government considers it premature to consider its final negotiating position in relation to this article and the declaration as a whole at this stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order simply because it is the only way that I can draw your attention to the second occasion within the last week in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) has failed to take proper account of the proceedings before this House. Mr Speaker, if you care to look at the blue daily program, you will notice that, later this afternoon, I am to present a report headed `Parliamentary Delegation to Bougainville' and to seek leave to make a statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) advised the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) and me that there was to be no further response to a parliamentary committee report on Indonesia from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I totally accept that the minister was not aware of the circumstances, because the foreign minister had not advised him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, we have the circumstance where technically there is almost a breach of privilege because the government's response to a report is to be tabled in this House before the report itself has been presented to this House. While I would accept that the Senate does have different proceedings and a different timetable, I believe it totally inappropriate for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to have acted in such a fashion that the report has not been presented here but that his response to that report has now been tabled. I realise that not a great deal can be done about it but I ask that you, Mr Speaker, request the Minister for Foreign Affairs in future at least to recognise that there are two chambers of parliament and that the House of Representatives is the people's chamber. I suggest that he, as a member of another place, would do well to take into account that proceedings and responsibilities of this place require him to act with due deference to matters that have not yet taken place within this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, on 28 March this year, there were a number of press reports about the imminent reshuffle of the federal cabinet consequent upon the sudden resignation of former Senator Richardson as the Minister for Health. One of those reports spoke of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). It said that the minister had:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . first tried to unload his industrial relations job in the reshuffle last December, but Mr Keating appears determined to keep him in the post.</PARA>
<PARA>The truth is that in the last seven months the Minister for Industrial Relations has twice tried to unload his responsibility as Minister for Industrial Relations. We on this side of the House believe that the events of the past few days have confirmed the reason why the minister has wanted to unload his responsibility: that is, the conduct of industrial relations in Australia has degenerated into an absolute shambles under the administration of this minister. Industrial relations is, without question, the nerve centre&mdash;or ought to be the nerve centre&mdash;of micro-economic reform in this country. Unless you reform the industrial relations system of this country, you will never make the Australian economy the modern, progressive, competitive economy that it needs to be if we are to reap the full rewards of that enormous, burgeoning market in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not enough for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to wander the highways and the byways of the world and say, `Asia is where our future is,' unless we are able to take advantage of that future. We are not the only country that sees the Asia-Pacific region, with 500 million middle-class consumers by the year 2000, as an enormous market. Unless we fit ourselves for the task of grabbing our share of that market, we will fall behind others who will get there before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no area that is more important in fitting ourselves out as a nation, as a modern, progressive economy, than the area of industrial relations. That is why it is a national disgrace that industrial relations policy has become such a shambles. That is why it is a national disgrace that you now have a disinterested, lazy, part-time minister looking after the industrial relations portfolio&mdash;a man who, self-professedly, is not interested in industrial relations any more. He wants to cut deals about the transport needs of this country. He is not interested in giving us a modern industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This shambles, quite appropriately enough, goes back to a speech made by the prime culprit himself, the Prime Minister of Australia. On 21 April 1993, just after the federal election in March 1993, he addressed a meeting of the Institute of Company Directors in Melbourne. He tried to persuade those company directors&mdash;and it was reflected in the columns of the Australian newspapers the following day&mdash;that the Keating regime after March of last year was going to be a regime that delivered a white-hot industrial relations revolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Prime Minister's acolyte in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reported `Keating's IR revolution'. That is what we were promised. He promised us that he was going to end 90 years of centralised wage fixing. He was going to unveil a major deregulation of the labour market to enable individual firms to negotiate wages based on productivity improvement. Would that he had done that. He would have been serving the national interest well if he had delivered on that high blown rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth, of course, is that he never intended to do that. It was another case of `Keatingspeak'&mdash;say one thing and do the complete opposite. He is a past master at Keatingspeak&mdash;you say one thing, you tell the world you will reform the industrial relations system and then you set out handing over more power to those who got you back into power. As soon as the ink was dry on that speech and the presses had rolled with their reports of it, the telephones rang hot. Martin Ferguson rang up, Bill Kelty rang up, Jennie George rang up, Iain Ross rang up, John Halfpenny rang up and Michael Easson&mdash;he still had a job then&mdash;rang up too. They all said, `Hang on, brother, you can't do this. We bankrolled you back into office. We're not going to cop anything less than a 100 per cent down payment on our getting you returned to power.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So bit by bit we saw this great retreat, this long retreat from Moscow, from the high water mark of this high blown rhetoric, this long retreat from those high ideals that Keating had given to the business community of Australia. Month by month those opposite retreated. The Minister for Industrial Relations said that he was going to negotiate with everybody. He did not negotiate with anybody; he took his running instructions from ACTU House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when the announcement of what would be in the Industrial Relations Act was made, it was not in the form of a press statement from the minister. It was a briefing paper from ACTU House on which all the press stories were written. The government was as blatant as that. It was not even shamefaced about it. There was not even a pretence of pretending that this government was seriously governing in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House of those immortal, never to be forgotten words of Jennie George. When she was told that the employers did not like the act, she said, `What they have to understand is that they lost the election and we won it.' That is what it was all about. It was winner takes all legislation of the worst kind, and to hell with the national interest. That did not come into it. Instead of our being given a decent reform of the industrial relations system, a bad system was made worse. It would have been better if the minister had done nothing at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not expect the government to adopt jobsback after it won the election. I would have gladly applauded it if it had. At least I did not think it was going to make the system worse, but that is what it has done. It has confused the business community, discouraged small business from employing unemployed Australians, weakened our international competitive position, loaded already excessively high on-costs for the employment of people with even further burdens, and it has further hobbled our capacity to become a more productive nation with the introduction of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new law has made matters infinitely worse, particularly for small business. I have four objections to it and I believe that they stand without criticism or reproof by the government. They relate to what is wrong with this legislation and why it ought to be not partially scrapped, not amended in a tiny particular, but scrapped altogether. To start with, there is no genuine enterprise bargaining for non-trade unionists. When the Prime Minister made this speech and promised this white-hot industrial relations revolution, the key point he made was that he would make enterprise bargaining available to the non-union sector of the Australian economy. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell you what has happened: his mates in the union movement, particularly the building unions in Victoria, said, `Look, if anybody thinks that non-unionists are going to be able to negotiate enterprise bargains, they ought to understand one thing, and that is that we are going to come down on them like a ton of bricks.' Of course, in the building industry in Victoria, that has a double meaning, literally and metaphorically. People do come down on you like a ton of bricks in the building industry in Victoria. That is the first objection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there has been the continued use&mdash;illicit use in my view&mdash;of the external affairs power. I was absolutely delighted that the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) at the dispatch box got up at question time in answer to a dorothy dixer and had a go at us over the external affairs power. If you think some article written 11 years ago by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) when he occupied a position with the Australian Chamber of Commerce is going to deter the opposition from attacking you for running cap in hand to foreigners to distort the domestic law of Australia, you have another think coming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have done more to give away the independence of Australia by the foreign debt you have run up and by the way you run off to these bureaucrats in Geneva begging them to change our domestic law than any invading army could have done. You have been the arch-sellers-out of Australian national pride and independence. You have done it not only by denigrating our symbols but also by subverting our sound currency and by handing over the control of our laws to foreign committees whose members are often from countries who have no regard at all for human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sorts of human rights records do some of the countries represented on the UN Human Rights Committee really have? What kinds of human rights are there for women, for example, in a country like Senegal? These are the sorts of committees that you are making this country subservient to and you have the infernal gall to talk about becoming a republic and ripping out of our flag the symbol of a country that has done more to defend human rights than most of the countries you now take your marching orders from. That is the measure of your respect for the institutions, history and culture of this country. That association to this debate is very basic&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the objectionable features of this act is the extraordinary lengths the government has gone to to use the external affairs power of the constitution. But worse than that is the way in which the destruction of the secondary boycott protections has placed trade unions, once again, above the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 15 years it was possible in this country to say that if somebody, and that somebody was a company, destroyed my business, I could take it to court and get an injunction and damages against it. If a union destroyed my business I could do the same thing. You could proudly say that in Australia for 15 years; you can say it no longer. Now if you wreck my business I can take you to court, but if your union mates wreck my business I am wrecked, and I do not have any redress. If you think that is fair, if you think that is Australian justice, if you think that is a fair go Australian style, then your values and attitudes are completely different from those of most Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that we strongly object to is the enormous burdens that this legislation has placed on small business in Australia. You will not get the unemployed back to work unless you get small business re-employing people. You must know that at the moment big companies are filling their order books but they are still putting off staff. If you go to any board lunch anywhere in Australia you will get that same story&mdash;they are still reducing their staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only hope we have of getting people back to work in this country is to give incentives to small business to take on more employees. What does this act do? It does the exact opposite. It provides disincentives for the recruitment of more people. It makes it more expensive, threatening, dubious, doubtful and frightening to take on more staff. If you say to somebody, `Look, if you put a bloke on, you'll find it very hard, nigh impossible, to get rid of him if he proves to be unsatisfactory,' the reaction is, `I'll buy another computer. I'll get my existing staff to work a bit harder.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have this incredible shambles. You have a piece of legislation that is nothing other than a 100 per cent payback to the trade union movement. We even had the amazing spectacle of that great democrat Stan Sharkey screaming his head off on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS>. He said, `The minister went ahead with these changes to unfair dismissal provisions without consulting me. We gave them $500,000.' They gave the government a nice round $500,000. What did our self-professed pay-by-results operator, Minister Brereton, say? Stan Sharkey's problem was that he did not give enough. A lot of unions gave a lot more and he has to understand that $500,000 only buys a bit of commission. It does not buy 100 per cent of the action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can agree with the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) on one point&mdash;and this is essential&mdash;that industrial relations is at the centre of micro-economic reform. The question is how we deliver the changes in industrial relations that will create micro-economic reform in the Australian community. It is not created by trying to legislate out one side of the game. It is not created by trying to damn the trade union movement and its right to represent Australian workers. We need to work with two groups: employers and those who wish to represent them, and employees and those who wish to represent them. That is precisely the way we have worked in the industrial relations system for more than a decade. We have had what we call a tripartite system of industrial relations in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell those opposite how it works. In significant areas of debate about the economy we invite employers and their representatives and representatives of employees to sit with the government&mdash;a triangle of interests&mdash;so that together we can work through the propositions. I will list some of the groups that operate in a tripartite system with the Commonwealth government of Australia. The Reserve Bank of Australia, a not insignificant institution in this country, has worker and employer officials sitting on its board. Some of the other groups include the Defence Industry Committee, the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, the Australian Manufacturing Council, the Australian National Training Authority, the National Labour Consultative Council and EPAC. Those sorts of boards are central to debate about micro-economic reform&mdash;that is, how we run industry in this country better&mdash;and each of them comprises representatives of government, employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a culture, it is a matter of the mind, that we do not seek to deny one of the key groups access to this debate. All industrial relations matters do not take place in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or before the courts; they take place in a myriad of forums. That is the essence of the system that those opposite have not understood. In a mature industrial relations system we can place people from both sides in all of those organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The American system, whilst very different to ours, can from time to time be compared. There has been a recent review of the Australian system by some senior US officials, reported on in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. I would like to read some of their comments. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">President Clinton's commission into industrial relations has endorsed Australia's enterprise bargaining reforms, which it says have produced more widespread worker-management consultation than in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a decent enough thing for them to have said. But the key bits&mdash;I quote Mr John Dunlop, a key official in the writing of the report&mdash;are these:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"I think the most impressive feature of the Australian experience is the way in which they appear&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Australian government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to have aligned unions, the workers, management and the Government with a unity of purpose,"</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to describe the purpose. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what they've done is they've acknowledged that what everyone is about is creating wealth and then distributing that wealth, not just the distribution but the creation of that wealth from the start.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a significant statement from a US official who now admits that the US cannot run an industrial relations system. Sure, it is a free-for-all and they have a fairly low level of industrial disputation, for instance. They have a low level of industrial disputation because of the bludgeoning that took place in the Reagan era and before that of organised labour, and we are very critical of that. Now in American workplaces there is a silent strike. There is now a lack of cooperation, a lack of desire to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">American enterprises today are unproductive enterprises because they refuse to have this joining together of workers and bosses. It is the lesson that many OECD countries have learned. The Japanese have learned, the Germans have learned and we have learned that unless both groups are operating together in a culture of cooperation there can be on the surface a measurable lack of disputes, but no-one is doing anything. Not a great deal is being produced&mdash;certainly not goods of quality that would compete, for instance, with Japanese manufactures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite do not understand the whole nature of the game. The honourable member for Bennelong had four specific criticisms of our bill and of industrial relations generally. He talked about non-trade unionists being excluded from the ability to bargain. That is not right. There is now a string of enterprise bargaining agreements called enterprise flexibility agreements. The trade unions cannot have a veto over the agreement. That system has been in place now only since 30 March. In those short weeks we have any number of EFAs up and agreed to&mdash;or in the process of agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was very difficult for the trade union movement to swallow because it had, I suppose over time, seen itself as the key player on behalf of workers in the IR system. It is still the key player, and my advice to any non-union worker in Australia is: `If you want to sit down with the boss and write up an agreement, then ring up someone who knows about the system. Do not bargain alone. Ring up an experienced advocate. Ring up your trade union. Have them, if not negotiate on your behalf, teach you how to negotiate so you can write up your own enterprise flexibility agreement. Remember: an agreement means that both sides have to agree. If you are not very experienced in the art of negotiation, if you do not understand your award rights and other rights of negotiation, make sure you learn about them first before you enter into an agreement.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proof of the pudding here really is how many agreements are being written around the country. Under the Commonwealth system, under our new act and the previous manner in which we have worked, 48 per cent of workers are covered in the federal award system for agreements. So we have had a good record so far and we would seek to reach 80 per cent coverage by the end of 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who would seek to run a different system, somewhat like the jobsback program that the honourable member for Bennelong suggested at the last election, have a very poor record of coverage. The coverage in states other than those using our system is something like four per cent or less. That is the record under state awards in state systems run by conservative governments. The reason people will not agree to bargain is that they are scared to do so. There is no equivalence of power. So we have written in a system which clearly induces workers to get in and bargain. They know that by law they cannot be worse off. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a stupid remark you make. Secondly, I turn to the business of ILO powers. It really does not matter who else signs up to an ILO, a UN or other convention. The point is that we freely choose&mdash;that is, the representatives of the Australian people, the Commonwealth government&mdash;to sign up to a convention; that is, we like the standards. It does not matter whether an African nation or an Asian nation or whatever wishes to sign those conventions. The fact is that we want to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is normal practice when we sign an agreement to check with the states to see whether they have legislation which would contradict or contravene the convention. If they do, we ask them to bring their legislation into line. If they choose not to do that, we still choose, on the basis of our representing Australia's interests, to sign up. That is a matter of choice for us. That is what we have done in the ILO. We have been a member of the ILO for 50 years. You opposition people have always travelled to the ILO where we have sent a minister. You have always been in that forum. You want to pull out now because you are unhappy that we are making great progress with enterprise agreements. I am sad for you. You are left trailing five conservative governments whose record in writing agreements is pathetic. It will not get any better. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point No. 4 concerns small business. This is like waving the flag that small business is good and that whatever we can do for it is terrific, but you never detailed the provisions of our act that are somehow denying small businesses the right to go out and make a quid. I presume it might be the business of its access to enterprise agreements, or unfair dismissals, or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Keep in mind that most small businesses&mdash;I guess workshops of fewer than 10 people or whatever&mdash;will rarely write an agreement. They would tend to go along with the award system per se anyway. Within the award system now there is a great deal more flexibility to vary the provisions of the award. So in the case of small business an agreement is not necessarily needed, but there is the ability to sit down and enter into a more flexible agreement within the award under which workers are covered. It is not a difficult system to operate. Small businesses, which I guess are fairly ignorant of the IR system, should get to know the system better, because there is a lot in it for them and their employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the area of small to larger sized businesses. One thing I have noticed as I move around&mdash;it is something the honourable member for Bennelong could never achieve&mdash;is that in larger enterprises of 100 or 200 workers, where any number of trade unions covers those people and they work under any number of awards, we have now been able to achieve not by dint of rules and regulations but by the culture that we have built in the last decade what we call single bargaining units. That is, the representatives of the workers in that workplace, perhaps coming from a number of different unions covering lots of workers, sit down as a single bargaining unit and, with great care and intelligence, together with the employer bargain for an entire agreement for the whole workplace. So, essentially, defensive practices that were written up and gained in years gone by to protect the plumbers, electricians, storemen and packers or whatever are now being put together and looked at as a whole to make sure that the plumbers, electricians, carpenters, clerks, et cetera, share the work and work together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers say to me that perhaps the single most important entity of the last 10 years has been the ability to bring all those representatives together. We have created a culture of industrial relations in this country that will drive productivity in this country. Industrial relations is at the centre of productivity in this country. On that point alone I agree with the honourable member for Bennelong. </PARA>

It had a vacancy for a single lecturer in mathematics. One outstanding applicant for it had all the qualifications under the sun. Unfortunately, the people concerned were not able to interview him because he was a Russian in Russia. They could not bring him out and they could not go over there. But they got some other objective academics in Russia to interview him. On the basis of their recommendation, he was given the job. But there was one thing wrong: he could not speak English.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Where is this government's fairness to all Australians and all sectors? We believe that the government of Australia should represent all Australians and all sectors. Where is the equity and justice? It has gone out the door, particularly in the area of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD report on Australia in April showed that productivity growth in the five years from 1987-92 was only 70 per cent of the OECD average. Productivity is the key to economic growth and economic success. It is the key to competitive success on the domestic and export markets. Quite frankly, the key to productivity is a sensible, fair and flexible industrial relations policy. This just does not exist with this current act or this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As the honourable member for Bennelong said just a short while ago, industrial relations is the nerve centre for micro-economic reform. He is absolutely right. Unless we get industrial relations right, we will not get anywhere. We are too highly regulated. The Industrial Relations Act is disastrous for small business. It removes the protection of the secondary boycott laws and it imposes penalties on small business wanting to employ people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the white paper, there is a $6 1/2 billion attempt to get small business to employ the long-term unemployed. Quite frankly, there is a black hole in that white paper that will destroy this government. The government says, `We want small business to take on the long-term unemployed.' The reality is that small businessmen really want to help this country. All of them do, and they would all welcome the opportunity of taking on somebody who has been long-term unemployed through the job compact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as the Minister for Industrial Relations said in response to a question from me only a couple of weeks ago, those who put on somebody under the job compact have one week&mdash;that is the only time available&mdash;to make up their mind whether they want to keep that person. That is unfair to the employer and the employees. To make it quite clear, there will be one week before the unfair dismissal provisions apply. So a businessman can get somebody who has been unemployed for something like 18 months or two years. That person can be employed out of the goodness of the employer's heart. The employer then has to make up his mind in just one week whether that person will be satisfactory. That is not fair or realistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government will go down the drain.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some reference was made earlier by the honourable member for Bennelong to a retreat from Moscow. He was absolutely right when he said that. But we will have more than that. Very soon, we will have a retreat from Paris. The headlines in the press of the last couple of days have been very illuminating. One of them states `Brereton agrees to further review of IR bill'. Another states `Brereton firm as ACTU tries to lift compo'. He was as firm as a soft meringue. Another headline states `Leaked advice paper embarrasses ministers'. Were they embarrassed! A further headline states `OECD blames unemployment and failure to adapt'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, in typical style, we have heard the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Bennelong. As usual, he is not letting the facts get in the way of a good story. Today, industrial disputes in Australia are at their lowest level in generations. Over the past 12 months we have had the most substantial reform of the industrial relations system in this country, introduced by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr  Brereton). We have had a new enterprise bargaining system introduced which is delivering far more results at the federal level than the equivalents that have been introduced by conservative governments in their states have produced. Yet the matter of public importance submitted to the House is that the conduct of industrial relations is in a shambles&mdash;or shambolic, to quote the word those opposite have chosen to use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might look back in history to see what sort of a model we should have for an industrial relations minister. Perhaps we should go back to the Fraser government&mdash;the last time we saw a Liberal industrial relations minister in this country federally&mdash;and look at its track record to check the sort of model we should be looking at. Perhaps we should compare the degree of reform and change in industrial relations in our society between 1975 and 1983 with the degree of change that has occurred since 1983. I think the honourable member for Bennelong might concede that there was not a great deal of change in the time of the Fraser government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps we could look at the level of disputes and the performance of people such as the former member for Stirling, Mr Ian Viner, as the minister who was responsible for industrial relations. Perhaps we could look at the level of confrontation and division in our society in that time. Then we would see the model of industrial relations that the Liberals and the National Party really represent and what they really are after. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of issues have been touched on in this debate. Unfortunately, my time does not allow me to deal with all of them. But I would like to make a few comments about the unfair dismissals legislation because, unlike the honourable member for Bennelong, I have a bit of experience in the area. In fact, I have been involved in 200 or 300 unfair dismissal cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of unfair dismissal cases in this country is that the vast majority of people involved in them do not get very much out of them at all. Contrary to the image that has been portrayed by the media, by the conservatives and by the employers with respect to these recent amendments, most workers who pursue unfair dismissals in Australia end up either with nothing or with very limited outcomes, such as a couple of weeks extra pay, a reference or a change in the term `dismissal' to `resignation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the previous Victorian system, under the Labor government, one per cent of applicants secured reinstatement. The vast majority of people under that system received, at best, a few weeks extra pay. This is the situation that the honourable member for Bennelong is suggesting is a great threat to employment in this country. It is an absolute absurdity. The vast majority of people come out of unfair dismissal proceedings still feeling that they are hard done by; that they have not got proper justice; and that the system dealing with unfair dismissals in this country is still substantially inadequate. Much as I would like to see it otherwise, I doubt that the new system that has been introduced federally will be greatly different. It will be an improvement. There will be workers who will be able to get some significant justice out of it. But, compared with the reality of the consequences that an unfairly dismissed worker suffers because of that dismissal, it will still be grossly inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfair dismissal laws exist in this country only because we have Labor governments. In Victoria prior to 1983 there was no redress for unfairly dismissed workers unless they were high-fliers who could access common law. Ordinary workers had no rights. If they were sacked arbitrarily or capriciously by an employer, there was absolutely nothing they could do. It was because we had a Labor government in Victoria, for the first time for 27 years, that we were able to introduce some justice and some protection for workers in that situation. The conservatives want employers to have the ability to sack workers arbitrarily and capriciously and to throw them out like they are a bag of rubbish, not to have to face any consequences for it and not to have to front up to any independent adjudication as to whether there was fairness in that dismissal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Think for a moment what it is like to be a store person or a typist&mdash;perhaps somebody who is a bit older or does not have too many qualifications&mdash;who has been at a place for 10 years and suddenly is sacked for some arbitrary reason. It does happen. Many dismissals are perfectly justified, but many are not. Think of the position and the consequences that people in that situation are likely to suffer as a result of that dismissal, such as the prolonged unemployment that they could incur and the stigma on their record that may make it extremely difficult for them to get another job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are very serious issues for many Australian workers. We need decent legislation in the area of unfair dismissal to ensure that people have the capacity to get an independent judicially based hearing to decide whether or not they have been unfairly dismissed. Unfortunately, the coalition's position is based on a philosophical view that an employment contract is no different from any other contract: for example, it is no different from a contract to go down to the Victoria Market and buy a sack of spuds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is implicit in this view that parties to this contract have equal bargaining power. It is an equal contract with the checkout person at Coles New World and Coles Myer. It is an equal contract with the steel worker at Newcastle and BHP. It is an equal contract with the vehicle builder on the production line at Broadmeadows and Ford. They have equal bargaining positions. That is implicit in the philosophical position of the opposition, as advocated by the honourable member for Bennelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the world is very different. The employment contract is one of the most fundamentally important socioeconomic structures in our society. It is not just a contract to buy a sack of spuds. Most people in our society live and die according to contracts of employment. To suggest that we should have a society that does not intervene to redress the imbalance that is implicit in many of those contracts of employment is bordering on a barbaric attitude to a contemporary industrial society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the vast majority of cases in the work force, the contract of employment is heavily weighted in favour of the employer. The balance of power, in most cases, is strongly in favour of the employer. Society intervenes through Labor governments in order to ensure that there is some balance in the relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer very briefly to enterprise bargaining, which was also raised earlier. As I said, I regret that I cannot deal with all the matters that were dealt with by the honourable member for Bennelong. The Liberal position, again, is based on the notion of the individual as a contracting party. Ultimately, it represents the interests of the strong and the powerful&mdash;the people who do have bargaining power and whom it portrays as equals in a negotiating process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both of the coalition speakers in this debate quoted a comment made by Jennie George, and again the meaning of that comment has been very seriously misrepresented. I say to the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) that the meaning of that comment by Jennie George was very clear. Her meaning was simply, `We got elected. Don't expect us to implement coalition policy. We will implement Labor policy. We won. The people of Australia voted for a Labor government, and Labor policy will be introduced.' That was what she was saying. There were no suggestions of payback, graft, or any of the other ludicrous implications that have been thrown around. Jennie George's implication was very simple. We won the election. The Australian people voted for a regulated labour market. Believe me, in Victoria it won us a few seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people voted for fairness in labour relations. They voted for a regulated labour market. Jennie George was simply indicating that the ACTU expected a Labor government to implement Labor policy. Those opposite may not like that, but that is the outcome of the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive that the opposition is attacking the Minister for Industrial Relations. Those opposite did not mention their policy. The reason they did not do so was that they do not have a policy.

Although acknowledging that simulation can never fully replace actual practice on a firing range, the committee believes that simulation could form part of training. This simulation could then be complemented by training at one of the army facilities on the mainland. The committee, therefore, recommends that the Department of Defence investigate the possible use of a simulated firing range at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> which could be used in conjunction with army firing ranges on the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should the small arms range eventually proceed, the committee would like to stress that it has been assured by the Department of Defence that only 2.5 kilometres of beach would be unavailable to the public when the range is being used, which would be up to three days per week. Access would not be restricted on weekends or public holidays. I also stress that the public has access to some 84 per cent of the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was told at the public hearing that operational safety measures would include sentries, warning flags, notices in local newspapers and personnel allocated to restricting public access within the safety template. The Department of Defence informed the committee that, following advice from army, the range is in accordance with military guidance and the safety template provided to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the public hearing the committee was made aware by various environmental groups of the rare fauna and flora native to Garden Island. The fauna includes the tammar wallaby, the lined skink, the carpet python and the brush bronzewing. The Department of Defence advised the committee that it recognises that the native animal life on the island play an essential role in its natural ecosystem. Accordingly, environmental management is aimed at maintaining the behaviour, diversity and ecological integrity of indigenous animal species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of preserving trees native to Garden Island, in particular the Rottnest pines, the Rottnest tea trees and the cheesewood trees, in which I took a great personal interest, was brought to the attention of the committee. The Department of Defence advised that every care is taken to preserve the flora on the island with exotic species being controlled and, if possible, eradicated. The committee commends the Department of Defence on action taken to preserve the unique environment of Garden Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the public hearing, the committee received the impression that non-government environment and conservation groups believed that they were not adequately consulted or represented when decisions were made concerning environmental issues on Garden Island. The committee has therefore recommended that a representative of these groups be appointed to the Garden Island Environmental Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Defence has assured the committee that, to the best of its current knowledge, the total development of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS>, including stage 3, would remain at 17 per cent or 206.1 hectares of the 1,214 hectare island. This statement should therefore allay fears expressed by various groups that the navy plans to occupy the entire island. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Bougainville from 18 to 22 April 1994. The island of Bougainville, a district which is part of Papua New Guinea, has for some five years been tragically subject to incredible divisiveness and a great deal of hardship and suffering. It would seem that there have been a number of occasions on which there has been a very tragic abuse of human rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in that climate that the members of the delegation were very pleased to accept the invitation by Prime Minister Wingti and his government to visit the island and to consult with members of the Bougainville community. The report I now table emanates from that visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three things I want to say. Papua New Guinea has a very special relationship with Australia. That relationship places a unique responsibility both on members of the Australian parliament in their dealings with Papua New Guinea and on those Australians working in Papua New Guinea. It is important that we understand that whether or not we believe that there is some continual causal relationship between events in Papua New Guinea and decisions and actions of the Australian government, nothing we say or do should intrude on the rights of the Papua New Guinea people to exercise their separate sovereign responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our report takes note of that special relationship. What we suggest in this report is no more than what we see as a possible process towards peace. So we are not laying down the law; we are suggesting a process. I believe this report does that effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At no stage during our visit to Papua New Guinea and certainly not during our visit to Bougainville did the members of the delegation discuss the reopening of the Panguna mine. That, of course, is an issue peculiarly for resolution by the government of Papua New Guinea. It was not an issue which we saw as our responsibility, nor was it a matter that was in any way discussed by us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the leader of the delegation has commented, tragically there has been a series of rumours and innuendos which led to the physical abuse of Sir Paul Lapun and his family as a result of a rumoured gift to him by the delegation and the apparent determination by what appears to be a rascal gang of some 15 members to extract that sum of money from him. That, of course, was absolute rubbish. At no stage did we give or offer money to anybody, nor were we in a position to do so. We are pleased that since that incident the steps we have suggested in our report have in part been taken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was delighted to read this morning a report from Mary-Louise O'Callaghan suggesting that already the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Papua New Guinea has initiated discussions which apparently have been held in Honiara with representatives of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army. All members of the delegation hope these discussions lead to a peaceful resolution of the tragic events that have so torn the people of Bougainville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Visiting the care centres was the only real opportunity we had to see people who had been affected by the dispute&mdash;although, of course, we spoke to a number of people in the administration. It is important that the government of PNG understand that, while there are so many other issues with which it must be concerned, unless it settles the dispute on Bougainville unfortunately that will continue to dominate world headlines and a disproportionate emphasis will be given to that dispute over all other matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We therefore feel quite strongly that, unless a process somewhat similar to that which we recommended is immediately embarked on, all the other fields of assistance that the PNG needs will be neglected and the press emphasis will unfortunately distort it. For that reason, we trust that the Prime Minister and other ministers will give the priority to Bougainville that we see as essential. We hope, having allowed our visit, Papua New Guinea will open the province to non-government organisations, to the media, to other visiting missions and of course to representatives of the churches. We believe there have to be discussions between representatives of the BRA and the government and that process, which apparently Sir Julius Chan has already initiated, we trust will lead to some review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of human rights, I was delighted to read from the government response given by the foreign minister that there is already to be a human rights commission constituted in PNG. I believe that commission should undertake the steps that we recommended to ensure that human rights abuses, no matter what side they have taken place, are investigated. Nonetheless, it is only by a process of reconciliation, such a process as we witnessed in Konga, south of Bougainville, that we believe that there can be a final putting to rest of the processes which seem, unfortunately, to have meant a continued series of retaliatory measures by members from both sides. Payback is not a process by which we are going to settle a dispute of this character. Unless there is a proper process of reconciliation taking account of the necessary formats and customary procedures, we do not believe that peace can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to a number of people, and quite demonstrably to the members of the committee&mdash;to the chairman, Senator Stephen Loosley; to my fellow members; to Margaret Swieringa, the secretary to the committee&mdash;and to the members of the Australian High Commission in Port Moresby, to whom we all felt particularly indebted, and in particular to those who accompanied us to Bougainville. It was not an easy visit; I believe their assistance was invaluable. I would also like to pay tribute to Prime Minister Wingti, to Sir Julius Chan and to each of the representatives of the government of Papua New Guinea who were inordinately helpful and willing to assist us, and above all, although we did not meet them, to the people of Bougainville, including the BRA, which I trust will pay equal attention to our report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is not just to the government of Papua New Guinea, it is to all Bougainvilleans and it is for their sake and for the achievement of peace that we make this report to the Australian parliament and to the government of PNG. We hope it is a step towards a new era in Bougainville. If so, we believe that the care centres, where tragically so many today are suffering, can be disbanded and people can return to their villages and to their normal way of life. I commend the report to the parliament and to the people of PNG in the hope that it might achieve peace in that war torn province. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would like to thank those people I was privileged to join on this delegation, including one-time strongman, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). It was with a note of affection and with great respect and esteem that he was referred to in that way by the people of Bougainville. They hold him in high esteem and I can assure honourable members that my contact with him on this delegation has led me to hold him in equal esteem. I also feel that, based on our experiences, I have a long-lasting relationship and friendship with the others who were part of that delegation&mdash;Senator Bourne, Senator Loosley and Senator Calvert.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point that needs to be made perfectly clear, however, is that the federal parliamentary delegation to Bougainville did not at any point talk directly to the Bougainville Revolutionary Army. I assure this parliament that I made attempts at various points to talk to those aligned to the BRA and an attempt was made through Kevin Masive MP and Nakikus Konga MP to talk to those held in gaol in Rabaul. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore reiterate that any references in the report to happenings in BRA held territory are anecdotal, implied or third-party accounts. No direct reference was made or should be inferred from the report as to our experience of BRA activities, as we had none. The PNG government cannot be held to account for this as it was not in a position to allow us to be in a position of danger, either real or potential&mdash;and one must remember that this is a war zone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first observation, which is not included in the report, is that I personally feel Bougainville Copper Ltd is responsible for the present situation. This is based on personal contacts in Bougainville before and during the conflict until the evacuation. It is my personal opinion that the lack of due attention to the local population and the environment and the massive dislocation thus caused to the social and economic structure of Bougainville are the cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of any other responsibility, BCL should clean up the mess it has made with no thought of ever going back to Panguna. That is its moral obligation. In addition, I suggest that BCL make a large seven-figure cash settlement to the people of Bougainville for pain and suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the other place, Senator Margetts implied that the report in some way avoided the issue of the mine. I dispute that vigorously. The point is that the environment was not there to even mention the mine. The truth is that cessation of hostilities and return to normalcy are prerequisites to any hope of any discussion remotely involving the mine. I think Senator Margetts should think of this: if two blokes are taking each other apart in a pub brawl, you do not try to sort out what instigated the violence until you actually get them apart and stop the violence taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issue for me, and I believe the delegation, was peace and&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;that is the main issue for the people of Bougainville. I ask all to closely look at the aid question, as the report clearly states that throwing money at the problem will not solve the problem. Indeed, whether that aid would reach its goal is questionable. The solution lies in the hearts of the Bougainvilleans to want, and reach out for, peace, realising that forgiveness may be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of accountability for actions, I made it quite clear&mdash;and it is reflected in the report&mdash;that the PNG government security forces and the BRA atrocities need to be dealt with with equal justice. I will be painfully clear: either all should get amnesty or all should face the full force of the law, because the atrocities committed have been numerous and on both sides. I qualify that by saying that the worst atrocities were set in the period 1989-90 for the PNG security and defence forces and the period of sole occupation for the BRA. It is unclear whether these acts were from the leadership down or from direct combatants. Suffice it to say, it is my opinion that those most responsible will evade justice. I am convinced that the PNG political leadership should sincerely seek a just settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Prime Minister Paias Wingti, backed by Deputy Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan, for the personal undertaking to facilitate a visit of union representatives nominated by me. I place on record that Senator Loosley has delivered my letter nominating three representatives of the ACTU, along with Fay Campbell of the National Union of Workers representing the South Coast Labour Council. The union movement of this country, especially the South Coast Labour Council, has a proud record of caring for its fellow man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that we visited the war cemetery at Rabaul, and the ages of those killed were late teens and early 20s. It was truly a moving experience. I sincerely hope that the lives of Bougainvilleans and future generations of Australians may in some way be protected by the work we have undertaken, by the report and by the goodwill it will generate. I hope my two boys never have to don khaki 20 years from now because we have failed to grasp peace today. I commend the report. I truly hope in my heart that this is the beginning of, or is part of, a process which will deliver peace to our region.</PARA>

<PARA>The government has agreed to the sale of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline system on the basis of a sale of 51 per cent to the Australian Gas Light Co. and a competitive tender for the remaining 49 per cent. This tender has resulted in preferred bidder status for a consortium headed by a Canadian company, Novacorp International, with Petroliam Nasional Berhard (Petronas) of Malaysia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposed amendments that have come through as a result of representations from industry and from the opposition are welcomed. They certainly sort out some of the drafting problems that were inherent in the legislation. They also go to meet some of the concerns of consumers and users of the pipeline. The big question to me has always been access to the pipeline by other producers within the gas fields around Australia, the appropriate compensation to be paid to the owners of the pipeline and under what terms and conditions access would be granted. I believe that the amendments go a long way to establishing this. However, in the future, we do have to think about a national grid, encompassing a connection between the substantial Victorian national gas grid and the Queensland national gas grid; and in the longer term no doubt an extension right across to Western Australia. When that occurs, a national regulatory body will be vital to handle the various component parts of, and access to, the line.</PARA></TALK.START>

We said it could not possibly be sold, and now here is the Labor government selling it. Those who have an even more acute sense of history will recall that AGL first proposed a pipeline at the end of the 1960s. Magnificent work was done by Connor when he nationalised it in the Whitlam government days but, 20 years later, the Labor government is turning around and privatising it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank all members who contributed to this debate: the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland), the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile). I give due recognition to the work done by the parliamentary Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, chaired by my colleague in the Senate Senator Barney Cooney, in the examination of these issues. I also give due recognition to the work done by Senator Newman, the deputy chairperson of that committee. I am sure I speak for all members of this House in saying that we were very saddened to hear of her illness. We wish her a speedy recovery and hope that she will soon be back participating fully in the deliberations of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will spend a few minutes explaining some matters which were raised by honourable members. I was very impressed with the quality of the debate and with some of the issues that were raised. It is never easy to get the correct balance between rights and responsibilities. In an area like this, where some people can take advantage of rights given to them and not meet their responsibilities, the government obviously has a role to act to enforce the law. Exactly where one draws the line in enforcing the law in the area of medical fraud and overservicing is not easy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can attest to the fact that this matter has been around for many years. The first parliamentary committee that I served on in this parliament during the period of the Fraser government conducted a big inquiry into medical fraud and overservicing. You may remember that, Mr Deputy Speaker. From that time, this matter has come up again and again. Governments have struggled with the issue in one way or another to try to achieve the balance that is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unacceptable that estimates of $100 million or $200 million, or even more than that&mdash;up to seven per cent, according to the last report of the Office of National Assessments&mdash;may have been lost through medical fraud and overservicing. At that point, obviously it would have been necessary for the government to act to bring in new and better procedures. I think all honourable members accept that this is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are issues in the area of health policy and other policies that divide this House. I think very few members would wish to object to the general principle and thrust of the legislation: to create a situation where, on the one hand, those people who are abusing the system could be caught and made accountable and where, on the other hand, those people who are innocent could have their rights protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been made of the point that this legislation, from when it was first drafted, has been significantly amended following an inquiry by the parliamentary committee. Somehow this has been put forward as a kind of negative rather than a positive. It was not a negative. The government recognised that there was some concern about certain provisions of the legislation in the community&mdash;especially in the medical community&mdash;and by people who are interested in civil liberties, such as the honourable member for Tangney, for example. Because of the concerns of a number of people, including people within both the government and opposition parties, and indeed the Australian Democrats, it was decided to send the bill to the committee with the idea that it would examine these issues and report back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Minister for Health, former Senator Richardson, need not have acceded to that request, but he did. As a result, we had a situation where officers of the department attended some of the hearings and heard some of the evidence and submissions and then decided, before the committee even reported, to put forward a series of proposed amendments in order to take account of the measures and suggestions that had been put up. In fact, as a result of the putting forward of those amendments, the parliamentary committee, by majority, accepted them. Not all committee members did. Opposition members did not because they wanted even more amendments, and I will get to that point later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member for Mackellar had been listening, she would have heard me say that, as soon as it was recognised that there were concerns about the original draft, there was no attempt by the government to say, `Look, we don't accept that in any way.' On the contrary, the government agreed to the whole question of having a parliamentary committee examine the issue and put forward amendments. After all of that process&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member says, `It doesn't have to be.' She cannot have it both ways in the parliamentary process. I have heard her spokespersons coming in here and saying, `You don't pay enough attention to our concerns; you don't pay enough attention to what we say.' When we do pay attention to what they say and when some ministers, and some parliamentary secretaries I might say, pay attention to what honourable members opposite say, what do we get from the honourable member for Mackellar? `Oh, it shouldn't have been like that in the first place.' She cannot have it both ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that we have listened to the people and we have listened to the opposition about genuine concerns in relation to this issue. We have wanted a bipartisan position and a position which is satisfactory to the community. As far as I can see, what has happened is that the amendments, as I say, were accepted by the majority of the committee; the opposition members on the committee expressed some further concerns; and, as the honourable member for Mackellar well knows, when these concerns were debated in the Senate, some of the opposition's concerns, not all of them, were also accepted by the minor parties and, as a consequence, they passed through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has decided not to reject those amendments but, in fact, to accept them and, therefore, to accept the overall package as being a package that has come from the deliberations of a range of people, all concerned, as I said at the beginning, with this very issue of balancing on the one hand the need for enforcement and, on the other hand, the need for there to be protection of the civil liberties of doctors and, indeed, of the records of patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the legislation has achieved that result and the opposition, as it has indicated, is not opposing the result that has been achieved. I think we are entitled to see this as a very good exercise of parliamentary process in which we have achieved very good legislation and legislation which is absolutely necessary if we are to go forward and deal with associated problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Adelaide raised a couple of important matters. One of them was the question: to what extent would the officers of the HIC be capable of exercising, with discretion, the new powers that have been given to them? In order to take care of this matter, besides the amendments to the legislation, I would advise the honourable member for Adelaide, the shadow minister and others who are interested that the Health Insurance Commission has embarked upon a comprehensive training program for all its officers working in this area. It is being assisted by the Australian Federal Police training college in developing and implementing the training programs. Already this financial year the relevant staff have attended tailor-made training programs. Ongoing training in this specialised area has been given a very high priority. Furthermore, comprehensive policy and procedures are being established under which HIC officers must operate in relation to these provisions. All use of the new powers will be authorised and monitored by the HIC managing director to the national case management committee of the HIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make those points on the record as an assurance to the opposition, to the parliament and to all interested persons, including persons from the medical profession, that these powers have been given but it is expected that the officers of the department will use them with the kind of discretion which I have mentioned; and that they will be used in such a way that they will not invade, unduly or without cause, the civil liberties of any doctors or interfere with patient records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lyne also raised a similar matter. He referred to the investigation of a pharmacist. This matter has been reviewed by the previous health minister. The whole pharmacy question and the behaviour of the HIC vis-a-vis the pharmacist have been reviewed. The issue has led to further strengthening of procedures followed by HIC officers and is well covered within the new comprehensive training programs of the HIC officers. So, again, there has been an effort on the part of the government to ensure that concerns which have been raised by honourable members in relation to these issues&mdash;which are important because of the balance between civil liberties and enforcement that I have mentioned and, in fact, even any suggestion of misuse of powers&mdash;are taken up, considered and reported upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, having said all that, it is still an unfortunate fact that there is a very small number of medical practitioners who are indulging in medical fraud. As the AMA and other organisations of doctors have said, this gives the whole profession a bad name. It is important that these people understand that the government is determined to stamp out all fraud and to ensure that overservicing does not take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who spoke last in the debate, talked about the difficulty of judging overservicing. He talked about how it should not be a matter for police officers and other people, such as HIC officers, to be imposing on doctors who know what they are doing with respect to overservicing. Obviously, he has not followed the debate at all. This bill, which deals with fraud and does have a role for the HIC, is separate from the question of overservicing, which we have dealt with in an earlier, commensurate bill. In the overservicing situation, a tribunal of peers, doctors, will look at the evidence and make determinations as to whether this was unwarranted overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question will not be determined by the HIC; it will be determined by an independent tribunal. The honourable member for O'Connor, by his comments, obviously missed the mark entirely. It is difficult in some cases to make a judgment of overservicing, but it is precisely because of that that the overservicing issue is going to be handled by a tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this is not the case with fraud. If a doctor claims that a certain patient appeared and the doctor made a claim for that patient when there was no such visitation, that is fraud. If a doctor claims that there had been six visitations when there had been only two, that is fraud. That is the sort of thing we are talking about in the distinction between fraud and overservicing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will stamp out all medical fraud and reduce overservicing. This will be done by a process which includes advising and counselling doctors about overservicing practices. We are not going to come in heavy-handedly and say, `You have done this. Out!' We will counsel and advise them and try to reduce the level of overservicing by using the tribunals which consist of doctors. We will not put up with fraud. I make it perfectly clear that doctors caught using fraudulent practices will bear the brunt of the law, and I speak for the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and the government. Fraudulent exercises will not be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank everyone for participating in the debate. I am glad that this legislation is supported by all sides. I believe that it will not only help to stamp out medical fraud; it will also ensure that we protect the civil liberties of doctors and the records of patients. It has taken some time to get this together by way of a parliamentary inquiry and all the other processes. I think we have reached an excellent position with the legislation and I look forward to its sensitive implementation by the HIC. There will be a big saving for the people of Australia who will benefit most from this legislation. It will further strengthen the Medicare system, which we, on this side of the House, are very proud of. We believe that it is one of the basic precepts of social justice in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992, the Quarantine Act 1908, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949 and the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will extend the sunset provision in the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988 from 30 June 1994 to 30 June 1996. This is a contingency measure in the event that the states do not pass legislation for the agricultural and veterinary chemicals code to commence in their jurisdiction on 1 July 1994. The 1988 act is repealed upon commencement of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1994, which was passed by parliament on 1 March 1994 as part of a package of agricultural and veterinary chemicals legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within this bill there are three amendments to the Quarantine Act 1908. Two of these amendments provide legislative support for practices developed to enable the resources of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, AQIS, to be directed towards higher risk imports and the third gives effect to certain recommendations of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of the three amendments of the Quarantine Act 1908 build on the successful partnership between industry and government in quarantine protection. They underpin arrangements entered into between AQIS and imported goods handlers, such as customs agents, freight forwarders, some importers of goods and those contracted to handle ships waste, to ensure an appropriate degree of quarantine surveillance is maintained over imported cargo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electronic entry and clearance of cargo for quarantine purposes is progressively being implemented at major ports around Australia. AQIS, customs and industry have worked together closely to develop and implement a system that provides necessary quarantine security but at minimal cost to industry. This bill, by inserting in the Quarantine Act 1908 provisions to permit the electronic entry of goods for quarantine purposes and the processing, recording and notification of quarantine decisions about those goods, gives legislative backing to the electronic systems being introduced. Existing customs and industry systems are used and no new administrative burdens will be placed on importers nor on the Australian Customs Service. The regulation making powers included in the new provisions are intended to allow the flexibility required to meet technological and organisational developments in industry. To ensure that the system can operate effectively, it has been necessary to require that all imports be notified. Again, existing practices will be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments for electronic processing also clarify the responsibility for compliance with directions given by a quarantine officer in the importation process. A clearance system based on documentation requires compliance where the documentation indicates a possible quarantine risk. The importer, agent or broker seeking quarantine clearance who is given a quarantine direction will be responsible for meeting the direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments also make provision for compliance agreements. These are arrangements effected between the Commonwealth and industry, on an individual basis, permitting industry to undertake certain quarantine procedures. Quarantine security is not jeopardised. AQIS conducts regular audits of operations and is responsible for final quarantine clearance of goods, and severe penalties are imposed for wilful non-compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with debt management practice in the AQIS food inspection programs, this legislation will enable AQIS to withhold services where debts remain outstanding and to charge a penalty fee for late payment. AQIS will also be able to take a deposit or charge a booking fee, or both, for a place at quarantine stations. These measures give legislative effect to relevant recommendations of the 1992 report on the efficiency audit of the quarantine division of AQIS by the Australian National Audit Office. Incorporation of these provisions in the act is an interim measure pending the development, in consultation with industry, of a revised legislative basis for the collection of AQIS fees and charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining amendments included in this bill are of a procedural nature directed to improving the administration of the issues dealt with in those acts. The amendments to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949 will remove gender specific terminology and enable the appointment of an acting commissioner, or acting assistant commissioner, for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority for more than 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Rural Adjustment Act 1992 will be amended to make the annual reporting arrangements for the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, RASAC, more appropriate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to hear that, and I can assure you that on this matter the local governments and we are in perfect accord. I hope that the government has the message that reform is needed. I want to focus on an incident that took place a few years ago which centred on the fact that customers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service often find it very hard to pin down that service when it comes to establishing what prices will be charged for services delivered. When it comes to quarantine procedures this can be a real problem because they, believe it or not, can last for periods of up to 10 years and costs can blow out. One thing that needs to be clearly established is that people entering into arrangements with AQIS, or quarantine services, need to make sure that they have a very clear contractual understanding of what is likely to be involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few years ago we had a case of the Commonwealth encouraging goat owners to import goats and to use AQIS's services by placing them in quarantine. I suppose the idea was that AQIS had something to do and the goat owners were able to improve the genetic quality of their herds. This saga began in 1984 when the Department of Health, as it was in those days, ran the quarantine services and sought expressions of interest from people wishing to import goats from North America. The original price for quarantine services was quoted as $50 per goat per year with a quarantine period of five years&mdash;that, by my maths, is about $250 per goat. Later the same year at an importers seminar in Adelaide importers were asked if they would accept a fee increase to $75 per goat per year and this, for reasons which escape me, was agreed to. In September 1986 the fee was increased from $75 per head to $311, and the importers were pretty excited to learn about this&mdash;they read about it in a newspaper!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It was some three months in fact before the importers were advised in writing that the price had gone from the original $50 to $75 through to $311 per head. Unbelievably, in October 1987 the fee went up to $340 per head. The following year it went to $360 per head, and lo and behold it continued to rise with the CPI. This is an example, if you like, of the cost-plus culture gone wrong in a big way. It reflected the changes being made as the government moved towards 100 per cent cost recovery without any acceptable accountability, without any acceptable commitment to the concepts that would ensure that efficiencies germane to allowing private industry to be fully competitive&mdash;and to enjoy the cost effective services&mdash;would be duly allowed for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eventual cost blew out to $410 per goat, and instead of the quarantine period being five years it eventually became eight years. They became very, very expensive goats, I have to say. The problem was exacerbated because goats, like rabbits, breed. So the goats ended up costing a lot more per goat, there were a lot more goats and there were more years than originally estimated, which resulted in bills that the importers just could not pay. The whole thing got quite out of hand. In 1991 the government threatened to sell some of the goats to pay the bills. But the coalition combined with the Democrats to stop this and the government was finally forced to accept the compromise, and the goats, to the enormous relief of all involved, were released. The coalition does not sanction people not paying their bills; neither does it believe that they ought to be put into a position where they have no control whatsoever over the sorts of costs that might be imposed upon them and the sorts of bills that might be dropped on their desks at the end of what ought to have been a gentleman's agreement as to the eventual outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is against that background that I reiterate my earlier warning: people bringing animals, plant material or whatever into this country who wish to take advantage of AQIS's services ought to ensure that they know what it is up to; they ought to seek a written contract with a decent degree of understanding built into it. It is understandable that circumstances sometimes change and in the very difficult area of quarantine services it may be that from time to time extra services, facilities or time constraints come into play. Nonetheless, AQIS will these days agree to contractual arrangements, and importers ought to ensure that they avail themselves of those opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the legislation before us there is one very good feature of the amendments being proposed: there will now be a facility for the Commonwealth to enter into agreements with private companies or contractors as well as those government bodies mentioned by the parliamentary secretary in her address tonight which can undertake, or will be able to undertake, quarantine functions on behalf of the Commonwealth in the future. This agreement should allow for the maximisation of efficiencies, competition and the lowering of cost outcomes as far as possible for users of the services provided by AQIS. The amendments should also allow for quarantine stations to take booking fees and deposits for services in the future, which we also see as a very welcome development. This action seems sensible in that, if quarantine stations are to be run on a businesslike basis, they must be able to forward plan and must be able to ensure that they have sufficient work on an ongoing basis to keep them open, because it is important that those services be there. The times have changed. It is not goats that people are trying to import today; it is ostriches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be room for AQIS to charge late payment fees&mdash;that is entirely fair enough&mdash;or to withhold quarantine services until fees and any deposits as undertaken by people using those services have been paid. The coalition, importantly, does not object to any of these amendments. All we ask is that the ground rules be clear and that the government continue to insist that efficiencies are maximised, inefficiencies are progressively eliminated and more efficient services are offered on a more cost competitive basis in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the parliamentary secretary mentioned, amendments to this act also legalise the electronic processing of imports for quarantine purposes and provide that notice be given of imports. That is moving us into the 20th century. Many of these amendments were recommended by Auditor-General's report No. 35 of 1991-92 on quarantine fees and charges and we welcome those recommendations being picked up. </PARA>

They have been touched on in this House before and I do not want to take up members' time, given that we have the opportunity to get away a little earlier than we had been led to believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949, which I suspect the shadow minister for resources and energy, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who is at the table, will be touching on in some detail and with great competence in a short time, remove gender specific terminology. This is very important. There was a lot of speculation in the House earlier about whether a certain minister on the other side could bring herself to utter the term `ombudsman'. We were working on `ombudsperson', but we did not get it. This amendment will remove gender specific terminology and will enable the appointment of an acting commissioner or acting assistant commissioner of the Hydro-electric Authority for a period longer than 12 months should that be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finally come to the question of the rural adjustment scheme. The Rural Adjustment Act 1992 is amended to make the annual reporting arrangements for the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, RASAC, more appropriate and streamlined. The government's new amendment to ensure that creditors cannot get their hands on re-establishment grants paid to bankrupt farmers is something I touch on briefly here. The government has&mdash;under some pressure, I might add, from the coalition&mdash;been forced to make those amendments so that those who have been forced to leave their farms do not find themselves in a situation of having their goods, houses or whatever seized by creditors. That action by the government is supported by the coalition. We hope that that has been locked in place and that it will work as the minister has assured us it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst on the rural adjustment scheme, I say that the government needs to be aware that many farmers across this country are still hurting very badly and that the assistance scheme, which for many is the only remaining safety net, is still, frankly, letting too many through without assistance. I am particularly concerned that the government is removing the exceptional circumstances provisions for wool growers. The exceptional circumstances assistance amounted to interest rate subsidies of up to 100 per cent which have been available over the last 12 months in recognition of the extreme plight of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At one stage it was estimated that 90 per cent of the nation's wool growers were technically non-viable. That was an appalling situation and for three years wool growers were toting up average losses estimated to be around $30,000 to $35,000 per year. Yet we find that at the first whiff of recovery the government has knocked off the exceptional circumstances provisions, which, as I say, offered the only real hope for growers who are in the long term, in my view, by and large viable. The only hope of making it for some of them was the continuation of the exceptional circumstances funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government seems in part to claim that that funding was no longer needed because the industry is in recovery mode. I point out that there are enormous accumulated losses out there. Although the market indicators hit a very welcome 628c or so in recent days, we need to remember that wool is many different products and many wool growers do not grow the finer wools, which is the area where the strongest recovery has occurred. Therefore they are still experiencing extraordinary difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, in the western divisions of New South Wales and the western districts of Queensland in particular, many wool growers really have no option but to grow wool. That is all they can grow. On top of disastrous wool prices, they have suffered drought in some instances for up to three years. Tragically, despite reasonable falls of rain in some parts of the continent over the last 24 hours, many are now facing the re-emergence of another disastrously dry winter, another winter when they will not be able to enjoy anything like a reasonable clip. They will be facing tragedies as severe in some cases as simply not having the feed to keep their livestock going on. Many of them cannot afford to feed any more. I really think this whole area needs very significant review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason the government seems to feel it was appropriate to knock off the exceptional circumstances funding is that it claimed the money was not taken up. Of the original $37 million made available last year, some $10 million or $13 million will not be taken up. The government seems to think this is evidence that it is no longer needed. The only reason that money was not taken up is that the eligibility criteria were too narrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before wool growers became eligible for exceptional circumstances assistance, they had to be able to establish that they had been dependent on wool for 65 per cent of their income on average over the previous three years. Many wool growers found that their wool income was so disastrously low that they had perhaps sold off all of their sheep. That in itself may have created a distortion. They had sold sheep and that income was then not classified as wool income. Or perhaps the wife had to go out and work in a school teaching situation to bring in a little bit of money and that income became greater than 35 per cent of the family's income for a couple of those years and again distorted the figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have letters from wool growers in desperate plight who have been ruled out because they could demonstrate that they were perhaps 64 3/4 per cent dependent on wool income and were therefore ineligible for this assistance. I just think that is absurdly narrow. I think it knocks out growers who desperately need assistance, who would have made it and who could still make it with some assistance. Worse than that, it devastates the communities that are dependent upon those wool growers. There are many country towns still dependent upon the wool industry, in terms of both their social and economic fabric, for their well-being, indeed for their very survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I register my very deep concern about the way in which the government has handled assistance to the rural sector. It is undoubtedly true that the sector has had difficult times in recent years. As a result of that it has been easy for the pundits to look at rural industry and say that it is not making the contribution that it once did to our economy, in terms of its percentage contribution either to GDP or to export income. Yet the fact remains that, despite disastrous years and disastrous prices, around a third of our total exports are still rural in origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 450,000 Australians are still basically dependent on rural industries for their occupations, and Australia's biggest manufacturing sector is the processed food sector, a sector which obviously is well placed in terms of the available supply of quality, reasonably priced, clean agricultural products from our farms to spearhead a real capitalisation of the market opportunities that lie to the north and in the Pacific regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it will be a great tragedy if we underestimate the importance of the need to make sure that that actually happens. That will involve making sure that the rural sector does fully bounce back now. It will involve ensuring that costs are kept to a minimum. It will involve industrial relations and transport reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was horrified to read a few days ago in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Times</EMPHASIS> a review on food processing in this country which warned us that, if we are not careful, we will find ourselves importing processed foodstuffs from Asia rather than exporting them, because we are still not competitive. Our taxation regimes still discriminate stupidly&mdash;that is the only word I can use&mdash;against exports. Our industrial relations policies still place us at a disadvantage vis-a-vis Asian competitors in the food processing industries. It is not a question of Asian style wage levels. Asia's levels are rising very quickly. In many places in Asia they are now higher than ours. It is a question of combining our good fortune in the area of natural resources with the way we do things in our workplaces, with the flexibility in our workplaces and those sorts of things to ensure that we are able to capitalise on the opportunities that lie there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a range of issues. I come back to the immediate one at hand: the government's short-sightedness where rural assistance is concerned. In the longer term, in my view we need to move away from a reliance on rural assistance schemes and instead to put the farmers back in a position where they are obliged to, and have the incentive and capacity to, provide for themselves more sufficiently in downturns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the interest rate and inflation regimes&mdash;the faults of government&mdash;and the impact of years of drought and low commodity prices, the twin bedevilling problems that are not the fault of governments but that have blighted the rural sector in recent years, we have no option but to insist on short-term assistance for the nation's farmers in the hardest hit areas and industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the interests of the farmers, the communities that they live in and the broader nation that we ensure that as many farmers as possible survive and recover as quickly as possible in order to fully contribute to the economic and social recovery to which this nation so desperately looks in the future. On that note I conclude by saying that we welcome some of these amendments, and even those that we think are unnecessary or are not particularly important we will not oppose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I compliment the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) on his very entertaining speech, especially the part relating to the goat saga. The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus bill to amend various acts administered by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. There is no essential theme but a variety of amendments. I take this opportunity to address these and subsidiary matters dealing with primary industries and energy in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is one of the most vital groups in Australia. Our continent is substantially free of a great many diseases of animals and plants because of our historical insistence on high levels of quarantine. This amendment seeks to alter the act, first passed in 1908, which relates to the payment of fees for quarantine services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that some people with a sound knowledge of the debt management scheme of the quarantine system have been misusing the scheme by avoiding payment until just before their next use of the services of the system. This is unacceptable commercial behaviour, and the Auditor-General's report was right to criticise it. A further problem was some clients making multiple reservations for imported animals at more than one quarantine station. Obviously this sort of sharp practice is not helpful to the orderly and efficient running of that vital service. In the face of these acts, the quarantine service could not withhold its services. With this amendment bill, the quarantine services will be empowered to withhold services until payment and have the ability to use monetary penalties as an encouragement to proper commercial practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also expands ministerial determination and discretion with respect to quarantine service fees. This is a good idea. In general, I am in favour of the powers of ministerial discretion being expanded. The Westminster system is one of ministerial government, departmental administration and parliamentary accountability. This is not a bad system and, as long as the department engages in administration and not government, we will do well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill helps strengthen ministerial government, and that is good. It further expands compliance agreements. The government recognises that some quarantine procedures can be performed reasonably by industry, and this will enable the resources of the quarantine service to be concentrated in higher risk areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New section 66B, dealing with compliance agreements, will be inserted into the 1908 Quarantine Act by clause 7. The effect of the proposed subsection 66B(1) is to allow the Commonwealth to enter into an agreement&mdash;a compliance agreement&mdash;with another person for the carrying out by that person of certain quarantine functions in respect of certain goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compliance agreements may contain provisions for the cancellation or the suspension of an agreement. The regulations may require a compliance agreement to provide for  the security as a bond to ensure the proper observance of the agreement. It will be an offence, punishable by a maximum penalty of 500 penalty units&mdash;currently $50,000&mdash;or 10 years imprisonment, or both, for the non-Commonwealth party to a compliance agreement to intentionally or recklessly fail to ensure that any requirements imposed on it are properly adhered to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to see that the government is aware of, and active on, matters dealing with our rural industries. Although I represent an inner western Sydney electorate, I am conscious of the situation of rural farm families and their prospects. However greatly we advance in our export drive and our development of elaborately transformed manufactures, we still have to eat and have to wear clothing. These things come from farms and the work of farming families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity, while speaking on the primary industries bill, to call at least for a better deal for our farmers. I know that much has been done over the years, and I also know that much more needs still to be done. As quarantine deals with animals, and animals are found on farms, I would like to make a short point central to the concern of farmers in this debate on a primary industries bill. The National Farmers Federation has called on the federal government to extend the special investment allowance past the 30 June 1994 cut-off date to allow farmers to take advantage of it. It is vital that Australian agriculture be given the opportunity to invest in new capital equipment after several years of negative incomes when new equipment purchases were markedly down. There are 30,000 grain farmers. In 1985 about 1,000 combine harvesters were sold. In 1993-94 the figure will be 400 to 450. I urge this government to act to extend the investment allowance and to help farmers avoid running down their capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill will also provide legislative support for the electronic entry, processing and clearance of goods imported into Australia. This is a modernisation of the fundamental duty of citizens to notify the authorities of the importation of goods. In practice these provisions allow for the continuation of existing information, access and processing arrangements between the quarantine service, the customs service and industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, in the future new developments in technology can be accommodated through the regulations making power. This legislative authority for electronic initiatives is a further step in redirecting the inspection resources of the quarantine service away from routine activities where alternative procedures are satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment bill deals with an important anomaly and improves the situation of farmers in a particular instance. The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill contains a technical amendment relating to rural bankruptcies. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act of 1994 amended the Bankruptcy Act 1966 to ensure that recipients of rural adjustment scheme payments are able to retain those payments or property purchased with those payments where the payment is received after 28 April 1994 and where the bankruptcy action is initiated after that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some farmers are eligible for and receive the rural adjustment scheme payment, notwithstanding the fact that they have become bankrupt before making an application or are even receiving the rural adjustment scheme payment. The amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 by the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 would not be effective to enable a farmer who became bankrupt before 28 April 1994 to retain a grant made after that date. The proposed amendment to the application provision of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 will ensure that, where a bankrupt farmer applies for and receives a rural adjustment scheme grant, he or she will be able to keep the grant or any property acquired with it irrespective of whether the bankruptcy occurred before or after 28 April 1994. This amendment is very welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farms are not just businesses. Life in rural Australia is especially hard. Bankruptcies are a blow to rural communities, many of which are poorly populated and, thus, poorly serviced. This amendment goes some way towards preventing, in some cases, absolute destitution amongst farmers, who are often put into bankruptcy through no real fault of their own. The amendments contained in this bill help to modernise and humanise the administration of our society. They are small but useful steps. I am happy to commend them to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having the privilege, as I do, to be the spokesman on behalf of the Liberal and National parties on resources and energy, I am delighted to be able to speak this evening on the legislation before the House and, more particularly, the amendments to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you and all members will appreciate, the harnessing of a great natural resource&mdash;namely, water&mdash;by that project has been a historical achievement which still gives Australians great pride today. Similarly, it is worth saying that land, like water, is one of the community's fundamental resources. How land is used determines whether it gains or decreases in value. It must be the goal of every government to use land for the maximum national interest and to seek to increase its value.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the alternative uses for a piece of land are rarely mutually exclusive, there is the clear potential for much of Australia's landmass to provide a number of distinct benefits. The coalition parties remain committed to the policy of multiple land use. We believe, on any sensible evaluation, that this allows the maximum benefit to be obtained from an area of land. For instance, locking up a piece of land solely because of environmental values may preclude considerable income in terms of tourism or mining. Yet it may well be possible to encourage responsible tourism and extract valuable minerals while preserving the environmental significance of the site. In this way, the benefits from a sensitive area are considerably increased at little or no cost to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is the aim of the Liberal and National parties to ensure that decisions on the use of sensitive areas are made on the basis of the best information available. That is what is so disturbing about the report of the commission of inquiry on Shoalwater Bay which was handed down on 1 June last. The principal recommendation contained in that report against any exploration means that decision makers and the community at large continue in ignorance as to the mineral deposits located there. So the first priority in making a balanced decision in the national interest is gathering information. In this case, the report recommends that exploration be ruled out even though this could be arranged to cause negligible or no damage to the existing environmental values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be instances where exploration cannot occur without threat to significant environmental or heritage areas. In such cases, it is appropriate that exploration be refused. However, they are few and far between. This report has not demonstrated that Shoalwater Bay is such an example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The argument that mining is unlikely to be approved and that, therefore, there is no point in exploring is simplistic and illogical. We must know the scope of the mineral deposits at Shoalwater Bay to be able to make a considered decision on their future. At a time when 30 per cent of Australia is effectively excluded from mineral exploration and nearly 10 per cent of Australians are unemployed, the benefits of mining and harnessing our natural resources, as occurred in the Snowy Mountains hydro-electricity scheme, must be factored into decisions on land use rather than considered only if there is no other objection. These benefits can then be balanced against the need to preserve significant environmental and heritage sites so that a decision can be taken that is truly in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Valuing each of the benefits involved is not simple, although some clear conclusions can be drawn. It is clear that different groups will place different values on the elements that interact in a particular site. Even where a pristine wilderness is involved and may be considered to have an immeasurable benefit in its preservation, it may be possible to allow mining in one small area and hardly reduce the associated value of the wilderness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is then a clear benefit from the income and jobs generated by that mine which must be weighed against the perceived decrease in value of the wilderness. Just because it may be difficult to balance the competing benefits to determine the maximum national interest does not mean that governments should shirk the responsibility to do so. Governments have a clear responsibility to take decisions based on a consideration of the relevant factors and not disregard or ignore information, as this government has done so often. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government provides a perfect example of the consequences of not following a policy of multiple land use based on a decision made in the national interest. The opportunistic decision making that characterised Coronation Hill has no place for a country needing investment to create jobs. International investors around the world took note of that decision, and they have not forgotten it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, Dr Max Richards, the managing director of Aberfoyle Resources, explained it as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has a 20 year history of gradual reduction of land accessible for exploration and mining . . . within the next ten years, 50% of Australia could be off limits to the industry, in the sense that too much risk and cost is attached to it. This surely reduces the country's prospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ore bodies rarely occur in convenient places;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ore bodies and the facilities needed to extract them, occupy a tiny area and the whole mining industry occupies only 0.02% per cent of the total Australian land area;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry has excellent practice in environmental management and rehabilitation and there is little excuse for repetition of sins of the past.</PARA>
<PARA>So multiple land use is an important element of sustainable development, particularly where mining is involved. This is really a very simple concept. If a mine goes ahead, despite environmental considerations and concerns, there are jobs in the region and there is growth in the local economy, income from the mine to pay for environmental studies and measures, money for rehabilitation of the sites, company tax for the government's coffers and profit for the mining company and so on. If mining does not go ahead, there is simply the unrealisable environmental value of the site. It is clear which scenario is more in keeping with the principles of sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is vitally important that the states be partners in decisions on land use and that the views of state governments be sought and respected. These issues are too important to continue as the political football that they have been in the past. The heat must be taken out of the debate. Australia must have stable, long-term regimes which balance the encouragement of mineral exploration with the conservation of heritage and environmental sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must be accountable for its decision making on land use and be seen to take decisions based on all the available information and in the national interest. That is why I am so sorry that the report of the commission of inquiry into Shoalwater Bay failed to really balance the competing interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry did arise out of a political ploy by the Labor government to pacify the environmental lobby at the March 1993 election. By its outright rejection of any possibility of sensible multiple land use, the commission sets the sustainable development debate back several years. The concept of sustainable development should have moved the debate on issues such as Shoalwater Bay much closer to rational and balanced judgments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation against any exploration was entirely predictable, given the political context in which the commission was operating. There is no possibility of ever making sensible decisions in the national interest without exploration data being available. So long as extremists equate exploration with development, governments will be virtually making decisions in the dark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission's findings are a throwback to the Coronation Hill period. The commission, in effect, is saying that we should be afraid of the knowledge that exploration would bring. The absence of due process throughout the commission's hearings will have grave ramifications for the resources sector. I am deeply concerned that this was a report born out of political expediency. It was conducted over a long period&mdash;some 12 months&mdash;and involved great expense for the Clinton Lowland joint venturers. Many of the standard rules of conduct of commissions of inquiry were frequently set aside to pacify extremists. The resources sector is very carefully evaluating the conclusions of the commission of inquiry&mdash;as we are on our side of the House&mdash;before making representations to the government on the basis of balanced, environmentally sound multiple use of the Shoalwater Bay area. </PARA>

The legislation proposes amendments to several acts that are encompassed by this omnibus bill: the Quarantine Act 1908, the Agriculture and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949&mdash;the amendment is basically procedural&mdash;the Rural Adjustment Scheme Act 1992, the Offshore Minerals Act 1994 and the Bankruptcy Act 1966. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to canvass in great detail each and every provision of this bill. The amendments are basically technical and do not involve substantial increases in Commonwealth outlays. They are housekeeping amendments, designed to improve the administrative efficiency of the legislation. But I would like to raise a couple of specific matters that relate to the Quarantine Act 1908, the Rural Adjustment Scheme Act 1992 and the Bankruptcy Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has one of the most efficient and professional quarantine control systems in the world. That is acknowledged not only within this country but internationally as well. Australia is regarded as a clean and a green producer of farm products. We have a burgeoning trade in both fresh farm products and value added food products. Our future exports and our domestic market development depend on our maintaining our position and our reputation as a clean agricultural producer. The word `clean' has various connotations to many people. It can mean produce that is free of polluting chemicals or produce that is free of disease. Our quarantine service has played a major role in protecting our country's great agricultural assets&mdash;land, plant and animals&mdash;from diseases imported from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed to the Quarantine Act authorise agreement between the Commonwealth and other parties for the performance of particular quarantine services. The government is acknowledging that some functions can responsibly be performed by industry players. It sets out measures in the legislation designed to guarantee quarantine security under any agreement that is made between the Commonwealth and other industry players. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures provide for the taking of a security. The bill provides a requirement that a quarantine officer clear the goods, provides for the imposition of additional procedures where circumstances change in this area and provides for penalties. These are reasonable provisions that will release resources within the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service for a greater control of supervision in the more critical and perhaps more troublesome of the quarantine areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments that are being proposed to the Quarantine Act relate to legislative support for the electronic entry, processing and clearance of goods into Australia. These measures are necessary to make sure that this particular service continues to provide the professional and expert function that it provides to the rural sector of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quarantine service has undergone significant restructuring during the lifetime of Labor government since 1983. The measures that are being proposed here are simply aimed at streamlining this important service a little further. They are also aimed at reducing costs to industry users. Great play is made by the opposition of the costs of these sorts of services to the rural sector. It is pleasing to see that we at least have some agreement on the major elements of this legislation as they relate to the reduction of cost to industry users in the rural sector. These aims are undertaken while we attempt to maintain standards within this vital service to Australian agriculture.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So they are logical and reasonable amendments that deserve the support of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill introduces some amendments to the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. These amendments, I understand, are designed to simplify the reporting arrangements under the 1992 Act for the rural adjustment scheme advisory council. The amendments repeal the application of division 3 of part 11 of the Audit Act 1901 to the rural adjustment scheme advisory council. Provision is made to require the chairperson to prepare a report on the council's operations during the year ending 30 June and to submit the report to the minister for primary industries and energy for tabling in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Rural Adjustment Bill 1992 outlined the specific support that would be given by the federal government to rural industries to develop a strong and more competitive farm sector in Australia. The minister at the time recognised the need to balance the structural change that was necessary to ensure the survival of many rural industries with the social justice imperatives of federal Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Rural Adjustment Bill 1992, along with the Farm Household Support Bill of the same year, provided the means for farmers with no future prospects in farming to leave the industry with dignity. For those farmers without future prospects in agriculture, the bill enhanced the farm exit provisions and provided a re-establishment grant of some $45,000 to eligible farmers who leave the sector. That measure is the subject of other amendments that are being proposed in this bill here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the concerns of the Deputy Leader of the National Party for farmers who are still under intense economic pressure within the rural sector. This process of structural adjustment is certainly a continuing one within the Australian economy generally and nowhere is this process more evident than in the rural sector itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I reflect on my own upbringing. As the son of a dairy farmer, I have observed the process of structural change within that industry with more than a degree of interest from the 1960s to 1994. There is probably no better example of the sorts of economic pressures that have been brought to bear on farmers and the structural changes that have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many factors have led to this process of structural change and the massive productivity increases that have occurred in the rural sector over the last 20 years. We have seen the introduction of new technologies in the rural sector on quite a massive scale. That has had implications for employment within the rural sector, but it has also imposed some burdens on farmers as far as maintaining their relative position in the technology stakes, in maintaining their levels of productivity, is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen better plant and stock breeding techniques that have wrought quite revolutionary changes in the rural sector and, once again, massive increases in productivity. The quality of financial management has improved to a considerable degree and there has been a great improvement in the farming techniques that have been applied and also in the accessibility of farmers to market information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers have faced a sea of change and there have been casualties along the way. I recall 1983 when I first stood for the seat of Corangamite, now occupied by Stewart McArthur. During the 1984 campaign I travelled with the Hon. John Kerin, the then minister for agriculture&mdash;he is probably one of the best agriculture ministers this nation has produced at the federal level&mdash;down through western Victoria. There we met with representatives of the farming community and local government. They were really out to lynch us and we had a harrowing couple of hours arguing around the table about the future of the dairy industry. We were at pains to point out to the assembled farmers and local government representatives that they really only had about 10 years to undergo a significant restructuring of their industry and to position themselves for the changes that were to occur in the international marketplace, especially the competition they would inevitably face from New Zealand producers of similar commodities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time it was a message the farmers really did not want to hear. Many in the sector were walking that fine line, facing severe economic pressures, and there was going to be, in the natural course of economic events, a requirement for them to leave the industry. We understood that at the time, we sympathised with that at the time, and we developed a Commonwealth response that had at its core compassion for those who had invested so much in the rural sector and in their farms but for one reason or another were going to be required to leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think history has proved us to be correct. If we look at the situation in the rural industry today, we find that the dairy industry is well positioned with higher than average incomes being earned in that sector relative to others. A degree of stability has been achieved. The restructuring has meant that this industry is positioned now to compete with its international rivals and to capture significant shares of markets in that international marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that backdrop I am very pleased that amendments have been made to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. The amendment being proposed here is a technical amendment and it relates to the application of amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1996 contained in the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act 1994. It is designed to allow a farmer who became bankrupt before 28 April 1994 to retain a grant under the rural adjustment scheme made after that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment will ensure that, where a bankrupt farmer applies for and receives a grant, he or she will be able to keep the grant or the property that has been acquired with it. It is a protection from certain bankruptcy proceedings and is designed to ensure that those who make the decision to exit a rural industry have some chance of resurrecting something from the ashes of that decision. The amendment reflects the compassion that we have for people who have to make that awful economic decision to vacate an industry where they have made not only an economic investment but also a significant personal investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the opposition for the manner in which they have supported the amendments that are being proposed in this legislation. I am sure that in the course of this debate there will be areas of difference between us, especially relating to aspects of the quarantine service and some of the other provisions that are made in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By and large, however, this legislation is necessary. In the main, these are technical and housekeeping amendments that do not involve the Commonwealth in significant outlays and I think they deserve the support of this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always a pleasure to get the opportunity to comment on legislation bills and amending bills with regard to the primary industries and energy portfolio. As the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) said, one cannot speak on a bill such as this without mentioning the vast progress that has been made in the dairy industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As in the electorate of the honourable member for Corio, the dairy industry in my electorate is about to face up to some more challenges between now and the turn of the century. Hopefully the industry, the government, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) and the opposition will be equal to the task of finding a way through the problems that will be faced by the dairy industry with the signing of the GATT agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the House tonight is basically an omnibus bill which will amend several pieces of primary industry legislation, including the Quarantine Act 1908, three agricultural and veterinary chemical acts, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act and the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To me, probably the most important aspect of this bill is that pertaining to the operations of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. Prior to entering this place after the 1993 election, I had a reasonable amount of exposure to the operations of AQIS, more on the inspection service side than on the quarantine service side. I believed that there was an enormous amount of scope for improvement in its operation and the cost-charge basis of its inspection services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the amendments to the Quarantine Act. The Commonwealth's quarantine service has suffered many problems in regard to fee for service. Many of the customers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Services cannot get an accurate picture of how much the quarantine procedures&mdash;which can last up to 10 years&mdash;are likely to cost. In recent years we have had a number of interesting cases. I think the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and the shadow minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) earlier this evening alluded to the quarantine that must be undergone in the case of goats when breeding stock is imported, and the cost of that quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few weeks ago the shadow minister for primary industry was in my electorate. We looked at the traditional industries that use the AQIS service: the fishing industry, the oyster exporting industry, the exporting of fish, and the local abattoirs which operate an export licence, as well as a domestic abattoir. We had a great debate earlier this year with regard to the change in the inspection service charges that AQIS applies to export and domestic abattoirs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most interesting few hours that the shadow minister had with me in my electorate was spent visiting an ostrich farm. We have a number of ostrich breeders outside the city of Port Macquarie. They have faced enormous difficulties in trying to get fresh breeding stock into Australia. The South Africans will not sell ostriches, so our breeders are forced to import them from places like Canada. One breeder whom we visited, Kevin Gleeson, had to lease a jumbo jet and, in a roundabout sort of a fashion, had to get this breeding stock to Cocos Islands, which I think is where the AQIS quarantine station is located. He was not complaining&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Andrew" NAMEID="HE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr Andrew</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do ostriches fly?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SU5">Mr VAILE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The ostriches were not flying; they were inside the 747 which was flying. He had to lease the 747 and have it specially fitted out for carrying the ostriches. About $1 million worth of ostriches died on the trip. Of course, the cost of insuring that stock was prohibitive. Kevin Gleeson has a breeding stock of hundreds and hundreds of ostriches and he is trying to get different bloodlines into Australia. We have not got to the stage where the birds are starting to be slaughtered for their meat, their skins, or their feathers. We are still building up a breeding base across Australia. So it is very important that AQIS show some understanding and give a bit of assistance to the ostrich breeding industry. I kid you not, it is a multi-million dollar industry, and it is growing. It is right there in Port Macquarie. The honourable member for Gwydir was amazed&mdash;he comes from west of the range where it is predominantly beef cattle, sheep and grain&mdash;to see this industry that has been established in Port Macquarie.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kevin Gleeson, the operator of the ostrich breeding facility, was certainly quite happy with the service he received from AQIS in his last exercise of bringing ostriches into Australia from Canada. But he has previously had a devil of a time bringing the ostriches into Australia and the cost of doing so has been rather expensive. The amendments to the Quarantine Act 1908 should be of assistance in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very good feature of the bill before the House is that it allows the Commonwealth to enter into agreements with private companies or contractors which can undertake quarantine functions on behalf of the Commonwealth. This should allow competition and, with work being done outside the Public Service, should result in reduced costs. That is something that has been proven, day in and day out, in a lot of the institutions around Australia that use the Quarantine and Inspection Service, such as the export abattoirs that I was talking about before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through a number of different ownership changes of an export abattoir in my electorate at Wingham, that company has slowly and steadily built up its own quality assurance program to the highest level. People employed in the works can do all the work of the AQIS inspectors. The company is still obliged to employ a certain level of AQIS inspector at a very high charge-out rate. I think it was up in the $70,000 range; it has dropped back a bit since the domestic charges were changed, but it is still too dear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that the people the company employed in its own QA program can do the work. The operators of the company have recently changed hands from Anvic and Toman to the Nippon Meat Packaging Co. That is another story in itself. The local Australian owners could no longer afford to expand the abattoir to continue operating and competing on the international market without a massive injection of capital. That capital could not be produced in Australia. So who owns it now? The Nippon Meat Packaging Co. The positive side is that it has saved 350 jobs in the town of Wingham because the abattoir will remain there. It is one of the few remaining and very viable export abattoirs in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn again to the subject of meat inspectors. There is still an enormous cost which is passed back to the producers, because all those things are deducted before they get their cheque for the livestock that they send to the abattoirs or when they make purchases those costs are passed on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had numerous inquiries into AQIS. The Auditor-General's report No. 35 addressed the quarantine service of AQIS. I know that AQIS is addressing a lot of these problems, but we have to keep pushing further down that path because enormous efficiency gains can be had in that meat processing industry. We certainly have to pursue them, because it is terribly important if the industry is to remain world competitive to get those gains. We can make gains in other areas with mechanisation. That is happening in the meat processing industry by the private sector, but we must do this side of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the coin, if we talk to the export meat processors, they will acknowledge the need to have a Commonwealth inspection service of some sort. They acknowledge a need for Commonwealth inspectors on the plant, because they need to have that imprimatur on Commonwealth products going out of Australia. We need to streamline the cost of that service. I know there is a debate on whether to charge out that cost at 100 per cent or whether, as a community service obligation, it should be partially funded, or whether there should be some sort of cross-subsidisation from other sectors. That debate is healthy, but the situation can be improved for the cost of meat inspection services being passed back to producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of this bill addresses the rural adjustment act and  the rural adjustment scheme. So many of our farmers have had to leave their farms in Australia because of financial and climatic circumstances&mdash;quite often circumstances not of their own making. We can do something about these levies and inspection charges on products going through the processing section of their industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning back to the bill, the amendments concerning the Quarantine Act will allow quarantine stations to take booking fees and deposits for services. That seems sensible in that, if these places are to be run on a businesslike basis, they must be able to forward plan to keep the quarantine station in work. There will be room for AQIS to charge for late payment of fees or to withhold quarantine services until fees and deposits have been paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not object to any of these amendments. All we ask is that the ground rules are made quite clear. Another message that came from Kevin Gleeson, the ostrich breeder in Port Macquarie, was that, provided they know up-front what they are up against when bringing new bloodlines into Australia and what hoops and procedures they will have to go through, he is not concerned. As long as they know that they can budget and allocate time for it, they can start the process at the other end as far as the country of origin is concerned at the right time of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not object to any of these things. All we ask is that the ground rules are made clear to the people in Australia who will be using the service. Amendments to this act also legalise the electronic processing of imports for quarantine purposes and provide that notice be given of imports. Many of these amendments were recommended in the Auditor-General's report No. 35 of 1991-92 on quarantine fees and charges. Three particular recommendations in that report have resulted in the amending bill that is before the House tonight. One was recommendation No. 53, which read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO recommends that AQIS<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">be given the discretion in the new quarantine bill to withhold services in relation to quarantine items for non-payment of fees.</PARA>
<PARA>The response from AQIS was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed inclusion of an appropriate power in the Agricultural Quarantine Bill is proposed as part of comprehensive provisions for financial management of quarantine functions. AQIS notes that withholding services in some cases is not practical, for example, aircraft arrivals, overseas containers, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second recommendation this bill is responding to is recommendation No. 55:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS make greater use of monetary penalties to improve its cash flow and encourage the prompt payment of outstanding accounts and give consideration to introducing a policy of providing discounts to clients who settle outstanding debts within a certain time frame.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, they are fairly well accepted commercial practices. The response from AQIS was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA>The second part states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS has some concern with the implicit cross-subsidisation involved in this proposal given the 100 per cent cost recovery basis of all charges. Other clients would need to pay higher charges to meet the cost of the discount. Prepayment of charges is being investigated. There currently exist legislative constraints to the introduction of discounts and prepayment but the principle will be further considered.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that under this legislation a booking fee deposit system is going to be introduced to quarantine stations, ANAO recommendation No. 56. The response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As acknowledged in the report, this recommendation was also made in the report of the review of animal quarantine stations. To implement booking fees, amendment of the quarantine legislation is necessary. This change will be incorporated in drafting instructions for the proposed agricultural quarantine bill.</PARA>
<PARA>So those things are to be implemented. I suppose the Auditor-General is trying to recommend that AQIS get itself onto a far more commercialised footing, which I am sure it is attempting to do. I am a member of the public accounts committee, which has been conducting an inquiry into the commercialisation of GBEs. We have had the opportunity to hear representatives from AQIS give evidence in that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major problems AQIS and a number of other GBEs face is a cultural problem in regard to the change of attitude involved in moving from a departmental or public service mode of operation, with the budgetary constraints and limitations that go with it, to a commercial type operation, with full accrual accounting and cost recovery. The problem AQIS confronted in the commercialisation process was not just restricted to AQIS; it tended to be across the board. I am sure that will be evident in some of the recommendations the public accounts committee will bring down when it reports on that inquiry later in the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Three agricultural and veterinary chemical acts will be amended to extend the time available to the states to pass complementary legislation. The Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act will be amended. The amendments to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949 remove gender-specific terminology from the act. Here we go again. When I was in my office I heard one of the previous speakers&mdash;I think it was the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms  McHugh)&mdash;trying to get around the terminology of `the Ombudsman'. So it probably will not be long before we have an `ombudsperson'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very important rural adjustment scheme contained in the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 is going to be amended to make the annual reporting arrangements for the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council more appropriate. The government's new amendment to ensure that creditors cannot get their hands on re-establishment grants paid to bankrupt farmers who have been forced to leave their farms is supported by the coalition. Many farmers or their spouses have been forced to take part-time jobs or whatever work they can get just to put food on the table. Yet they often still have to pay interest bills amounting to tens of thousands of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1993, almost 13,000 farmers sought interest rate assistance, but about 5,300 of these applications were refused. Farmers are very proud people who do not like asking for help. Therefore, these applications are not made lightly. With such a high rejection rate, is it any wonder that people keep telling the coalition there is no point in applying? It is a wrong attitude to take with people in dire circumstances. This government continues to tell us through its policies that it has a safety net for everybody and that it will not let people lag behind in the slipstream and that, if they do, it will reach back and pick them up. We challenge the government to give a bit more consideration to those people in Australia who have provided Australia with a lot of its wealth in years gone by, such as those in the farming community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most farmers are trying to stay on their farms. But, last year, 811 applications were filed for re-establishment grants. This figure was up on the 634 received in 1992. The final answer is not in giving farmers assistance but in making them profitable. The government's indirect taxes on the rural sector cost around $1 billion per year. A handout of $40 million or $50 million in interest subsidies is small when compared with what the government collects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a happy knack in this country of continually increasing the indirect tax take on the productive sector and the people who are producing the wealth of this country: exporting industries; small business; and the people who have the opportunity and ability to generate employment. We&mdash;I use that word in the collective sense, and refer to the government in particular&mdash;continually ignore that fact and continually increase indirect taxes. They are the easiest people to target because they are the people who are operating, producing profit and income and generating employment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since we are talking about AQIS, I will close by reinforcing the points I made earlier. It is of vital importance, particularly to the beef industry in Australia, that the current situation as far as inspection charges are concerned be reviewed and that the charge that operators pay be more reflective of what the inspectors actually cost on the floor of the abattoirs. We need to pay far more attention to those abattoirs that have a QA program in place which can be used at a far more efficient rate than the AQIS inspectors on the floor who cost $70,000 per year. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have assured the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns), who is at the table, that I do not wish to spend long on my feet. But I want to reinforce the remarks already made by my colleagues the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), particularly as they refer to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. Mr Deputy Speaker Snow, as you would be aware from your experience, I have an interest in the Snowy Mountains scheme, the ultimate result of that scheme and the storage of water as it affects my electorate. I would like an opportunity to also reflect for a moment on that section of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Lyne has indicated, the debate about AQIS, its fee structure and the service it delivers goes on and on. I join my colleagues in expressing my concern about AQIS's fee delivery in the past and acknowledge those areas where AQIS has proved to be much more flexible than its reputation has generally led producers to believe it would be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had an experience in my electorate in the past few weeks with LVS abattoirs at Angaston in the Barossa Valley. LVS had found itself in financial difficulty as a result of what were accumulated inspection fees, particularly export inspection fees, that applied to the abattoir but which had not been paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must in the parliament acknowledge that, while AQIS has a reputation for being ruthless, at this point it proved willing to renegotiate this fee structure on the understanding that a late payment and penalty would be met by the company. I hope that partially as a result of my intervention&mdash;certainly it was the result of some flexibility on AQIS's part&mdash;it was possible for LVS abattoirs to continue in business. Had AQIS stood by the letter of the law, LVS would have been closed simply because it did not have the cash flow to meet its outstanding debts to AQIS. So, in that sense, I acknowledge AQIS's flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say though that the story does not have a particularly happy ending. Having some months ago negotiated this restructured arrangement with AQIS on behalf of LVS Meats, I subsequently discovered that LVS Meats was also behind in the levy collection obligations that it had, both for research and development and for AMLC. At this point I am critical because, without warning and without negotiation, the Attorney-General's office was brought in and LVS Meats was obliged to meet a payment that it clearly could not meet. In the last three weeks it has been bankrupted. As soon as word got out that it was in financial difficulty the tax office indicated that LVS Meats had some outstanding obligations; a local transport operator appeared, and it seemed on the surface that there was very little opportunity for this particular abattoir to be saved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to make this point in the context of this legislation because it is worth noting that the bank was not alarmed about LVS Meats, which had entered into a restructuring program. The bank recognised that it had entered into some new management techniques and that there would be opportunity for it to trade its way out. But such trading opportunity did not exist because, as a result of the actions of the Attorney-General's office, this abattoir is now in a bankrupt state and has been offered for auction. There is a real threat that the 20 or so jobs in the town of Angaston in the Barossa Valley will be lost. So I do not have quite the same gloss to put on this story as the honourable member for Lyne had to offer on the 350 jobs that were saved in the electorate of Lyne.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must, however, recognise that in this instance, as I said, AQIS was flexible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the legislation currently before the House makes some amendments to the Quarantine Act to allow for the late payment of fees in respect of quarantine service; booking fees and deposits for services to be provided at quarantine stations; the withholding of quarantine services until fees and deposits have been paid; the electronic processing of imports for quarantine purposes; the Commonwealth to enter into agreements with other persons for the purpose of carrying out quarantine functions; and notice to be given of imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that some of the capacity to negotiate that I experienced with AQIS is reflected in future with other abattoir stations that may well also find themselves needing to be flexible in order not to be forced to the wall, particularly in light of the government's commitment to regional Australia, to the development of regional Australia and presumably to job creation in regional Australia. There is no doubt that a number of the abattoir facilities around Australia exist, have export licences and have export opportunities largely because of what has been done to reassure those who are our major customers that the meat that is processed at our abattoirs leaves Australia in pristine state, and that in fact pesticide residues will not be a problem because of the inspection services that we offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in that context that I would like to refer to another section of the bill before the House. This section involves the changes proposed to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act. They are proposed as a contingency measure to allow the states to extend from 1994 to 1996 the time they have to put into place complementary state legislation to allow for fee collection and to allow for the evaluation and registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals around Australia. The opposition does not wish to frustrate the government in what has been an effort by the government to accommodate those states that have not been as rapid as they should have been in implementing the complementary legislation that the government sought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I only want to comment that I am one who supports the judicious use of agricultural chemicals and who believes that the nation is the better for the careful use of agricultural chemicals. I would add that the dust storm that swept across much of south and south-eastern Australia about two weeks ago, dramatic though it was and disastrous though it was, would have been much worse 20 years ago when agricultural chemicals were not as widely used and when the opportunity for herbicide application was not as apparent. In fact, had those sorts of weather conditions been experienced 20 years ago we would have had an even more severe dust storm, disastrous though the one two weeks ago was, simply because we would have had more paddocks worked up and less paddocks left in a semi-tilled state, this semi-tilled state being possible because of the careful use of herbicides as part of the agricultural and veterinary chemicals currently available to our farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that note, as I weave the various parts of this act together, the dust storm that took up so much of the west coast of South Australia&mdash;much of which was deposited in the eastern part of South Australia, and some of which I know moved into the eastern states&mdash;was evidence of the sort of dilemma facing farmers, particularly farmers on the west coast of South Australia, as they watched their top soil disappear while they were simply waiting for rain. The House has been told of the disastrous drought that threatened to grip South Australia. That was broken by rains that fell only in the last week, too late I fear for some of our farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth reflecting on the fact that for much of the west coast it will ensure that there will be some sort of feed and some sort of paddock cover. But it will still be very difficult for farmers in the west coast of South Australia and in the Mallee areas of my own electorate to sow the sorts of crops that produce the harvests that keep bankruptcy at bay. The simple fact is that the further one gets inland, particularly in South Australia, the colder it gets and the harder it is to get a late sown crop to the point of harvest, and certainly a harvest of sufficient abundance that allows farmers to be recompensed for the outlay they have made on planting that crop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia already faces a farm debt of some $18 billion. In a recent survey, almost 28 per cent of farmers said that, given a choice, they would choose to cease farming. It is in that context that we need, as we all know, some very effective rural adjustment scheme, and I note the commitment of the government to regionalising the present rural adjustment scheme. I also welcome the commitment covered in this legislation that suggests that farmers that are bankrupt will not be obliged to include as part of their payment to their creditors the money they receive as resettlement money from the rural adjustment scheme. Along with my colleagues, I welcome the changes that the government is proposing to the RAS so that farmers will have the capacity, even though they may be bankrupt, to effectively quarantine&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;their RAS payments as a resettlement payment so that they will not be something that their creditors will automatically have access to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I refer to the changes that are proposed to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority to allow the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to appoint a commissioner or assistant commissioner for an indefinite period, and changes that will ensure that any areas that are gender specific in the act are amended to reflect what is seen as the politically correct thing to do in this day and age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a South Australian, as a member representing a state that has been threatened by drought and just narrowly spared what looked like being a 1994 drought, I am very conscious of the importance of Snowy Mountains water to my state. Not everyone in the parliament would realise that even in good years up to 50 per cent of the water that is used to maintain, not the irrigators along the Murray, but the people who live in the city of Adelaide, is sourced from the River Murray. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I call on the government to look to the whole question of water quality in the Murray as part of what might be a bicentennial project. I know the Prime Minister has indicated an interest in this. There is a desperate need for some Commonwealth intervention to allow the sewage ponds of River Murray towns that are currently located on the river flat and within the flood plain to be relocated to higher ground. A very simple initiative that I would encourage the government to take up as it looks to this whole question of water quality is the question of what is done about the funding of the Albury-Wodonga Freshwater Research Institute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Snow, that you are familiar with this institute given its proximity to your electorate. I would point out to the House that the institute is currently funded as part of a cooperative research centre involving La Trobe University and the ANU. Along with the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), I have been mounting a campaign to allow the Albury-Wodonga Freshwater Institute to establish a sub-laboratory which would be located in about Mildura and would allow further research into blue-green algae control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I encourage the government to look to the uncertain funding that the institute currently faces, to give it a more certain ground for funding, and the opportunity to expand the work it is doing in freshwater research, because the provision of freshwater, particularly to my electors in South Australia, and to all Australians, is of paramount importance. I recognise what has been done in state cooperation and look to having that state cooperation further enhanced. I commend the bill currently before the House. </PARA>

This amendment relates to the position of a person who has already become bankrupt but has not applied for or received a rural adjustment scheme re-establishment grant.

<PARA>This bill contains the amendments that are required to Commonwealth legislation as a result of the arrangements being put in place by the government of the Australian Capital Territory for a separate public service. The ACT government has announced its intention to have arrangements for the new service in place by 1 July 1994. The Commonwealth government has undertaken to have appropriate legislation in place to facilitate the commencement of the service on that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1988 ACT self-government legislation provided, on an interim basis, for the `core' ACT Public Service to be constituted by a branch of the Australian Public Service called the ACT administration. The head of the ACT administration has the powers of a secretary to a department under the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1922. These were intended to be transitional arrangements pending the establishment of a separate public service for the territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) initiated moves to establish a separate public service for the ACT on the basis that it had always been the Commonwealth's intention that the ACT should move, over time, to such an agreement. Funding for an establishment task force was made available to the territory by the Commonwealth to assist in progressing the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consultations between the ACT and the Commonwealth and the ACTU have taken place in accordance with subsection 21(7) of the ACT Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988. The new ACT Public Service will be established by ACT legislation to be passed by the ACT Assembly. Currently, there are two pieces of legislation before the ACT Assembly which deal with the general structure of, and detail associated with, the proposed service. This bill completes the arrangements from the Commonwealth's point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn more specifically to the provisions of the bill. Because of Canberra's unique position as the seat of two Australian governments, the issue of continuing mobility between the two public services is of particular importance to the thousands of Commonwealth employees who have worked to implement self-government and who will be transferred to the new ACT government service. The bill therefore provides for an arrangement where officers of the territory service are able to apply for and compete on merit for non-Senior Executive Service positions in the Australian Public Service which are advertised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</EMPHASIS>. All Senior Executive Service positions are already open to applicants outside the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These mobility arrangements will be reciprocated by the ACT. The arrangements will ensure that permanent staff movements between the services will be through the merit processes of the gaining service. Appointments from the losing service to the gaining service will be subject to the usual rights of appeal or review available in relation to promotions within the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mobility arrangements in the bill also provide for the recognition of periods of probation served in either service. The package of measures will also provide for the recognition of prior service for the purpose of calculating most entitlements. In the case of superannuation, service will be recognised in accordance with the provisions of the relevant superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes provision in relation to the rights of staff under the officers' mobility scheme provided for in part IV of the Public Service Act 1922. This scheme currently provides for the rights of re-entry to the Australian Public Service where staff have left the APS to take up employment in other areas of the Commonwealth. Where staff, before participating in the scheme, held an office which was associated with a function that is now the responsibility of the ACT government, the ACT government will make provision for re-entry or re-appointment to the ACT government service. The bill extinguishes the rights of these people under part IV of the Public Service Act 1922 to return to the Australian Public Service. ACT government employment will remain within the federal industrial relations system as public sector employment under the Industrial Relations Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the spirit of cooperation, the Commonwealth will continue to make many of its services available to the ACT government. The ACT government will have access, on a user pays basis, to, for example, recruitment programs, training and development programs, arrangements for workers compensation, the Merit Protection and Review Agency, the Remuneration Tribunal and the Australian Government Health Service. The bill will make provision in relation to the application of the Privacy Act 1988 in the ACT public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend and modify the Privacy Act in two parts. First, it will make amendments to the act so that the information privacy principles will not have long-term application to the ACT public sector. In acknowledgment of the self-governing status of the ACT, the government recognises that the privacy laws that are to apply in the territory public sector are a matter for the territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the bill will extend, on an interim basis until an ACT enactment provides otherwise, the application of the information privacy principles in the Privacy Act to ACT public sector agencies. This is being done at the request of the ACT government and will ensure that there is no erosion of existing rights ACT residents enjoy under the Privacy Act. The government expresses the hope that the ACT will, when it provides that the interim measures are no longer to apply, consider the enactment of privacy legislation for the ACT of at least an equivalent standard to that currently applying under the Commonwealth act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As further legislative amendments may be identified as the arrangements for the separate service are put in place, a regulation making power has been included to enable the modification of an act in its application to matters arising from, connected with or consequential on the establishment of the new service. This regulation making power mirrors a provision in the earlier legislation providing for self-government for the territory, and a sunset period of two years has been provided for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulation making power will be used to enable amendments that fall within the scope of the legislative scheme agreed by the governments to be made expeditiously. The power will not be used to make any significant alteration to the agreed scheme. This bill is just one element in the arrangements that need to be put in place to facilitate the establishment of the new service. Ongoing consultations between the Commonwealth, the ACT government and the unions will continue in relation to these remaining matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of a separate public service by the ACT government is an important milestone for the ACT and is a logical step following on from the implementation of self-government in the territory. The Commonwealth government notes the ACT government's commitment to the establishment of a cohesive and professional public service for the territory and looks forward to the continuation of the cooperative working arrangements between the two governments. I congratulate all of those people who have been involved in these negotiations. I wish the ACT Government Service well in its journey. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Capital Territory Government Service (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1994 enables the ACT to establish its own public service and amends the ACT Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988, the Public Service Act 1922 and the Privacy Act 1988. The coalition will support the passing of this bill as it stands and at this time. We believe that the formation of a separate ACT public service is an important step by the ACT on the road to total self-government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost 23,000 ACT administration staff will become members of the new ACT Government Service. However, we would like to point out that, although much of the bill's content has merit, we are concerned at the number of issues in the bill which appear to be contentious and not easily resolved. Many of the contentious issues are a result of the Labor Party's well-known inability to keep its promises to the electorate, its inability to work on a Commonwealth-state level, and its inability to negotiate appropriate outcomes with unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I refer to the mobility arrangements between the APS and the ACTGS whereby officers of both services can apply and compete on merit for non-Senior Executive Service positions advertised in the APS gazette. This is consistent with the general coalition philosophy, which supports, firstly, improved performance and the rewarding of effort in the public sector; secondly, the introduction of greater flexibility into the APS by allowing recruitment from a wider base; and, thirdly, officers being encouraged to use opportunities to increase their experiences and abilities by moving between agencies and services. However, we note that this falls far short of what was originally promised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the ACT Chief Minister, Rosemary Follett, promoted the concept of a separate ACT public service, she promised that when a separate service was formed it would not disadvantage ACT public servants in any way. In particular, she promised that there would be full mobility provisions which would allow for unrestricted movement of public servants between the ACT and the Australian public services. This bill clearly does not fulfil this promise. Indeed, the issue continues to be the subject of much dissent between the government and the unions&mdash;so much so that it has been referred to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unions wish to hold up the bill until a determination has been handed down. The coalition sees no merit in this, as the government has agreed that it will make amendments to the bill if they are required. Furthermore, I understand that the Industrial Relations Commission will endeavour to hand down a determination prior to 1 July, when this bill comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I stress the coalition's disappointment at the breach of trust on the part of the Labor government in going back on its much publicised promise to ACT public servants of full mobility provisions when the ACT public service was established. This is yet another issue which will further convince the electorate to vote no to Labor governments in the February ACT election and in the federal election which will follow not long after. The opposition will not oppose the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good to know that the opposition supports the Australian Capital Territory Government Service (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1994. It is an important bill. In fact, it really is the last substantial phase in the movement towards self-government in the ACT. Whilst that was a controversial issue within the territory, it seemed to many people&mdash;and I was one of them&mdash;that, given that we live in a democracy, it was not appropriate for people to have the right to say, `We will not govern ourselves'; we had to accept that responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are advantages for the ACT in self-government which are commonly neglected. One of the most important ones is that it leads to a more coordinated delivery of community services. Before self-government there were about a dozen departments and a dozen ministers involved in some aspect of ACT government in the provision of ACT community services. That was very inefficient. It also meant that at no time was there an attempt to set priorities within the territory as to which of those services should be given attention. Finally, it meant that there was no one person or one group of people responsible for negotiating with the Commonwealth government in the interests of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it is true that the Commonwealth has cut the funding of the ACT, it has done the same with other states and territories. Whilst I do not think that is an appropriate policy, I think we have done probably marginally better than we would have done if there had been no ACT government negotiating on behalf of the people of the ACT. So on balance, with all factors taken into account, I think self-government has been an appropriate step. The purpose of this bill, which is to establish an ACT public service, is just a logical consequence of that. Clearly, no government can have responsibility for its own policies without also having responsibility for its own officers. This bill establishes that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preparation of the bill has taken a long time. There have been extensive negotiations, as the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) and the Special Minister of State (Mr Johns) have said. It is true that those issues are not yet entirely resolved. I regret that the bill has come into the House before these issues have been finally resolved. However, there has been considerable narrowing of the differences over the period of this negotiation. Many of the conflicts have been settled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the outstanding issues will go before the Industrial Relations Commission on Friday. As the honourable member for Ryan mentioned, the minister has said that, if the commission determines that any issues are inconsistent with the bill, then the bill can be amended. I see the minister nodding in agreement with that. That is very reassuring for the people whose interests are being discussed here. The principal question involved relates to mobility; that is, the right to transfer between the two services&mdash;the ACT service and the Commonwealth service. But there are also issues relating to redundancy, sick leave and long service leave. Those issues are still under discussion and are being negotiated with and debated by the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I think the Commonwealth government is doing the right thing by bringing this bill forward now. The ACT government does want to set up the service. It wanted to do so by 1 July. The bill could not have been left any later than this if that were to happen. Given that pressure from the government whose responsibilities are about to be increased, I think the Commonwealth really had to act in the way that the minister has outlined. As far as I can tell, I think there is good faith on the part of the Commonwealth government. I fully expect that these issues will be resolved through either negotiation or arbitration. We are fortunate in Australia to have a system that does allow that kind of fair judicious settlement of industrial conflict. So I congratulate the minister, the public servants who have been negotiating on and preparing this bill and the unions who have been representing their members effectively. I wholeheartedly wish the new ACT public service well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 May 1969 in Santa Cruz, Trinidad, the youngest of seven brothers in a family of 11 children was born to a mother, Pearl, who is now 63 years old and a father, Bunty, who died in 1989. Bunty was an agricultural manager and he looked after his children well. The youngest child, about whom I am talking, is Brian Lara. His father bought him all the necessary cricket equipment. Only a couple of days ago, on the 50th anniversary of D-day, Brian achieved true greatness. I would like to pay tribute to that Trinidadian batsman here tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Playing for Warwickshire against Durham, in 474 minutes off 427 balls he scored 501 not out, which is the highest first-class innings ever. This came only a few weeks after his scoring the highest test innings ever of 375 against the English at Antigua. Brian Lara beat the first-class record of Hanif Mohammed, who scored 499 for Karachi back in the 1958-59 season. That innings took just under 11 hours. Hanif Mohammed, one of four brothers who played test cricket, was run out off the last ball in a mix-up. Incidentally, in a 16 hour 10 minute innings, Hanif scored 337 against the West Indies in a test at Barbados. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the way to that score of 501, Brian Lara beat Don Bradman's 452 not out in a game between New South Wales and Queensland at the SCG in the 1929-30 season. Bradman got to the 450 mark in 414 minutes, which was just over a quarter of an hour quicker than Brian Lara did. It is interesting that all those three batsmen made triple centuries in tests and that all three were short. Brian Lara is only 162 1/2 centimetres tall, or about five foot five. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could say that this last innings was scored on a flat track. In the first innings, Durham declared at 8 for 556. One could say that the runs were scored against less than the best bowling attack. One could also say that Brian Lara was lucky not to be caught in a straightforward catch to the wicket-keeper when he was 18, in a hot chance he gave to mid-on when he was 238 and in a skied chance he gave to backward square leg, where the fieldsman was unsighted, when he was 413. But that only proves that he is human. By any standards it was an innings of breathtaking proportions. Not only was it the highest first-class score ever; Brian Lara scored the most runs in a single day. He scored 390. The previous record of 345 was held by Charlie Macartney when playing for Australia against Nottinghamshire in 1921. In fact, only 19 batsmen in history have scored more than 300 runs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Lara was the first left-hander to score more than 400 runs. He was the first West Indian to score more than 400 runs. He scored the most boundaries by a batsman in that innings. He scored 62 fours and 10 sixes. He made 308 runs just off boundaries alone. Those 72 boundaries exceeded the 68 scored by Percy Perrin for Essex back in 1904. Brian Lara started the day with 111 not out. He scored 174 runs in the morning session and 118 runs between lunch and tea. He slowed down to score only 83 runs in the last session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Lara has scored 1,551 runs in his last eight innings. In seven of those eight innings, he scored centuries. He is the first person ever to do that. He has scored 1,176 runs in his last seven innings in England. Only Bradman had scored 1,000 runs in seven innings in England, and that was back in 1938. It will be interesting to see whether he can match Denis Compton's 18 centuries in a season. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a magnificent feat by any standards. I think the world is just gasping open-mouthed at what Brian Lara has achieved. We look forward very much to the next 10, 15 or 20 years of test cricket before him. I fear for what will happen to the Australian team when it visits the West Indies on its next trip. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly tonight about the problems in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and particularly as they apply to Queensland. Moves have been made within the CSIRO to rationalise its operations due to budgetary constraints. That is well understood. The division of expenditure for research between the primary and secondary sectors has to be considered by this organisation when there is any reduction in research expenditure. No-one would deny that over the years CSIRO has made a very big contribution to both the primary and secondary industries in Australia. At the present moment the reductions in moneys have forced a choice between these two competing areas. As a consequence, the primary sector will be the major loser, and Queensland will probably feel the biggest brunt of the changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSIRO has a number of operations throughout the state. In particular, I refer to its operation at Indooroopilly, which is dedicated to research into rural diseases, tropical diseases and the development of adequate ways of protecting livestock against these diseases. The CSIRO is also very closely associated with the University of Queensland. It works very closely with the university, at its farm at Samford, on new developments. In Queensland, the CSIRO plays a unique role in the primary industry research area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am appalled at the prospective closure of the Indooroopilly branch of the CSIRO. It has some unique features. It has the facility to isolate and quarantine special diseases. Only one other area in Brisbane has the same facility, and that is Sherwood. I hope that those who control the CSIRO will give very serious consideration to maintaining the facility at Indooroopilly. Through its association with the university and the farm, CSIRO makes a very major contribution to the primary industry sector in Queensland. I hope that the management of CSIRO changes its priorities in that respect. </PARA>

The irony of this situation is that I am really only a bystander in this issue. My constituent wrote a letter, of which I have a copy, to the then duty senator for the Labor Party in my electorate&mdash;Senator Richardson, as he then was. The letter is from a local card carrying member of the Labor Party, and she noted her membership number on the letter to Senator Richardson.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* Why make changes to fee setting in Long Day Care in such a way as to force us to become similar to Occasional Care Services, unable to estimate income adequately in our Budget? Schools, Pre-Schools, TAFE colleges and Universities charge day or term fees according to their budget estimates. Doctors charge for at consultation times typically 15 minutes: if the patient is with the doctor for eg. 8 minutes the patient still pays the set fee for the short consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* Why is the Government . . . determined to change the Long Day Care way of setting fees and so threaten viability?</PARA>
<PARA>In closing, Mrs Smith made the comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes are very concerning as Labor Policy seems determined to introduce payment, and therefore Childcare Assistance Claims, on hours used rather than as has been the case since the Programmes inception on a set day fee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the difficulties facing rural and provincial areas of Australia is access to tertiary facilities. I bring to the attention of the House tonight the Tweed Opening Learning Access Centre which operates from Murwillumbah. The centre is part of the Southern Cross University in Lismore. The centre began operating in 1991. It was opened by Senator Mal Colston, as the representative of the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, now the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centre provides support to external students in the region. The coordinator and sole staff member of this particular centre is Mrs Margaret Hayes. The feature I point out to the House with regard to the Tweed Opening Learning Access Centre is the support it provides to people who would not normally have access to higher education facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I attended a celebration dinner for a number of graduates of different universities around Australia. The Opening Learning Access Centre is able to function in such a way that students from the area are able to maintain access to universities and tertiary institutions across Australia. The changes that are occurring within tertiary education are exemplified here. Most people traditionally think that to get access to universities and tertiary education facilities they have to go to a particular university location. Most of these universities are located in cities or very large provincial cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of the changes in communication means that the Tweed Open Learning Access Centre is able to provide support for students studying at various institutions. It has compatible computers&mdash;obviously both IBM and Macintosh&mdash;but it is also, through the Southern Cross University, able to provide tutorial support for students who would normally be faced with quite a long trip to the campus at Lismore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the range of graduates who were at the recent celebration dinner. The good thing about this&mdash;apart from students being linked to a large number of different tertiary institutions&mdash;is that students who previously had to leave a particular city and break links with a particular university can now maintain those links and continue training through the university with which the student is familiar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A prime example of this is that the spouse of a student who started out at a university in Perth was transferred to the north coast. I can understand that would be a good move, but it normally would have meant that the student at the university in Perth would have to stop and start again somewhere else or pick up the threads of his or her education. Through the Tweed Open Learning Access Centre, this person was able to continue the course&mdash;a Bachelor of Nursing degree&mdash;and was able to finish off that course. It would apply to many other different courses a person might be undertaking. In this case, the person was able to graduate with a Bachelor of Nursing degree without having to change institutions and therefore pick up the training that we require of most people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, another facility provided by the centre is that persons are able to access libraries right across Australia through E-mail, and therefore get hold of much more information than would otherwise be available. I pay tribute to the local community. Apart from being funded 50 per cent by the Southern Cross University, the centre is funded 50 per cent by the community. I pay tribute to the local business community and the Tweed Shire Council for the role they play there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centre assisted 1,700 people in 1992. In 1993, it assisted 2,300 people and, to date, there has been a 74 per cent increase on the 1993 figures. I mentioned Margaret Hayes as the manager of the Tweed Open Learning Access Centre. Last but not least, I pay tribute to Mr George Hanna, the chairman of the board of management of the Tweed Open Learning Access Centre, for the fine job, determination and leadership that he has displayed since the centre has been in existence. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, may I congratulate you on your launching of this very interesting innovation in the conduct of parliamentary practice in this country. I know that we will all take heed of the strictures that you have placed upon us in terms of our conduct in this chamber. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill amends the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1990, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990. These acts relate to the provision of superannuation benefits to civilian Commonwealth sector employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purpose of the bill is to make amendments to allow superannuation schemes for Commonwealth civilian employees to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and associated legislation. The bill also makes some technical corrections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government decided that its own superannuation schemes that were at least partly funded should comply with the occupational superannuation requirements in the SIS legislation in the same way as private sector schemes. Commonwealth schemes that are not funded will be required to comply in principle with the major thrust of the controls, such as vesting and preservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among other things, the SIS legislation requires that the rules of a superannuation fund may not allow the trustees of the fund to be directed by another person, nor may any other person exercise discretions unilaterally. In addition, the  rules of the fund should not be able to be amended without the approval of the trustees. All these rules have some exceptions spelled out in the SI(S) Act itself, and some to be provided for by regulations under that act. The main exception relates to directions, discretions et cetera that would affect the employer's contributions to the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the Superannuation Act 1976 provides that the Commissioner for Superannuation and a board of trustees share the responsibility for the administration for the scheme set up by the act, the Commonwealth superannuation scheme or CSS. The bill gives the responsibility for administration of the CSS completely to the board of trustees. All discretionary decisions that were previously made by the commissioner will be made by the board from 1 July 1994. The Minister for Finance also has a role under the 1976 act. Some of the powers exercised by the minister are to be transferred to the board. However, other powers which relate to employer costs under the scheme will remain with the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain other powers were exercisable by the board after consideration of principles issued by the minister. In the case of these powers, the act generally has been amended to incorporate into the legislation any principles that were issued, and any remaining discretion is to be exercised by agreement between the minister and the board. Similar amendments concerning the powers of the minister are to be made to the Superannuation Act 1990. The scheme established under the provisions of that act is already administered by a board of trustees, so no transfer of power from the Commissioner for Superannuation is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that no changes are to be made to the benefit structure or the scheme design of the schemes covered by the acts that are being amended. One of the technical changes being made is to allow certain delegated instruments to operate with retrospective effect and to put the validity of past instruments beyond doubt. These amendments are a response to concerns raised by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. The instruments would enable members to continue membership in circumstances where they may have inadvertently been forced to leave the scheme if there was no retrospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990. This act enables the Minister for Finance to exercise certain discretions to oversight and control superannuation arrangements established by Commonwealth employing authorities other than the Commonwealth itself. Consistent with the SI(S) Act, the existing ministerial discretions would be replaced with provisions preventing Commonwealth employers from establishing and operating superannuation arrangements unless they are able to satisfy certain predetermined requirements. An added feature of these requirements is that they will impose an obligation on employers to report annually to the minister in relation to those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the financial impact of the bill. As none of the changes result in any change to the benefit designed for superannuation schemes involved, there is no financial impact. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the bill to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 was introduced into the House on 9 May after it passed through the Senate on 5 May. It was referred to the Main Committee on 2 June, making it the first of several bills to be referred to this Committee. The bill sets out to ensure the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, CSS, and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, PSS, are compatible with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, known as the SI(S) Act, and with associated legislation. This is a goal which the coalition agrees with, no matter what concerns we may have with the provisions of the SI(S) Act. Therefore, the coalition does not oppose the legislation. The SI(S) Act, which effectively begins operating from 1 July 1994, makes provision for the prudent management of certain superannuation funds and for oversight by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the SI(S) Act aims to ensure that members' moneys are as secure as possible. Although the SI(S) Act allows for certain public sector superannuation schemes to be exempted from it, the government has nevertheless decided that all Commonwealth superannuation schemes with an invested fund will comply with the SI(S) Act. This is the first measure to ensure that Commonwealth schemes comply with the SI(S) Act. Further legislation, such as the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, has been introduced with the stated aim of bringing all Commonwealth superannuation schemes with the SI(S) Act. For the information of the Main Committee and others, this bill will bring the parliamentarians' superannuation scheme within the SI(S) Act. Those without an invested fund will still need to comply with the main requirements of the principal act, such as preservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to ensure that Commonwealth superannuation schemes can continue to be eligible for taxation concessions after 1 July 1994, the governing rules for those schemes, including the legislation, are to be amended. The main thrust of the proposed amendments is to give trustees greater responsibility for and control over the administration of the scheme. This results in the powers of the relevant minister in the role of employer being diminished in some ways and shared with the trustees in other ways. In other instances, discretions previously exercisable by the minister have been replaced by specific provisions in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the SI(S) Act provides exemptions so that employers are able to retain control of decisions, discretions and amendments which affect the cost to the employer of a scheme. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill before us will amend four acts. They are: the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1990, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990. The vast majority of amendments are made to the Superannuation Act 1976, however, which is the act that established the CSS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several amendments are made to this act. They are mostly of a technical nature and include the powers and role of the trustees of the CSS, ensuring that the rules of the CSS enable the payment of certain unclaimed benefits to eligible rollover funds as required by the SI(S) Act; providing for the making of and saving of previously made retrospective regulations and other legislative instruments under certain provisions of the act in order to ensure continuing membership of the scheme in certain circumstances and certain other technical amendments that ensure that references to other legislation are correct and that the CSS complies with the SI(S) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1990 amended the 1976 act as well as other acts as a result of the review of superannuation for Commonwealth employees that led to the introduction of the superannuation scheme provided for by the Superannuation Act 1990. This bill proposes to amend the amending act to correct a technical deficiency in one of its provisions. The Superannuation Act 1990, the 1990 act in brief, provided for the establishment of the PSS under a trust deed and rule. This bill amends the 1990 act in several ways, including changes to the power and role of the trustees that mirror the changes to the CSS, as stated, providing a regulations making power to enable alternations to the 1990 act so that it can easily comply with future amendments to the SI(S) act, its regulations and other regulatory laws and mirror the changes to the CSS so as to provide for the making of and saving of previously made retrospective regulations and other legislative instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act of 1990 allows discretions to be exercised by the Minister for Finance on the oversight and control over the provision by Commonwealth employees of superannuation benefits for their employees outside the CSS and PSS. The amendment to this act enables the Minister for Finance to maintain strategic control of Commonwealth employing authorities superannuation schemes in a manner that is consistent with the SI(S) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under these amendments, Commonwealth employers will not be able to establish and operate superannuation schemes, unless they are able to satisfy certain requirements that are predetermined by the minister. The amendments proposed in this bill do not alter in any way, shape or form, the financial entitlement accruing to members of the CSS and PSS. Overall these amendments benefit the members of the two Commonwealth superannuation schemes, because members will now have access to the superannuation complaints tribunal, with its low cost dispute resolution mechanisms. Fund members will also maintain access to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, giving members a choice of process by which they can seek redress if they feel hard done by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are also reassuring for Commonwealth public servants because their funds will not be protected in the same way as private sector funds are by the provisions of the SIS legislation. This is especially important because invested funds in the CSS and PSS will be subject to the SI(S) Act's prudential standards, which become effective on 1 July this year. Though the SI(S) Act exempted certain public sector schemes from these controls, this legislation brings nearly all Commonwealth public servants under SIS provisions. Many state schemes are apparently unable to comply with the SI(S) Act at this stage, but are expected to be able to do so in the near future, I understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation currently before us is fairly straightforward and does not involve a great deal of contention or controversy. However, some aspects of the CSS and PSS warrant discussion, as well as some more general superannuation issues which relate to the SI(S) Act. As honourable members are aware, no doubt, there are no employer contributions from the Commonwealth to meet future claims upon the CSS, and only very limited contributions to the PSS. On retirement, the employer component of the CSS and most of the PSS comes from consolidated revenue. That means, in effect, that, for the CSS alone, there was an unfunded liability of $33 billion as at 30 June 1992. That was a liability of $1,903 a head for every Australian man, woman and child. For the PSS, the employer contribution is only three per cent of salary. This leaves the remaining 12.4 per cent unfunded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government's potential liability does not end there. In the CSS, employee contributions are invested by Commonwealth Funds Management, CFM, with returns to employees based on investment outcomes. In the PSS though, employee contributions are invested by the CFM, but the return is guaranteed and not limited to investment returns. The Commonwealth thereby has to make up any shortfall that occurs, further exposing consolidated revenue in the future to the need to pay out PSS members on retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fully funded superannuation scheme is arguably the most desirable scheme to have in place. The strongest argument in support of full funding concerns the principle of inter-generational equity. Put simply, it is more equitable that the cost of liabilities currently incurred should be met by the current generation and should not be left to be paid for by future generations. Future generations may not have the capacity to pay the superannuation of their predecessors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This lessening of fiscal responsibilities severely inhibits the ability of future generations to make the necessary decisions on where expenditure would be best allocated. P.P. McGuinness in two columns in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 1 February and 5 February amongst other things said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ageing of the Australian population is a problem that is attracting increasing attention as we look forward to the next century. What has now become quite clear is that the baby boomer generation has created a burden that will blight their children's lives.</PARA>
<PARA>This blight will occur because the children of the baby boomer generation will, according to McGuinness, be left to pay the unfunded superannuation and pensions of their parents, as well as the mounting bills for health and nursing homes. McGuinness, even if somewhat emotive, has mounted a good case for fully funded future public and private sector superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation is also an important component of labour costs, and governments should be recognising these costs and paying for them as they occur. This could have the added bonus of giving governments increased resolve to keep staff numbers under control and inhibit government from engaging in activities for which there is no real benefit to the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fully funded schemes would also have the advantage that governments would need to keep schemes within economic levels. One of the few arguments against the full funding of public sector superannuation is that, while Australia is a net borrower, it does not make sense to borrow further in order to fund public sector superannuation. Although that is a valid point, and there are some others, the reasons for establishing fully funded schemes are more persuasive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, when establishing the PSS in 1990, took the decision to partially fund that particular scheme to avoid a large increase in unfunded liability. So at least the government is aware of the problem. The government, when establishing the PSS, not only made it partially funded; it reduced the level of future entitlements due to fund members. This has been achieved by reducing the new entrant contribution rate&mdash;that is, average employer contribution expressed as a percentage of salary from 22.8 per cent to 15.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is not the only government to reduce the level of its contribution: New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia have all created new public sector superannuation schemes that are partially funded with reduced employer contributions. As of 30 June 1992, Victoria's unfunded superannuation liabilities amounted to $18 billion, which is $4,063 for each and every citizen of the state of Victoria and it is the worst liability of any state fund in the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales's unfunded liability was $13.9 billion, at the same level of employer contribution as Victoria&mdash;that is, 21.5 per cent&mdash;while Western Australia, after Victoria, had the highest per capita liability of $2,694. This is a reflection on the previous Cain and Kirner governments in Victoria that destroyed Victoria's fiscal base, in one of the worst examples of economic vandalism, by employing more public servants from 1982 to 1988 than all the other state governments and the federal government combined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These extra public servants became an impossible fiscal burden to carry, in terms of their wages and on-costs, as well as the added future cost of massive increases in unfunded superannuation liabilities in that state. It is small wonder that, in those circumstances, the Kennett government has been reducing the size of the Victorian Public Service. Both the Commonwealth and the states as at 30 June 1992 had total unfunded superannuation liabilities of $80 billion, with this figure rising to $90 billion when local government is also taken into account. This is an extremely large burden that tomorrow's taxpayers will have to carry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland is the only state that has a fully funded superannuation scheme which, though a modest scheme, is affordable. </PARA>

He should be remembered as the Australian state premier who established Queensland's excellent financial state of affairs, which the current Goss Labor government has inherited. It is time that all government public sector superannuation schemes become fully funded and meet the requirements of the SI(S) Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another superannuation issue that I have spoken about in the past is the operation of the superannuation guarantee charge, which discriminates against many casual, part-time and itinerant workers. The coalition has received many representations from working men and women in Australia who have been affected by the rules current applying to the SGC. These problems were acknowledged by the then Treasurer as long ago as August 1993, when he announced that the government would give high priority to resolving the problems experienced by casual and itinerant workers under the SGC scheme. I see it has surfaced again, and we are getting the same assurances as we had in 1993, but we still have very little to show for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a problem which requires a strong government  response. If the government had addressed the issue in the past two years, or as long as two years ago, lower income earners would now have a rational superannuation system. Sections 27 and 28 of the Superannuation Guarantee  (Administration) Act 1992 are at the heart of the problem that penalises casual, part-time and itinerant workers, and penalises them very severely, indeed. Casual and itinerant workers often work for many employers and change jobs regularly, resulting at the moment in membership of multiple and separate superannuation schemes. Administration fees and exit fees whittle away those funds because they take no account of the available balance. For example, a worker earning $600 per month would receive a superannuation contribution from his or her employer of $18 per month, or an annual benefit of $216. However, there is a contribution tax of 15 per cent that reduces the balance to $184, and there is a further administration charge of $50. The remaining balance is only $134&mdash;$82 is gobbled up by taxes and administration fees. What hope does this hold for a worker who works only a few hours a week or who can get only occasional work?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these schemes, into which contributions are made by the employer, often lie dormant after a casual worker has moved on to another job. These dormant superannuation schemes, if more than $500&mdash;or less than $500, but not withdrawn from the super fund&mdash;will continue to be charged an administration fee of approximately $50 per year or, at best, a dormant account fee of $26. There are also the exit fees when workers decide to rationalise their superannuation holdings. These provisions penalise women disproportionately to men, as women are more likely to work in part-time positions and occupations that are less well paid. I have mentioned several solutions to that problem in the past in the chamber, so I am not going to regurgitate them here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in his budget speech, and as recently as 26 May, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) announced the government will issue a statement before 30 June on superannuation including reference to this problem. Hopefully, Labor will not let down the poorer sections of the work force. They are seeking a fair superannuation system that gives workers the choice and flexibility they have long expected, and have been given reason to hope for. What hope does this hold for workers if they can rely only on what has been given to them so far? And I am talking about casual, part-time and itinerant workers. They are seeking a fair superannuation system and I hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the government will address that, and in an effective way, in the very near future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, could I congratulate you and all the officers and clerks who have assisted you in the preparation of this chamber which we know as the Main Committee room. I look forward to the debates we will be having in here. I think we have already seen this morning the closeness that we have to our colleagues on the other side of the chamber&mdash;or should I refer to it as the committee. The exchange that will obviously happen there and the closeness of the debate will help us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main reason for this committee is to deal with non-controversial legislation. I think the message is that it is often forgotten by many people out there in broader Australia&mdash;and it is an opportunity to say it this morning&mdash;that much of the legislation that actually goes through the parliament is non-controversial and goes through with the support of all members of the parliament. I believe that, as the debate goes on in this chamber, this is going to give us the opportunity to emphasise that more. Overall, the success of this place will be up to each and every one of us as members of parliament&mdash;not so much you, sir&mdash;in the way we contribute to this place. The success that will follow will be how we make our contribution to this place. I think it will be very important. I look forward to making my contribution in this place from time to time and discussing these matters that come before the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, the matter before us today, the first day of operation of this place, is the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. The main purpose of this bill is to enable the Commonwealth superannuation arrangements for civilian employees in the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, the CSS, and the public sector superannuation scheme, the PSS, to comply with revisions of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, the SI(S) Act, and associated legislation which largely come into operation from 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will do this by amending the four acts dealing with superannuation for Commonwealth sector civilian employees. These acts are: the Superannuation Act 1976; the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1990; the Superannuation Act 1990; and the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990. The SI(S) Act takes effect from 1 July this year, and makes provision for the prudent management of certain superannuation funds in particular, to ensure that members' money is as secure as possible. This is understandably a matter of great concern to the public. It will also allow the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to supervise its operations, another very important aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government decided that its own superannuation schemes that were at least partly funded should comply with the occupational superannuation requirements in the SIS legislation in much the same way as private sector schemes. Commonwealth schemes that are not funded will be required to comply, at least in principle, with the major thrust of the controls such as vesting and preservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth superannuation schemes with invested funds will consequently come under the supervision of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, who is responsible for ensuring that superannuation funds comply with provisions for prudent management in the SI(S) Act. The Commonwealth superannuation schemes without invested funds will also comply with the requirements of the SI(S) Act such as preservation and benefits and vesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main provisions of the bill are intended to ensure that the CSS and the PSS comply with the SIS legislation in the following key respects. Subsection 58(1) of the SI(S) Act requires that the trustees should not be subject to direction by any other person except to the extent permitted by subsection 58(2) and the regulations. This will require the removal or limitation of the power of the minister to issue statements of government policy and principles of various matters to be followed by the boards. Paragraphs 4.1, 4.6 and 4.16 actually apply to that. Subsection 59(1) and the SI(S) Act provide that a person other than a trustee must not be in a position to exercise discretion except in certain limited circumstances permitted by subsection 59(2) and the regulations in paragraphs 4.7 and 4.15. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is all about providing adequate control and supervision over money built up by members of superannuation funds. These amendments will mean that the Commonwealth funds will comply with the SIS legislation. This is a very good idea, of course, and to illustrate this I will remind honourable members of the nature and the intent of the SIS legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among other things, it requires that the rules of a superannuation fund not allow trustees to the fund to be directed by another person, and that no other person may exercise discretion in that group. In addition, the rules of the fund should not be able to be amended without the approval of the trustees. As you can imagine, this places a great onus on the trustees to provide the fund members with regular, quality information about the ongoing operation and performance of the fund. The CSS and PSS schemes are examples of funds that are doing this, and the managers of these schemes should be commended for their commitment to adequate protection for their members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main benefit that will flow from these amendments is that they will give trustees greater responsibilities for, and control over, the scheme. This implies, of course, that they will also have higher standards to match regarding prudent supervision of the funds. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is important to note that these proposed amendments do not alter the benefit design of the schemes provided for by the legislation, so there is no net financial impact of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the Commonwealth superannuation funds will not lose any money from this, but they will gain increased protection. Under this legislation, the trustees of both the CSS and the PSS are not subject to any direction from any person except the minister, as provided for under the SI(S) Act. This is reassuring for Commonwealth public servants, as they will know that their funds will now be protected in the same way as the private sector funds are protected under the SI(S) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a debate that has raged for some time now, but there is nothing wrong with that. We are, after all, talking about very large sums of money in these funds. The topic of the adequate supervision of superannuation funds has received a great deal of attention over the last few years. To illustrate the necessity for the changes outlined in the legislation currently before us, I take the opportunity to remind honourable members of what the parliamentary banking inquiry, which I was involved in, said two years ago. The report of the inquiry recommended that `a council of financial supervisors be established to facilitate closer coordination between the supervisors of the financial system'.  Whilst the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill does not propose to set up any such council, the important point in that quote was the necessity for better coordination, and these amendments will help to achieve this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the legislation will place greater standards on trustees. This is a very important part of any superannuation scheme. This was another point that arose from the banking inquiry. In line with the need for the best possible supervision of funds is the control and management of investor's funds. It is essential that the trustees and managers of the funds be accountable to the fund managers. These amendments will ensure that this is the case, as the funds will comply with the SIS legislation, which requires that the trustees report down to the members and, as I said before, must not be directed by another person. It is one thing to have elected trustees of funds to represent members' interests. However, who those trustees authorise as the fund managers is equally important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, the government has made several significant and positive decisions to ensure adequate protection, and this process will continue as superannuation continues its rise into prominence in the savings pool of the future. The following are some of the significant main changes proposed by the bill to each of the acts setting up the CSS and the PSS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, clause 4 declares that the object of the amendments proposed by division 2 of part 2 is to ensure the rules of the CSS are consistent with section 58 of the SI(S) Act. Subsection 58(1) of the SI(S) Act broadly provides that the rules must not permit the trustee of a superannuation entity to be subject to direction by any other person. This general prohibition against directions to trustees is subject to certain exceptions provided in subsection 58(2). In the case of employer sponsored funds, such as the CSS, paragraph 58(2)(e) provides that the employer sponsor&mdash;or an associate of an employer sponsor&mdash;may direct the trustees in certain circumstances prescribed by the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulation 4.03 prescribes the circumstances where an employer sponsor or an associate of an employer sponsor may give a direction to a trustee. Subregulation 4.03(1) provides that such a direction may not be given if the implementation of the direction will result in the fund becoming technically insolvent and if the rights of the members to accrued benefits are adversely affected by the direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subregulation 4.03(2) provides five specific circumstances where a qualifying direction may be given. These relate to the admission of new members, the category of members into which a new member or an existing member may be placed, thus the allowing of a person to become an employer sponsor of the fund, the termination of a fund and the appointment of a trustee to an entity that does not have a trust deed. Division 2 of the bill amends the CSS Act so that the minister may only direct the Commonwealth board of trustees No. 2, the CSS board, in circumstances authorised by section 58 of the SI(S) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsections 27C(6) and (7) of the CSS Act provide for the minister to issue a statement of Commonwealth government policy in relation to performance of the functions of the CSS board. As the issue of such statements may be considered as providing directions to the board, contrary to the provisions of section 58 of the SI(S) Act, these subsections are being repealed by clause 7 of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As all sections currently providing for the issue of principles by the minister are being repealed from 1 July 1994, clauses 14 and 15 amend sections 153AL and 153AS to provide for a delegate of the board or the board itself to make determinations before 1 July 1994 on the basis of principles issued by the minister prior to that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 161 of the CSS Act provides for financial statements issued by the CSS board to be in the form approved by the minister. It also provides that the annual report should contain details of a statement or a policy issued to the CSS board by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 16 of the bill omits these requirements and provides for the form of financial statements to be agreed by the minister and the board. Clause 17 declares that the object of the amendments proposed by division 3 of part 2 is to ensure that the rules of the CSS are consistent with section 59 of the SI(S) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsection 59(1) of the SI(S) Act broadly provides that the rules of a superannuation entity must not permit any person other than the trustee of a superannuation entity to exercise a discretion under the rules except in certain circumstances. Paragraph 59(1)(a) provides that such a discretion could be exercised by a non-trustee if the rules require that trustee to consent to the exercise of the discretion. In addition, paragraph 59(1)(b) provides that, if the entity is an employer-sponsored fund, the discretion which a non-trustee may exercise must relate to the contributions the employer will be required to pay after the exercise of the discretion; or the discretion must relate to the termination of the fund; or the circumstances of the exercise of the discretion are covered by regulations made for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulation 4.04 prescribes the circumstances when a non-trustee may exercise a discretion. Subregulation 4.04(1) provides that such a discretion may not be exercised if it will result in the fund becoming technically insolvent and if the rights of the members to accrue benefits are adversely affected by the exercise of the discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subregulation 4.04(2) provides five specific circumstances when a discretion may be exercised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 3 of the bill amends the CSS Act so that the discretionary powers at present exercised by the commissioner or the minister other than those exempted under section 59 of the SI(S) Act are transferred to the CSS board. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulation 4.05 prescribes the circumstances under which the rules of a superannuation entity may be amended. Subregulation 4.05(1) provides that an amendment may not be made, if it will result in the fund becoming technically insolvent, and if the rights of the members to accrued benefits are adversely affected in consequence of the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subregulation 4.05(2) provides five specific circumstances when an amendment may be made without the consent of the trustee. These relate to: the admission of new members; the category of members into which a new member or an existing member may be placed; the allowing of a person to become an employer-sponsor of the fund; the termination of a fund; and the appointment of a trustee to an entity that does not have a trustee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 3 of the bill attempts to amend the CSS Act so that the rules of the CSS may not be amended without the approval of the board. With regard to investment of funds, section 42 of the CSS Act provides that the CSS Board must consult with the Commissioner for Superannuation regarding moneys that are required to be maintained for the purpose of paying benefits under the CSS Act, in the course of managing the fund. As the board will have responsibility for the payment of benefits under the CSS Act, clause 26 of the bill removes the requirement for consultations with the Commissioner of Superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently, subsection 42(3) of the CSS Act provides that the board may invest the money of the fund through an investment manager or managers. Subsection 42(4) requires the board, until 30 June 1995, to engage only Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd (CFM) as the investment manager, to invest any money of the fund. Section 33 of the PSS Act places similar restrictions on the board of the PSS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the SI(S) Act the trustees are generally responsible for the investment of funds through an investment manager of their choice. This is a discretion vested in the trustees which goes to the essence of prudential management. It may therefore be argued that, as long as the provisions of section 42(4) of the CSS Act and section 33 of the PSS Act require that the trustees of the CSS and the PSS should only engage CFM as investment managers, there is a contravention of section 59 of the SI(S) Act, which provides that the rules of a fund must not allow any person other than the trustee to exercise a discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, scope for the contrary view that parliament made a definite exception to the requirements of section 59 of the SI(S) Act, in the case of the CSS, on the discretion to appoint an investment manager, by not repealing the requirements of subsection 42(4) when it amended subsection 42(1), and that therefore the provisions of section 59 of the SI(S) Act are subject to the provisions of section 42(4) of the CSS Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that view, it may be argued that, as section 42(4) in the CSS Act and section 33 in the PSS Act existed prior to the enactment of the SIS legislation&mdash;which introduced an entirely new legislative framework for the prudential management of the superannuation industry&mdash;any exception to the key provision of section 59 of the SI(S) Act should be found in that act or regulations made thereunder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the CSS and the PSS, the two funds we are speaking about, are to be complying funds, it would be best to remove any doubts about whether the legislative measures to appoint CFM as the investment manager until 30 June 1995 create an exception to the provisions of that particular section, section 59 of the SI(S) Act, either by amendments to the CSS Act and the PSS Act or by regulations under the SI(S) Act relating to section 60. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members undoubtedly are aware, this is an extremely wide ranging bill in the work that it does, and I have by no means covered all the aspects of the legislation and its impact. In the short time left, I reinforce the importance of the bill with respect to supervision of investment by funds managers. While the thrust of this bill is to provide protection for funds, I make some short comments about some possible investment alternatives for the future of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is anticipated that growth in superannuation funds will continue and will in fact accelerate. It has been estimated that by the year 2002 more than $500 billion will be held in superannuation stocks. This huge pool of savings could provide enormous opportunities for Australian industry investment, and there is a good argument that a portion of these funds could be used for industry development. If such a proposal were to be considered, the primary concern would have to be the safety of the members' funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By adequately supervising the investments, and by ensuring that they are spread across different portfolios to minimise the risk, the safety of members' savings should be assured. The changes to trustees' reporting and supervisory requirements brought about by the amendments in this bill would already go some way towards this, in respect of Commonwealth superannuation funds but, of course, further complementary legislation should be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not likely that the superannuation industry will suddenly move in that direction, and I would suggest that perhaps we will need to ensure that superannuation funds are legislated in some way, to encourage them to invest that pool of funds into industry development. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to support the bill before us today. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The size of the chamber reminds me a little of the size of the Victorian Legislative Council whence I came. However, it does not have the gracious adornments of that chamber, nor does it have any gold leaf. Nevertheless, I believe that it will be a very good debating chamber. I am sure that the close proximity of the government and the coalition will lead to some very good debates. I am pleased to be able to speak on a bill that is before the House on this historic day in the Main Committee chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address a few comments to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill. Superannuation has changed quite dramatically in this country over recent years. Those changes have led to much confusion and greater complexity than we have ever seen before. There was a time when individual citizens could negotiate their own superannuation with comparative ease. They were able to understand the implications of what the superannuation requirements were, what their benefits would be after paying into it for an extended period, and what their net benefit would be at the end of that period. Much has changed in the field of superannuation since that time. Change upon change upon change has been wrought on the superannuation industry over that period. It is now such a complex area that very few people in this nation understand how superannuation works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation guarantee charge continues to be a source of concern for many employers. Apart from being an additional impost on the cost of employing every worker, the administrative costs must be added to the already long list of the costs incurred over and above direct worker payments. One of the widespread concerns that I have picked up about the operation of the superannuation guarantee charge is the way in which small balances in superannuation funds can be eroded by administrative costs, particularly for itinerant, casual and seasonal workers, who often see their small balances disappear completely. The problem is also particularly serious for many women workers because of the broken periods they spend in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently had a complaint from a young man in my electorate. He was desirous of working and he had a friend who operated a fruit property in Sunraysia, so he went up there to do some fruit-picking. Obviously, he was paid for that work. The superannuation guarantee charge was deducted from his earnings and was paid into a superannuation fund. I think a sum of a little over $48 was paid into that superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a period of approximately 12 months, this young man discovered to his dismay that the whole of that amount had been swallowed up by administrative charges. This situation is of real concern because that person may take on a number of part-time or itinerant positions and yet all of those small amounts of money would obviously be swallowed up more or less totally by the administrative charges of that fund. So the government has got serious problems with that. I should note that I understand that the Senate has requested that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation take submissions and conduct hearings nationwide on the problems associated with that superannuation guarantee charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other issues related to superannuation was the promise made by the government leading up to the 1993 election. That promise was that superannuation funds would be made available for housing. I am sure that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) would be well aware of the election promise made that people would be able to use their superannuation funds for housing. Of course, the government has now reneged on that. It has disappointed a lot of young people who have paid into superannuation and who could have had access to those funds to provide a deposit on a house. The government has reneged on that promise and it is not going to implement the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then the superannuation for housing report was issued by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. That was in mid-May. The committee took submissions from many interested parties on this issue and the report received unqualified support across Australia. I might add that for the benefit of the honourable member for Moreton. There were many people who were desirous of having those superannuation funds freed up for housing. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation did identify a narrow but certainly a significant band of individuals who would be better off being allowed to use their superannuation money to finance the purchase of a home. There are many ways in which that could have assisted people, particularly young people, to get their first home. Of course, now the government has reneged totally on that promise and those funds will not be available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that is related to that concerns a letter that I received from Mr Roy Wilkinson, who is a constituent of mine in the Bendigo area and who has spent a lifetime in the life assurance industry. His working life has been devoted to that industry. In his letter to me he expressed grave concerns about the direction in which superannuation and life assurance were heading. He believes that the industry is in danger as a result of a whole range of changes made by the government. They are so far-reaching that people simply do not understand the complexities of it all and the pitfalls that may be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He does say that the savings potential of life assurance is one of the major factors that Australia needs in its economic planning and he has expressed his concern at the way the industry is going. He has implored me to put a case that commonsense be put back into the insurance industry and the superannuation industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implementation of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act imposes an additional cost. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who was in the chamber earlier, expressed concerns about the additional costs that would be imposed and the administrative complexity of the superannuation changes that have been made. I can only reiterate them to the honourable member for Moreton, who is the government member present, in the hope that those issues will be taken up. There are also difficulties imposed on public offers of funds too. I think that there are a number of issues that the government needs to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation, as I say, has become more and more complex. People do not understand what is happening now with their superannuation, the extent of the changes varying from one year to another. There have been so many changes over the past three or four years that people are totally confused about the way that the superannuation industry does in fact operate. People who do itinerant work and are moving from job to job are suffering as a result of the administrative charges of the superannuation funds. I think that that is one issue that the government needs to address very quickly. It needs to do something to simplify the processes of the superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major issue which I drew attention to was the use of superannuation money for housing, on which the government has let down the public yet again, making promises in the lead-up to the election, building up people's expectations of being able to use their superannuation funds for housing, only to dash those hopes by reneging on its promise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this very historic day in the life of this parliament, after deliberating on the proposals that led to the establishment of this Main Committee over the past months, we probably take it a little bit for granted, but this first day of operation of this chamber will go down in the annals of history of Australia as quite an historic day. The establishment of the second chamber obviously was supported by both the government and the opposition and it seems, from its operation so far this morning, that it is going to be on occasions a rather more civilised place than the main chamber of the House of Representatives. That is the way it has been designed to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ironically, the first bill that we are debating here today is a bill that deals with amendments to superannuation for Commonwealth parliamentarians. It will be interesting to see what the pundits say in 10 or 20 years time when they are writing about the first day's operation of the Main Committee and the first piece of legislation that comes before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another irony in the first day's operation of this Main Committee is that the Main Committee was established primarily to hasten the flow of legislation through the parliament, particularly the lower House, to get the Senate to speed up the process of government in its part of the legislative process. It is designed to give the opposition a better opportunity to speak, to give more members an opportunity to speak, and therefore to give a greater number of Australians, through their representatives, an opportunity to be heard on different legislation that is being passed through the parliament, by transferring the passage of non-contentious items of legislation from the House of Representatives chamber to this second chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, on this first day of operation of this chamber, in the House of Representatives chamber the guillotine will be enforced all day on different items of legislation that are going through. That is the very mechanism that is at the disposal of the government from time to time the use of which we are trying to overcome by establishing this chamber. So let us hope that in the future it does have the effect of eliminating more often the use of the guillotine on legislation which members of the opposition would like to debate in the main chamber but which today a lot of us are not going to get the opportunity to actually debate. As we iron out the bugs in the establishment of this chamber and we get it running, I expect that it will help to overcome that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must congratulate the staff of the Clerk's office on the work that they have done over the last couple of months in getting this chamber, and all the technicalities that go with it, established. Obviously some finetuning changes will need to be implemented over the course of time to help smooth out the running of this chamber, but I am sure that it is going to work quite well. We recognise that, as one of the reforms undertaken by this government, it probably is going to be quite a positive move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purpose of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill is to amend the three acts which deal with superannuation for Commonwealth parliamentarians. The amendments primarily affect the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948, the amendments to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Act 1981, and the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Act 1983. The proposed amendments to the PCS Act allow the superannuation scheme established under it to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act and associated acts and regulations in relation to vesting and preservation of members' benefits and disclosure of information to members of the scheme. As well, inequities that exist under the current scheme will be corrected. They relate to former members who hold offices of profit, to invalidity retirement and to transfers between the Commonwealth parliament and state and territory parliaments. There will also be minor amendments to spouse benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SIS legislation provides for the prudent management&mdash;`prudent' is a very operative sort of word when we are talking about superannuation of any kind&mdash;of certain superannuation funds, particularly with regard to the security of members' moneys, and for certain minimum standards. Although this act provides the capacity for unfunded public sector superannuation schemes to be exempted from these arrangements, the government has decided that all Commonwealth schemes should comply with the main operative provisions of the SIS legislation, that is, vesting, preservation, and disclosure of information to fund members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of very important aspects. The SIS legislation and the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 require that all employees receive a minimum level of employer sponsored superannuation support. The pension benefits provided under the current scheme to parliamentary retiring allowances, where they are payable to a former member or spouse's annuities where the pension is a revisionary benefit payable to a spouse of a former member, will meet the minimum requirement in all cases. However, the lump sum benefits of persons who do not qualify for a pension will not, in some cases, meet the minimum requirement. This bill will amend the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act to increase the amounts of lump sums so as to ensure that they comply with the minimum requirements of the superannuation guarantee legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no provisions under the present scheme which require benefits to be preserved. The SIS legislation requires that certain lump sum benefits be preserved in a superannuation fund or an approved deposit fund until beneficiaries reach the preservation age, which is currently 55, and retire from the work force, or that they be used to purchase a deferred annuity which cannot be accessed until the preservation age is reached. The pensions paid under the current scheme meet the preservation requirements of the SIS legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are currently no provisions in the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act of 1948 that require disclosure of information to members. This bill proposes to amend the act to require information to be disclosed to members in line with the requirements of the SIS legislation. The Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act currently provides for the reduction of a pension where a beneficiary is a holder of an office of profit. This bill proposes amendments to the act to provide for the decrease in the amount of pension reduction from $1 to 50c for each dollar earned from an office of profit, and to provide a threshold below which earnings from an office of profit cause no reduction of pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PCS Act currently provides for the recognition of periods of service in a state or territory parliament and for the reduction of benefits payable from the present scheme where the beneficiary is a member of a state or territory parliament or is receiving a pension as a result of a such a membership. This bill proposes that the act be amended so that periods of service in a state or territory parliament are recognised in the scheme only to the extent that a transfer value paid from the state or territory scheme to the Commonwealth scheme is used to purchase Commonwealth service. If a transfer value were paid, the state or territory service would be recognised on the payment of a transfer value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed that benefits paid under the act would continue to be reduced where the beneficiary is a member of a state or territory parliament or currently receives a state or territory pension, but would not be reduced where a new beneficiary of the scheme is also in receipt of a state or territory parliamentary pension. Transitional arrangements will apply to ensure that current members are not disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is impossible to quantify the precise financial impact of the changes in this bill because of the limited application of the amendments in the small parliamentary superannuation scheme. However, the restoration or partial restoration of pensions to certain persons who currently hold an office of profit are estimated to cost about $80,000 in a full year. It is expected that in the longer term these additional costs will be more than offset by savings made by the Commonwealth no longer recognising prior state or territory parliamentary service, at no cost to the state or territory. Therefore, any changes in immediate budgetary outlays or change in long-term cost from the measures in the bill are expected to be relatively insignificant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are two contentious matters that need to be looked at. The first relates to the requirement in section 60 of the SI(S) Act that the trustee of the CSS must approve amendments to the rules of that entity. The CSS Act is part of the rules of the CSS, and therefore compliance with the requirements of section 60 will require the board of the CSS to consent to any proposed amendments to the CSS Act. The explanatory memorandum to the bill states that, as any express provision to that effect will be a restriction on parliament's ability to amend its own legislation, no action has been taken to provide for making the consent of the CSS board a condition for amending the CSS Act. This may be construed as creating a further exception to section 60 of the SI(S) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the PSS, the bill introduces a provision that the minister may not amend the trust deed without the consent of the PSS board. Such amendment can only be made by the minister by signed instrument, which is a disallowable instrument. If parliament intends that only the CSS should be exempt from complying with the provisions of section 60 of the SI(S) Act, it should provide for this exception specifically in an amendment to the CSS Act or in regulations under section 60 of the SI(S) Act. A mere statement in the memorandum that it is not proposed to take any action to provide for obtaining the consent of the CSS board to proposed amendments to the CSS Act may not be adequate to exempt the CSS from complying with the provisions of section 60. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second contentious point relates to the lack of discretion in the trustees to change the investment manager should that step be considered necessary by the CSS board, and the PSS board, as is in the CFM legislation, to be the sole investment manager until 30 June 1995. The removal of this key discretion, which is essential for the prudential management of the funds of a superannuation entity, would be contrary to the provisions of section 59 of the SI(S) Act. As the legislative provisions in the CSS Act and the PSS Act existed prior to the enactment of the SIS legislation, which introduced an entirely new legislative regime for the prudential management of the superannuation industry, the view may be taken that any exception to the key provision of section 60 of the SI(S) Act should be found in that act or regulations made thereunder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a fairly pertinent point to wind up on. The key element and the key concern as far as superannuation generally in Australia is concerned is of prudential management. We have seen a number of areas where this has not existed. I suppose it would be fair enough to say that the honourable members speaking on this bill today would expect prudential management to be at a premium and at a very professional level for the Commonwealth scheme. A major concern being expressed by a lot of people right across the industry, particularly in the private sector, is how their funds are being managed, how the superannuation industry is being managed, how it is conducting its business and how it is looking after the funds of its members. I think there needs to be far more attention paid to ongoing changes to legislation and an ongoing review of the system so that we can get far greater accountability, flexibility and transparency within the superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as superannuation is concerned, the government is going in the direction that it ultimately wants to replace the current pension and social security system. It is terribly important to try to get people to provide for their own retirement, which at the moment is quite difficult. The private sector has been experiencing a lot of difficulties with the government legislation that relates to private sector superannuation schemes, particularly through the superannuation guarantee levy and the charge that comes as a result of that. Those difficulties are partially because of the concerns of employers about affording it. Employers are concerned about the implications of the extra costs and the paperwork that they will have to go through. They will have to deal with the taxation office in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers have had the opportunity on a number of occasions since the superannuation guarantee levy came into force in August last year to have representatives from the tax office in Newcastle, in my electorate, to try to explain it. Some employers did not anticipate the possibility of this charge. It was quite awesome to a lot of employers. Therefore, rather than getting caught in what they saw as another lot of bureaucratic and government red tape&mdash;and a further trap&mdash;they did not go ahead and extend their employment. They structured the people that they had employed in such a way that they were able to keep themselves below the superannuation guarantee levy threshold. Therefore, it had a counterproductive outcome in the community and that is something the government needs to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) referring to the possibility of people who have been contributing to superannuation funds having access to those funds for housing, but that did not eventuate. That caused a great deal of concern and heartache within the community. A lot of people were relying on that. It would have saved them getting caught by higher interest rates for housing, because they would have been able to buy a house with funds that they had put aside for themselves. A lot of people do not have access to private sector finance through the banks or anywhere else. However, that did not eventuate and I am sure the government is certainly aware of the upset that has caused in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be interesting to see the result and recommendations from the Senate inquiry that is taking place at the moment. My electorate covers a number of coastal resorts and areas where there is a lot of part-time employment. People work through the holiday periods in tourist resorts and tourist attractions, and their employers pay ridiculously small amounts into the scheme, which are never seen again. That brings us back to the aspect of the accountability and transparency of these funds. This money is only going to get gobbled up by the administration costs of these superannuation schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had numerous representations from employers who have shown me foolscap pages covered with the small amounts that they have contributed on behalf of people who have worked on a part-time basis in their operations. These people will never see that money again. It is not going to help them in their retirement. It is not going to help alleviate any financial impact on future governments: all it is doing is filling the pockets of the superannuation fund managers. I know the government is in the process of addressing this problem but I believe it has been too slow in addressing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the public sector, I was interested to note some of the figures that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) used in his address on this bill in relation to the unfunded liabilities of a couple of our state governments. That must be of great concern to the taxpayers in those states. A key element in budgetary strategies, when I was involved in local government, was to make sure that our employee entitlement reserves were always substantially cash funded. We have seen the diminution over the years of these funds at all levels of government throughout Australia. It must be of great concern where there is a heavy call on some of these state funds. The honourable member for Curtin used the example of the unfunded liability in Victoria, which is about $18 billion, and in New South Wales, where it is $13.9 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come back to the aspect that we have been discussing this morning of the prudential management of these funds. There is a big nest egg there and the temptation is very great for government to use those in a less than prudential manner as far as the fund members are concerned. In days gone by, people would invest in something associated with the government or subscribe to something supervised by the government and there was a reasonable expectation that it would be there the day people wanted to call on it. There was a reasonable expectation that it would be managed properly. Unfortunately, in recent times there has been an element of doubt cast across that aspect for people who contribute to these funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I would urge the government that, in all future considerations with superannuation, both private and public, it focus on that aspect of prudential management because, from here on in, these funds are going to carry enormous amounts of money. Without that sort of accountability there is a real risk of less than professional management, and the only people it will disadvantage will be the members of the funds. </PARA>

<PARA>This bill proposes a number of amendments to improve the operation of the Corporations Law and to facilitate the operations of the Australian Securities Commission, ASC, and the Corporations and Securities Panel, the panel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadowed this legislation last year in introducing the Corporate Law Reform Bill 1993. At that time, and in the debate on that bill earlier this year, I also referred to the major long term process I had established to simplify the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am pleased to report that good progress is being made with simplification, that process will take time. In the meantime, the current law governs the corporate sector and some reforms must continue to keep that law in tune with the rapidly changing commercial environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When deficiencies are revealed, they need to be rectified. When new products, services and structures challenge the boundaries of the law, those boundaries need to be moved. That is why this bill is being brought forward at this time. These amendments cannot wait for their turn in the queue for simplification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is the usual practice in relation to corporate legislation, this bill, or more accurately, most of this bill, was released for public comment in December 1993. The period of public exposure ended on 28 February 1994 and public submissions made during that period have been taken into account in finalising the bill for introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have qualified my comment on the extent of the bill's public exposure as there is one important proposal that was not, in fact, included in the exposure draft of the bill, but which has arisen subsequently and has been included in the bill prior to its introduction. The proposal in question is that to refine the law governing clients' segregated accounts maintained by futures brokers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a second proposal in the bill, as introduced, that did not appear in the exposure draft of the bill&mdash;namely, the proposal to enable trading on stock and future markets of new products which do not fall squarely within the current definitions of `securities' or `futures contract'. However, I wish to inform the Committee that the government will not be proceeding with this proposal at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the definitions of `securities' and `futures contract' were intended to enable trading on stock and futures markets of certain new hybrid products. In particular, they were intended to facilitate the trading of a new product by the Australian Stock Exchange from 1 July 1994. I have now been informed that the exchange will not be ready to trade this product until later in the year. In light of that I consider that it is preferable that the amendments have further exposure. The government will be moving an amendment during debate on the bill to delete those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To facilitate the public exposure process I have asked my department, as a matter of priority, to develop the proposed regulations that would govern the trading of these new products. I consider that this will clarify the situation and provide adequate information for a more detailed consideration of the policy underlying the proposed amendments. I intend, at this stage, to introduce a separate bill containing the amendments following that exposure period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now mention a few of the most important amendments proposed by the bill. One of the most important reforms is the conferral of civil jurisdiction on lower courts&mdash;such as magistrates courts and district courts&mdash;to hear small civil claims arising under the Corporations Law. This proposal has been developed in response to concerns from the business community and the legal profession about court judgments over the last year which have held that civil jurisdiction under the Corporations Law is confined to superior courts, that is,  the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Supreme Court in each state and territory. Concern has been expressed that legitimate civil actions will not be able to be brought under the Corporations Law because of the cost and delay involved in bringing actions before the superior courts. For very small claims, it will often be that the cost of the filing fees alone would prevent the commencement of civil proceedings in a superior court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is committed to the principle that justice should be available to the community at an affordable cost and with the prospect of a speedy resolution. It is for this reason that it has moved to amend the corporations legislation to confer civil jurisdiction on lower courts in regard to those civil actions under the Corporations Law which are in the nature of debt recovery, monetary compensation or minor administrative remedies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislative framework for the national scheme of corporate regulation means that effective jurisdiction can only be conferred on lower courts if complementary amendments are made by state and Northern Territory governments to the corporations acts of the respective jurisdictions. The Ministerial Council for Corporations has already agreed that the necessary amendments should be made as soon as possible and I anticipate that a uniform date can be set for the operation of these amendments in each jurisdiction in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are expected to receive widespread support from the business community, given that they will reduce the cost and delays associated with bringing small civil actions under the Corporations Law. It is important that these reforms be implemented as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also proposes a number of amendments to support the introduction of the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System&mdash;commonly known as `CHESS'&mdash;to be introduced by the Australian Stock Exchange. CHESS will bring the settlement procedures of the Stock Exchange to world best standards. The aim of CHESS is to have transactions settled and delivered within three days after trade and to replace the current paper document of transfer with electronic transfer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic legislative framework for CHESS was established by the Corporate Law Reform Act 1992. Since the passage of that act, and in progressing the CHESS project to its final stages of development, the Stock Exchange has sought a number of additional amendments to the legislative framework. These amendments are basically refinements of the existing legislative scheme. They are essential to the smooth operation of CHESS. They deal with such matters as the cancellation of certificates by brokers; electronic acceptances; off-market transfers before official quotation; and establishment of record dates to determine entitlement to vote and receipt of dividends and other benefits. The Stock Exchange presently envisages that CHESS will commence operation on 1 July this year. In view of this imminent start-up date, it is important that these amendments proceed as a matter or urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important set of amendments proposed by the bill is the provisions dealing with the application of the Corporations Law to non-bank financial institutions, the collective term for such bodies as building societies and credit unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enactment of the uniform financial institutions code by the states and territories in 1992 has highlighted the uneven and inconsistent application of Corporations Law and state and territory legislation to the activities of financial institutions. The resolution of the interface between the Corporations Law and state and territory legislation was a matter left for future consideration at the time the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory entered into the heads of agreement on future corporate regulation in June 1990. This has resulted in doubts and uncertainties for financial institutions as to which law applies to their activities, as well as a degree of regulatory and administrative duplication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, the Ministerial Council for Corporations and the Ministerial Council for Financial Institutions agreed to principles on which the interface between the two bodies of law could be rationalised. A key aspect of this resolution was agreement that the fundraising activities of financial institutions, in their state of incorporation or elsewhere, should be governed by the Corporations Law. This reflects the Commonwealth's policy that there is a significant public benefit in there being a single regulator and uniform regulation of public fundraising in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other areas, such as the duties of officers and charges over the property of financial institutions, the Corporations Law will be displaced by the financial institutions code as that is considered a more appropriate form of regulation for these bodies in those areas. In addition, the registration of financial institutions under the Corporations Law as registrable Australian bodies will no longer be required. These amendments, together with complementary amendments to state and territory financial institutions legislation, will not only reduce regulatory duplication and clarify which law applies to particular areas of activity, but will also promote investor protection and confidence. The certainty that these amendments will bring to this area of the law is also urgently needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Special mention should be made of the proposed amendments to the operations of the Corporations and Securities Panel. The panel was established as a peer review group, a body to examine conduct in takeover matters referred to it for review by the ASC. In particular, it was empowered to make declarations of unacceptable conduct and acquisitions in respect of a takeover and to make orders to remedy such conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The panel's legislative charter was to conduct hearings with as little formality and technicality and with as much expedition as possible. However, the very first matter to come before the panel bogged down in legal argument over its procedures. Following consideration of this case, the government has decided that the panel should be restructured to remove the procedural difficulties that this first case disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the extension of the jurisdiction of the panel to takeover conduct generally, and specifies with greater precision what constitutes procedural fairness for the purpose of the panel's inquiries. Procedural fairness does not require that the panel behave like a court. Likewise, cross-examination of parties and witnesses is not a requirement of procedural fairness. The emphasis will, instead, be on written submissions by parties and strict time limits for submissions. After examining those submissions, the panel will decide whether a conference or oral inquiry is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the panel's deliberations do not generally relate to technical legal matters, rather to matters of market behaviour and market standards, it is more appropriate that the parties rather than their legal advisers address the panel. The legal advisers may, of course, be present to assist but will not be entitled to address the panel. This is the approach that has been successfully adopted in predetermination conferences by the Trade Practices Commission and it should be equally successful here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide for regulations to set out in a comprehensive form the procedures for the conduct of the panel's inquiries. Draft regulations have been released for public comment and the government intends to have the regulations in place at the same time these provisions come into force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also provide for the establishment of retail screen based trading markets for collective investment schemes which are not listed on a stock exchange. The establishment of such retail markets is a significant development in Australia. Investors are currently reliant on the liquidity of scheme assets and the ability of the manager of a collective investment scheme to buy back the investment. The measures proposed by the bill will greatly enhance the liquidity of such investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with stock markets, approved security organisations and exempt stock markets, the establishment of any such market will require the approval of the Attorney-General. Each market will be operated in accordance with business rules, relevant agreements contemplated by those rules, and any conditions which are imposed on special market approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The powers of the ASC to supervise the special markets will be similar to those which it currently exercises in relation to the stock market of a securities exchange. The business rules will also require the appointment of an independent and appropriately qualified person to monitor compliance with the business rules and to report a contravention of those rules to the ASC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now return to the first of the two amendments which, as I have already mentioned, were not included in the public exposure draft of the bill: that is the proposal to refine the law governing clients' segregated accounts. The segregation of client moneys from that of brokers is a fundamental investor protection rule of the futures industry. Thus, the Corporations Law requires that a broker maintain a client segregated account into which client funds are placed, and permits the withdrawal of funds from that account only in certain circumstances. Funds held in this way are immune from claims by creditors of the broker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, changes to the way the futures industry operates have highlighted the need for some refinement of the detail of the law governing such accounts, so that it keeps abreast of developments in the industry. In particular, the bill recognises that in a futures transaction involving a chain of intermediaries, moneys can be identified as client moneys and continue to be treated as such. The result will be that client moneys involved in such transactions will enjoy the full protection afforded by the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among other reforms proposed by the bill are the introduction of a modified regime for the notification of persons affected by ASC decisions of their rights of review under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act of 1975; the introduction into the Corporations Law and the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 of the penalty unit system for the prescription of penalties; and the transfer of unclaimed money functions of the Attorney-General under the Corporations Law to the ASC. A complete list of the reforms proposed by the bill is set out at the start of the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on government or business, as the majority of the proposed amendments clarify existing provisions of the Corporations Law and will not result in additional costs. The explanatory memorandum details the extent of the potential impact on business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I return briefly to the simplification program. It is now seven months since the task force first met. The task force consists of four experts, two of whom work in the private sector. It is responsible for developing proposals and draft legislation. A private sector consultative group has also been established to provide expert advice and assistance to the task force. This group consists of representatives of large and small users of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December, the task force released a plan of action which outlined how it proposed to go about the overall project. That plan of action identified seven initial priority areas where early practical gains for business are possible. They include streamlining the corporate structure for small business, facilitating share buybacks, rationalising annual reporting requirements and reducing the burden of maintaining company registers. The aim is for simplification to occur in manageable stages so that the benefits can be achieved as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task force's first simplification proposal, concerning share buybacks, was released in early March of this year. The law in this area is extremely complex, burdensome and expensive to comply with. Its cumbersome nature and complexity deters companies from using the provisions. The task force's proposal on buybacks involves an emphasis on the basics. The aim is to discard the excessive detail and technicalities in the current law. By the end of the consultation process we will have developed provisions that companies can actually use, consistent with the need for adequate safeguards for shareholders and creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same principles for simplification apply to small business structures. Our smallest companies are currently regulated under a scheme primarily designed to supervise our largest companies. Clearly, this not only makes life difficult for small companies but in many situations is simply illogical. A proposal to simplify the proprietary company structure to ease the burdens for existing and new small businesses was released for public comment also in March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The twin emphasis on clarity and elimination of unnecessary paperwork continues in the task force's proposal, released at the end of April, to do away with many of the requirements for company register keeping. Where adequate information for investors and creditors is readily available through the Australian Stock Exchange or through access to the ASC database, unnecessary requirements to maintain registers can be removed. In other cases the information held is unnecessary. The proposal would make the remaining obligations easier to use by bringing them together in the law, streamlining the requirements and making them more uniform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest task force proposal was released in May and deals with annual returns and financial reporting to shareholders. Under the proposal, the annual return would be streamlined by reducing the number of items of information it contains by around 75 per cent. In addition, companies which are required to prepare annual accounts would have the option of sending concise financial reports to shareholders. This would have the dual benefit of cost savings for companies and easier-to-read financial reports for shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task force is working towards a first draft bill for public exposure about mid-year&mdash;I think early August is the latest date&mdash;but the process will not be rushed. In particular, the task force is determined to consult widely on its proposals before it drafts the legislation. This will provide an essential opportunity for business and other user groups to influence the basic policy as it is being developed. The first simplification bill would deal with buybacks, proprietary companies and company registers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I confirm that, in accordance with the heads of agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the ministerial council on corporations has been consulted and, to the extent necessary, has given approval for the introduction of the bill into the parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose most of the measures in the bill. Those measures tidy up pockets of difficulty and facilitate desirable reforms. The coalition does, however, oppose an aspect of the provisions of the bill relating to procedural changes to the Corporations and Securities Panel. In our view, it is unacceptable that the government is seeking to prohibit legal and other representatives of the parties from addressing the panel. I propose to move an amendment that will entitle a person who appears at the inquiry to have another person address the panel on his or her behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill in its current form provides that the rules of natural justice are not applicable to the panel. It was the government's intention to provide for procedures before the panel to be dealt with by regulation. To accommodate coalition objections, the government has agreed to proposed amendments to recast the provisions. I will deal with the Corporations and Securities Panel provisions and the unopposed provisions of the bill in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like first, however, to comment on the provisions of the bill which sought to alter the definitions of `securities' and `futures contract', which the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has indicated will be withdrawn. I welcome the government's decision to withdraw the amendments. As the Attorney has mentioned, those amendments were slipped into the bill after an exposure draft had been circulated. Given the potential ramifications of the amendments, this was somewhat surprising. Part of the reaction against the amendments has resulted simply from the limited time for adequate consideration, together with the lack of any initiation by the government of consultation with those concerned. It appears that the only industry body consulted by the government was the Australian Stock Exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the amendments came to light when this bill was introduced, considerable concern was expressed by both industry and commentators as to the scope of the amendments. The amendments would have given the government extensive powers to vary the definitions of `securities' and `futures contracts' by regulation, and without any necessity for industry or public consultation. The practical effect would have been that the government could direct that hybrid instruments which are presently futures would be traded as securities, and vice versa. This would mean that the safeguards of chapter 8 of the Corporations Law which apply to futures would not apply to the affected instruments, but the different provisions of chapter 7 relating to securities would apply&mdash;and vice versa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition accepts that there is a need for some flexibility to allow the Stock Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange to conduct markets in new products and to maintain an ability to compete with overseas exchanges. Any arrangement proposed for exchange-traded products should not have adverse consequences for over-the-counter derivatives; and any interim measure must be compatible with long-term reform presently under study by CASAC, the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. The amendments which were proposed by the government go much further than is necessary or appropriate, and I am therefore pleased that the amendments have been withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech the Attorney was a little more specific in relation to the purpose of the proposed amendments. He stated that the amendments were to facilitate the trading of a new product by the ASX from 1 July 1994. The exchange will apparently not now be ready to trade the products until the end of the year. The Attorney has also stated that his department will develop the regulations that will govern the trading of the new products. I welcome that opportunity for greater consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current concerns, however, will not be addressed simply by the government preparing in advance for scrutiny the regulations it intends to adopt to facilitate the trading of a particular product by the ASX. As amendments should be designed to facilitate flexibility in the interim, they should be limited in scope and they should be discrete. In the absence of a wider review of derivatives regulation, there may be significant difficulties with changes that widely delegate to the executive the power to regulate derivatives, no matter how strenuous the assurances that they would be exercised sparingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the announcement that the ASX is drafting new business rules to cover the trading of derivative products. This move has been made in anticipation of the reintroduction of provisions which are to be withdrawn. While suitably drafted business rules provide a step in the right direction, in my view it is very important to ensure that the developments in general do not hijack the benefits of a broader approach to the regulation of derivatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with the coalition's objections to the provisions of the bill that deny the right of a person or body appearing before the Corporations and Securities Panel to have any other person address the panel on his or her or its behalf. I will also refer to a more general uneasiness I have with the thrust of the reforms in relation to the panel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To understand the coalition's objections it is necessary to examine the nature of the panel and the impetus for these amendments. The panel came into operation at the beginning of 1991 upon the introduction of the Corporations Law. The role of the panel was to examine the acceptability of takeover conduct by reference to the so-called Eggleston Principles which are set out in section 732 of the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The panel was required to conduct a hearing with the power to make enforceable orders it considered necessary or desirable to protect the rights or interests of persons in a takeover. The panel was established because the National Companies and Securities Commission, which previously examined such behaviour, risked being perceived as investigator, prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner. The establishment of the panel was also in part a move to bring peer review into the difficult area of acceptable behaviour and market integrity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the panel were chosen for their business, financial, legal and other experience relevant to takeovers. The panel has had one matter referred to it which concerned a reverse takeover of Titan Hills Australia Ltd by Precision Data Holdings Ltd. That hearing and determination process was criticised as being cumbersome and overly legalistic. Additional criticisms were that the jurisdiction of the panel was unduly narrow and that the panel was unable to enforce undertakings given by parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments contained in this bill are in part an attempt to render the panel procedures as informal and expeditious as possible. This bill has addressed those concerns. My core difficulty is that the amendments pull in opposite directions. On the one hand they emphasise the peer review nature of the hearings by freeing up legalistic procedures. On the other they expand the court-like powers of the panel. The current power to make enforceable determinations is expanded by the power given by the bill for the enforcement of undertakings. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a contradiction, in my view. It is not appropriate in the black-letter law world of Australian takeover regulation to create an informal peer review body that has the power to make binding determinations which materially affect rights and interests. While it is true that the panel will not be considering technical legal issues but market behaviour and standards, the background to any inquiry is the takeover law, which is highly technical. An appreciation of the takeovers background will be vitally important in making any determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulation through black-letter law and by peer review may well be desirable but the panel should exhibit the characteristics of one approach or the other but not both. In this regard I note with interest a report of an interview with Mr Tony Hartnell in the journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Company Director</EMPHASIS> in December 1992. Mr Hartnell was asked about peer review in corporate governance. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The idea of peer review is to take the debate, the exposure to corporate conduct, much wider than the narrowness of the black-letter law, and debate precise situations, not general formulations. This would be done within a body that was set up as a peer review body, with no powers to punish anyone. But it would have powers to publish its views at the end of their examinations.</PARA>
<PARA>And continuing the quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An ideal vehicle for the development of this vision could be the Corporations and Securities Panel. That relatively inactive body presently has a quasi-law enforcement role within the confines of a strict legal process with a black-letter jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this body has always been conceived of, in policy terms, as a peer body . . . No more ideal body of persons exists in Australia with relevant qualifications for peer review of corporate conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, my perception is that the body, as presently staffed, is more suited to the peer review function than the quasi-judicial process it currently possesses.</PARA>
<PARA>The present amendments confuse even more the role of the panel. It is in this context that the coalition cannot accept the proposed ban on advisers addressing the panel. The bill excludes advisers&mdash;legal, financial or otherwise&mdash;from representing persons appearing before the panel by addressing the panel. Advisers will be able to be present to assist their client but may not address the panel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the power of the panel to directly affect parties' rights and interests and the complex black-letter law background, this is unacceptable. In that context, it cannot be said that the presence of legal and other advisers will impede its work. The ability of legal and other advisers, who might include stockbrokers, financial analysts, merchant bankers and others, to make comments may well result in distillation of the complex issues involved and, in fact, serve to expedite the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, given that the adviser may be present but cannot speak, there will be the ridiculous situation of advisers whispering to their clients what they should be saying, or presenting written submissions and comments for their clients to recite. I cannot support the relaxing of the judicial type procedures in a situation where the panel has the power directly to affect interests by means of coercive powers. If the government were to propose the establishment of a body of the type envisaged by Mr Hartnell, that would be an entirely different matter and it would be considered in a positive context by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment that I foreshadow moving would omit the proposed subsection 194(4) and substitute a subsection in these terms: `A person who appears at an inquiry is entitled to have another person present to assist the person, and a person who so assists is entitled to address the panel.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to comment further on the provisions relating to the applicability of the rules of natural justice. Although those provisions are not opposed by the coalition, I am distinctly uneasy about the way they have been formulated. The bill currently specifically provides that the rules of natural justice do not apply in relation to an inquiry. The government has indicated that it was its intention that the rules would be replaced in a streamlined form by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of opposition pressure, the government proposes to recast the provision to provide:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that this division and the regulations will set out procedural requirements that equate to the rules of natural justice.</PARA>
<PARA>In my view, there is little substantive change effected by that amendment. It is, in my view, unsatisfactory and it should not be regarded as a precedent for any other situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before commenting further, I will provide a little background. Natural justice is a common law doctrine which safeguards the rights of persons who may be affected by an administrative or quasi-judicial decision to procedural fairness in the making of the decision. Examples of the rules of natural justice are that the person whose rights are affected has the right to be heard and that the decision maker should not be biased. The courts have clearly established that rules vary from one situation to another. That flexibility in itself causes me to wonder whether this amendment is required. If an expedited determination is inherently necessary for the process to be effective, as it is in this case, a court would take that into account in determining that more streamlined procedures were appropriate and met the standards of procedural fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, the government has stated that the content of the rules of natural justice is to be expressly set out in regulations and will facilitate quick commercial decisions. Prior to the coalition making clear its objections, we had no idea what the regulations would look like. There was no guarantee that the regulations would be promulgated before the relevant provisions of the bill entered into force. That was entirely unsatisfactory. The government has now seen fit to provide draft regulations. However, the regulations are extensive and the time within which they were provided has not allowed for a detailed study or any consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of the regulations does provide some measure of improvement, however; but I must say that it is my personal view that, if the rules of natural justice are eradicated or replaced, at the very least the principal substitute rules should be set out in primary legislation in the enactment that abolishes the rules that would otherwise apply. The coalition, however, is not taking that point in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should note that my views in relation to both representation and natural justice have been echoed by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The committee has expressed the view that the proposals may be considered to breach the committee's principles in that they trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, and that they delegate legislative powers inappropriately. I simply repeat that, while it is not opposed, the technique of substituting a statement such as that in the proposed subsection 195(3) is unsatisfactory and should not be regarded as a model. But the coalition will move an amendment to substitute a subsection 194(4) to deal with representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to some of the less contentious areas of Corporations Law to be amended by this bill. The bill makes it clear that the lower courts have jurisdiction to hear certain claims under the Corporations Law. It is presently unclear whether lower courts such as district and county courts and magistrates courts have such jurisdiction. The inability to bring action in lower courts may have the practical effect of discouraging parties with legitimate but comparatively small civil claims from bringing action. This is due to the comparative cost of bringing action in superior courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulties are compounded by a superior court reluctance to consider minor claims. The bill confers, on lower courts in each state and territory, civil jurisdiction in respect to corporate law claims relating to debt recovery or monetary compensation. Jurisdiction is not to be granted to lower courts where high-level discretionary powers are involved. The amendments are welcome and, although he has now been replaced in the chair by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), I know that the previous Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), has a personal interest in seeing these amendments through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes changes to the clearing house electronic subregister system commonly known as CHESS. The Corporate Law Reform Act 1992 provided a legislative framework for the electronic settlement of transactions on the ASX. It allowed for the creation of CHESS, which aims to have transactions settled and delivered within three days after trade and to replace the current paper document of transfer with electronic transfer. The bill makes further technical amendments to facilitate the introduction of CHESS. Those provisions are not opposed by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill implements a decision of the ministerial councils for corporations and for financial institutions to rationalise application of the Corporations Law and of state legislation to financial institutions&mdash;principally, building societies and credit unions. At present, intrastate activities of credit unions are governed by state legislation, and interstate activities are governed by the Corporations Law. In broad terms the amendments are unobjectionable. However, commentators have made a number of specific criticisms that should be noted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill removes charges over the property of financial institutions from the registration scheme of Corporations Law, part 3.5. That is to say, charges are to be regulated only under financial institutions legislation. This worsens the fragmentation of the personal property security registration systems in Australia. The Australian Law Reform Commission, in its report No. 64 in 1993, commended a move to simplify registration and searching using the register under part 3.5 as the base for a national scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it seems that the ministerial councils did not agree on a centralised register, it seems unfortunate that fragmentation becomes more entrenched as a result of these amendments. One practical question that I ask is whether there will be a transfer of charges over financial institution property registered under the Corporations Law to the state registers. If not, dual searches will need to be undertaken. This will be cumbersome, time consuming and costly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assertion in the financial impact statement that the bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on business has been challenged by a commentator as ludicrous. Under the bill, the fundraising provisions of the Corporations Law will apply to financial institutions with certain exceptions. The view is expressed that it will be costly for financial institutions to comply with the complex and uncertain prospectus provisions for fundraising activities. It is doubted whether this will be offset by the elimination of duplication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section of this bill implementing these amendments contains a table to help in determining which provisions of the Corporations Law apply to financial institutions. While the inclusion of the table provides a useful tool to those seeking to understand the legislation, it does exemplify the ever growing complexity of the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill modifies the way in which the ASC must provide notice to persons affected by its decisions to facilitate appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 requires a person who makes a reviewable decision to take all reasonable steps to give any person whose interests are affected by the decision notice of the making of the decision and the right to have the decision reviewed. This creates significant practical difficulties for the ASC. In many instances it is difficult to identify all those affected by broad-ranging decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Administrative Review Council, in conjunction with the ASC and the Attorney-General's Department, has examined all categories of decisions of the ASC to determine the extent to which exemption from the notification of the making of the decisions and the review rights may be justified. The bill legislatively implements that review. It should be noted that the bill enacts in primary legislation a regulatory scheme which has been in operation since 11 December 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The categories of decisions excluded from the standard AAT Act requirements are subject to a modified regime for notification of persons affected by such decisions of their rights of review under the AAT Act. The changes appear to balance sensibly the need for notice to be given to those affected by decisions against the administrative difficulties in giving notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In implementation of the scheme it would be desirable if the ASC were to issue policy statements listing the sorts of persons to whom it would be likely not to give notice. That would enable representations to be made by interested parties at the exposure draft stage, enabling the ASC's final determination to be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill allows companies limited by shares to convert to no liability status. At present, a no liability company can convert to a limited liability company, but there is no procedure for conversion in the other direction. No liability companies are generally mining companies. The no liability status allows the company to offer shares at a discount without a requirement to obtain court approval for the offer. This makes investment more attractive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments address a legislative irregularity which has created difficulties for the mining industry and are not opposed by the coalition. I have a personal interest in the amendment in that I was involved in relatively fruitless litigation in a former life as counsel on the very question which is now being dealt with. It was a matter that came before several courts on several occasions in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the establishment of stock markets in unquoted prescribed interests on which the interests may be traded by means of an electronic trading facility. Any market will be required to be approved by the minister. The bill, supplemented by regulations, is said to provide the necessary basis for the supervision by the ASC of any such approved market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASX has submitted that the amendments do not provide a sufficient framework for the provision of an efficient market and for ensuring that the interests of the public&mdash;principally, the smaller investor to whom this type of market is directed&mdash;are safeguarded. The ASX is concerned that the legislation itself provides no minimum standards. Particularly, it is concerned that the protections in sections 774 to 779 are not necessarily applicable to stock markets and unquoted prescribed interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASX also has doubts about the proposed structure of the management company providing a market, surveillance work being contracted out to a supervisor, and participants in the market not necessarily being members of the management company. The exchange asks whether the proposed structure is capable of providing a comparable level of regulation and compliance. In the absence of other criticism of the framework, I am willing to accept for the present&mdash;at least until demonstrable evidence proves to the contrary&mdash;the proposed mechanism for screen based training systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do, however, find it troubling that the legislative skeleton has no flesh whatsoever. No minimum standards are detailed in the legislation. They are left for inclusion in regulations, or to be determined on a case by case basis as applications to the minister are made for approval of relevant stock markets. There needs to be application of consistent standards. As the ASX points out, providing for substantive matters to be dealt with by way of regulation is undesirable, as it reduces opportunity for scrutiny and comment. The delegation of substantive policy making from the legislature to the executive has been a troubling theme in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been most seriously evident in the provisions dealing with the definition of `securities' and future definitions of `securities' and `futures contracts'. Thankfully, they are to be withdrawn. Had they come into effect they would have given to the executive government inappropriately wide policy making power. So too is the attempt to replace rules of natural justice with regulatory replacement. Laws affecting fundamental rights of citizens should not be made outside a parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are being very civilised in this chamber. Mr Deputy Speaker, there are a range of issues which arise from this bill, but I would firstly make some general points. As is the custom with corporations legislation, this bill has, in a sense, done the rounds by way of the public comment process. In the course of the exposure draft, comments have been received in the usual way from a range of interested parties: the Australian Institute of Company Directors, the Australian Securities Commission, the Credit Union Services Corporation, the Australian Institute of Credit Management, the Attorney-General's Department, the Law Institute of Victoria and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. So in this area, Mr Deputy Speaker, we very much are dealing in an area for the technical aficionado where the public comment process is very important, but where the general policy which applies is also important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support a range of amendments to the Corporations Law in the bill. There is one which is in the original bill, which the Attorney-General has indicated he proposes to withdraw. That relates to the definition of `securities' and `futures contract'. I agree with the sensible decision of the Attorney-General to withdraw and proceed with that on a later occasion. A third amendment in respect of the Corporations and Securities Panel has been the subject of some discussion and is the subject of two amendments, one in the name of the Attorney-General and one in the name of the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). It is my view that the amendment in the name of the Attorney-General ought to satisfy those reservations which have been raised by the honourable member for Tangney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the general point that the Attorney-General, in his second reading speech, referred to the simplification process. That is a process which I know is supported by members on both sides and is certainly supported by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities, of which I am fortunate enough to be chair. I think it is important to make the point, which the Attorney-General did in his second reading speech, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am pleased to report that good progress is being made with simplification, that process will take time. In the meantime, the current law governs the corporate sector and some reform must continue to keep that law in tune with the rapidly changing commercial environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When deficiencies are revealed they need to be rectified.</PARA>
<PARA>So the simplification process goes on, and the Attorney is to be complimented for that, but life goes on as well and we need to consider these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will start in the reverse order to the honourable member for Tangney and deal with some of the range of amendments before coming to those which have been more contentious. The first one to which I draw attention is the proposal to extend the civil jurisdiction under the Corporations Law to lower courts in areas of debt recovery and monetary compensation. I think this is adequately described in paragraph 7 of the explanatory memorandum, where it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The court jurisdiction amendments will facilitate business, to the extent that those businesses with legitimate civil claims under the Corporations Law will be able to bring those actions in any lower court in Australia if the claim is within the court's usual monetary limits, without worrying about technical jurisdictional issues such as where the cause of action originated or the State of Territory jurisdiction in which the defendant company was registered.</PARA>
<PARA>There are two important policy points here. One is the general access to justice, which relates to the cost of bringing actions in superior courts. The second is that this is effectively an extension of the cross-vesting jurisdictional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again draw attention to the Attorney-General's second reading speech. He summarised very succinctly the access to justice point when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government is committed to the principle that justice should be available to the community at an affordable cost and with the prospect of a speedy resolution.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the principle behind this amendment and the principle behind the access to justice action plan to which the government generally is committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as cross-vesting is concerned, we are very fortunate that we have in this chamber today the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), the former Attorney-General. He and I were reminiscing about former lives, his as Attorney-General and mine as principal private secretary to an Attorney-General for Western Australia, Mr Joe Berinson. We were reminiscing about the cross-vesting arrangements. I said to the honourable member for Holt that the original cross-vesting arrangement, which was achieved at a meeting in Brisbane of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, was actually sealed over lunch between the Attorney-General for Western Australia, Mr Joe Berinson, who is also a predecessor of mine as a former member for Perth, and the former Commonwealth Attorney-General and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Lionel Bowen. The comment that the honourable member for Holt made, with which I wholeheartedly agreed, was that that lunch no doubt brought with it some very clear drafting instructions for the parliamentary counsel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a serious note, this is an extension of those cross-vesting arrangements and I think it is another example of the great sense of that cooperative venture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second of the non-contentious matters to which I wish to draw attention concerns the amendments in respect of the CHESS arrangements. In very many respects, I think these changes have been understated. The effect of these amendments is that the Corporations Law will provide a legislative framework for the electronic settlement of transactions on the Australian Stock Exchange. It will enable the ASX to introduce a new clearing house electronic subregister system, CHESS, through the establishment of an approved securities clearing house and legislative support of its business role. The aim of CHESS is to have transactions settled and delivered within three days after trade and to replace the current paper document of transfer with electronic transfer. That is a significant improvement in arrangements so far as the ASX is concerned. The legislative underpinning will ensure that there is an appropriate legislative regime in place to effect those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Tangney and previous speakers referred to those amendments which relate to the fundraising provisions of building societies and credit unions. As that is the subject of a decision of the ministerial councils for corporations and financial institutions, this chamber can be well assured that those amendments are worth while. In passing, I draw attention to the adoption of the penalty unit system to prescribe penalties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final amendment to which I wish to draw attention is in respect of the segregation of client moneys by futures brokers. This is an important amendment to ensure the protection of investor funds. It is an issue that cannot be understated. This is not an amendment that was contained in the exposure bill but it is not an amendment that has been the subject of adverse comment. On the contrary, it is an amendment that has been the subject of endorsement. It is sensible and is firmly based on the principle of ensuring that at all times, through either the Corporations Law or ASX arrangements, investors' money is protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move to that area of the bill which is the subject of the Attorney-General's amendment to delete the proposed amendments in respect of the definitions of securities and futures contracts to facilitate the trading of equity based instruments having the characteristics of both equity and futures contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the decision to defer these to a later day are very sensible and, far from being a matter for which the Attorney-General should be the subject of adverse comment, it is a matter in respect of which he should be the subject of positive comment. The Attorney-General has, I think, a growing capacity to be taking sensible and wise decisions and taking them in a timely fashion. He outlined in his second reading speech one of the reasons why the need to place this amendment into the bill without it being in the exposure bill has now passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of references that I wanted to draw attention to in order to reaffirm the point that this is a sensible decision by the Attorney-General. I refer to an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Butterworths Corporation Law Bulletin</EMPHASIS> under the heading `Wolf in sheep's clothing'. I must confess, when I first saw that, I thought it was article on the change of the opposition's leadership, but I then saw the subheading `OTC markets under the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994'. It is an article by Michael Hains, who is an author of Butterworths <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Corporation Law</EMPHASIS>. In his contribution in that piece, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what appear to be fairly minor amendments proposed by the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill . . . may herald a wholesale change to the way derivatives are regulated&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on in his article to make the point, at its conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is evident that several important policy issues are raised by the amendments. It is imperative that the amendments be deleted from the Amendment Bill and that a considered, informed and consultative process be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If proceeded with, the amendments will create uncertainty and will confuse the regulatory regime in Australia. This will adversely impact on both exchange traded and OTC derivatives markets.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not necessarily agreeing with the final comment but that is one indication which supports the sensible decision by the Attorney-General to delete this particular provision from the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a second reference that I wanted to draw attention to on this issue, which is an extract from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> by Mr Ian Rogers, under the heading `Law could give ASX derivatives'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A partner with Freehill, Hollingdale and Page, Mr John O'Sullivan said the reforms would `lessen the certainty that designers of new products can have about the regulatory treatment of the product at the time that the product is designed.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the futures issue, for those reasons, I believe the amendment which is listed in the name of the Attorney-General ought to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move to the issue which has been the subject of an amendment tabled by the honourable member for Tangney and by the Attorney-General and that is in respect of the changes to the Corporations and Securities Panel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to put the comments that the honourable member for Tangney has made on natural justice and procedural fairness into context. The Corporations and Securities Panel is established under part 10 of the Australian Securities Commission Act, and its powers are defined in part 1 of the Corporations Law. Upon application by the ASC it examines takeover conduct and may make declarations and orders concerning unacceptable conduct and acquisitions. These declarations and orders are enforceable by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The activities of the panel have been greatly curtailed following its examinations of conduct involved in the shares of Titan Hills and Precision Data Holdings. In the Titan Hills matter, the panel found that its jurisdiction did not extend far enough to cover the fairness of the amount of information provided during a related series of takeovers. In both cases the panel became involved in litigation which prevented it from reaching a rapid decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments contained in the bill would have the following effect: to extend the panel's jurisdiction to cover matters concerned with takeover conduct generally; to allow a person appearing before an inquiry to have another person present to assist him, although they remove any right to be represented by a barrister or a solicitor; to allow regulations to be made dealing with submissions, the right to appear or be present at an inquiry and the matters to be taken into account when making a decision; to reduce the risk of delays through litigation; and to empower the panel to accept undertakings which are enforceable by the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the two amendments that we have before this chamber is in the name of the Attorney-General. As the explanatory memorandum notes, this amendment will, in effect, omit the express exclusion of the rules of natural justice in relation to an inquiry in proposed subsection 195(3) and substitute a statement of the government's intention that the requirements of the rules of natural justice will be met where the procedural requirements set out in division 3 of part 10 of the ASC Act and the regulations are followed in the course of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment which is in the name of the honourable member for Tangney has the effect of suggesting that a person who appears at an inquiry is entitled to have another person present to assist that person, and the person who so assists is entitled to address the panel. That is code for ensuring that a person is entitled, as of right, to have present a legal practitioner, in effect, who can address the panel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue here is one of procedural fairness. Procedural fairness does not require that the panel behave like a court, and likewise cross-examination of parties and witnesses is not a requirement of procedural fairness. The emphasis of the panel will instead be on written submissions by parties and strict time limits for submissions. After examining these submissions, the panel will decide whether a conference or oral inquiry is necessary. Given that the panel's deliberations do not generally relate to technical legal matters but rather to matters of market behaviour and market standards, it is more appropriate that the parties, rather than their legal advisers, address the panel at any such oral inquiries. Legal advisers may of course be present to assist but will not be entitled to address the panel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue which the honourable member for Tangney has raised is the ability of a person not just to assist but to address the panel. The rule of natural justice, which as a result of the amendment in the name of the Attorney-General will be incorporated, has the effect that a person does have the opportunity to be heard but not necessarily the right to be heard orally. The rule of natural justice does not necessarily require that decision makers hear arguments from a person's legal representatives. It does require that a person have an adequate opportunity to present his or her case and, while the bill has the effect that a person does not have the right to be represented by a legal adviser, it does enable an adviser to be present and to assist the person in the presentation of that case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments have been modelled on the system of pre-decision conferences under the Trade Practices Act. That is a system which, to my understanding, works very well. We ought to have every confidence that similar procedures adopted here will work equally well in this area. To return to a point I made earlier, I believe that will prove to be the case because the panel's deliberations do not relate to technical legal matters but to matters of market behaviour and market standards. One does not need to have legal representation to make those points adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, if I can, in a sense, conclude where I began, I compliment the Attorney-General on his simplification process. The amendments which he has put before the House are all worthy of support, and the important changes to Corporations Law which are envisaged by this bill reflect, once again, the ongoing commitment that the government has to ensuring that the Corporations Law operates effectively and efficiently, and that the interests of all players&mdash;and investors, in particular&mdash;are supported by an effective legal regime, which needs to change continually with changing circumstances. The bill and the amendments which the Attorney has put before the House effectively satisfy those requirements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not keep the chamber long in my comments in regard to the matter which is before us, which is the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. There have been a number of matters that have concerned the opposition. The panel and the natural justice issues naturally come to mind. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has sought to re-establish a process which covers the natural justice issue. It is not the opposition's proposal to press that matter, but instead to take up the matter referred to by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). That is the area of the panel itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We just feel that, in the circumstances, despite the assurances that have been given, natural justice is an issue. I think the terms used were that natural justice need not be served by people giving oral expression to their concern. To me, it is a strange thing indeed that natural justice can be thought to be served by anything other than someone having the opportunity to, in any way they think appropriate, express their objection or concern about an issue before the government or before a court. So there should be no limitation on the way in which persons can express themselves. The limited process of expression being adhered to by the government is not something that is endorsed by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quickly run through the main provisions of the bill. Firstly, there is the conferral of jurisdiction on lower courts, something that the opposition will not oppose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next is the clearing house electronic subregister system. I notice that government speakers have said this will have a massive impact, far wider than is supposed by many in the industry. The reverse appears to be the case, and there have been expressions of concern from various interests. To quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several listed public companies have adopted articles which confer on their boards the power to refuse to register a transfer in favour of a company which is a foreign company for the purpose of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975</EMPHASIS>. See, for example, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Equiticorp Industries Ltd v ACI International Ltd</EMPHASIS> . . . The justification of such articles is said to be that if transfers are registered in favour of foreign persons, the company may itself be classified as a foreign company and this may cause it to lose business opportunities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Stock Exchange has expressed its view on this matter, and it is not the intention of the opposition to oppose this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area is the application of corporate law to financial institutions. The bill removes charges over the property of financial institutions for the registration scheme in the Corporations Law part 3.5, and that will not be opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporations and Securities Panel is an area which is of concern. The bill seeks to remedy some of the faults by excluding the rules of natural justice in relation to an inquiry. Excluding legal and other advised representative persons before the panel, advisers will be able to be present to assist their client but may not be able to address the panel. The bill allows the court to enforce undertakings given to the panel, and broadens the jurisdiction of the panel to investigate certain conduct associated with a takeover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the area of contention. My colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) has moved an amendment seeking to rectify that problem. I have already said that it is my view that persons ought to be able to give expression in these circumstances in any way they see fit, whether it be written, by tape or orally. They ought to have their representative prepared in such a way as to be able to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument presented is that this will work like a pre-hearing tribunal of the Trade Practices Tribunal under the Trade Practices Act. That is fine, except I point out to the Attorney that a court stands behind the panel and the court has the capacity to enforce undertakings given to the panel. Therefore, no-one could put any blush on the fact that the proceedings before the panel are not important. They are very important, both to the individuals and to their organisations. I submit that not to allow legal representation could inhibit the proper and fair pursuit of an issue being considered by the panel. I do not think anybody wants to get into a full-blown court situation but there is a court standing behind the panel. That makes it different from a tribunal or a dispute settling process which is not formal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before most tribunals or panels there is a process whereby one may not have judges present, such as in social security, veterans' affairs or immigration. There is a large range of processes whereby negotiations and settlement take place before a tribunal or panel. In all these instances there is no court standing behind the panel to enforce the undertakings given to the panel. That is the distinction we want to draw. In this instance there is a court behind the panel and therefore legal representation is valid and should be allowed. So we are moving our amendment along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer to other factors in this legislation, such as the notification of review of decisions and the screen-based trading systems. The Australian Stock Exchange has submitted that the amendments do not provide a sufficient framework for the provision of an efficient market and for ensuring that the interests of the public, and principally those of the smaller investor, to whom this type of market is directed, are safeguarded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these criticisms are detailed and complex and appear to be influenced by the desire on the part of the ASX to ensure that markets are restricted to the existing forms of markets. That may or may not be right, but the ASX has offered a comment and a criticism. As the process develops we need to be very sensitive to ensuring that Australia can capitalise on its particular geographic location in South-East Asia and draw on the expertise and security our markets offer in this area. So the government will need to listen to the Australian Stock Exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I mention the conversion of companies to no-liability status and the series of other less consequential amendments. I wish to raise two matters in particular&mdash;the program of simplification of the Corporations Law and the conduct of the investigation by two members of the Simplification Task Force. Comments were made by Miss Claire Grosse and Dr Robert Eggleson, who hinted that the company register paper would allude to the need to eliminate the requirement of companies to hold registers in multiple locations. They appear to be eminently suited to the task in which they are engaged. That leads me to the second matter&mdash;the Attorney-General's comments reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 29 April&mdash;which basically say to the corporate world, `You get your act together and we will support you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a sensible way to go. I am pleased with the tack that is being taken in relation to this matter. The government could move in and be very prescriptive and use black-letter law and heaps of it. However, there is an adopted attitude or an inherited attitude about this. The former Attorney-General was very much of that ilk: he did not want to move to complete prescription. In the latter days of his term he tried to gain a mix&mdash;an interrelationship&mdash;between black-letter law and fuzzy law, and he did that successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to compliment the present Attorney-General. I hope his actions help to end the difficulties that the country has experienced over a long period and about which the government really failed to take action until the horses had bolted. It has been too little too late in some ways, but the Attorney-General is going about it in the right way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposed amendments to the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 require a brief examination of the history of the Corporations and Securities Panel. When honourable members look at this history, they will see that it picks up many of the points made by the previous speakers. The panel was established, as the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) pointed out, as a peer review group to examine conduct and takeover matters referred to it by the ASC. In particular, it was empowered to make declarations of unacceptable conduct and acquisitions in respect of takeovers, and to make orders to remedy such conduct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the first matter that came before the panel was the one referred by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams)&mdash;the Titan Hills takeover case. In terms of peer review, it must be said that that case was a total disaster because, rather than a peer review, it became an exercise in legal technicalities. It was clear at that point to the government that the panel could not operate without changes to facilitate the panel's conduct of inquiries. That is what the government is doing in this legislation. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the government should be commended for that because I think it is an important panel. It could not work in the past and these amendments will make it work. That is the aspect of the bill that I particularly want to deal with. All of the other matters in the bill are matters of significance, apart from some consequential matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large amount of litigation was directly generated by the Titan Hills-Precision Data reverse takeover. It is true that some of those actions&mdash;these points have been made by other people&mdash;such as the constitutional challenge to the panel's power, will not come back to haunt us. I think that that has probably ended. However, as I have indicated briefly, it did become clear during the Titan Hills matter that there were a number of other difficulties with the panel's operations. The most obvious difficulty evidenced by that case is that, despite the panel's legislative charter, hearings have to be conducted with little formality and technicality and with as much expedition as possible. There is potential for that process to be totally bogged down as a quasi-legal forum for legal representatives to present lengthy arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that there is a precedent, which was touched on by other speakers, although they were not agreeing with it. That precedent is the procedures before the Trade Practices Commission in the early stages. The worrying part about all this is that when the government attempted to go for peer review there was only one case, because the exact opposite happened. It got bogged down in the most extraordinarily complex legal arguments, and something had to be done about that if we were going to make any sense of peer review at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Tangney raised the issue which Mr Tony Hartnell, former Chairman of the ASC, pointed out in a fairly recent interview. I do not have the quotation in front of me, but Mr Hartnell said words to the effect that we should have a panel with no power to punish but merely a power to publish what it felt about the behaviour and the standards of behaviour that people had engaged in. That is all very well, but what concerns me about that is that there is nothing at all to stop corporate Australia doing precisely that now. There is nothing that the Attorney could do to stop corporate Australia doing precisely that. In fact, the contrary; and that was touched on in the latter part of the speech by the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a long while, if not for ever, there has been a total lack of a culture of peer review in this country. People tend to say that there has been an overreaction to the corporate excesses of the 1980s, and that is why we had so much legislation in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But it is not an overreaction to something that happened in the 1980s. The history of it, unfortunately, goes back a lot further than that. One thinks of Cambridge Credit, the Korman empire, Reid Murray and Poseidon. None of that happened in the 1980s. It goes back well before the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no history of any real attempt by those people involved in corporate Australia to deliver peer review. I well recall occasions on which I spoke to a man who can be referred to as one of our leading chief executive officers, the executive director of a leading Australian public company. He always became very concerned when it was put to him that the behaviour that we were seeing in corporate Australia was appalling. He would always respond&mdash;and it was particularly in relation to the general area of the Corporations Law concerning loans to directors that he made this response&mdash;that in the company of which he was the chief executive and executive director, none of those things happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I always had to remind him, time and time again, that no-one suggested that they did. As far as anyone could see, in that company there was a record of accountability along the lines that this government has said should be upheld in the area of corporate law in this country. This government has said right through its period of government that, where people are dealing with other people's money, a standard of behaviour is required which is far beyond that which might apply if they wanted merely to fritter away their own money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well recall having to say to that person on many occasions that if, at some stage in the future, he was asked by a judge, `When did you actually make a strong speech to the Institute of Directors, the Business Council of Australia or whoever, on what should be the proper behaviour in corporate Australia?' the answer from him at best would have to be, `Your Honour, I just happened to be passing by at the time.' In many ways that sums up the problem that the government has&mdash;and in particular the Attorney-General has&mdash;of getting it into the minds of those people that, if they want a culture of peer review, they have to do it. He as Attorney-General cannot do it. This government cannot establish it. The government and the Attorney cannot put a culture into the minds of people; they have to do it themselves. They have not done it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Tangney quoted the eminent Tony Hartnell, for whose drive, initiative and energy as the first Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission I have the greatest respect; and one can understand what Tony Hartnell said, as quoted by the member for Tangney. But the fact is that that is not a criticism of the legislation that the Attorney is bringing before the parliament. It cannot be a criticism of it, because what they are appealing for&mdash;as much as I can understand precisely what the honourable member for Tangney and Mr Hartnell are appealing for&mdash;seems to be some body which does not punish but has to publish and, therefore, highlight misbehaviour of corporate Australia in a particular instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, there is no question that that is what this government has always been on about. If corporate Australia wants to engage in that sort of self-regulation through peer review, then it should go right ahead. I think there is no question that the last three Attorneys, including the present one, are on record as saying that, if people want to talk about peer review and if they really are serious about it, they should get on with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point made by many people was that this legislation was not necessary. The old, but correct, point was made by them that, if it is not broken, do not fix it. I can tell honourable members that this legislation was necessary because unquestionably it was broken. This panel had to be fixed. It could not operate in the way it did. The government, and in particular the Attorney, should be congratulated for attempting to bring it back on the rails. But again let me emphasise that it still probably will not work unless corporate Australia is prepared to give it a chance to work. If people wish to turn this again into a quasi-court, they will be able to do it through various means. Do not blame the Attorney-General, or the government, if that happens. Corporate Australia should not run around saying, `The government did not make an effort to bring about peer review'&mdash;because it has. That is what this legislation is attempting to do; it is attempting to fix something that was broken, and it was broken in a way which indicated that corporate Australia had not learned a lesson of allowing a body to take its course and, in a limited way, have that peer review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, this is only a limited way. The Attorney cannot do it; the government cannot do it. It is up to corporate Australia. I think I have reached the stage where, if I hear one leader of industry in this country again say that he wants more self-regulation or more peer review, I will become ill, because we know that people are not going to do it. If they want to go out and do it, we invite them to start right now. From the moment of this bill, let them show the Attorney and the government that they are capable of conducting peer review, because they have no culture or no record of it to date. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. However, the Authority's Strategy published in October 1992 indicates that this priority applies to companies in the textile industry rather than the clothing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. The financial review conducted by Arthur Andersen and paid for by the Authority was only one element of the Authority's evaluation of the company's application. The company was unsuccessful due to the need to consider applications on a competitiveness basis. The company marginally met other criteria while other companies from the clothing sector in general, and the knitwear sector in particular, demonstrated they were undertaking investment projects with outcomes more consistent with the Government's objective for the industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 June 1994 Mr Lloyd asked the Acting Prime Minister the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. He will be aware that the tomato industry, in November 1991, lodged an application for the imposition of dumping and countervailing duties on canned tomatoes from Italy. He will also be aware that duties were finally imposed in April 1992, successfully appealed by the Italians in June 1993, and then successfully counterappealed by the Anti-Dumping Authority in February 1994. My question is: why has the government only reimposed duties back to February 1994 rather than June 1993, as this would be the correct procedure and as this failure to do so has condoned the significant tonnage of canned tomatoes imported in that seven month period with a subsidy close to the total price received by Australian growers? Will the Government reconsider this incorrect and bad decision?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dumping and countervailing duties were initially imposed against canned tomatoes from Italy in April 1992. The Italian exporter subsequently applied to the Federal Court to have the duties set aside on the basis that there had been several errors of law in the inquiry process. The court upheld the application and the duties were removed in June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The findings were challenged before the Full Bench of the Federal Court and, in February 1994, the Full Bench upheld the challenge. Following a brief inquiry by the Anti-Dumping Authority into a particular aspect of the Court hearings, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction reimposed dumping and countervailing duties as from 10 February, the date of the orders that gave effect to the Full Court's Decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning now to the questions raised by the Honourable Member as to why the measures were reimposed as from February 1994 rather than from the time when they were removed in June 1993, the response is twofold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, in accordance with Order number 35 of the Federal Court Rules, a judgement or order of the Federal Court takes effect on the day it was pronounced or made, unless the Court orders that it take effect at an earlier or later date. In the canned tomatoes case, as the Court did not specify a date for the Full Court's finding to take effect, the findings came into effect on the date of the orders&mdash;10 February 1994. To have this date overturned and an earlier date imposed would have required an application to the Federal Court by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction. Thus the Minister, in deciding to reimpose the relevant duties, was unable to apply them from a date prior to the order by the Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether the Minister should have applied to the Court to have the ability to impose duties earlier than February 1994 goes to the second aspect of the response to the Honourable Member's question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dumping that causes material injury is recognised internationally as a form of unfair competition. As all Honourable Members would know, this is explicitly reflected in the GATT. As a signatory to the GATT, Australia has upheld the right of all Australian industries to seek action against such behaviour. Duties are not imposed as a means of creating revenue for the Government. It follows that these duties should not be imposed if they do not have the effect of countering the effect of unfair competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of canned tomatoes, if the Minister had applied successfully to the Federal Court and had the date of reimposition set at June 1993, how would this assist the Australian industry? Obviously, the vast majority of imports of canned tomatoes since June 1993 would have by now been sold to consumers by supermarkets throughout the country. To the extent that these imports may have caused material injury to the Australian industry, that industry would gain no advantage now in having duties imposed against these past imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the Australian companies who import canned tomatoes would be faced with a substantial bill&mdash;amounting, I am told, to over $3 million&mdash;which could conceivably cause considerable hardship to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the circumstances, the Government is satisfied that the dumping and countervailing measures against exports of canned tomatoes from Italy should apply only from February 1994.</PARA>
