<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, of course no-one has done that, although I am not sure about that side of the chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When clients first come to the Child Support Agency, many of them are going through a very traumatic period in their lives and it is very hard for the Child Support Agency to be involved at that time. At the start-up of the Child Support Agency, it was always envisaged that the agency would handle the non-custodial parents and that the Department of Social Security, which pays out to custodial parents, would handle queries from the custodial parents. It never worked that way because, as we know from experience, they all went to the Child Support Agency and that put a lot more pressure on the agency than we ever envisaged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also did not anticipate the rapid growth. The statistics are well worth having a look at. When the Child Support Agency was established in 1988, it started with 58 clients. Today that figure has risen to 293,000 and every week there are 2,800 applications. I doubt whether there is a government agency anywhere&mdash;certainly not in Australia and in few places in the world&mdash;that would have growth approaching that. In addition, every working day the Child Support Agency receives 8,500 telephone calls and 8,200 letters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Agency pays out an average of $51 a week for 240,000 Australian kids. Its collection rate, which is now 75 per cent of net liabilities or, if we measure it since 1988, a collection rate of 68 per cent of all debt, is by far the best in the world. That figure compares with the figure in the United States of America of 19 per cent. We are looking at 68 per cent since we started up the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Pyne" NAMEID="9V5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V5">Mr Pyne</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What does the member for Chifley say about that?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get on to that in a minute. What we really should be focusing on is: what is the Child Support Agency's job? Its job is looking after Australian kids&mdash;a very important job and one which, until 1988, was neglected. It used to be the case that when parents separated, mum, who usually had the kids, was on social security benefits, and dad, who was usually the non-custodial parent, in many cases never worried about paying maintenance, even though that was due.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the agency often deals with emotional people and many people on the other end of the phone need help. I do not think at the start the Child Support Agency people had the skills needed, although the national training strategy we have in place is addressing this problem, giving Child Support Agency staff the skills to tackle this problem. The training of all staff will be completed by June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also well worth remembering that independent research has shown that many clients are aggressive when they first come to the Child Support Agency; in many cases there is a lot of resistance and a lot of emotion and there may be a lot of problems. Our research has shown that, after people have been with the Child Support Agency for about three months, there is an acceptance of the role of the Child Support Agency and the criticism tends to die down. By then we have another lot of people&mdash;as I said before, there are 2,800 applications a week&mdash;so it seems that there are always complaints about the Child Support Agency. But I venture to say that they are from different clientele, because we go through the same problem over and over again. I hope the changes we are making in the House today will go a long way towards sorting out some of those problems. I would like to think that in the future some of the criticisms we have received of the Child Support Agency will be alleviated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since I became the minister in charge of the Child Support Agency in March 1993, I have worked with the Registrar of the Child Support Agency, Michael Carmody, to improve the system. This package of measures is the result of practical experience and it will free up the system. It will cut out the delays of start-up and the proof of parentage. At present one of the major obstacles to getting people their child support is making them chase up birth certificates or statutory declarations. For people born overseas this can take months. The measures will allow easier direct payment for reliable payers, to get them out of the system so the Child Support Agency can deal with the more difficult cases, and will even stop the debts building up for stage one cases where people have to go back to the court. Many people just do not have the money to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the criticisms I have heard during this debate is, `Is that all you are doing?' No, it is not. In actual fact they are the legislative changes, but there are a lot of administrative changes. I detailed some of these in the House earlier this week: 90 per cent of phone calls are now answered in three minutes or less, the processing of correspondence has been speeded up, national guidelines have already been implemented, over the next six months an extra 150 staff will be allocated to tackle arrears and there will be a comprehensive strategy to deal with that, and a national training program has already been implemented that focuses on client service. So this package of measures today is but one avenue, if you like, of improving the service the Child Support Agency gives its clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just get to some of the points brought up by the opposition. Really I do not think I have much to respond to because I did not hear much that would lead me to believe that many opposition members took much time to look at the bill. It was hardly debated at all. A number of them said they were not going to oppose it, and neither should they. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just contrast two speakers from the opposition&mdash;the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), whom I was in the House to hear last night, and the member for Tangney (Mr Williams). They are two contrasting contributions. The member for Mitchell clearly did not understand what he was talking about, but the member for Tangney gave what I thought was a very comprehensive and very thoughtful speech. I have instructed the people here today from the Child Support Agency to have a look at that speech, because there were a lot of sound suggestions in it. The quality of the contributions from the opposition varied widely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the amendment. With all the hullabaloo about it last night, you would have thought that the opposition, if it thought it was such a terrible scheme, might have come up with an amendment or a number of amendments which it thought could have improved the system. But all the amendment does is have a bit of a whinge about how the government is not doing enough without suggesting any improvements. That should not surprise anybody who has been in this House for a while. The opposition could not come up with a constructive suggestion about how we might improve the operation of the Child Support Agency. The government will not be agreeing to the opposition amendment because, basically, it says nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been in the job for 21 months now. I think I have had two, maybe three, questions about the Child Support Agency in that time and that was after the Auditor-General's report a couple of months ago. So I do not think there is all that much to worry about in the operation of the Child Support Agency if it is measured by that criterion. There has never been a matter of public importance raised. I point out to the House that after this week's report, which was tabled on Monday, I have not received one question in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the opposition has not given us an amendment which deals with anything substantial. Apart from the contribution of the member for Tangney, many of the contributions consisted of nothing more than just reading out constituents' concerns. So there is nothing much for me to answer on that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to what was discussed during this debate&mdash;that is, the report handed down on Monday by the chairman of the committee which looked into the Child Support Agency&mdash;I notice that a number of opposition speakers seem to think that our first reaction was, in the words of some of them, to savage the report. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Pyne" NAMEID="9V5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V5">Mr Pyne</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said that in my speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Somebody has put his hand up here to say he said that. You are wrong. There was one glaring error in that report which dealt with the Child Support Agency which I had to correct. The committee said in its report that the agency had a collection rate of only 42 per cent. As I said earlier in my speech today, that should be 75 per cent. I said that again in the House the other day in answer to a question. The chairman of the committee sought to reiterate the committee's viewpoint and I had to come back into the House and correct it. I am happy to say now that the chairman admits that the Child Support Agency has collected 75 per cent of all net liabilities this year and that the committee, in that particular instance, was wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have brought down my speaking notes from a question I had the other day. I agreed with the committee in four different areas. I will reiterate them. I agreed with the committee that the child support scheme has changed attitudes of parents to the financial support of their children when they separate. I agreed with the committee that there should be a charter. I assured the committee that the government will give its recommendations thoughtful consideration. I said that we had already implemented a number of them where we agreed with them. I also said that I agreed with the thrust of the committee's report that the government should keep out of the private lives of separated parents. Those were four instances in my answer to the House the other day where I agreed with the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was only one area where I did not agree with the committee. To extrapolate from that that I damned the committee's report or that I attacked the committee's report is wrong. All I was doing was correcting an error. As I have said, in the answer I gave the other day at least in four instances I agreed with the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate, understandably, was mixed up with the report, as it was released only this week. As I have said, there was not much debate on the bill&mdash;no opposition to it. At this stage, I would like to thank all members of the committee for the work they put in and for the report they handed down. I can say from my point of view that over the break I will be going through the report very thoroughly. I have instructed the Child Support Agency to make sure that it does the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be having meetings with the Child Support Agency early in the new year. I can assure the committee and, through it, custodial and non-custodial parents that we will be doing everything we can to make sure that they get a better service and that all of those Australian kids from separated families get the child support they need to make sure that they have a better future. Once again, I would like to thank all of those who contributed to the debate. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>Under current legislation, people who receive compensation for an injury should reimburse the Commonwealth for Medicare and nursing home benefits which they have received in respect of that injury. However, the review of the relationship between compensation and health and community services programs found that many people receiving compensation designed to meet the full cost of injury-related medical and other care needs do not reimburse the Commonwealth. They `double-dip' by receiving free or heavily subsidised services funded by the Commonwealth, as well as compensation for the full costs of these services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Double dipping can never be acceptable, because it means that the community pays twice for a service&mdash;once through insurance and again through Commonwealth funding. The current policy to prevent double dipping is not able to be implemented properly because of flaws in the legislation. According to the work of the review, it appears to be widely circumvented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This main compensation bill and its cognate bills seek to address the problems with the existing legislation and ensure that the Commonwealth is reimbursed the equivalent of benefits that have been paid, as current policy requires. It is important to stop double dipping because it diverts limited resources away from injured people who have no alternative source of assistance, apart from Commonwealth programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will improve systems to identify compensation claimants and recipients, and to recover benefits paid prior to an award of compensation. The benefits covered by the bills are Medicare benefits, provided under the Health Insurance Act 1973, and nursing home benefits, provided under the National Health Act 1953. The new provisions will ensure that compensation claimants and recipients, insurers, and compensation payers are aware of their liabilities to the Commonwealth, where Medicare benefits and/or nursing home benefits have been paid to claimants before their compensation is payable. The bills are particularly targeted at lump sum compensation payments. Double dipping is generally not a problem under periodic payment schemes because expenses are reimbursed as they are incurred. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Identification of people who receive compensation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that approximately 73,000 compensation cases are finalised each year, with many more than that number ongoing at any one time. To improve the identification of these cases, the main bill requires insurers and compensation payers to notify the Health Insurance Commission of details of claims lodged for compensation. They must also notify the commission of key events in their progress and of their finalisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While seeking to improve identification of compensation claimants and recipients, the new arrangements protect individuals' private information relating to their treatment histories. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Benefits paid prior to compensation becoming payable</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare and nursing home benefits paid to, or in respect of, a person because of their compensable injury up until compensation is payable will be recovered from the compensation payment. Where the amount of compensation is reduced because of contributory negligence, the amount of benefits to be recovered will be determined on the basis of the reduced compensation award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compensation claimants will be required to identify all services received in respect of the compensable injury prior to the compensation case being finalised. Insurers and compensation payers will then be notified by the Health Insurance Commission of the amount to be reimbursed to the Commonwealth. This will be done prior to the compensation amount being determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the debt will be the compensable person's, insurers or compensation payers will be liable to the Commonwealth for payment of the amount claimed from the compensation. Payment will be made by the insurer or compensation payer at the time compensation becomes payable. Given these arrangements, no appeals process against recoveries for past benefits is necessary because the claimant identifies the services in respect of the compensable injury and for which benefits have been paid.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say at the outset that the opposition agrees with the proposition that double dipping has to be avoided and that action should be taken to prevent it. It is precisely for that reason that we will not be opposing the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Bill 1994, the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Bill 1994, and the Health and Other Services (Compensation) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For exactly the same reason, we will be opposing the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Administration Fee Bill 1994. We will not be dividing on the administration fee bill, and I make that statement at the outset to assist the House with the allocation of time in this rather shortened, still Thursday sitting of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obligation to repay Medicare benefits paid in respect of a compensable person has been the law for some considerable time. The problem is that it has not been complied with or there have been ways of avoiding it. The Health Insurance Commission and the Department of Human Services and Health have known that very well. Indeed, two years ago work was commenced in the department on this problem to find a way to ensure that these repayments were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills were then brought before the House on 16 November, I believe. It was some two days after that that we, the opposition, contacted the various people who would be affected by this legislation, including insurance companies and people who would otherwise be known as compensation payers, to advise them and to seek their opinion. I can only say that the response was, as I am coming to learn in this area of health, to be expected. The response from the people we contacted was nothing but complaint about the way in which there had been a failure to consult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read some extracts from the responses I have received. I am even going to take the precaution of not naming the particular companies that have responded in these terms because there is a feeling out there in the electorate that this government is of such a vindictive nature that it often takes action against people who complain about it. Mr Speaker, if you or anybody wants to see the correspondence I am perfectly happy to make it available. The first of these comments was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the industry offered to work with the Government in a submission dated August 30 1993 but consultation did not take place.</PARA>
<PARA>A second one stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been no consultation with the State stakeholders and the legislation has enormous implications for the administration and operation of the compensation schemes.</PARA>
<PARA>An insurance company stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have had no opportunity to consider the full impact of the requirements nor have we had an opportunity to have any input.</PARA>
<PARA>A state body stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there has been no prior consultation with this office . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Another insurance company stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are writing to express our serious concern that these four bills have been brought forward without any consultation with insurers.</PARA>
<PARA>The Insurance Council of Australia stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we strongly believe it appropriate that any debate be delayed until such time as full and proper consultation can occur with insurers and other compensation payers.</PARA>
<PARA>There are matters of considerable substance which were raised by the industry which should have been properly addressed by the government before proceeding with legislation. Another insurer said that it is outrageous that the industry should assist the government through reporting procedure and then have to pay $10 million for the privilege of doing so. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ultimately these costs will be passed on to the consumer.</PARA>
<PARA>Another state work authority body stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the notification requirements placed on insurers appear to be unnecessarily complex and onerous.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet another insurer referred to the additional administrative burden likely to be imposed on the industry, costing time and money. The Insurance Council of Australia expressed a similar view. In other words, here is a process where we have taken two years to produce legislation. None of the people who ought to have been consulted about the final form have been consulted, despite the fact that many of them have made it quite clear that they are willing to be consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add final insult to injury, the mechanism by which this $40 million is to be clawed back is to be passed on to the insurers, who are going to have to collect the money, at their own expense, and pass it back to the government. Talk about double dipping. They are obliged to do the work and they are obliged to comply with this onerous legislation. Clause 28 of the bill alone shows members how onerous the legislation is. The explanatory memorandum puts it very succinctly when it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This clause provides that where a compensation payer or insurer is given notice of charge under clause 24 or under clause 25, the compensation payer or insurer must, within 28 days, pay to the Commonwealth the amount specified in the notice. Failure to do so constitutes an offence punishable by a maximum of 12 months imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA>We do not seem to put murderers in gaol for that length of time. If we go back to the act we find that the government does not intend to put the board members of insurance companies in gaol. There is a provision that that can be commuted down to a fine. Nonetheless, when people write and say that these are very onerous provisions they are correct in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a hugely complex administration system which insurers and other compensation payers are going to have to establish. They have been given no adequate consultation or estimation as to how long that is going to take them or how that is going to function and operate, onerous penalties have been put in place to operate as soon as the bill comes into operation and, on top of that, they are going to have to pay for the privilege of giving money to the government. Talk about double dipping. It has been the law for a number of years that these amounts of money should be reclaimed by the Commonwealth, but there has been no political will to do it. Two years it has taken to get to this stage of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timetabling was amazing. As I said right at the beginning, it came in on 16 November. We sent out material on 18 November. Then I got a little request: `Do you think we could agree for these bills to go through the parliament without there being any objection; that we could slip them through the second chamber perhaps?' I said, `I would like to have the opportunity of knowing what is in them.' So we had a briefing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say in all honesty that the briefing I received on these bills from the people who came to give me the briefing was far superior to the one I received several days later from the minister's private office and the department concerning the other bills that were introduced into this place this week&mdash;namely, the ones affecting private health insurance&mdash;which I can only describe as appalling and misleading. In this particular briefing there was no misleading and there was a frankness which was not in existence in the second briefing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it mildly, in that briefing I was told that batches of information had been sent out to various people affected and that the last one went out as late as last Thursday, I think. I am sure there will be a note sent to correct me if it was Wednesday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long and the short of it is that somebody has put pressure on the department to race it through. Who could that possibly be, do you think? Do you think it could possibly be the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), who never shows up; the minister for health who has not once since she has been in the parliament brought in or debated her own legislation? She usually leaves it to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), who, I must say, seems competent and does the job well. Perhaps we are to be blessed that he does it and is on top of the work. From the press conferences, from the bits of paper that slip out of the minister's office, all I can say is that we probably are better served in the parliament by the parliamentary secretary dealing with legislation than we would be if the minister did it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that she is paid to be the minister. She is paid to be on top of her legislation, to bring it in, to answer criticisms and to debate it. I was told by my colleagues in Western Australia that the minister was very good at running away; that she did not like confrontation, that she did not like to be questioned. I can only say that I have found that to be very true. Anyone who cares to look at the tape of her speech on the matter of public importance&mdash;we finally did get her up here on a matter of public importance after three tries&mdash;will see why she likes to run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not good enough for that minister to put pressure on her department and say, `Can't we slip these bills through the parliament in the last week of the sitting?' That is presumably so they will be available for budget considerations. That is not a reasonable request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again and again I hear grumblings coming out of the public sector in this area: the minister never comes to Canberra; the public servants have to go to Perth. The costs are escalating. She is rostered on in this parliament only twice a week&mdash;Monday and Tuesday&mdash;in question time. As I said, never does she come into this chamber to debate her legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today is another example. Where is she? She has gone home, I suppose, to Perth. The rest of us remain here to get on with the job. Lots of us had other things to do this morning. Lots of us had pressing commitments, yet we are here to deal with the business of this place because it takes priority. When you are elected to parliament and are given the responsibility of being a minister and responsibility for policy making and introduction of legislation, you have a duty to be present.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is somebody over there, whose name I can never remember, who thinks it is amusing that the parliament should be treated with contempt. As I said, the opposition is in favour of ensuring that double dipping does not occur. There has been no effective mechanism, prior to this bill, to ensure that that money is collected. The estimated $40 million that will be clawed back is, at best, a guesstimate. It may be more, but it is a conservative estimate. The figure of $10 million, which is to be paid on occasions by compensation payers is again a guesstimate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the insurers and the compensation payers have said, `There has been no consultation with us. We have no idea how much it will cost us to put in place the new mechanism.' This is despite the fact that they are willing to comply. Now they are to be hit with a double-dip fee from the Health Insurance Commission. Quite clearly, this legislation is asking insurers and other composition payers to absorb the cost of complying, from their point of view, with the provisions contained in the legislation. But the Health Insurance Commission is not so prepared. It is time the Health Insurance Commission got its act into gear. It is time for the commission to run itself efficiently so that it is able, from all the material that it has been gathering for so many years, to be readily available to raise a bill and send it on without putting another impost of $10 million on the industry and therefore the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is no need for me to go through the various provisions stating precisely what the bill does, except to mention the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Charges Bill, which is a piece of insurance the government has taken out in case, under section 55 of the constitution, it is construed to be a tax.

The shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), in her 14 minutes of contribution spent 10 minutes personally attacking the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). She raised a whole range of spurious points that have no relevance to the debate before the chamber and have no relevance to this legislation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ST4">Mr GIBSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I felt it was important to set the record straight, since we had so many inaccuracies this morning from the member for Mackellar. The bills before the House are designed to introduce measures to address the problem of double dipping in the federal government's health and community services programs by people who have received compensation for injuries they have sustained. Double dipping occurs when a person in receipt of a compensation payment, to cover medical and other care costs relating to a compensatable injury, does not reimburse the cost of the services already provided through health programs subsidised by the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Double dipping hits the wider community through taxpayer-funded or subsidised programs and through increased insurance premiums. People are paying more for their health care costs because the Commonwealth is covering a person for the medical expenses incurred as a result of an injury and for which compensation can later be gained but when that person gains a compensation payment for that injury he or she is then not paying back the Commonwealth for the costs of those medical services that have been provided. So such people are getting two bites at the cherry. They get free medical services provided through Medicare and then get paid, through their insurance, for the provision of those free medical services or subsidised medical services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures contained in this package of bills will save the government an estimated $40 million, although it will cost $10 million to administer, due to data storage requirements and the resources needed for identification and recovery measures. These savings will free up funds for use in other areas of the health portfolio, allowing these additional funds to be spent on things such as public hospitals, nursing homes, aged care facilities and pharmaceutical benefits, et cetera&mdash;all of which will benefit the wider Australian community. I am pleased that the shadow minister has indicated that the opposition will be supporting all of the legislation bar the imposition of the administration charge. I will talk about that shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for this legislation is highlighted by the number of factors which show an alarming number of compensated people are double dipping into the health system. Much of the substance of this legislation has been borne out of recommendations contained in a discussion paper called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Compensation and Commonwealth Health and Community Services Programs</EMPHASIS>, released in June 1993. It was then distributed to all of the people involved in insurance and compensation payments. There were great opportunities for the industry to be involved in this process. It knew what the Commonwealth was about. It knew what the intentions of the Commonwealth were in producing this legislation to respond to the issues raised in this discussion paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review found that double dipping was a widespread practice with significant financial implications for the Commonwealth's programs. Although it is difficult to calculate, the discussion paper found that over $700 million is spent annually on treatment costs for compensatable people. This figure includes only workers compensation board and motor vehicle accident cases. The treatment includes hospital, nursing home, and medical and community health service outlays, with hospital costs comprising 34.2 per cent and medical costs 38.7 per cent of the total. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for this legislation is very hard to deny, and I think that is recognised by the opposition. The discussion paper identified that over 50 per cent of all inquiries to the Health Insurance Commission from solicitors just prior to settlement of a case were the first time that the Health Insurance Commission knew that there was a case pending for compensation. A Health Insurance Commission survey in 1988 found that about 700 letters per month were received from solicitors seeking data for use in settling compensation claims. Over half of these were the first indication to Medicare that such a claim existed. With statistics like these, it is anticipated that this package of bills will provide an effective process for greater identification and recovery from cases. The discussion paper went on to comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incentives for patients are to not disclose compensatable status when a lump sum settlement is concluded, when service costs have been redeemed under a statutory scheme and when the right to compensation is in doubt, as is the case in many pending common law motor vehicle cases.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, this double-dipping process has been a drain on Australia's health resources for a number of years. In 1980 a study of compensation recipients by consultants Neave and Howell found that eight years after receiving compensation, about half of those still alive required medical treatment for their injuries in the preceding year, and nearly 21 per cent had 10 or more accident related visits to a doctor or physiotherapist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The findings of the discussion paper released last year mirrored this earlier survey. This is a massive double drain on public and private health insurance funds which is not acceptable to most fair-minded Australians. Theoretically, these accident related costs should be met from the damages payments that were awarded. However, there are shortcomings in the existing legislation. The proposed legislation will enable us to find out about these cases and to in fact pursue those funds that are owed back to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compensated accident victims are required to indicate this fact to Medicare and private insurers and are then ruled ineligible for benefits. In reality, this group have not been meeting the full costs of their treatment and are still receiving the full form of subsidy from the Commonwealth. In general terms, this is not because of any intentional deceit or questionable honesty on the part of the compensatable people, but rather a lack of information and knowledge by those parties involved about how they should go about the process of repaying the Commonwealth. Again, as the discussion paper noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Health Insurance Act contains no relevant powers to require information about compensation. It contains no provisions for data linkage or the exchange of information between compensation authorities or providers and Commonwealth authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>This legislation clarifies the situation by requiring all insurers and other compensation payers to notify the Health Insurance Commission of all claims lodged for compensation for personal injury where liability is not accepted at the outset. It will also require payers of compensation to provide notification of all settlements and judgments in personal injury cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation provides for the recovery of all Medicare and nursing home benefits paid up to the time compensation is payable for services provided to a compensatable person because of the injury. The Commonwealth will recover these amounts directly from the insurer on the occasion of settlement or judgment. Where contributory negligence has the effect of reducing the amount of compensation awarded, a proportional recovery of benefits will be allowed. It should be noted that these requirements will not impact negatively in any way on the rights and entitlements of the person seeking compensation at the time of judgment and settlement. They will seek only to recover and prevent compensatable persons from gaining dual access to federal health services in future years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure the effective operation of the main thrust of this legislation, this package of bills includes the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Bill, which has been drafted in case the judiciary interprets the recovery of these benefits to be a form of taxation. The constitution requires taxation matters to be isolated in an act, hence we have this particular bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package also includes the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Administration Fee Bill, which provides the administrative framework for this package of measures. The opposition has indicated its intention to oppose this bill. Its main feature is the existence of an administration charge on insurers to meet the operating costs of the improved identification and recovery mechanisms. The fee applies to every case where there is an amount payable to the Commonwealth under the new legislation. It becomes payable on the occasion of a case being finalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A two-tier fee structure will operate&mdash;$150 for cases finalised within five years of injury, and $300 for claims finalised after this period. This fee differential arises out of the need to store data on long-term claims for longer periods than is usual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also included in the package is the Health and Community Services (Compensation) (Consequential Amendments) Bill. This bill makes necessary consequential amendments to the National Health Act 1953 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>The shadow minister commented that there was a lack of consultation in the preparation of this bill. However, this matter was outlined in quite extensive detail in the review of the compensation of Commonwealth health and community service programs, which was released as a discussion paper in June 1993 and was forwarded to all those insurance companies. Therefore, they did have the opportunity to put forward their views, and they knew that the Commonwealth was working on this matter. The paper ensured that insurers knew that the Commonwealth was seeking to address this problem in this way. Any legislative measures that needed to be developed to address the widespread practice of double dipping, which we are seeking to address today, were going to be impossible to frame without imposing new requirements on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit inconsistent of the opposition to argue in this place, as it consistently does, that the Commonwealth should be seeking to reduce its costs, that it should be seeking to balance the budget and to reduce the deficit; yet where there is a legitimate process contained in legislation which seeks to recover from industry the costs of a measure which the opposition knows the industry should be meeting but has not been meeting to date, it seeks to oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite a legitimate process for the government to require the insurance industry to cover the costs of the administration of these new measures and it is not something that the insurance companies would not have been expecting. Of course, they are going to write letters to the member for Mackellar saying, `Yes, we think it is dreadful we are going to have to pay this charge.' I would not expect insurance companies to say anything less. But they know that it is quite reasonable, they know that it is quite legitimate, they know that it is not an unreasonable fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a legitimate responsibility to ensure that the industry meets the costs of recovering this process, recovering the $40 million that is involved per annum. This recovery process will ensure that the Commonwealth has access to additional funds that can help it meet its other requirements in the health and human services portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is pleased to be able to bring this legislation forward and we look forward to the opposition's support for the package of bills, apart from the one bill to which it has indicated its opposition. I again say that I think the opposition is being totally inconsistent in its opposition to this bill when compared with the statements that it makes in this place from time to time regarding the requirements of the government to meet its financial obligations and to reduce the deficit. This package of bills will achieve significant justice and end the double dipping process that has been occurring, and I urge the support of the House for all of the legislation before us today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of bills are being debated cognately at this time. I want to concentrate my remarks this morning on the main bill in the package&mdash;the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Bill. The reason I rise in this debate is related to part 2, division 2, clauses 9 and 10 of the main bill. Division 2 relates to the recovery of costs in respect of compensable persons, as defined, who have received residential care in a nursing home funded by a Commonwealth nursing home benefit. This relates to my responsibility as shadow minister for aged care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, compensable persons affected by division 2 will be residents in nursing homes who are, in the most part, younger than 60 years of age. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's welfare 1993: services and assistance</EMPHASIS>, in 1992 there were 2,426 residents of nursing homes under the age of 60. I assume that today the current number of such residents would be very similar to that of 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussing the cost of their care we should reflect on the fact that these people reside in nursing homes because of physical infirmity due to injury, illness or disability. Many have active minds living in a badly damaged or disabled body. The two most common reasons for a younger person having to be in a nursing home are multiple sclerosis or a motor car accident. All things considered, these people have a difficult and tragic existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is not the scope of the debate here today, while mentioning this issue I will reflect on the fact that the needs of younger people in nursing homes may not be, or are not, the same as older people in nursing homes. It is a sad commentary that in this country we do not provide specific facilities to cater for the needs of younger people in nursing homes. These people by and large are able to make a choice: they could choose to be in a mainstream nursing home or they could choose to be in a nursing home which caters specifically for the needs of younger people. Today they do not have that choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before making specific comments on the main bill, I would like to reiterate that the federal coalition is as keen as the  government to close off avenues for double dipping of health benefits wherever they may arise. This naturally includes circumstances such as those anticipated in this legislation: namely, compensation, damages or other financial settlements that have been paid to or on behalf of people who have sustained an injury or suffered from a disease which is subject to compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the explanatory memorandum for this bill explains that part 2, division 2 is intended to apply to nursing homes benefits the same cost recovery provisions that part 1, division 1 of the bill applies to Medicare benefits. I also note that the intention of division 1, which the nursing home provisions are intended to mirror, is to ensure that a compensable person does not enjoy the financial benefit of some form of financial settlement which covers medical service costs incurred under the Medicare scheme. I am advised that this closes off a loophole in the Health Insurance Act, and as such it is timely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the similar provisions proposed for nursing home benefits in division 2, I have some concerns. These concerns are not, as I have just indicated, with the principle or policy of preventing double dipping but with some of the practical issues that arise in attempting to address these issues through this legislation. My two particular concerns come under two broad headings: first, the relationship of clause 9 and clause 10 of the main bill and the National Health Act&mdash;in particular, section 59 of that act; and, secondly, some of the logistical problems I anticipate in trying to give effect to the broad intent of this legislation in the context of a nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making my comments, I have had a look at the 1993 discussion paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Compensation and Commonwealth health and human services programs</EMPHASIS>. The paper, authored for the government compensation review by Mr Tom Brennan, contains proposals which are reflected in the outcomes of the review process. In preparing this legislation, I am assuming that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and her advisers are endorsing Brennan's views. Yet, when looking at the main bill now before us, I cannot help thinking that they have somehow missed a point about the relationship between compensable persons, nursing home care and financial settlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 5 of the discussion paper makes the a few relevant observations: first, nursing homes are subsidised by the Commonwealth under the National Health Act 1953 and, second, section 59 of that act provides for preclusion from nursing home benefits, by reason of compensation and recovery of those benefits, when compensation is paid to a person who is receiving or has received residential care. As it stands, the catch with section 59 of the National Health Act is that it imposes a liability at the discretion of the minister, or her delegate, to repay nursing home benefits on the nursing home proprietor. This is because the proprietor, and not the nursing home resident, is the legal receiver of Commonwealth funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Tom Brennan proposed, however, in his discussion paper&mdash;what I am assuming the government is taking up here&mdash;is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A . . . legislative scheme (which) would place liability on the participants in the compensation: first the insurer; second the compensation payer; and third the patient.</PARA>
<PARA>Brennan goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By removing proprietors from the compensation recovery provisions the Commonwealth could enhance the prospect of proprietors identifying compensable patients.</PARA>
<PARA>This, in my reading at least, is what clauses 9 and 10 of the main bill set out to do. But this does not change the legal beneficiary relationship of the proprietor to the Commonwealth under the National Health Act. This will not change even though section 59 of that act will be amended to state that proprietors will not, as I read the consequential amendments, be liable to repay nursing home benefits prior to the making of a settlement, judgment or reimbursement arrangement after the day the present legislation comes into force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While, therefore, the proposed consequential amendment to the National Health Act is intended to take proprietors out of the particular loop of liability as Brennan intended, proprietors still are the legal point of receipt for Commonwealth nursing home benefits. This seems to be a latent ambiguity which could create uncertainty for nursing home proprietors, if not actual financial detriment. The simple question I, therefore, put to the government is: just what thought has been given to the role of the nursing home proprietor and the new set of financial relationships covered by this legislation? I am not convinced at this time that the financial and operational interests of nursing home proprietors are protected adequately by this legislation. The coalition would appreciate some clarification of the future role for proprietors as it is envisaged by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When regulations for the operation of this legislation are placed before the parliament we, on this side, will be scrutinising the small print very closely to ensure that proprietors, as much as persons paying or receiving financial rewards, are dealt with equally and fairly. I would not want to see, for example, a possible situation where nursing home proprietors are pressured financially if, for some reason, the Commonwealth cannot recover its nursing home benefit outlay from other parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concerns I would like to raise in this debate go to the likely effectiveness of processes and procedures which would implement the provisions of the main bill in the nursing home sector. Once again, I wonder whether the government has thought through its proposals in the light of everyday reality of nursing home funding practices. To give some very brief background, funding nursing home beds takes into account the following funding components as part of the basic nursing home benefit: firstly, the care aggregated module, CAM, which covers nursing and other personal care services. As members may be aware, there are different rates of CAM which are intended to reflect the degree of care required by each individual resident as assessed through what is known as the resident classification instrument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the standard aggregated module, SAM, which reimburses the nursing home on a dollar per bed basis for its overall general operating expenses, such as cooking and  cleaning services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, other costs reimbursed expenditure, OCRE, which is a formula covering nursing homes for such special expenses as leave loadings and workers compensation. This expenditure, particularly CAM and SAM expenditure, is subjected by the government to checks and reviews. Most importantly, there are annual reconciliations of Commonwealth payments to nursing homes at the end of each financial year, and there are validations conducted by the Department of Human Services and Health of CAM and SAM expenditure of nursing homes. These validations are intended to ensure that the government and the taxpayers' funds are paid to nursing homes and are spent appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But validations are a problem for nursing homes and their operators, a problem which relates to the matters at hand before the House. This is because the present cumbersome nature of the CAM-SAM validation process is slow and ponderous. It is a process that is seriously disliked by the industry and it flies in the face of good management and good accounting practices. It should be noted that in 1994-95 validations are still taking place for expenditure incurred as long ago as 1986-87, with consequential funding adjustments being made to nursing home entitlements going back six to seven years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the operating realities of nursing homes, this is ancient history but the fact remains that nursing homes can and do find themselves owing money to the government arising from validated funding adjustments relating to operational expenses many years previously. This is not the place to debate the rights or wrongs of the validation process, but what I am endeavouring to show here is that the final per bed CAM and SAM costs of nursing home care will not, in all likelihood, be known for many years, as many as seven or eight years from the time that expenditure is incurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Bevis), who is at the table, suggested that these bills would enable precise costs already incurred to be factored into subsequent compensation payments or other financial settlements. On the basis of the matters I have outlined, I cannot share the parliamentary secretary's confidence on this point. Taking validated expenditure into account, if a compensated person's nursing costs need to be adjusted after a recovery is made by the Commonwealth, would the person be entitled to a credit if one was found due, or would he or she be subject to further payments six or seven years down the road?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would therefore suggest, for the consideration of the Minister for Human Services and Health and her parliamentary secretary, that any regulations, guidelines or directions made under part 1, division 2 of the main bill refer to validated expenditure and not just the raw estimate of nursing home benefit expenditure for a compensable person receiving residential care. This is a difficult problem, even allowing for the timelags inherent, for instance, in seeking a personal injury award through common law processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such delays in cost reckoning or in the receipt and calculation of damages or other financial settlements can lead conceivably to financial detriment being suffered by the types of parties identified in this legislation or by nursing home proprietors. Once again, it is important for the government to ensure that guidelines and processes under this legislation work fairly and equitably for all concerned while seeking to achieve the broad purposes of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I would like to make a brief point about consultation. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) has also had something to say about this from her perspective. In preparing for this debate, I consulted with a senior and deeply knowledgeable officer in a nursing home industry organisation about the implications of these bills. Those consultations reinforced my broad reservations about the possible orientation of part 1, division 2 of this main bill. This officer, who should know, was asked whether his organisation was consulted by the Minister for Human Services and Health, her predecessor, or the Department of Human Services and Health in the preparation of this legislation. It will be no surprise to the House to learn that the answer was a decided no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and time again in my portfolio area I come across actions of a government which invariably insists that it knows best, a government that tells the aged care industry what to do, even though proprietors and managers have a great wealth of experience to share with government. This may be the Labor way, but it may result in legislation which, like this, can look good on paper but can run into difficulties when the time comes to implement it. I can assure the House that lack of consultation will not be a feature of the next coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to make a comment following on from the member for Mackellar's comment that neither the minister nor her parliamentary secretary saw fit to introduce this bill. I have concerns about this bill. I have tried to bring them here in a constructive and cooperative way. The concerns relate to how this bill may actually function in operation. I could have tried to move amendments. I could have seen that when it finally gets to the Senate it goes to an inquiry, that it gets held up. I have not done that.</PARA>

But the simple courtesy of the minister or her parliamentary secretary has not been shown to me or this House by their coming in here and at least listening to the debate on their bill. This House operates largely by consent, far more than the general public would ever realise. That consent relies on courtesies and conventions. If people do not think those courtesies or conventions are important, then we are not doing our job that people send us here to do, and pay us a very handsome salary to do. I am prepared, on legislation like this, to remain cooperative but, quite frankly, if the minister cannot be bothered to turn up for her legislation, if she cannot even be bothered to send the parliamentary secretary, she should not be surprised if there is a touch less cooperation in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Bill and related bills obviously address a very serious issue. The matter of double dipping costs the government and taxpayers, so it is right that the general drift of what is being presented to the House receives my support. The problems are apparently quite widespread. A review in 1992 revealed this quite clearly. Again, it has taken all this time to get some correcting legislation to the House. That is disappointing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills attempt, by my understanding, to address the issue by the development of improved systems to identify compensation claimants firstly and then to provide some teeth in recovery mechanisms of moneys that should rightly be directed to health, particularly to Medicare, thus saving the government an estimated $40 million or $50 million per year. Apparently there is also something like 73,000 compensation cases of this nature every year. Obviously it is going to be a massive task and again it requires the establishment of a large bureaucracy for its administration. This leads me and my coalition colleagues to the very first problem of this bill&mdash;it has already been addressed&mdash;that is, the cost has to be passed on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also disturbing to me to see the complete lack of consultation with the major players in this particular area, most particularly those insurers who are going to be required under this legislation to pick up the tab. Time and time again in this House&mdash;and I realise I have only been here a short time&mdash;this government seems to ignore the fact that it does not legislate in a vacuum. It does not have a charter to legislate without proper consultation, particularly with the people that the legislation will directly affect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Agency is an example of this. There are many others. The superannuation guarantee charge is another example where a huge monster is created, the mechanisms are not properly considered and no study is previously initiated to find out what the impact of such legislation will be. The superannuation guarantee charge has collected in its huge net such people as itinerant seasonal workers, whom I do not believe it was intended to collect. I remember in my first few months in this House asking the then Treasurer whether he could tell me how many such accounts for itinerant workers exist across Australia. He could not tell me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, it was revealed that there was between one million and two million of these accounts, with less than $100 in them being consumed by the management fees of insurance companies. I just use that as another example of legislation that was hastily brought to the House without proper consideration that then became a problem for the community. Enormous paperwork is involved to discover very little benefit at the end of the day for a small segment of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has the same ingredients all over again. The government does not seem to learn. I am also concerned after being made aware that the major players received the brief of this legislation only a matter of days before it was introduced into the House. This is simply not good enough. The community out there, and particularly the major players who are affected by the legislation, deserve the right to be properly consulted, properly briefed and have their concerns heard&mdash;even though the government might ultimately ignore their concerns. But, in this case, those people have not even had an opportunity to air those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems completely unfair to me that, with the way this legislation will work, an administrative fee will have to be charged. That total is still only estimated as being $10 million a year. It will not surprise me in the least if, once this monster gets under way, just like many other monsters we have seen which have been generated from this place, the matter worsens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand from the legislation that the fee to be charged for claims finalised within five years of the date of injury will be $150; for those claims settled five years after the date of injury, it will be around about $300. There is absolutely no doubt that these charges will subsequently have an impact on the premiums charged by insurance companies for coverage by their disability insurance&mdash;absolutely no doubt at all. Yet we have not had presented to us in this House for any consideration at all any kind of impact statement that has at least some sort of assessment of what that impact will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is completely improper. I am certainly not happy with it. I stand with my other colleagues on this side of the House in opposing particularly that bill which imposes an administrative charge. It is obvious that, for every $4 recovered from individual compensation recipients, a further $1 will be charged as an administration fee. And even that is only a guesstimate, a best guess, without any rationale or considered committee work or consultation with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that, with the premiums for disability insurance&mdash;and I use as an example the pressure that is currently being applied to the health insurance industry itself which has been created by the dramatic exodus from private insurance companies which has occurred; over the last 12 months that exodus has numbered in the order of 300,000 Australian families&mdash;and with fewer participants in private health insurance, the pressure on premiums is immense and increasing. Over the last 10 years there has been a dramatic decline in the number of Australians who are prepared to fund their own health insurance. In February 1984, 59 per cent of the population maintained private health insurance. That has currently fallen to something like 34 or 35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the fall in the number of people who are members of the private health insurance system but the changing profile of those who remain in it. Healthy people drop out because of the pressure of trying to maintain an ever increasing premium and so reduce the cross-subsidy that is available to compensate for that older group of Australians who probably use their health insurance more than the younger ones do. This is made starkly evident by looking at the number of people over the age of 65. In 1992-93, the number of people who were 65 years and over increased by 12,000 people just in 12 months to 844,000. The number of people who were younger than 65 fell by 208,000 down to 6,124,000. This puts pressure on premiums so that they rise, which results in a greater number of young people exiting private health insurance, so premiums rise even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly alarmed, as I represent a very depressed financial environment in a rural electorate, that those people from the farming community just have no capacity to maintain their private health insurance and are exiting it at an alarming rate. This represents an even worse problem. In small communities throughout my electorate, the hospital system has been created by bush nursing hospitals. These are not public hospitals, they are private hospitals, their status as such this Commonwealth government sees fit to maintain. People cannot get access to hospital care through a bush nursing hospital, unless they maintain their private health insurance. This is grossly inconsiderate, given the fact that these bush nursing hospitals have been placed in a community at no cost to government, no cost whatsoever out of community generated funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Bush nursing hospitals, before admitting patients, require them to be members of a private health insurance fund. I think this is a situation which should be reviewed urgently by the minister responsible. I mention that because it is compounding now. Many people cannot maintain their health insurance because of the dire economic circumstances that they face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to complete that point, it is interesting to note&mdash;and I know this from maintaining my own private health insurance&mdash;that, in the last 10 years, the private health insurance premium for my family has more than doubled. Looking at the statistics provided by the private health insurance council in its statistical supplement last year, in 1984-85 there were approximately $1.5 billion of premium contributions through private health insurance covering about 7.5 million people. For 1992-93 premium revenue was $4.1 billion covering 6.9 million people. It is very difficult to determine what escalation in average premium that represents. But in 1992-93 broadly it means that it costs in excess of about $500 per person to maintain private health insurance, whereas back in 1984 it was roughly $200 per person. So, in a family of four, like mine, to maintain private health insurance every year, that represents roughly about $2,000. This is an alarming problem, and I repeat the calls which have been made from this side of the House for the government to urgently address that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to my point about the lack of consultation. This government seems to continue with its big stick in complete disregard for the community. From the amount of insurance industry representation that has been presented to the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Mackellar, (Mrs Bishop), who is at the table, concern is evident about the likely impacts of this legislation. I think the government ought to consult more widely with the industry because, in effect, the impact will be direct on those persons whom the government purports to support&mdash;the subscribers to disability insurance, which affects every Australian. I urge the government to change its profile in the way it presents its legislation and consult much more widely with the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Be that as it may, it is regrettable that an attack on the minister for health has been launched by her shadow. On these issues of great public importance, such as this legislation and the serious things happening in the health portfolio, the government and the people of Australia at the end of 1994 would be happy and excited at the way in which the minister for health has made the transfer from Western Australian politics to national politics and has taken on this difficult portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the cabinet, the minister has introduced significant reforms, ensuring greater competition between private health insurance funds. Yesterday, our caucus received a briefing on the findings of the Baume report, which will increase the supply of specialists in Australia to meet demand and end some of the bottlenecks that have occurred in various aspects of specialty medical practice. Most significantly, the broad agenda for health reform is now before COAG. Various papers have been prepared on the rationalisation of federal and state health responsibilities to get better integration of the health system, to make sure it is more efficient and make sure the health system is much more cost effective. This legislation is an important step in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister for health has demonstrated that, in Australian politics in 1994, it is easier to make the transfer from the premiership in Western Australia to the House of Representatives than it is to transfer across the corridor. It looks a short walk but it has been a long walk from the Senate to the House of Representatives for the shadow minister. She would be much better served addressing the major issues on the health agenda in Australia about the rationalisation of services, the COAG agenda, the private health insurance industry reforms and the substance of matters rather than taking out personal criticism and vendettas against the minister for health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are important issues in the nation. Every citizen in every part of the country has strong interests in health. I know that it is the honourable member for Mackellar's style to provoke confrontation, bitterness and anger. These matters are much too important for that style of politics. That is the contrast between the minister and the shadow minister. The minister gets on with the substance of the policy agenda and the reforms that are needed, but the barking from the member for Mackellar only provokes confrontation. These issues are much too important for that narrow and bitter style of politics. It is regrettable, indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister and her colleagues, including the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), who spoke before me, would be better off concentrating their endeavours on an understanding of how the health system works: that is, the responsibilities of the public sector and the responsibilities of the private sector. In the end, the key issues should not be whether or not the citizens and taxpayers of Australia are paying for health and other services out of tax, or out of their pocket, but whether there is efficiency and equity in the service delivery. This is where the coalition and its spokesperson fall down time after time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mallee has criticised this legislation. He is concerned with the increase in private insurance costs because of the administration charge posed by the legislation. The same party and the same shadow spokesperson are always saying that the government needs to do a lot more to reduce the burden on the taxpayer. This legislation should be supported because it meets that demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package of bills will produce an annual savings to the federal budget of $40 million. During her time as a senator on the public accounts committee, the member for Mackellar had a very public and well exposed record of positioning herself as a watchdog on the public purse by arguing for savings across the board. I would have thought she would be the first person to walk into this parliament and endorse an annual saving to the federal budget of $40 million. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow minister concentrated her remarks on attacks on the minister for health. If you were serious about your contribution in this debate, you would not be attacking the minister for health but would be pointing out your bipartisan support for an annual saving of $40 million. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot have the saving on the federal budget of $40 million per annum and also complain about your claim of an increase in private insurance rates because of the administration charge in this legislation. You are embracing the politics of the magic pudding. Your simplistic style of political analysis always relies on taking the best of both worlds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here in the House of Representatives you cannot get away with that simplistic style of political debate. Either you can have the saving in the public sector and some marginal increases in private costs or you can have it the other way round. You cannot find the magic pudding in the House of Representatives for savings in both the public and the private sector. The honourable member&mdash;who made her reputation on the Public Accounts Committee by bashing public servants and taking out personal abuse on them&mdash;has been a little exposed in debates of this nature when she has had to responsibly face up to the way in which budgets are framed and costs are reduced in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to understand that any transfer of public costs to the private sector is still a burden on the citizens of Australia. The shadow minister, in her endorsement of tax breaks for private health insurance, does not really understand that fact. All she is doing is transferring outlays that would otherwise be borne by the public sector to the private sector, which demonstrates her lack of understanding on these key issues. She is obsessed with tax, but she is not willing to embrace the sorts of savings that are available. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I have been speaking on the bill. Opposition contributors to this debate have argued that the government should not increase the cost of private insurance through the administration charge in the legislation. If the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) had been here earlier, he would have understood that by listening to the contribution of the honourable member for Mallee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition cannot have it both ways. It cannot embrace a $40 million annual saving on the federal budget and also complain about an increase in private costs. There is no magic pudding in the health sector. There is no way public costs can be reduced without it having some impact on private costs. That is the point I make. It is a simple point. A first-year university student would understand these matters but they seem to be beyond the grasp of the shadow spokesperson; the member for Mallee; and, by his point of order, the right honourable member for New England. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is good legislation because it will make an important saving in the federal budget. It addresses the question of double-dipping, which occurs when a person receives a compensation payment to cover medical and other care costs for an injury but does not reimburse the Commonwealth for the cost of services he or she has already received through programs subsidised by the Commonwealth. It is good legislation. It is quite comprehensive legislation, in that it seeks to make a number of amendments to the National Health Act 1953, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the Health Insurance Act 1973. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me respond to some of the other issues raised by the honourable member for Mackellar. She raised the question, as did other contributors, as to why the insurance industry was not consulted about the new provisions. Let me provide the answer to that question. The new provisions arise from the findings of a discussion paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Compensation and Commonwealth health and community services programs</EMPHASIS> published in June 1993 by the Review of the Relationship between Compensation and Health and Community Services Programs. This paper was sent out to the insurance industry and others, and submissions were received on the policy issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been substantial consultation. A discussion paper was circulated and absorbed by the industry, and submissions were sent back. The review found that double dipping is widespread, with significant financial implications for Commonwealth programs. Any legislative measures developed to address such a widespread practice were going to be impossible to frame without imposing new requirements on the industry. The shadow minister is always seeking the best of both worlds. She wants tighter scrutiny of national budgets and savings for the taxpayer but she wants there to be no impact on the industry she seeks to defend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislative framework of the double-dipping provisions is the most straightforward possible. It balances the interests of insurers, people involved in compensation payments and the taxpayers generally. It is difficult in these circumstances to see how consultation could have assisted in this phase any more than it did. I do not think the honourable member for Mackellar in her remarks contributed anything positive as to how the consultation could have been further enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition speakers have raised the question of the effect of the new provisions on no fault compensation schemes, such as statutory workers compensation. Under the new provisions, any Medicare or nursing home benefits paid to or in respect of a person up until he or she is accepted as eligible for compensation under statutory no fault schemes have to be reimbursed to the Commonwealth by the schemes. Under existing legislation, the Commonwealth should already be reimbursed for any benefits that were paid prior to acceptance of the compensation claims, except that the statutory schemes reimburse the compensable person for costs incurred up until his or her compensation claim is accepted and then the person involved should reimburse the Commonwealth for any benefits that were paid. That fully answers the concerns of opposition members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question raised was: what is the effect on state and territory statutory compensation schemes? The creation and operation of statutory compensation schemes relating to injuries suffered by persons in any state is essentially a matter of state law. The double-dipping legislation does not attempt to impact in any direct way on the operation of state or territory compensation schemes. The legislation encompasses compensation paid under Commonwealth, state and territory statutory schemes as well as common law damages. However, the effect on statutory schemes is expected to be minimal. The reason is that, in general, statutory compensation schemes pay the medical and other care costs of the injured person as they are incurred from the time that the person's claim for compensation is accepted. This means that, in most statutory scheme cases, there will be no recoveries of Medicare or nursing home benefits to be made under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that, under the double-dipping legislation, the majority of statutory scheme cases will have to be notified to the Health Insurance Commission. Only those claims which are not accepted for periodic payments within six months of the claim being made will have to be notified. Very few cases fall into this category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question has been raised&mdash;it has been central to the contribution of the opposition&mdash;as to whether or not the new provisions will force insurance premiums to increase. In the longer term, there may be some upward pressure on compensation settlements as they more accurately reflect the true costs of injury. The $40 million per annum saving has been calculated on the basis of 73,000 cases a year being affected by these  provisions. That is an average recovery of approximately $550 for each case. This is unlikely to place much upward pressure on premiums. There certainly will not be any dramatic increase in premium costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government can be satisfied that the saving it makes in its budget is worth while. It should be embraced by the opposition, which should understand that a saving of this nature in the public sector which ends double dipping is good public policy. The new provisions will have minimal effect on statutory schemes, such as workers compensation schemes, because they provide for reimbursement of expenses as they are incurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further question that has been raised is whether or not these provisions create new bureaucracies funded at the expense of the insurance industry. The insurance industry is a multi-billion dollar industry in Australia. The cost of administering these provisions is approximately $10 million a year, with a staffing requirement of 156 officers in Health Insurance Commission offices around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Double dipping in relation to health and community services programs is estimated to cost the Australian taxpayer at least $40 million a year. Double dipping cannot be acceptable because the community in effect pays twice: firstly, through taxpayer funded or subsidised programs and, secondly, through insurance premiums. The central point of this package of bills now before the House is to tidy up the way in which these insurance and compensation arrangements have been made around Australia, to make sure there is no double burden on the taxpayer and to make sure that, if the taxpayer pays once with regard to compensation arrangements, those costs will be recouped by the Health Insurance Commission. It is a very effective reform. I would have thought it would have been embraced wholeheartedly by the honourable member for Mackellar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to my original point regarding the minister for health. This legislation, which she has passed through the cabinet and had introduced into the House, is part of a package of reforms that she has very skilfully introduced to national politics in 1994. Having been elected earlier this year, as was the minister, and having taken up a keen interest in health policy, I have been watching the performance of the minister for health and the shadow minister with enormous interest. Let us look at the record of the minister for health. She made that transfer from Western Australian politics to a federal ministry. She is right there in the cabinet. She introduced the very difficult private health insurance reforms and got effective competition into that industry for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to the commissioning of the Baume report. A former Senate colleague of the honourable member for Mackellar, Peter Baume, produced an outstanding report that all members should look at. I do not know whether the honourable member for Mackellar has had time to read it, but she should. I do not know whether she reads material produced by people like Peter Baume. His report is worth having a look at. He has produced some outstanding recommendations to try to increase the supply of specialists in Australia, to break those bottlenecks and to try to make the health system in this country work more effectively. Then there is the COAG agenda. On top of all this, the shadow minister, who was not invited to the Liberal Party party last night, as she mentioned earlier&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I specifically wish to draw attention to clause 28 of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Bill. That clause requires the compensation payer to pay the Commonwealth the amounts specified in the notice within 28 days after the day on which the notice was given. That also applies to an insurer. The penalty for failure to comply is 12 months imprisonment. I know that under section 4D(1) of the Crimes Act these penalties are only maximum and may be substituted with a fine or a fine imposed in addition to the imprisonment. Where a corporation is involved it will be a fine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to know why such a harsh penalty has been chosen when it is a question of clawing back money which is due and payable. As there is a lump sum payment involved, which is to be paid by way of compensation, it seems to me that the money available to be clawed back should be clawed back by way of a fine and not by way of imprisonment. I would like a comment on that because I think there is enormous concern in the community that insufficient penalties are imposed for violent crimes. When we make comparisons between the onerous nature of this clause and the sorts of sentences that are so often handed out for violent crimes, there seems to be some imbalance in our sense of justice. I would like to have some sort of response as to why that penalty was chosen and why it could not have simply been a monetary fine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity, as the Senate has not returned the legislation for which this chamber is now waiting, to return to the defence white paper 1994. It seems to me that many issues arise out of the defence white paper and in the few minutes that are available to me I would like to address a few of those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the areas in which Labor has failed the country miserably is defence. Successive defence white papers have outlined expectations for the amount of money that is to be allocated. There has been a glossy publication and a failure to fund the aspirations that that paper prescribes. Significantly, this white paper has reduced the amount of money to be provided and, we think, the expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy is that in the opening part of the defence white paper the government has, without doubt, set out the regional environment in which Australia must look at its defence. In doing so, it has set down what I think we all accept is the enhanced responsibility the Australian Defence Force has as we move towards the year 2000, to work cooperatively with the nations of our region to try to ensure that, if there should be an emerging threat, Australia would be able to play some important role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement does not at that stage but at a later stage refer to the defence role in peacekeeping. One of my concerns is that, having spoken about peacekeeping&mdash;I will come back to the funding of it in a moment&mdash;and having spoken of that regional role in defence, it then reverts to what I regard as the long since flawed conception that Professor Paul Dibb first enunciated: we should really worry predominantly about low level attacks on this nation of ours alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The structure of the Australian Defence Force in relation to attacking those low level defence threats has in one sense, I think, focused the attention of the Defence Force on a conceivable threat. But that focus is not, in my view, a realistic possibility. Indeed, in each of the successive Kangaroo exercises it has been apparent that the real deterrent to a low level threat is the police force and, particularly, the police forces of remote areas of Western Australia or the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even as far as the landing of refugees in their boats is concerned, we have already seen circumstances where those arrivals have walked downtown, found a telephone booth and rung up the local police to find out what they are going to do. When you hear of those circumstances, you realise that the main way you combat that low level defence threat, against which this white paper still seems to want the defence force oriented, is by ensuring that the Australian police forces, at the state and federal levels, have a capacity to deal with it and, of course, to work in conjunction with Customs, Coastguard and others to ensure that, if there should be some type of an intrusion on Australia's shores, there is a capacity to respond to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the opening chapter of the defence white paper embraces that regional concept, I believe the relationship between the old Dibb theory, which seems to preoccupy most of the objectives of the Defence Force, and the rest of the white paper is flawed.  I think it is very easy to identify the other failings of the Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second worry I have is that successively over the years the government has not got right the defence equipment, on which it has been spending a large amount of the defence vote. Not only has it not got it right; it has used the money it has been given to re-equip the Defence Force to the detriment of providing the high training and maintenance of the morale of the three uniformed services. I am most concerned that, as we look at the Australian Defence Force today, expert and brilliant though many of the aspects of it are, the morale in a number of the services has never been so low. That applies particularly to the Royal Australian Air Force and to elements of the Royal Australian Navy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I identify that at a time when the government, within this white paper, is still giving a lot of emphasis to what I see as some of the wrong priorities in re-equipping the Defence Force. I do not believe enough has been done to combat the inadequacies which are leading to an erosion of morale. That morale is absolutely critical if we are going to ask people to lay down their lives for the sake of the country. Underneath every commitment of a person in uniform is a fundamental and possible contingency which each might face. I will come back in a moment to what we should do about it and how we should go about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me revert now to re-equipment. The first area of my concern with Labor's planning has been its objective in trying to buy flogged off equipment, such as HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Westralia</EMPHASIS>. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Westralia</EMPHASIS> is a very good example of a ship that had been just about worn down by the British before we bought it. It cost a fortune to put her into place, and she is still nowhere near as effective as HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Success</EMPHASIS>. We have now done exactly the same thing. We have acquired, after considerable political duress from the United States, two vessels from the United States navy. Leaving aside the debacle of the government's mishandling of the situation&mdash;in that it did not register that there is both an administration and a legislature in the United Nations, so it did not set about trying to ensure that the United States Congress agreed with the sale&mdash;the sale consisted of two vessels that, in my view, are going to cost the Australian navy dearly before it has what it seeks. It would have been far better to have built those vessels in Australia. It certainly would have been far better if we had not bought ships that were just about worn out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to another aspect of the Defence Force that is talked about in relation to the army: the replacement of the APCs, the M113s. It is of real concern that we still have vessels that are grossly uncomfortable for the people who travel in them. If we are going to use such vessels in the tropics, they should not be ones that are particularly uncomfortable. The armour is too light for modern weapons; yet we are talking about upgrading them. What we should be doing is moving towards re-equipment by designing a vessel for the conditions which&mdash;if it is to be the white paper parameters&mdash;the white paper parameters have established. I do not believe we have done that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The LAV vehicle is not suitable. We bought a Canadian vehicle designed to operate in the Northern Hemisphere, where it is cold. We want something that can operate either in the tropics or in the northern part of Australia. The LAV vehicle and the M113s, the APCs, are not intended, nor are they designed, for those purposes. When the coalition government was in office, we started planning for Project Waler. Project Waler was designed to enable Australia to develop and design its own equipment to meet the requirements of the Australian Defence Force. In my view, it would be far better if we reinstated Project Waler to ensure that we have a vehicle designed to meet Australian conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a whole range of other instances where the government seems quite intent on going out and getting equipment off the shelf from other countries instead of trying to design, develop and manufacture equipment here. Sure, quite a deal has been done to try to manufacture equipment in Australia by way of the Anzac vessels and the new Collins class submarines. But in my view neither of those is ideally suited to Australian conditions, but that is another argument. The concern I have is that they both should have been designed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite fascinated to see that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is embracing the idea of trying to sell submarines to the Koreans. He should know that one of the troubles of the submarine design is that it is not ours; it belongs to the Swedes. We have the technical capacity in Australia to design things ourselves. Why has this government made our designs subservient to those acquired from Europeans, Americans or somebody else? The Prime Minister pretends to assert Australian sovereignty. All he does is subject Australia to acquiring designs from somebody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure we can take the advice of consultants, if need be. We can accept assistance from universities, academics and others who might help to develop designs suitable to Australia, but every one of the major pieces of equipment that has been manufactured in Australia in recent years has come from overseas, including even the Steyr rifle. What the devil is the government about? We built the Owen gun during World War II. Why can we not build a rifle for today? I think it is an absolute disgrace that this government has not tried to encourage design capability within this country instead of just looking at manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the rest of the white paper and a number of other areas that worry me. I think it is important that we look to addressing the morale problem which I identified earlier. Let us look at the Royal Australian Air Force. I am delighted to see that we will upgrade the F111C and that the F111G that has been acquired from the United States is now apparently coming into operation. We still have no airborne early warning system. Without that, we are not in a position to be able to direct those aircraft onto target. It is no use saying that Jindalee, as it is being developed and extended, will be able to do that. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Duncan" NAMEID="7G4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7G4">Mr Duncan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where was that designed?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Jindalee was designed, in part, in Australia from an American base. The problem is that without the Americans we would not have been able to get Jindalee off the ground, which is a great tragedy. At the same time, Jindalee is Australian to a greater degree than American. The problem is that, without the capability of airborne command and control systems, the capacity of our FA18s or F111s is significantly reduced. While yet again there is talk of acquiring them at some future time, the priority given to them, to my mind, is not adequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would have been appropriate in terms of our peacekeeping commitments to have looked at what we are going to do with the 707s, which are used now for both refuelling and transport operations within the Defence Force and for VIP operations. With their modern engines, they are not suited to landing. We have talked about airport noise at Mascot. One thing people forget is that modern aircraft engines have improved significantly and that today the level of aircraft noise is significantly lower than it used to be. Our 707s are very good examples of that. They cannot now be used in a lot of modern airports because the noise level is too high. I would have liked the defence white paper, in looking at the future of the air force, to have identified that we need to replace those 707s. It could have looked at refuelling. It could have looked at an aircraft which would also have been suitable for command and control, for an AWAC type capability. I think that should be given a higher priority than the defence white paper has given it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What worries me is that, in the nature of the defence white paper, there are problems in terms of budget availability. I do not accept that two per cent of the budget or of gross domestic product, with the idea of being able to top up the vote every time we have a peacekeeping obligation, is the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would far preferred to have seen that peacekeeping obligation put into the defence vote. There is certainly going to be an ongoing obligation by Australia, which we all support. I would have liked to have seen that vote increased to the point where we might have been able to undertake, for example, the acquisition of that replacement for the 707s that are now used for the transport of VIPs and refuelling. We would have had a new generation of aircraft there which would have given us that command and control function to which I referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other area I briefly want to refer to is defence science and technology. There has been a tremendous effort undertaken in that area over the years. I notice that two per cent of the defence vote is allocated to that. I am still worried about the extent to which that still seems to be very much a poor relation to the rest of the Defence Force. I think that has not been given enough emphasis in the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am equally concerned that there does not seem to be enough of a recognition of the role of the reserves. The new 5th Infantry Battalion, unfortunately, is only given a three- to four-year time frame. That, to my mind, should be accelerated in line with the peacekeeping report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to at least two years. I do not believe it should incorporate a company of reservists, for that is at about a quarter of its strength. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence white paper does embrace some excellent concepts. Regrettably, I do not believe the funding is there to meet them, nor do I believe the government is looking at Australia's overall civilian capability in the way that it might to enable Australia to undertake the level of defence that might be necessary in the forthcoming years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have always respected the approach of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) to defence, because I know that over a large number of years he has had a great deal of interest in defence matters and has served this country as a Minister for Defence. Nevertheless, despite that respect, I must draw his attention to the fact that in the 1993 election he was part of the coalition which campaigned for a $400 million cut to the defence budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be said that we on this side of the House are often bemused when the government is attacked for failing to spend sufficient funds on any one particular program. It is difficult to take the call for an increased defence vote from the honourable gentleman seriously when his own party has supported quite savage cuts to the defence vote. Having said that, it must also be realised that, when the opposition calls for massive cuts to the expenditure base of Australia, across a wide variety of areas it is in fact calling for an increase in expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple reality of the defence vote is that it is dependent upon the revenue base of the country and the economic demand on the expenditure side. Defence is one of those aspects in Australian expenditure which must be taken into account in the overall budget perspective. This government has a very proud record on defence. It is one which I am not ashamed of. My own interest lies very heavily in this area because the major army base at Puckapunyal is located in my electorate. For those who do not know, that is the home of the Australian Armoured Corps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corps was established during the First World War and was one of the very early armoured brigades that the Australian Army had. Its history throughout its formation period has been a very proud one. Even today at Puckapunyal they celebrate the Cambrai Day parade, which recognises the efforts of the Australian Armoured Corps in the Western theatre of the Second World War. As most members are aware, the major vehicle in the Armoured Corps today is the Leopard tank&mdash;a German tank&mdash;which we acquired some 20 years ago now. It is, in anyone's language, an ageing tank, yet it is still with its 105 millimetre cannon and its fairly modern firepower systems a most effective armoured weapon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with interest to the right honourable member for New England's attack on the government's armoured program. He seems to forget that the M113, whilst an old armoured personnel carrier, has through Australian design and Australian technology been varied for use in Australian conditions. For example, the M113 comes in various forms in Australia as a result of Australian design. There are a number of M113 armoured vehicles which have a scorpion turret. That carries a 75 pound cannon, which is a very effective close range support cannon in infantry actions. There are other M113s which have had similar firepower systems adapted to the basic armoured personnel carrier systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is wrong to say that Australia has not been adaptive and has not used its own design and its own technological processes to adapt different design systems from overseas to Australian circumstances. It really is quite ludicrous for any member of the opposition to suggest that the six new Collins submarines being built in Australia are not suitable for Australian conditions. I was quite bemused to hear the right honourable gentleman suggest that. Does he suggest, for example, that a submarine is less effective in southern waters than in northern waters? The whole concept of that approach really is quite ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a major upgrade in both the navy and the air force. The right honourable gentleman mentioned the F111Cs and the F111Gs. Currently, some $46 million is being expended on new avionics and fighter support systems in the F111. When that is completed, Australia will have, unarguably, the most advanced fighter bomber capacity in our part of the world. It is not to be sneezed at. He forgot to mention that the FA18 is still probably the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world and most certainly in our region. In terms of air force capacity, Australia is well placed, and is far in advance of any comparable country in our region, in terms of air strike capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new frigates are not to be sneezed at. They do incorporate Australian adaptions to foreign design. If we look at what the Collins class submarines have done by using Australian designed pumps on their torpedo systems, it is clear that Australia has adapted a foreign design to make a far more effective fighting unit than the original foreign design provided. One only needs to read the newspapers to know that the new torpedo firing systems have dramatically expanded the torpedo firing capacity of the Collins class submarine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, it is a rather fallacious argument for the opposition to attack this government on the quantity of money being spent on defence. Nevertheless, I have to say to this House that, being very familiar with the Armoured Corps and having frequent contact with it, I am concerned that we are expending far too much money on two services and are neglecting the army. Enormous sums of money are going into the Collins submarine program and the frigate program. I cannot argue that that is not a desirable thing. At the same time, the RAAF is being equipped with the best and most up-to-date design systems in their fighter aircraft. However, the Leopard tank is now an old tank. It lacks a night firing capacity, and there are far superior armoured vehicles now on the market which would more than match the Leopard's capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to travel around the world to our near neighbours to find that the surplus Russian tanks, which are a fine fighting machine, are being sold at quite cheap prices right around the northern regions. One must wonder why some of our Asian neighbours feel the need to have rather large armoured brigades when they have no local defence threat to themselves. Maybe it is just a quest for power in the region or a need to be seen to be an independent, strong defence force nation. But it cannot be justified in terms of threat assessment anywhere in the Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To all who are concerned with defence in Australia, it must be worrying to realise that the Russians have an enormous surplus of both the T72 tank and the T80 tank. From memory, the T80 and the T72 are both fitted with the 155 millimetre cannon, which is heavy artillery. They are very large tanks indeed. If members get the chance to visit Puckapunyal, they will be pleased to know that the Australian Army has a T72 on the site of the armoured school in the museum of armour. I have had a look at the T72 and it is, indeed, a very vicious looking weapon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most modern tanks have a modular system of armour which enables different armour to be placed on the tank for different circumstances. The Leopard does not have that capacity. The new Abraham, a US tank, is a large, vicious looking beast of a thing. It has the capacity to have ceramic armour placed on the outside, which is a missile protecting armour that protects the tank from certain missile attacks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a desirability for our Armoured Corps, and one that we should look at very seriously in upgrading our armoured system. I cannot agree with the right honourable member for New England when he suggests that the new LAV, which is a Canadian made and designed wheeled vehicle, is not suitable for Australian conditions. Indeed, I can say to the house that that is not the view of the Armoured Corps, which assessed a number of vehicles on the market and discovered the LAV. In fact, the LAV has been selected by the United States Marines as a most suitable light armoured personnel carrier; and that is its function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can be argued very strongly that the LAV, with its six-wheel drive system, has far more adaptability to northern conditions, as it can go through swamps and sand and is not limited&mdash;as many tracked vehicles in fact are, particularly very heavy tracked vehicles. I can say to the right honourable member and to the House that, from my instructions and from my understanding of the view of the Australian Armoured Corps, it is more than satisfied with the LAV as a new vehicle for northern purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some things we should do fairly urgently for the Armoured Corps, and one of them is to install modern, updated airconditioning systems in the Leopard tanks. It cannot be argued that the Leopard should not be placed in our northern areas. If Australia is going to be attacked, the attack will unarguably come from the north. A proper decision was made to base the bulk of the land army in the north. Of course, you do not let infantry go without the armour to protect those troops. So the bulk of the Leopard tanks are now situated in the north. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know if anyone in this House has been in a Leopard. They are fairly confining, on the inside. They are all steel, of course, and when the lid is down and you are in the turret, for example, there is not much air. They have a fan system which puts air through the tank, but can one imagine the conditions our soldiers now face when the tanks are in the north and they are in a combat position on a training exercise with lids down. They get bloody hot, and I am being kind when I say that. They get awfully hot. At the moment, our soldiers are up there exercising in vehicles which have no airconditioning. I have approached the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), and I feel very strongly that our soldiers in the north should, in fact, have decent airconditioning systems put into the Leopard tanks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along those lines, the army is currently evaluating its need for new armour, and there are several possibilities that may be taken up. The army may decide not to go for airconditioning if, down the track in a very short space of time, the Leopards are replaced by a newer, and much lighter, light armoured tank. I have been briefed on various possibilities for the Armoured Corps in that area. They are the experts; I am not. Sometimes, we in the House have a shopping list of things that, for a variety of reasons, we would like to see in the defence forces but, ultimately, the government must take the advice of the services, in terms of the equipment that they get within budgetary constraints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, I totally reject the claims of the right honourable member that we have neglected the Australian defence forces in budgetary terms. I can only remind the House that, when I first went back into Puckapunyal in 1984&mdash;after having served there in national service and citizen military forces some years ago&mdash;I was shocked and horrified at the abysmal conditions we are asking our service personnel to live in. There were houses with sloping floors and doors that did not open or close. One thing I am proud to say is that this government, at least, has diverted a lot of money to ensure that service personnel now live in decent houses. In Puckapunyal, there are over 100 new brick veneer homes being built as decent housing for our personnel, who now live in far better circumstances than those I saw in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even better than that is the fact that the individual single soldier, or the soldier on transfer for training purposes away from home base, now has accommodation in flats, which is far more appropriate than the dormitory situation that I first saw. That has all gone. There are now decent living conditions&mdash;something which is important for morale, especially if we are going to encourage into the defence forces the sort of people we need today of extremely high technical capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In brief, I reject outright the claims of the right honourable member for New England that we have neglected the forces. There are restraints on budgets and we recognise that. But it is sheer hypocrisy for members of the opposition to put that charge to this government when they called for a $400 million cut in the defence vote in Fightback. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is depressing that this defence white paper, this strategic document, has speakers in this House speaking about tactical issues. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) did touch on a couple of strategic issues when he talked about Australia's own native defence capacity, our capacity to build for ourselves. But I remind the right honourable member that it was the government of which he was a part that made the decision to destroy the Australian aircraft industry, which it did, when it opted to buy the F111 instead of joint venture in the TSR2. It might be worth pointing out that the F111 was originally a British design, designed by Barnes Wallis, and given to the Americans. The TSR2 exceeded its expectation on its maiden flight. The F111 has never met its design capacities, although it is, of course, a very good aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also point out to the right honourable member for New England that when I alone in this House was concerned about the submarine acquisition program what we had from the opposition, apart from the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred), was a deafening silence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with the strategic issues. If this defence white paper, Defending Australia, is meant to be a serious statement of our defence strategy, then I am disturbed. I notice that even Greg Sheridan, one of the foremost propagandists of the Manifest Asian Destiny or MAD school, thinks that Defence has gone too far in its emphasis on Asia in this paper. If Sheridan with his lamentable Asian cringe thinks that, then it is something that must really be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that defence planners are desperate. On the one hand, they are desperate to fit in with the government's general Asian theme in foreign affairs, trade and immigration whilst, on the other hand, they are desperate to avoid giving offence to Asian nations in our region. The Department of Defence and the defence chiefs know at first hand the power of political correctness. Perhaps, given recent bruising experiences, they think that it is best to be seen to be playing the politically correct game whilst keeping secret the more touchy aspects of the policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as Senator Joseph McCarthy attacked the US military as a way of promoting his own career, so the politically correct of the day, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Sue Walpole, and her ilk have attacked the military, particularly the navy for the supposedly systematic and terrible harassment of women. They are onto a good thing. First, they agitate for increased numbers and responsibility for women in the military, and then they say women are being treated terribly. They may find one or two cases, but they exaggerate to make it the general rule. All the while they can posture as outstanding human rights warriors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Homosexual activists have also sought to dictate recruitment policies as a matter of personal status&mdash;not that they have any concern for the best interests of the military. Under pressure from the professional ethnic lobby there is also a push to recruit people on the basis of their ethnic background. Also, the republican push makes it necessary that the terrible British base of our services must be undermined. And so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The political correct will not rest until they have insinuated their ideology into every institution in the country. They see the military as one of the last bastions of old Australia which they are determined to extirpate. They do not care about the cost to morale and efficiency. If morale is low, we will have great difficulty in attracting the best people to the services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Military chiefs and career officers feel uncomfortable in engaging in public disputes and have generally capitulated before such attacks. But I am sure that the great bulk of the military would have cheered them if they had come out fighting across the board against this insidious and highly politicised interference. Unfortunately, they are unlikely to have succeeded in any event. They are no match for the polished and articulate McCarthyists and their media propagandists, even though they know the McCarthyist attacks are unjust and adversely affect morale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that they think a bit of public relations camouflage is in order. I can understand it. I feel sorry for the military. They have dedicated themselves to the service of our country knowing that in the grave possibility of war they may be called on to lay down their lives. This should be a profession honoured throughout the land. Instead, the military is attacked by professional do-gooders who bleed public funds for their purposes. These are the people who know nothing about what it takes to run a military machine and they have absolutely no empathy for the people who choose the military as a career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask: how many of the politically correct would put their lives on the line for Australia? They would be among the first to head elsewhere if Australia faced war. The professional ethnics in particular, with their sentimental allegiances to foreign nations, would be among the first to scuttle to the airports for departure. Australia is just a funding base to them. It is not something worth fighting for when real dangers are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the influence of these people is such that the military bows before it. At the very least, the defence planners feel the need to fit in with the fashions to avoid new bruises&mdash;to give the government and the politically correct establishment what it thinks it wants to hear and to play its part in the Asian public relations effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it amusing that copies of this paper were delivered to military attaches from Asian nations before it was actually presented to the Senate by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). Perhaps we can be less critical of this paper if we view much of it as an exercise in public relations. Perhaps our defence planners do not really believe that Indonesia can be relied on to basically be the sheet anchor of our defence. Perhaps they are keeping their real policies secret. If these real policies were based on a commonsense strategic assessment, I would understand. Commonsense has been ruthlessly extinguished as a basis for policy in Australia and I doubt that there is more than a handful of the professional serving officers who really believe that this paper tells it like it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider some of its main points. There is a restatement of the belief that no country has the capacity to seize and hold major Australian territory and that no country has the desire to do so in the foreseeable future. In consequence, the main preparations should continue to be for potential low level conflict and continued coverage of the air-sea gap. There is a belief that Indonesia can and should be cultivated as a major and reliable ally, but I think it is foolish to build your entire policy on this belief. The next main point in the report is a supposed restatement of defence self-reliance, with defence of the continent a priority, but also increasing regional cooperation with China, India and Japan and an emphasis on participation in United Nations peacekeeping forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point is the relocation of land forces to Darwin. The 2nd Cavalry Regiment is already there and will be joined by the 1st Armoured Regiment, the 5th/7th Battalion and the remainder of the 1st Brigade. By the way, those deluded characters who have been trying to whip up a new `Brisbane Line' conspiracy in which the north will supposedly be militarily abandoned are not only wide of the mark, as this movement of personnel shows, but diverting attention from the real problems with our defence posture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an upgrading of air and naval forces, but ADF personnel numbers will be maintained at the present level for the next 15 years. Defence spending is to remain at its present level. There is to be the upgrading of the training of the reserves. The belief is stated that our security involves an integrated approach embracing defence, foreign policy, trade and immigration. There will be reliance on an early warning from intelligence to reveal any potentially hostile build-up of forces in the region&mdash;an intelligence which I might say was lamentably lacking in relation to events in Fiji. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major strategic initiative is to push for closer defence relations with Asia, including China, India and Japan. This approach is taken as being complementary to the government's trade and foreign and immigration policies, deluded as they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia is presented as a key ally, yet there are deep instabilities beneath the surface in Indonesia. We have only to look at examples of the 1960s to see how quickly circumstances can change in that country. There is always the potential for an expansionist Islamic fundamentalism to become a force, particularly if the increasing economic prosperity of the new middle classes does not `trickle down' to the great bulk of the population. There is likely to be growing discontent under these circumstances and, as in Egypt and Algeria, Islamic fundamentalism could be an attractive option for those who miss out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many so-called educated economists have predicted a golden age of prosperity in the Asia-Pacific that will make military action redundant. The defence paper at least acknowledges that economic growth is not a guarantee of stability in the region and that prosperity means the opportunity to buy more and better weapons, which other nations will feel the need to match, resulting in a potential arms build-up. However, the paper does not follow through with the implications of this and prefers to cultivate a false sense of security, perhaps to avoid insulting our neighbours, and particularly the Indonesians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia is seen as a possible strong ally, largely because of its fear of China, it seems, and Australia is an unthreatening neighbour with whom it can cooperate for its own security. But what if Indonesia is able to forge an alliance with China? These nations are far closer culturally. Where would that leave Australia? Indonesia may well grow tired of constant carping from Australia&mdash;even if it is not coming from government circles&mdash;about human rights abuses and the army's handling of internal security matters, particularly if the regime is seriously threatened internally. China certainly would not be so rude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good way of diverting attention from internal instability is to unite against a common external foe and one that can be presented, as our own new class has presented us, as a greedy and wealthy hogger of a vast landmass. Throw in our nasty racism, which even our own government accuses us of before international forums, and they have all the justification they need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No natural affinity for us exists in either Japan or India. While they may want a cut of the action, they certainly would not come to our aid. While the USA may be sympathetic and sell us equipment which is not sold to Indonesia, it is an ally of Indonesia and it would be highly unlikely to intervene in a conflict between Indonesia and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the point of view of Australia's security, the increased use of scarce military resources to bolster usually impotent United Nations peacekeeping ventures is also a waste of time. Will the United Nations assist us if we have problems? Even if it did, there is little a puny UN force could do against a determined attacker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN may prove to be more of an enemy than a friend. As the politically correct within Australia continue to denounce us internationally, the cry may be taken up by the United Nations to sanction large-scale population movements from Third World nations. How would we respond to a large fleet of refugee boats from China or Bangladesh, approved by the United Nations, approaching our shores? How would we defend ourselves against that? What would happen if an opportunistic aggressor took advantage of the chaos caused by such a fleet and mounted an attack behind it? Not only could these boats be helped towards us by such an aggressor, but simultaneous refugee movements could be provoked from places such as Irian Jaya and East Timor to add to the chaos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope Defence has considered such possibilities, because they are certainly credible scenarios&mdash;not in the short term perhaps, but in the long term with population pressures in the region likely to be enormous within the next 20 to 30 years. These are the sorts of things we have to prepare for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, one of our biggest concerns is the `new class' elites at home which have actively weakened and divided our nation and undermined the military. If this sort of behaviour continues we will decline as a stable nation and our ability to defend ourselves will continue to be eroded. Meanwhile, our potential enemies, unaffected by such new class parasites, will grow stronger. At any rate, we have to rid ourselves of the delusion that we can rely on regional neighbours in any emergency. When it comes to the crunch, we will be on our own. It would be nice if the government had the guts to accept that and plan accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course we should aim for good relations with Indonesia and other Asian countries, but we should not rely upon them as a basic foundation of our defence. The government's so-called defence self-reliance leaves us heavily dependent on US-sourced equipment. Industrially, we are weak and our defence spending is poor. Our personnel problems in Defence will not be addressed. Add this to our cringing foreign affairs stance and our absurd immigration policy, and the powers that be may well make us `part of Asia' sooner than we think. Let us hope that our new masters are humanitarians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My first comment on the defence white paper is to refer to the ministerial statement made by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). It is important that we bear in mind Senator Ray's comments when discussing the white paper. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all the hopes and aspirations we share for reducing the chances of conflict since the end of the Cold War, military force is still an important element in international affairs, and will remain so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a fact of life&mdash;regrettably&mdash;but a fact nevertheless. It is also a fact that, while we will do all we can to avoid the use of force ourselves, ultimately, armed force can only be resisted by armed force.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a timely reminder that the focus of any defence policy should be the maintenance of peace. That is very important. We have come to the end of the Cold War. One of the consequences of that is, unfortunately, a likely increase in regional conflict. Again, Senator Ray says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key judgement in this white paper is that fundamental changes in strategic affairs, both globally and within our region, will make Australia's strategic environment more demanding over the next fifteen years.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very true statement. We did think the Cold War was over. I thought that until I was reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> this week. There are still some Cold War warriors out there. I looked with astonishment at the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> on Wednesday `West lashed over attempt to ban reds'. That was the headline that prompted me to looked to see who the reds were. I was quite interested to find that the reds were Boris Yeltsin and Russia. Apparently, for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> at least, the Cold War is still not over. It still refers to Boris Yeltsin and his government as the reds. I guess that is one for Stuart Littlemore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the Cold War has changed the perception of threats to Australia. Up to the middle of the 1980s, Australians saw the threat as coming from the Soviet Union, according to the opinion polls. Indonesia was ranked second in those days but by the end of the 1980s and the end of the Cold War the Australian public came to regard Indonesia as the most likely threat to Australia's security. In 1993 a national survey revealed that some 57 per cent of Australian voters believed that Indonesia would pose a security threat to Australia within 10 to 15 years. That is the public perception, and perhaps the issue of East Timor has something to do with Australians thinking that there is some security threat from the Indonesian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, it is true, as suggested by my earlier quote from Senator Ray, that an end to the Cold War does change the strategic environment in our region. I am indebted to an article by Des Ball headed `The political-security dimension of Australia and the Asia-Pacific region' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indonesian Quarterly</EMPHASIS> of July this year for some comments in which he highlights the nature of these changes. He points to the changes in South-East Asia and the restructuring of the defence forces from counter-insurgency capacities that obviously reflected the Cold War conflict to modern high technology forces. Des Ball sees that as perhaps highlighting a mini arms race in South-East Asia. He points to increased regional tension&mdash;although the article was written pre-APEC&mdash;and he also points to the offensive nature of the new weapon systems. He quotes `maritime attack aircraft, modern surface combatants, submarines equipped with anti-ship missiles' as examples of this heightened arms race in South-East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at what the Australian response will be, and that is partly contained in the white paper. With regard to Australia's response, Des Ball quite clearly comes down on the side of regional cooperation, as does the white paper, as the only course of action for Australia. In his article, Des Ball provides eight very significant imperatives for regional cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that regional cooperation is necessary to counter centrifugal possibilities within the region. The second reason he gives concerns the various major advance weapon acquisition programs currently under way in the region. He says that it is critical that these acquisition programs not lead to a regional arms race. I think that is very important. In the third reason he highlights the character of new weapon systems being acquired, and the fourth reason in favour of regional cooperation is that it provides a combined counterweight to the intrusions of other powers into the region. He cites as the fifth reason that all countries in the region have a concern with the international law of the sea, which I do have not time to talk about now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A sixth and very important reason he offers is that many of the current and prospective regional security developments can only be addressed on a cooperative basis. His seventh reason is that the increasing rapidity of change and the relatively novel nature of emerging security problems demand an unfettered flow of ideas and dialogue on policy initiatives and means of addressing common problems, a reason that I think is very important. His final reason is that, more positively, regional cooperation is necessary for the achievement of regional resilience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without going into further detail, I suggest it is obvious that those reasons have a lot of cogency, and that Australia has no alternative but to cooperate with the rest of South-East Asia. We have obviously done so in a trade sense with APEC, and we have no choice but to do that in relation to the military. We are all in the one boat, as it were, in South-East Asia. There is no alternative. When we are talking about Indonesia, however, we cannot ignore the issues of human rights. It would assist if the Indonesian government did consider some degree of self-determination for both East Timor and Irian Jaya, since it is certainly the case that Tasmania has more regional independence in Australia than Timor or Irian Jaya, very sadly, would have in Indonesia. If, for whatever reason, complete independence for East Timor is impossible, the Indonesian government&mdash;if it is serious about cooperation on a regional basis&mdash;should consider some further self-determination for East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Des Ball's article also points to many regional security concerns: piracy, pollution from oil spills, illegal fishing, and exploitation of our offshore resources. All these concerns relate to the region in which I live and which I represent. They all point to the importance of the defence of Northern Australia, which is increasingly becoming the focus of Australia's defence strategy&mdash;and rightly so. Obviously, it is the site of an increased defence presence in terms of capacity, bases and personnel. The area which I represent and other parts of northern Australia have very close links with South-East Asia through trade and other cultural contacts which will obviously diminish misunderstanding and will enhance cross-cultural contact&mdash;which, in itself, helps in the long run to diminish any possible military conflict in the future, simply through cultural cross-fertilisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper highlights the Defence Force's increased operations in northern Australia, and the surveillance of maritime areas of northern Australia particularly. I was very disappointed with the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who chose to make the very cheap point about the fact that certain boat people&mdash;I do not think they were Indonesian&mdash;were found in the streets of Darwin and the police were rung. Everyone has heard this story, which is very funny. But no-one seriously suggests that there was a threat to Australia's security in that situation, so how can the defence forces be criticised? It was really a very cheap point, given the nature and difficulty of northern surveillance, to take this incident and somehow raise it in the House today with regard to the defence white paper. I am very disappointed in the right honourable member for New England for having done that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper makes the very important point that the ability to locate and monitor potentially hostile forces in our sea and air approaches and on our territories is essential to prevent or nullify threats to our interests. The northern coastline is significant in my electorate, and the Torres Strait is of great strategic importance. I pay tribute now to the contribution of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the defence of northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Scherger air base is a very important part of the potential northern defence of Australia. The white paper says that the chain of northern air bases will be completed later this decade and that we will work until the Scherger air force base on Cape York Peninsula is completed. I am advised that that project, which people may know is just outside of Weipa, is due for completion in 1999 and may be completed earlier. Already built in that base is a camp for 200 people; a kitchen to feed 400 people; a temporary power station, with a central power station to be completed early in 1995; and a workshop. This is all being done by local contractors and is providing jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An air cargo hangar is being constructed and half of the runway is now complete. That has been done by both army and local contractors. I am advised that in 1995 a tender will be called for an ordnance loading area at an estimated cost of $7 million to $10 million. There will also be a tender for the placement of hard rock. Scherger air base is a very significant example of cooperation. I understand there has just been an environmental audit which has again given the progress of work a tick. It is an example of cooperation with the local community, with involvement of local contractors. The Aboriginal people from Napranum community successfully completed the contract for the fencing of the Scherger air base and, of course, other contractors have benefited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the long run, Scherger will not be a fully operational base. But, as I pointed out earlier, there is a camp for 200 people and 400 people can be fed. So obviously, in any future operation, it will become a vital part of Australia's defence of the north. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to have this base in my electorate. Not only does it provide jobs in the short term but also it is an example&mdash;as is the presence of the 51st battalion in Cairns and HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns</EMPHASIS> naval base&mdash;of the fact that Australia is being well defended and that the emphasis on defence of the north is important. The thrust of the white paper is obviously on the right track. The matters that I referred to earlier suggest that Australia has no choice but to seek defence cooperation with other parts of Asia, and I think that is highlighted in the white paper. I commend the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and I commend all those who produced the white paper for an excellent blueprint for Australia's defence into the next century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In my concluding remarks yesterday, I was talking about the need for&mdash;and the content in the defence white paper on&mdash;the relationship between Australia and our neighbours at the military level. I was observing that, in the case of Indonesia, during the time of the Sukarno regime there was quite an important split in the training arrangements made for military forces, in that officers were trained in either the Soviet Union or the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it goes further than that in the context of our present expanding and excellent&mdash;that is not too strong a word to use&mdash;relationship at the military level with Indonesia. We are prepared to identify that we have some philosophical differences. We certainly have some perspective differences; nevertheless, Indonesia is the nation which is closest to Australia, apart from Papua New Guinea, and it is across our main sea lanes to Japan and to South-East Asia generally. Consequently, Indonesia's position, not only in relation to Australia to the south but also in relation to its neighbours to the north, is going to continue to have an important role to play in our strategic considerations in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an indication of the sorts of pressures that one is up against in this area, while the document goes to considerable lengths to emphasise the strength of our growing relationships with nations such as Malaysia and Singapore through the five-power agreement and so forth, it is also true that, from the perspective of the bilateral relationship between those two countries, both of them tend to see the other as a potential&mdash;I stress potential&mdash;threat to their security. Therefore, when Australia is in a position of needing to be friends with both, that can create a number of stresses and strains. Equally, we can work with their military forces. In the case of Malaysia, we are a major contender for their patrol boat program, and that is something we hope will be finalised in the foreseeable future. We have a continuing relationship with Singapore, as I noted earlier, in the training of air force personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So overall Australia's defence preparedness on the one hand and our strategic assessment on the other are very closely linked with our bilateral and multilateral relationships in the region, including the United Nations. It is pleasing to see in the white paper that Australia's continuing role in United Nations peacekeeping has been identified&mdash;in particular, our role in Cambodia. The events leading up to the first parliamentary elections in Cambodia significantly raised Australia's profile&mdash;not only in the wider United Nations family context but within our region&mdash;as a nation which is concerned about security and the wellbeing of the people of South-East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I will make some remarks on a matter which I brought to the attention of this House on no fewer than two occasions in the past. This matter raises very serious questions about accountability and the culture of the Department of Defence. It concerns the case of Sylvia Margaret Faulkner, which I have raised before in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past few days, I have received more documents from the Attorney-General's Department, under my FOI request, which appear to confirm my worst suspicions about the conduct of the Commonwealth's legal defence against Mrs Faulkner's compensation claim in which the defence department was the client. The crucial document is a minute dated 6 February 1987 from Mr Peter Swinton, a senior official in the Attorney-General's Department's legal services section, to Mr Robert Muecke, the head of the litigation division of the Attorney-General's Department. This was just two months before the court hearing of Mrs Faulkner's claim relating to an alleged breach of contract by the defence department over the purchase of her invention, the trisal clip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minute outlines discussions between Mrs Swinton and the QC advising the Commonwealth, Mr Jack Hiatt. What it suggests very strongly is that the Commonwealth, through its legal officers and the defence department, deliberately set out to influence the evidence presented at the trial by the key witness for the defence, former Brigadier Charles Flint. This document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was strongly suggested&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, by Mr Hiatt&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that when any approach is next made to the Department of Defence, the question of Mr Flint's involvement be raised and finalised. In other words, it should be put to the department that Flint has run the gamut of departmental proceedings and ought not to have his pension subject to alteration as a result of anything which might take place in the course of the hearing. If the client&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Defence&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">agrees that that is the departmental position, then it should be requested to confirm that and Flint should be informed.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to make it clear how important Flint's evidence is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should Flint confirm in a statement that he was acting without authority, this litigation would quickly evaporate and it seems more than justified to take whatever steps are necessary to bring that result about.</PARA>
<PARA>I have already informed the House how Swinton and Muecke only a week later contemplated the morality of buying Flint's evidence by holding his pension over his head. The words `whatever steps are necessary' speak for themselves and are proof that this case needs to be investigated by an independent inquiry. Once again, I call on the government to act. Justice delayed is justice denied, and this matter has been unresolved for 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I note that almost the entire press gallery, which has been preoccupied during the last month in a frenzied pursuit of the Liberal Party, has patently failed to report these extraordinary developments in this issue of major public interest. It is time it did so. It above all, as well as this parliament, is responsible for ensuring that everyone in this country has fair access to the law. No-one should have to wait 20 years to have a case settled through the judicial system of the Commonwealth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to come into this debate, but then I listened to the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), a member representing the forefront of our defence system, the most northerly part of Australia, and found his remarks quite extraordinary. His remarks were extremely critical of any sort of action by the government to defend Australia. He pooh-poohed and ridiculed statements made in the northern media that were critical of our defence capacity and our ability to protect our coastline when some people&mdash;I think they were Indonesians&mdash;landed in Far North Queensland. He apparently thought this was quite all right and he made remarks in newspapers and in the northern media along those lines&mdash;most extraordinary statements and most extraordinary behaviour. But, of course, he is in the mainstream of Labor thinking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently read a book on the life of John Curtin. A lot of people seem to have the impression that he was a very good person. I became so angered when reading about Mr Curtin that I threw the book away, which is something I rarely do. This person before the Second World War had continuously fought against every single allocation of moneys for armaments. The net result of that was that we went into the war with virtually nothing at all to fight with and to defend our own shores with. In fact, he as Prime Minister had allowed almost every one of our troops to fight in Africa instead of leaving them at home to protect against the very imminent danger of invasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two reasons why the international socialists and their successors continuously have this attitude. They have a belief that the only people who cause wars are the capitalist class; therefore, all wars are bad by definition and we should not fight in them because we are serving the interests of the capitalist class. Often it seems to be forgotten that the original attack on Poland, which precipitated the war, was undertaken from the south by Germany and from the north by the socialist empire of Russia. Russia&mdash;the great hero of the Labor movement in Australian during that period of time&mdash;was the invader and part of the precipitating factor for the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went into war with virtually no armaments whatsoever. The only aeroplanes we had were the Wirraways. Not one single Wirraway, if my memory serves me correctly, brought down a single Japanese plane and every single one that went up was shot down out of the skies. We had virtually no tanks or heavy artillery whatsoever, nor did we have conscription. To our eternal shame, we had no conscription even during the war. There was no conscription for fighting overseas thanks to the leadership given by the socialists. There was a continuous coal strike throughout the entire Second World War which imposed electricity rationing throughout Australia. This was the effort made by the people. Not one single striker or person who put on overtime bans was brought to heel by the then government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, still with the socialists in the saddle, we were sent into the Korean War carrying 303 rifles against the Chinese, who were carrying automatic weapons. At the present moment there are some great ideas and this white paper has some very excellent ideas. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) spoke very sensibly about the white paper. But there is no implementation of the ideas on the ground whatsoever. There has been a site cleared at Longreach for the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar and that is all that has happened. We have heard all sorts of noises being made, but all we have is a cleared piece of ground. At the proposed air force base near Weipa, again there has been nothing but noise. Nothing substantive has happened at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Things that are desperately and importantly needed, such as Jindalee and some sort of naval capability to back up Jindalee, simply do not exist and, quite frankly, on present monetary allocations, they most certainly will not exist in the future. I think there are 32 Blackhawk aircraft in Australia&mdash;they represent out capability to rapidly deploy our armed force&mdash;and five of them are operational. We are paying pilots of the Blackhawks an enormous amount of money&mdash;and quite rightly so; they are very experienced and highly qualified men&mdash;but they do not fly. They get virtually no flying time at all. This was quite foreseeable since we have only five operational aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People say there is no danger and immediate threat to Australia. In the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill was laughed at in parliament for a protracted period of time because he said there were grave dangers. Right up to 1938 he was still serving on the backbench and being laughed at by the collective wisdom of the parliament and the media in England. Maybe that mistake led the world into the Second World War. If people like him had been listened to sooner, maybe there would not have been a war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the lesson for Australia is the lesson of Israel, where 3 1/2 million people have been able to hold off sustained attacks by some 200 million Arabs. The lesson for Australia is the lesson of Sweden. Sweden was left alone in the Second World War because every single Swede had a rifle and was military trained. If you did not have to take on an army of over one million people&mdash;that is the number that Sweden effectively could quickly put on the ground&mdash;why do it? It was put in the too-hard basket. Because it was militarily strong, Sweden was the one country in Europe that came out of the war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need some serious defence of our coastline, not only to guard against external threats to our security but also because of drug running, illegal immigration and health worries&mdash;foot and mouth disease, which is endemic in Indonesia, could be brought into our country. Then there is the requirement for constant patrolling by our military of the seas surrounding Australia&mdash;no-man's land, if you like&mdash;and the constant agitation by the Torres Strait Islanders that they are not being protected at all. People from Indonesia continuously come through the Torres Strait and are not assailed. In fact, we do not have the ability to assail anyone coming in because, if a Coastwatch aircraft does sight a vessel&mdash;be it from New Guinea, Indonesia, New Britain, the Philippines or Taiwan&mdash;the nearest vessel that can react, pick up and apprehend these vessels is back at Cairns. I do not think the Taiwanese or the Indonesian vessels will stand around waiting for 24 hours for the cavalry to arrive while there is an aircraft circling overhead. I very much doubt whether that is going to occur; it does not happen. That is why the coastal defence systems are entirely inadequate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who believe in an egalitarian society where all people are equal, national service pushes the rich and the poor together, the well-educated and the uneducated together, black, white and yellow people together. It creates a great cohesive force. I am not in any way advocating along the lines of national service. I did military training for many years and I can see absolutely no justification for having military training for anything over two or three months. It is hard to go past the Swedish and the Israeli model. It would achieve so many other objectives, such as an egalitarian society, which we most certainly do not enjoy in Australia today. It would also give us the potential to defend ourselves, having such a huge continent with such a tiny population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem which is so relevant to defence is that one-third of Australia's entire water resources are locked up in North Queensland. We have a tiny population of 500,000 occupying that huge land mass which has enough soil and water to support a population of, I suppose, about 10 or 15 million without any difficulty whatsoever, yet there is no-one living there. </PARA>

There was a very great American president, Theodore Roosevelt, who said, `Walk quietly and carry a big stick.' The imbeciles that run this country are doing just the opposite. They are walking loudly and carrying no stick at all. I suspect some of these Asian nations have a memory for these sorts of things and they carry a big stick.

That was fairly logical when you think about it. Our cannons today are far bigger and have a far greater range. To assert our control, we really need to put some people up there and not leave the people of Cape York Peninsula and the Torres Strait feeling abandoned.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I sat in the House and listened to the response by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) to the white paper. As a person who had previously been a shadow minister for defence, I had thought that there might be some fairly considered and useful contribution from the opposition in an area which has, by and large, been the subject of bipartisan support, certainly on key questions. Sadly, that was not to be the case. The Leader of the Opposition commenced his speech by referring to the fact that he thought the white paper was  several years too late. I am not quite sure whether the Leader of the Opposition had in mind exactly what a white paper is, what it does and what it is intended to construct for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">White papers are not the sort of thing that governments produce on an annual basis. The previous white paper on defence was in 1987. If you look at comparable documents in other countries, you will find that they are produced normally on the basis of seven- to 10-year time frames. This one was no different. My concern about the Leader of the Opposition's understanding of the process was made worse when he complained that the white paper restated the views that were in the 1993 strategic review. Of course they do. The strategic review is designed to provide a statement of our assessment of where we see the nation and our defence posture in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategic review was set out last year accurately and properly&mdash;and I think it was well received by the Australian community and the defence community&mdash;to identify precisely that. Here we are about a year later taking that assessment, building on it and producing a white paper that puts out in some greater detail the way in which we as a nation will address that strategic circumstance over the five to 10 years ahead of us. But the Leader of the Opposition seemed to think there was something wrong, something deficient, with this white paper because it restated what was in the 1993 strategic review. I suspect the Leader of the Opposition has failed to understand the actual basis upon which these documents are constructed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to a couple of specific areas in his contribution. He alleged that there had been a reduction in defence capability. In support of that allegation, he said we had lost two of our six infantry battalions. I assume he is referring to the 1991 decision to replace two regular battalions with the introduction of the ready reserve battalions that occurred in 6th Brigade. I happen to know a little about 6th Brigade because not only is it within my electorate but also for the greater part of this year I have had portfolio responsibility for the ready reserve along with the general reserve. I take and have taken a very keen interest in the ready reserve since its announcement in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We previously had two regular battalions in 6th Brigade. There is nobody in 6th Brigade who will seriously argue that the capability now resident in 6th Brigade is anything other than substantially greater than the 6th Brigade that was in existence in 1991 before we made the changes. The fact of life is: those regular battalions within 6th Brigade&mdash;and there was then a general reserve battalion to make up the complement&mdash;were understaffed and had inadequate equipment levels. This government's approach has ensured that 6th Brigade is now staffed at much higher levels, has much more equipment and is now being motorised for mobility purposes. The 6th Brigade in 1994 is a far more capable brigade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that that change has reduced capability&mdash;that is what was said by the Leader of the Opposition; it followed in his very next sentence where, to support his allegation of a cut in capability, he referred to this change&mdash;is patently wrong. The 6th Brigade is a far more potent force today than it was in 1991. But he compounded that felony when he went on to talk about surface combatants. He seemed to think that numbers and capability are interchangeable. The Leader of the Opposition supported his view about a reduction in defence capability by claiming that there has been a reduction in surface combatants and fewer submarines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it astounding that, at a time when the government is committed to a major program of re-equipment with the Anzac frigates&mdash;a program which, I understand, has enjoyed bipartisan support; a project which has been pretty widely acclaimed in the parliament, industry and defence circles&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition should claim that we are reducing our capability on surface combatants. But, worse, he throws submarines into the argument. To suggest that our submarine capability is less when we are already trialling the first of the Collins class submarines that have been built in South Australia is just arrant nonsense. We are now in the process of upgrading our submarine fleet, to which we are committed under this white paper. The old Oberon submarines, with 1960s technology, we are replacing with absolute state-of-the-art technology to produce the most potent conventional powered submarines in the world. But the Leader of the Opposition does not seem to understand this. Just yesterday he said that we are reducing our capability in submarines. That is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition does not understand what is happening in defence. If ever we needed a clearer example of that, he made it patently obvious when he started talking about the strengths within various battalions. He identified a number of battalions where he referred to what he called `nominal strength' and `actual strength'. He ran through a series of figures to say that a number of battalions are, by implication of his words, under strength. For the most part, the battalions he was talking about and the figures he was using were the difference between the authorised establishment and the posted strength. Sure, there is a difference between those two. Anyone who is involved in defence knows there is a difference between the authorised establishment and the posted strength of a battalion. The posted strength is invariably lesser&mdash;it is a smaller number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, you will see that the posted strength in most of those battalions is about 30 or so people fewer than the higher figure&mdash;and that is usually as it is. There is nothing untoward about that; there is nothing new about that. But the Leader of the Opposition either does not understand the difference between an authorised establishment and a posted strength or was seeking to deceive and mislead. It is one or the other: he either does not understand it or he wanted to mislead people. I am not quite sure which it was since with the last of those battalions he mentioned he got it horribly wrong. He referred to the 5th/7th Battalion and said that that battalion has a `nominal operating strength' of 740 people. He went on to say that it actually has 480. That is a huge difference. When he said that, I thought `This could not be right'. So I have gone back to have a look to see what the situation is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This `nominal operating strength' of 740 is not simply the authorised establishment for that battalion; it is the war establishment. If we were in the middle of a war, that is the level to which we would have that battalion manned. But yesterday the Leader of the Opposition stood here and rattled it off in a list of battalion strength numbers, claiming it to be a `nominal operating strength' and trying to claim that there is some deficiency in our capability. He does not know what he is talking about when it comes to defence. That is his best defence in answer to my comments today. He does not know what he is talking about. If he does know what he is talking about, then he came in here and quite improperly sought to convey an impression which he knew to be untrue. So he has a choice: he can claim incompetence or deception&mdash;one or the other&mdash;but there is no other answer available to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition and other spokespeople at different times in this debate, both here and in the other chamber, have referred to the resourcing question. The resourcing question is a vitally important consideration in any portfolio allocation. It is particularly so in defence where there are, of necessity, very high costs. A lot tends to be made in these debates about the percentage of GDP, gross domestic product, allocated to particular portfolios. GDP or percentages of GDP are useful instruments for getting a gauge on international comparisons and getting a gauge over time on where you are at. But that is about all they are good for. Percentage of GDP does not buy anything. The percentage of GDP does not equate to any piece of equipment or any number of people. What buys equipment and people is money. Percentage of GDP quoted in isolation is a meaningless term that can be used and misused to substantiate whatever case you wish to pursue. All members in this place know that to be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition fell into that trap as well and decided to home in on the percentage of GDP as if it were the holy grail of the debate about defence. It is important, but it is not the sole test. That is why the white paper quite clearly sets out not simply a statement about GDP but a statement about actual dollars. In paragraph 14.5 of the white paper, the government says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some modest real growth in defence spending will however be needed later this decade and in the following decade.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear statement that there needs to be real growth in defence spending. That is the important part of the process. Do not worry about the percentage of GDP. Our friends in New Zealand went through a decade where their GDP did not grow at all; they had zero growth. At the same time, the Australian economy grew by 25 per cent. If you were to take two per cent of GDP in New Zealand against two per cent of GDP in Australia over the same time, you would get a very different answer in real growth terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the facts of life is that a percentage of GDP will not buy you a single soldier, a single tank, a single battleship or anything else; but money will. The government has made its intentions clear in the white paper. It has referred in that paper, quite properly, to maintaining defence spending at approximately two per cent of GDP. Of course it says `at approximately two per cent of GDP' because GDP fluctuates, but the important thing is the statement says there will be an increase in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would not be too bad listening to the opposition talking about budgetary matters if it were actually going to do something to enhance the budget for defence itself. But it is not. This week we have had confirmed the opposition's view that the government should cut its spending of total outlays by $11.7 billion&mdash;that is, $11,700 million we should stop spending that we are spending today. That is not a little pocket of money; that is a major slice of the government budget which the coalition parties say we should stop spending. At the same time as telling us that we should cut $11.7 billion out of this budget&mdash;and that is not over time but in one hit, this year&mdash;those opposite hop up here and tell us that we should spend more on defence. When there is a debate on health, they tell us that we should spend more on health. When there is a debate on legal aid, they tell us that we should spend more on legal aid. You cannot have it both ways. Your hypocrisy on that stands out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to try today to get a detailed policy statement from the opposition about defence, we would not be able to. If we go back to the last election to get the last detailed policy statement of the opposition, we find that the opposition undertook to cut $200 million out of the defence budget. That is the opposition's policy that was taken to the last election. Those opposite wanted to cut $200 million out of defence and they have the hide, the hypocrisy and the cant to stand up in the parliament and try to attack the government, which has been about maintaining the defence effort in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly what we have done. Real growth in the defence effort of this nation has been maintained in real terms, except for the last year when there was a slight reduction. We have committed ourselves to real growth, and the opposition stands here and seeks to attack that when it stands on a platform of reduced government outlays. That policy will not stand up to scrutiny either in this place or by the public. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate that the government issue another white paper on defence at this stage. As my colleague the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) indicated, the last defence white paper was issued in 1987. Quite dramatic changes, both global and regional, have taken place in relation to questions of defence technology, attitudes towards defence, priorities and relationships. As the member for Brisbane indicated, the purpose of a white paper is to indicate the general framework within which government policies are determined. The current defence white paper is attempting to look ahead over a period of something like 15 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the unfortunate realities at the present time is the fact that national governments do have a responsibility to ensure that they provide adequate defences&mdash;and I emphasise the word `adequate'&mdash;to ensure that their citizens are provided with a reasonable level of protection. Let me emphasise that I am one of those people who adopt a minimalist approach to the question of defence. I am not one of those sabre rattlers who suggest that a country the size of Australia, with only 17 million or 18 million people, would ever have the capacity&mdash;and should ever seek to have the capacity&mdash;to defend itself against the onslaught of major world powers. That would be absurd in the extreme and impossible absolutely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a situation recently&mdash;and I am not attempting to denigrate Australia's defence effort&mdash;where a boatload of Asians landed on a beach near Darwin. No-one knew they were there until they were walking up the beach towards Darwin looking for the local police. We have an enormous coastline. Providing adequate surveillance of that coastline in itself is an enormous task. I am not one of those people who believe that Australia can or should seek to provide absolute defences. That is simply not possible and is recognised in the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper provides a recognition of the fact that Australia, unlike the approach that we have taken so frequently in the past, must now look more closely to questions of regional arrangements, regional relationships, the changes that have taken place in our immediate Asian region&mdash;and in the Pacific region generally. Enormous and accelerating growth has taken place in many countries which are our near neighbours in the Asian sphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have come a long way from the days when Australia looked to be in a position of dependence and subservience to Britain and dependence on the royal navy. The Second World War had the effect of changing our view to a closer relationship with the United States. We spoke for many years about the importance of what was referred to as the US alliance. ANZUS itself developed from those times and types of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, Australia has quite correctly concentrated its defence consideration on the types of undertakings which the United Nations has been involved in with its peacekeeping operations. We have also looked at and emphasised the importance of Australia concentrating its attention on its immediate region and building up, establishing and strengthening the types of relationships Australia has with the countries of Asia and the Pacific rim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the way Australia needs to look in the future in developing its general approach towards defence strategy. It is no longer a simple question of Australia adopting a policy of either forward defences or fortress Australia. There is a recognition, particularly on the part of the present government, that Australia's defence requirements now and into the future will continue to be increasingly dependent upon a much more sophisticated, integrated, policy coordinated approach than that. One of the unfortunate realities is that governments have to give attention to and apply enormous volumes of national resources which could well be, and would preferably be, applied to improving the material comfort and security of its citizens rather than in simply securing its borders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole basis of war is to be found in human qualities and group qualities which still persist: greed, belligerence, face saving, arrogance, national and international thuggery, and questions of national prestige and government prestige. Traditionally, the wars of the past were very closely related to questions of territorial ambitions, sources of raw materials and access to markets. The imperialist reality of world tensions and world conflict has been referred to&mdash;and, to a very large extent, it is still with us&mdash;but, fortunately, countries have now developed much more sophisticated ways to approach and pursue their economic objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now countries do more closely integrate, and seek to integrate and coordinate, their economies with other countries throughout the world. One of the greatest safeguards of peace is that countries now increasingly depend upon a coordinated and good relationship, an integrated relationship, with other countries. In those ways, and through those means, countries are now better able to secure and to advance the interests of their citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World War I was to be a war to end all wars. World War II was a war against fascism. The capacity of the world now to unleash massive destruction means that those world wars of the past could never recur. If they were to recur, it would be the end of the world as we know it; it would be the end of human civilisation. But we do have continuing skirmishes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Countries of the Third World, in particular, are seeking to secure their own defences. Unfortunately, too often they are seeking to increase and improve their capacity to wage local wars against their neighbours. In order to either wage wars or defend themselves, they need defence equipment and the facilities which are necessary for them to pursue those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In today's world, the US military industrial complex&mdash;particularly following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the collapse generally of eastern Europe&mdash;is the big player in what some people have chosen to refer to as the new world order. It is a concept which I have rejected ever since I first heard it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent figures to which I have access show that in 1992 the Third World&mdash;the most underdeveloped countries of the world&mdash;spent $A35,000 million on arms. The United States supplied 60 per cent of those arms. As a result of the problems in Russia, its share of supplying arms, defence facilities, equipment and supplies to the Third World is now down to six per cent. It is not as a result of any change in Russian attitude but as a result of a significant reduction in the Russian capacity to be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the communist bloc and the global Cold War, as we understood it, we are now starting to see a revival of star wars nonsense. That program was going to absorb massive volumes of US productive capacity. In order to support and justify the allocation of funds and resources away from more elevated forms of human security and welfare, it is always necessary to find a threat. The Soviet Union was a threat that has disappeared overnight. Now there is a resurgence, a revival, a rediscovery, of the Chinese threat. We will hear more about it in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope we do not have a revival of those maps that we all knew so well in the past. I refer to the maps that were drawn on a grid which made it look as though China dominated the whole of the Eurasian land mass. They had those giant red arrows coming down through Asia. They were the things that we needed to defend ourselves from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also recall the domino theory&mdash;the belief that, if any one country in Asia fell to communism, then the others would follow like dominos. That proved not to be so. One of the most distressing developments of that attitude, that acceptance, that approach, was the disaster of Vietnam. On occasions like this, we should recall some of the facts of that brutal and brutalising experience. It was one of the worst experiences in the history of mankind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US lost over 47,000 troops in combat in Vietnam. Over 47,000 troops&mdash;largely young Americans&mdash;died in Vietnam. In excess of 10,000 who were not combat troops were also killed in Vietnam. American troops who were wounded in Vietnam exceeded 300,000, and we know the way in which those people were physically and mentally devastated by that experience. The average age of those combat personnel from the United States in Vietnam was 19 years&mdash;kids. The average age of American combat personnel in World War II was 26. We are bringing the age down; we are getting kids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The war cost the United States $150,000 million in direct expenses. It brought about a withdrawal of the United States to within its own boundaries. It turned the United States from a creditor nation to a debtor nation. It brought about a significant contraction of the productive capacity of the United States. That, as much as any other reason, was the chief cause for the United States withdrawal. The indirect costs to the United States from Vietnam would probably equal the direct costs. That would make a total of $US300,000 million. The population of Vietnam is about 65 million. If they were concerned about the possibility that communism would prove to be attractive to those Vietnamese people, they could have taken those funds and given every man, woman and child in Vietnam almost $US5,000. That would represent in excess of 10 years of per capita income for all of the people in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total tonnage of bombs dropped on Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia during that period was eight million. That was four times the total tonnage of bombs that were dropped by every combatant in the Second World War. That amount of tonnage&mdash;four times the amount dropped in the Second World War&mdash;was dropped on three little Asian countries. Some 1.5 million Vietnamese died after the US had decided in 1961 that it would save Vietnam from itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate that we resume this debate after having spent a while talking about the defence white paper. The other dimension to defence is the extent to which we in this region, of which Australia is part, are able to develop new relations&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very important that we understand that in our region there are opportunities for people to talk together in order to work out their difficulties. Within APEC, there is a forum whereby for the first time many countries of the region are meeting in an entirely different context. Those of us who were involved in the early days of the ASEAN formation wonder just where that group might eventuate. It comprised countries with many similarities, yet with probably as many differences as they had similarities. It has been remarkable that the ASEAN group has grown, flourished and produced the results that it has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the APEC conference, to which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) referred in his statement, Mr Suharto, the President of Indonesia, one of the leading members of the ASEAN group, was chair. It was from him that much of the inspiration of the results of Bogor was derived. All of us should pay tribute to President Suharto for the way in which he not only chaired the conference but also has been able to bring together countries, particularly Malaysia whose Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, seemed for a time so strongly opposed to the concept of APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, in looking at the whole concept, several comments need to be made. The first is that, while all of us welcome and compliment the Prime Minister and the Australian  government on their role, it needs to be recognised that the APEC conference has not been seen as such a great achievement in other member countries. Indeed, there has been concern in a number of the countries of APEC that Australia, the United States in particular and to a lesser degree Japan have taken over the running of APEC. While it is true that cannot be said as far as President Suharto's involvement at Bogor is concerned, I think it needs to be mentioned that only last week in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bangkok Post</EMPHASIS>, an English language newspaper distributed in Bangkok in Thailand, there was quite a significant article which suggested that some elements of the Thai establishment believed that the whole of the APEC concept has run off the rails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know that we could accept that. But I think it needs to be noted that, in a grouping of so many countries, inevitably there will be different emphases and different concerns. We need to make sure that, as this forum develops and continues, Australia will need not only to continue to make its input and try to direct the conference in areas where we believe there is a benefit to Australia but also to understand and listen to the points of other countries who may well have different emphases. It is a worry that this article suggested that some people in Thailand have reservations about APEC and the direction in which it is heading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second concern I have is that, while I acknowledge again the benefit of APEC to Australia, in reading the prime ministerial statement I felt that there is perhaps too much of an emphasis on the economic achievements rather than on the two areas that I think are particularly important. The first is that it is important to have the dialogue. It is a happy coincidence that this debate follows the debate on the white paper relating to Australia's defence attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to try to overcome some of the problems of this global village which telecommunications is rapidly thrusting on us, it is going to be essential that there be not only forums in which to talk to each other but also an understanding of the person to whom we are talking. There is nothing quite like face-to-face dialogue in international discussions. Mr Speaker, I know that you and everyone who has represented Australia or the parliament abroad understands the advantage of that personal contact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC brings together leaders of countries in much the same way as the South Pacific Forum has brought together the countries of the South Pacific. The leaders conference of ASEAN has brought together the leader countries of ASEAN. Those continued personal interfaces are not only an insurance against the need for future defence effort but also a way to overcome at a one to one level bilateral difficulties that might emerge. It is true that no multinational forum is going to replace those bilateral contacts. Bilateral contacts between nations are always going to be the basis of individual relationships. It is most important for Australia that we maintain our bilateral relations with all the countries of the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect, I differ totally from my former colleague Malcolm Fraser. I read the other day that he is suggesting that the ANZUS agreement should now be set aside. To my mind that is absolutely ridiculous. I am disappointed that Malcolm Fraser does not understand that an agreement like ANZUS may not necessarily remain as it was when first negotiated by Sir Percy Spender but it should evolve. The relationship that we now have&mdash;albeit without New Zealand, which I think is regrettable&mdash;allows a considerable interchange between our countries which would not exist if we set the ANZUS agreement aside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANZUS is not just a defence relationship, it is a special bilateral dialogue between our nations. To my mind, the APEC conference should not replace any of these bilateral or multilateral associations. For example, we have the five-power defence arrangement which involves New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and Singapore. I believe that that arrangement also needs to be maintained. APEC provides one to one dialogue. It should not replace other existing arrangements but should give us a better chance of maintaining, establishing and expanding the particular significance of the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect, I think it has been quite fascinating to see the attitude of the Europeans. They are apprehensive that there may be a group growing in the Asia-Pacific area which could in some way combat the European Community. I think the Europeans could learn from APEC. In Europe they have set up barriers against outward involvement. It is that aspect of the European Community that has worried so many of us. Instead of trying to break down trade barriers not only with each other but also with the outside world, the Europeans have built up a fortress which makes it difficult for countries excluded from the union to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has created problems for Australia on the agricultural front. The common agricultural policy has regrettably been a major problem for this nation and its agricultural exports. To a degree the export enhancement program in the United States is a product of those tariff walls. APEC is not that sort of a body. The Europeans could learn from APEC in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that there are aspects of APEC about which we need to be concerned. Every Prime Minister, that I can recall, has always found it particularly heady wine once he moves into the uncertain seas of international politics. I think that Prime Minister Keating should keep that in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are areas within APEC that need emphasis. I have mentioned the concerns of some of the people in Thailand. One real omission that I have noted in the agreement is that there is no reference to social relations or health. One of the major worries in the world around us is the extent to which AIDS is spreading. It is important that a forum like APEC uses mutual contact in order to address particular social and health problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that there does not seem to be any reference to health at all, within the areas that have been identified as important, in the whole of the Prime Minister's APEC statement. He identifies the areas of education and training and that is welcome. In that sense we could look at training nurses and health professionals. I am delighted to see that science and technology, small and medium enterprises, economic infrastructure&mdash;including energy, transportation, telecommunications and tourism&mdash;and sustainable development are all included in the statement. But it is important that it is not just an economic forum. I would suggest that we need to include in future deliberations issues related to social problems, health and matters that affect people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to see that there is going to be a voluntary consultative dispute mediation service. It is not going to replace but supplement that of the World Trade Organisation. A great deal of good has been done in that regard. I know Sir  Laurence Street is currently the president of an Asian lawyers association. This group of lawyers has become progressively involved in looking at mediation between countries. It is not just a matter of mediation, however; it is also a matter of establishing commonality between the processes of law in this region, particularly commercial law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law of contracts where there is an interchange between people needs to be certain, identifiable and commonly interchangeable. There is a great deal that needs to be done in that respect. I know the Indonesians are interested in having consultations with our Australian government officials to see to what degree they can identify our legal systems in the commercial sense. I believe that could well extend over a wider basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal of good has been achieved from the Bogor meeting and the statement by the Prime Minister. However, I will spend my remaining time on the downside of two other matters. I think it is important that we understand, in the same way as the Thais have reservations about the identity and purpose of APEC, the general attitude of Asian countries on many issues. I think the comments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) about the Khmer Rouge in Thailand is a very good example of how at times the aggressiveness, for which we are characteristic, can bring the wrong result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind the tragedy was the way in which the statement was made. No foreign minister and no Prime Minister can afford to be too arrogant and not take into account the sensitivities of a country, either because of the nature of its religion or prejudices or because it feels it will lose face, by making attack in the wrong way. The sad part is that now the foreign minister has virtually retracted his comments about Thai support for the Khmer Rouge it is he who has lost face. Australia has lost face in an area that is of great concern to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all want to see the elections that led to a change of regime within Cambodia, the outcome of the commitment of UNTAC forces which led to the elections and the efforts by Australians, including General Sanderson, in the sponsored UN peacekeeping force come to a positive result. It is no use going out there approaching the issue like a bull at a gate. We need to have the lesson of the Minister for Foreign Affairs' remarks in our mind when we look at future relations within APEC. Certainly in Thailand there is great concern about the effect those statements have made on our future relationship. We do not want those sorts of statements used in future approaches we may take within the APEC context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concern I have is that we do not set out in any way to think this is something that is going to be just a short-term endeavour. The Prime Minister in his statement certainly has suggested that it is going to be a way in which we can provide a better world in the 21st century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should remember that the beginnings of Bogor were in 1956 when the Japan-Australia trade agreement was entered into. The person who I feel more than anybody else has been responsible for this initiative is the late Sir John Crawford. John Crawford, who was head of the department of trade and industry when I first came to this place, was one who certainly saw the need for us to be able to develop new relationships in this Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to understand that while our economies are moving ahead&mdash;those of Asia are in particular&mdash;there is another dimension to trying to develop peace in the world. That entails looking after those countries in which the same opportunity is not present. I think it is important that, as we look at the Asia-Pacific, we look also at the Indian Ocean where it is said that a similar association may be developed. I think that may be very much in Australia's interests. Sadly, the countries of Africa and the countries of South America still have a long way to go before the opportunities available in Asia are available for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all, I commend the Prime Minister and the Australian government for the role they have played in the pursuit of the APEC initiatives and trust that, as the Prime Minister has suggested, they will be a basis for continued multilateral dialogue into the 21st century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a very interesting speech by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). It was good to see him commending the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and I join with him in doing so. One of the striking things about Australian history is the slowness with which we have recognised the importance of our geographic location. We are predominantly an immigrant people, predominantly from Europe. For that reason, the countries to which many Australians have related have been in Europe and then, at the time of the Second World War, the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout history, there have been prophetic people who have recognised the importance of our geographic location in relation to Asia and have tried to build up our relationships with that enormous continent. The right honourable member for New England referred to John Crawford as one of those, but there have been many. One thinks of scientists like Sir Ian Clunies-Ross or scholars like McMahon Ball. Jim Cairns's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living with Asia</EMPHASIS> influenced my development and concern in this area. There have been people on both sides of this House. R.G. Casey, when minister for foreign affairs, was very committed to building up relations with Asia and the Colombo Plan was one part of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That earlier investment is now bearing great fruit in our very good relationships with Asia. In the last few years, that firm foundation has been built on very effectively by the government&mdash;by the previous Prime Minister and by the present Prime Minister&mdash;in establishing strong economic relationships with the rapidly growing Asian countries. The APEC idea, which originated in Asia, has been gradually, methodically and carefully developed at a moderate, proper rate, depending on the sound consultation which has taken place. The meeting in Bogor was a very important stage along the way to greater integration with the countries of Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bogor agreement is a very important one. I simply repeat what others have already said in this debate: the negotiation of an agreement that there should be free and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region by the year 2020 is a major achievement. By making the target date well ahead, countries are given plenty of time to adjust, to make the changes in their tariff and non-tariff barrier structures, to be able to achieve that goal. The target is also expressed in a way which gives greater time for the developing countries to make their adjustments. The target is set for 2010 for the industrialised countries and 2020 for the developing countries. That ensures that the greater difficulty of developing countries in achieving that target is fully recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other achievements from the Bogor meeting which have received less attention. Some of them were referred to by the right honourable member for New England, but I would like to rehearse them because they are less well known than is the goal of reduction of tariffs. One of the most important is the elimination of administrative and other impediments in areas such as customs, standards, investment and other non-tariff barriers to trade. It is very important in order to facilitate effective trade relationships that we try to standardise on our procedures, on our investment guidelines, and that that quite complex task be addressed now so that it can be achieved as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to ensure that these goals are not an excuse for delaying reductions in tariffs, the Bogor meeting also agreed to accelerate within the region the elimination of tariffs relating to the Uruguay Round so that they would be implemented in the time that was set for them, so that those commitments are applied as well as those within the APEC region. As well, there was a commitment which would prevent any further increases in tariff or non-tariff barriers in a way that would hardly seem necessary. But, of course, it is quite important to express that minimum standard as well as the positive goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as those very important developments relating to tariffs, there were a number of other important achievements, involving integrating the business sector into APEC programs, creating a mechanism for that purpose and establishing a review procedure for considering a voluntary consultative dispute mediation service. It is wrapped around with qualifications but, provided that is implemented, that too could be an important step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly glad to see that there was a commitment relating to human resource development. I share the concern of the right honourable member for New England that social issues were not at all prominent on the agenda. That is understandable; it is not a criticism at all. Economic development is certainly the priority for the region, but one would like to see APEC expand its attention in other centrally important areas of government policy, and those in the social policy area are amongst them. That would obviously include education and health very high on the agenda. There was a mention of those in relation to human resource development and cooperation relating to that. I strongly support that at the next meeting greater attention be given to that cooperative educational activity and hope to expand it into other areas, such as health and housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a commitment to strengthening dialogue on economic policy questions other than tariffs. That, too, is crucial. One of the striking features of the global economy at present is that there is no global forum at which economic policy can be comprehensively discussed. The G7 relates only to the major industrialised countries, the OECD relates to western industrialised countries, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank principally deal with current account deficit developing countries, and the UN has very little influence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we build up one global forum where economic policy questions can be comprehensively and influentially discussed. That should happen through the economic and social council of the United Nations, but a step towards that goal would be to build up regional discussion of those questions. That is happening in Europe. That is one of the central aspects of the importance of the European Union. It should also happen in our region. There is scope for coordination of macro-economic policy, for example, for examining ways within the region of standardising approaches to taxation to prevent the competitive downward bidding of tax rates which foreign investors sometimes force on to weak, developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many areas where cooperation over economic policy would enhance the economic development prospects of developing countries as well as industrialised countries in the region. That should be on the APEC agenda. Another issue I would hope would fit onto the APEC agenda in due course is that of security. One of the major steps that has been important in Europe in the last couple of decades has been the establishment of the conference on security and cooperation, which has led to improved communication about defence issues within Europe. It has led to the introduction of a whole series of confidence building measures to improve communication so that those countries can build up their trust in each other, reduce a breakdown of communications, which leads to tension, and allow them to reduce their military expenditure below what it would otherwise be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same kind of communication does not yet effectively exist within the east Asia region. It would be a very important step to gradually move in that direction. This year is notable for our having the first conference on security matters in the east Asia region. That was held in the middle of the year. Just the fact that it was held is a very significant development. Three years ago, I moved a motion in this House calling for the establishment of a conference on security and cooperation in east Asia and the Pacific. The opposition opposed that motion on the grounds that it was too visionary, that it was inconsistent with Australian interest in some way or that the Americans did not like it. Now it is supporting that approach. That change has occurred within the last three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US is supporting that kind of approach because, obviously, it makes sense. If we are not talking to each other, we are creating a situation where tension increases. If we are communicating effectively, tension can be reduced, potential military conflict can be defused and we can spend rather less on wasteful military activity and build up our expenditure on far more important economic and social programs. I hope that security will also appear on the APEC agenda in due course and that there will be some place on that agenda for human rights questions. They are difficult, they involve tension, and there are different perspectives in different countries but, quite clearly, Australia has a commitment to enhancing and strengthening human rights within the region. There are some notable cases of failure to apply appropriate human rights standards within the region, and it is very important that we play our role on a principled, firm and determined basis in strengthening implementation of human rights, both in the political and legal spheres and the economic, social and cultural spheres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, on the agenda for the World Summit for Social Development, for which preparations are being made in New York and which will be held in Copenhagen next year, one of the issues receiving a great deal of attention is the ratification universally of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the strengthening implementation of that convention. It will be a fine convention because it will set minimum standards for the  availability of education and health and the goal of full employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is strong support for that convention in Australia. In fact, an Australian chairs the international implementation committee. We are advocating, in the preparations for the world summit, that that covenant be universally ratified by the year 2000 and that resources available for its implementation be increased and strengthened. That will also play a role in strengthening human rights regimes in Asia. It is important that human rights appear on the agenda of regional bodies as well as the UN in order to ensure that those goals are achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Prime Minister, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and all associated with the Bogor meeting. It was a major achievement. It is a very important step towards greater economic integration in the region. We look forward to making that more fruitful and effective in the years ahead. We also hope and advocate that the agenda for future APEC meetings be extended in those social, security and human rights areas so that total relationships within the region can be effectively strengthened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on APEC. Our future lies with Asia, which is what this particular paper is all about. Earlier today we discussed the defence white paper, Defending Australia, and this flows on from that. Both those matters are very much inter-related when it comes to speaking about Australia's future, particularly in this region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all of us in this parliament need to be positive in our approach to dealing with these sorts of issues in our area. I was particularly disappointed to hear some comments from those opposite and to read in the paper of the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). The headline I read was something like `Downer tears up white paper'. That has been his attitude for some time. I remember at the last election he visited my electorate as the opposition spokesperson on defence&mdash;my vote went up two points, so he can come back any time&mdash;and made it quite clear that, if the opposition were elected to government, it would not be going ahead with the purchase of further F111s. The good thing for the defence of Australia was that those opposite were not elected to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have 15 extra F111s which have been refurbished and are now flying. It was certainly a great initiative of the government to purchase them. That goes hand in hand with what we need when talking about defending Australia. The APEC agreement is very important, and I think we all need to get behind it. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) was much more positive in his comments on the Prime Minister's participation in the APEC meeting and the Bogor declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central element in the Declaration of Common Resolve is the commitment to free trade and investment in the region by the year 2010 for industrialised economies and by the year 2020 for developing economies. What underpins that commitment is our recognition of the growing independence of regional economies and the need to work together to maintain high rates of economic growth. That work must start here if we are to expand that into the Asia region as well. Our business community plays a very important part in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some criticism that business has not been as active as it should be. Whilst the government is committed to the APEC process, we need to urge business and the community to get behind the process. BHP is a very good example. For some years, it has been supplying specialised building materials designed for particular environmental conditions in the region which are notorious for their effect in the traditional dwellings of areas like Sarawak. BHP is taking a positive step. The number of Australian companies making a name for themselves in the Asia-Pacific region is growing, but it may be too slow. We need to encourage it more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For industry to really succeed in the region, it does not simply need to identify and tap into an export market in selected countries. Industry has to pursue a real commitment to the region and its people. I was pleased to pick up the September edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Council Bulletin </EMPHASIS>out of all the mountains of paper that come to our offices in this place. This edition had the heading `Asia Pacific Economic Developments'. When business is picking up and running with this, the sorts of criticisms I just made will be picked up, because there are great opportunities. There is a special feature in this publication about Mr Bob Lim, the Business Council's director of policy analysis and research. The executive director's forward said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This article was written by Bob Lim following a recent study tour of several regional economies where he met with government ministers, officials, bankers, economists, academics and business people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bob Lim's visit sought to address the question: "Can government policies and corporate strategies in Australia assume that Asia Pacific growth will proceed on the same basis as the past two decades?" His answer is a resounding "Yes"! In particular, he said that this  assessment echoes the sentiments expressed in an October 1993 survey by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Economist</EMPHASIS> (A Survey of Asia; A Billion Consumers).</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By 2000, Asians . . . are expected to account for 3.5 billion of the world's 6.2 billion people. On conservative assumptions, fully 1 billion of those Asians&mdash;not much less than the entire populations of north America, South America and the European Community today&mdash;will be living in households with some consumer-spending power (meaning they can buy at least basic goods such as colour televisions, refrigerators and motor-bikes).</PARA>
<PARA>Sometimes you wonder what basic goods are. It further goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps 400 million of these consumers&mdash;three times as many as now&mdash;will have disposable incomes at least equal to the rich-world average today; they will be spending their money on houses, cars, holidays, health care and education. And if all this consumer spending is to take place, immense investments in infrastructure will be needed to make it possible: Power plants, roads and airports among other things. The rocket-like growth and absolute size of Asia's middle class should therefore create some of the biggest business and financial opportunities in history, and far-sighted western firms and their workers stand to profit immensely from this.</PARA>
<PARA>That shows the very positive attitude and the focus of the Australian business community. We need more of that and we need the business community to pick that up and run with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was speaking the other day on the defence white paper, I made reference to the trip I made to New Zealand last week and the fact that I do not think Australian business is taking up all the opportunities there either. It is focusing on a lot of the bigger areas, and that is good, but it also has to make sure that it develops and looks at some of the smaller areas&mdash;not that New Zealand is one of the smaller ones when we start looking at the South Pacific area, particularly. As the right honourable member for New England said earlier, our two countries have a close relationship and it should be maintained and enhanced at every opportunity. I hope that our visit did achieve that, because we certainly were treated very well by the New Zealanders and I thank them very much for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are opportunities in the other smaller countries such as Samoa, Tonga and the Cook Islands, et cetera, which businesses need to get into. This is an opportunity for us to encourage business as much as we can. I welcome the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Council Bulletin</EMPHASIS> publication. I am not usually one of the people who get up here and say good things about the Business Council, but I think its members can really pick up on that and do a lot with it. The Bogor declaration definitely gives business many great opportunities in the immediate and long-term future up to the year 2020. What that means is many job opportunities for Australians, which is very important to us. The article also mentioned an exhibition when they were speaking about the growth of the cities. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Year 2000 there will be 22 mega-cities in the world . . . 13 of these cities will be in the Asia-Pacific region</PARA>
<PARA>The growth in this region will be quite phenomenal and all of those opportunities are there for us to pick up. Hopefully, we will be able to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The APEC summit has been described as an overwhelming opportunity for everybody and it has been important for us. The Prime Minister is to be commended on his contribution to that. He has certainly shown his leadership qualities. It is something that we on this side of the House are very proud of and I know all Australians can be very proud of his participation and of what he has done in these particular areas. There are those great opportunities for us. The Prime Minister made the point the other day in his speech&mdash;I mentioned the New Zealanders before&mdash;that the APEC summit was a triumph for diplomacy. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr Bolger, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the level of commitment from leaders was remarkable. . . it is truly going to change the nature of trade in the world in the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA>The overwhelmingly positive comments that have come from the various APEC leaders mirror this attitude. That sort of feeling and attitude are essential if we are going to succeed in the part of the world where we actually belong. This makes it even more important for Australian business to go into the region, because industries of the other member nations will not stand still&mdash;nor should they. I call on Australian industry, particularly those businesses with established export markets in the region, to make the most of the multitude of opportunities the Bogor declaration has created for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the government's policies are changing Australia for the better, there is always more to be done and we will continue as a government to keep up the strength of Australia today. Australia is finishing this year on a very positive note, with the growth we are seeing at present. As time goes on, we must recognise the need for further changes and improvements across all sectors of the economy. One particular thing that Australians are good at is our ability to trade in services. That is a very important area that we should pick up on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to employment, technology is something that has often been seen as a bit of a problem for us. How do we cope with the new technologies as they move on? Of course, we could have done things better, but technology is something that has a major impact. There are also great advantages for us in that area. We should make sure that we use all our comparative advantages in the areas of technology and education to increase our trade participation in the region. Our health and education services are something that we can really participate in and we can offer more in training services. The telecommunications industry is going ahead in leaps and bounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate, a new information technology outlet is opening today. If I had been at home, I would have gone to the opening, but, unfortunately, I am still here. We are taking advantage of new information links. The new outlet in my electorate is called Infolink. A group in New Zealand, the Wellington City Council, is involved in the same sort of thing. It is helping us in Ipswich with our participation. There was a seminar here earlier today on that very aspect. The New Zealanders were over here helping us develop these new information technologies. They are the sorts of things that are happening and the sorts of things we need to focus on if we want to play our part and take every opportunity that is available to us as a nation in terms of APEC. I know business has the ability to do it and it really needs to take every opportunity to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, we need to ensure that we on this side of the House and those on the other side of the House are very positive about the opportunities that are available to us in the booming Asia-Pacific region. We on this side will continue to pursue those opportunities as much as we can. I am sure that as time goes on we will have every opportunity to take up those opportunities, which will help employment and help the Australian people prosper. I hope that this will be the last time I speak in the House this year. I take the opportunity to wish all my colleagues the best for the festive season and I look forward to seeing them all back here next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly a much appreciated gesture of the government to allow those of us who have missed out on the opportunity to speak in the adjournment debate during the past week or fortnight the opportunity to put a few things on the public record this afternoon. I want to address two issues in this adjournment debate. Firstly, I would like to put on record the concerns of an orchid grower within my electorate of Lyne, Mr John Wright of Coopernook. Mr Wright has serious concerns with the continued use of the chemical fungicide Benlate throughout Australia other than in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of Benlate as a chemical fungicide has been the cause of widespread litigation in the United States of America and has been withdrawn from the market in South Australia due to damage caused to the flower growing industry in that state. One Florida newspaper has described the story of Benlate as a tale without equal in modern agriculture. Benlate is the trade name for a fungicide that is labelled for use on a wide range of fruit and vegetable crops and ornamental plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Benlate is manufactured by the multinational giant Dupont, and the wettable powder formulation came on to the market in 1969. In late 1987 Dupont replaced Benlate WP with an easier to mix granular formulation, Benlate DF. Both have been commonly used in Australia, and for many years Benlate was a staple for nursery growers to prevent fungal outbreaks. However, over the last few years, Benlate has been linked to health problems and to plant damage in the United States, England, New Zealand and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1991 there has been a recognition that the product Benlate has produced deleterious effects in crops and that serious problems exist. The dry flowerable granular forms of the fungicide&mdash;Benlate 50DF, Benlate 1991 DF and Tersan 1991 DF&mdash;were removed from the market in the United States in March 1991 when Dupont issued a stop sale and recall on these products. This followed reports of stunted root and plant growth. Benlate DF was then recalled in Australia following notification in a press release dated 12 June 1991. However, the recall was not at all well publicised. Yet the wettable powder formulation, Benlate WP, is still on sale in Australia. However, there is evidence that this formulation has also caused problems in plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr John Wright of Coopernook claims it was the product Benlate that recently totally wiped out his orchid crop costing him in excess of $100,000. The history of Mr Wright's problem is an interesting one. He has made extensive representations to the New South Wales agriculture department and to Dupont Australia regarding this issue. So much so that at various times representatives from both organisations have visited Mr Wright's property to takes samples for testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore have some serious concerns to raise in this debate. Why, in a letter dated 25 October 1992 from the National Registration Authority&mdash;the group that is supposed to monitor all chemical products in Australia&mdash;does it state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all states, except South Australia, no reports of plant damage have been received by departments of agriculture/ primary industries.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Wright has had samples taken from his property by the New South Wales department of agriculture, yet it seems to have forgotten having visited his property. It is highly irregular that South Australia has been the only state in Australia that has been able to force Dupont Australia and the relevant department to withdraw Benlate from the market. I am sure the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) would agree with me that what is dangerous in one state must also be considered dangerous in another. Uniformity across the states of Australia is surely lacking here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My next concern is with the testing arrangements for Benlate. I do not have a superior knowledge of herbicides, but I understand that Benlate is a promoter of sulfonel urea, which is a herbicide of sorts. Naturally, after finding out this information, Mr Wright wanted sulfonel urea tested out on his plants. However, just this week the New South Wales agriculture department has told him that it does not have the facilities to test it. This is very strange indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is yet another concern in this issue. I have here two newspaper articles from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, one headlined `Avocado dip a recipe for longer life produce' and the other `Fruit chemical mistake admitted'. What happened was that a fellow in New South Wales agriculture department thought he had discovered another use for Benlate as a preserver for avocados. The five-member team claimed to have spent four years developing the technique and the federal Department of Primary Industries and Energy had applied to the New Zealand government to allow in exports using the new procedure. Yet in a following newspaper article, this same fellow is forced to admit he was wrong&mdash;that the chemical would actually seep through the skin and cause serious physical problems!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet another strange twist to this story is that when Mr Wright made his initial inquiries to Dupont Australia regarding Benlate, Dupont employed a consultant to speak with Mr Wright and take samples. This person just so happened to be the wife of the representative who thought he had come up with the miracle avocado dip for the New South Wales department of agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are too many unanswered questions about the active ingredients of Benlate; there are too many unanswered questions surrounding the use of this chemical by Australian farmers; and there are too many unanswered questions about the role of certain individuals with what seems to be an ulterior motive for the protection of Benlate for this issue to simply rest. We need to see this issue investigated by the department of primary industries in a hope of achieving some uniform dangerous chemical practices throughout Australia. It is only then that individual businessmen, such as Mr Wright, who has suffered great personal expense and loss of income, will be protected in their horticultural endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I raise in this adjournment debate is totally unrelated to that of the chemical Benlate, but it is very important considering that in 1995 we are coming to the Australian celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War. I want to put on the public record what took place in my home town of Wingham on Remembrance Day a couple of weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important ceremony was held on Remembrance Day in November this year in final recognition for the young soldier from Wingham, Private Alan `Johnny' Wallis, who gave his life in Vietnam&mdash;the only native of Wingham on the mid-north coast of New South Wales to lose his life in that Vietnam conflict. The ceremony, which included 10 diggers from his section who fought alongside him, as well as members from the Manning District Vietnam Veterans Association, unveiled a plaque in his memory at the Wingham Town Hall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private Alan J. Wallis was killed in Vietnam on 16 May 1968&mdash;26 years ago. It has taken that long, as we have seen over the last couple of years, for the broader community in Australia to develop respect for those people that were involved in the Vietnam conflict. He is survived by his aunt, Vera Tisdell, and his nephew, Alan Bell, who both unveiled the plaque at the ceremony and accepted replicas of the young soldier's medals, as well as the Australian flag, which I presented to them on behalf of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His section commander, Bert `Shorty' Thirkell, gave a short tribute to the young soldier who died in the battle of  Fire Support Base Coral. I might add at this point that none other than the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) was also involved as a Vietnam veteran in that battle. There were unashamedly few dry eyes among his old buddies. They had travelled from Sydney, Armidale and from up the coast to be there for the special occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a number of people, including local veteran Steve Pemberton, the unveiling of the plaque was a final farewell at the end of a long campaign and research to have recognition for the only solider from Wingham to die in the Vietnam War. Steve deserves to be congratulated for his efforts and the hours that he put into researching the story of Johnny Wallis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many of the veterans present, including Private Wallis's mates from 7 Section, 3 Platoon, 1RAR, the day was filled with memories of the sacrifices and the comradeship which no-one but those who went to Vietnam could understand. Special mention must also be made of Private Wallis's friend and digger mate Eric Edmonds. I understand Eric had been absolutely determined to be at the ceremony on Remembrance Day 1994, on that Friday. However, he unfortunately passed away in Concord Hospital on 28 October this year after his battle with cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the Vietnam veterans at that short ceremony for Johnny Wallis told me about some of the ongoing statistics and the problems that are faced by Vietnam veterans today. I was handed a copy of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stand to</EMPHASIS>, a bulletin put out by the Vietnam Veterans Association. An interesting paragraph in there stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statistics from the Vietnam War are horrifying. Of the 50,000 troops who served in the theatre, 5,000 have died from "natural causes", over 4,000 have suicided, some 16,000 are being treated for varying disabilities, of these 16,000, a large number have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. This is a psychiatric disorder which is most distressing to wives and families and the members who have it. The veteran looks 100% but is in fact a very disturbed individual. In the last "Veterans Budget Review", the DVA set aside four foolscap pages alone on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>Those statistics are very compelling as to the circumstances of a large percentage of the Vietnam veterans&mdash;those 50,000 soldiers who fought on behalf of the Australian community in Vietnam. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the vital problems that face my electorate is the question of education. Some statistics from the 1991 census are indicative of the reality out there. Whereas in the Sydney metropolitan area 3 1/2 per cent of people are currently engaged in CAE or university studies, the local figure for the Reid electorate is 2 1/2 per cent. In a similar fashion, one finds that, whilst about eight per cent of Reid residents have higher education or associate diploma qualifications, that compares with the figure of approximately 15 per cent for the Sydney region. These figures are indicative of a problem that relates to the presence of a very large NESB population and the socioeconomic characteristics of low income levels and high unemployment, equally enforced to some degree by the starvation of resources in the library sector by the Parramatta City Council, whose performance is in strong contrast to Auburn which recently obtained an award for its work in ethnic libraries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But today I want to talk about a study that came out in the last week or so&mdash;it was cited in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 5 December this year&mdash;by Dr Bob Birrell and Ian Dobson. It noted the very high probability that Australia's Austudy scheme is being abused in a very big fashion not only by people undertaking tax minimisation schemes but also by a number of people resident outside of Australia who have children studying here. They went to the fact that large numbers of people in the private education field are currently receiving Austudy, despite paying school fees of approximately $7,000 a year. They are questioning how people can afford this $7,000 and at the same time have incomes which qualify them for Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main point that concerns me is the interrelationship of this with the access to our university system by tourists and visitors. In the last few months I have had need to correspond with universities around Australia, as well as their conference. Although I do not go down the street looking for such people or asking people questions, in a very short time at least three people came to my attention, through migration cases, who have been merrily attending our universities while tourists in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have not come here in the proper way as foreign students and abided by the variety of requirements in that field, such as having student visas and departing from Australia at the time of expiry of their visas, the maintenance of a valid enrolment and a maximum of 20 hours part-time work. They have not come here and sought to enter our institutions up front, paying the fees and abiding by the rules. In one case a person was simultaneously undertaking tertiary study for three years while pursing a refugee claim. In that process she had a solicitor with the effrontery to put forward as one of the grounds for residence in this country the fact that she had illegally done a course in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The universities supposedly have some responsibility in this field. Under section 5.21 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Administrative guidelines manual for higher education institutions on HECS and fees </EMPHASIS>it notes that they are supposed to confirm the eligibility of students who claim exemption from HECS and to verify documentation relevant to a student's claim for exemption. Furthermore, the immigration status of students will be clear from passports or other travel documents. Section 5.72 speaks of overseas students and says that they are required to identify themselves as holders of student visas or temporary entry visas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially a part of this problem is Australia's ludicrous privacy laws which allow people to get tax file numbers without any requirement whatsoever as to their resident status. That in turn becomes a crucial facet of their possibilities of entering institutions here. From my contact with these universities there has been a fairly studied level of disinterest, a cavalier attitude, that really it is too hard for them to check. It would be atrocious of the government to actually require them to check passports and other verification, because they really have too much to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, every year we have pressure in our electorates from students who cannot get admission to courses. Our region has been part of a campaign waged by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and others to seek some kind of reallocation of university places in this country to recognise the population change favouring Queensland, western Sydney and northern New South Wales. That is typical of a very real problem out there, but it does not really assist measures of university access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, I feel there is a case that this system is being abused in a far greater fashion than the government or these institutions claim. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) in response to a question earlier this year stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . institutions must satisfy themselves that, in all cases, the students have the correct enrolment status. It is a matter for each higher education institution to decide how best to fulfil its obligations to ensure that students are enrolled according to the correct status.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T4">Mr FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As queried over there, the rampant attitude of these institutions is that they do not check. The comment of the University of New South Wales, for instance, is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst we currently rely on students' honesty when completing application and enrolment forms, we believe that appropriate sanctions are available if students do make a false declaration. Alternative procedures such as demanding to see passports or birth certificates before enrolling 24,000 local students would be a huge administrative burden which institutions, with their present state of funding, would not be in a position to bear.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Thom of UNE commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My academic colleagues are increasingly concerned by the demands placed on us by government agencies for more and more accountability . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The registrar of the Northern Territory University commented that this `would divert scarce resources away from areas of greater need and importance'. Mr F.S. Hambly of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee said that the greater flexibility in the visitor visa provisions has been welcomed. But his solution to all this was, `It is too hard for us to do although we are supposed to do it.' He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would, therefore, be appropriate to bring such cases to the attention the DIEA, DEET and the institution concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>He put forward the proposition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the number of international students who have attempted to defraud the nation by passing themselves off as local students is extremely small.</PARA>
<PARA>He comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would need to be demonstrated by hard data rather than hearsay that such fraud is in fact a growing trend, before additional measures to monitor compliance would be considered either appropriate or cost-effective.</PARA>
<PARA>I had three people walk into my office within a period of two months. One of them, fortunately, the University of Wollongong had picked up and deprived of his qualifications but he had managed to go along to that institution, like the other claimant I spoke about earlier, for three years undetected simply by saying, `I am a permanent resident.' As I say, this typifies a very real problem out there. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T4">Mr FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. As the member over there notes, an honour system. There have been some positive attitudes from a minority of universities. Central Queensland University noted:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now that you have highlighted this potential for abuse, we will be more vigilant in monitoring the situation to see if the practice is occurring at this institution.</PARA>
<PARA>The University of Wollongong, which I mentioned earlier, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The University of Wollongong first experienced this problem two years ago and has carefully checked the residential status of students enrolling in courses in 1993 and 1994. Students are required to bring to Enrolment either a passport, Birth Certificate, or Citizenship Certificate for verification.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this university acknowledges the problem, is doing something about it and does not seek to shirk responsibility. Essentially, people get access with tax file numbers, go to a university for a period and then, in some cases, decide to leave Australia before HECS is collected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the buck passing between a number of government departments and the universities throughout this country must halt. If we are talking about the failure of Australian students to get access to tertiary education, it is not good enough to simply say that it is too hard, that we have not got the time, that too many of our clerical staff are doing other things. This is, as I said, a manifest problem. It is also typified in my own knowledge of people getting access to TAFE colleges or people getting building licences in New South Wales who are not even permanent residents and who have no migration status that justifies such. I ask the government to take this matter seriously. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I would like to address a subject that is or should be important to all of us: the integrity of the electoral system. With the last federal election being lost by our side of politics by perhaps about 1,000 votes in a very small number of seats, it is in our interest on this side and, I submit respectfully, in the interests of colleagues opposite, to make sure that what is said to be the result of an Australian election accurately represents the collective will of the Australian people. I am not suggesting that the government is out there rorting the system on this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has certainly misled the Australian people with its promises prior to the election. I am seeking to point out in the adjournment debate today that it is important when the votes are tallied and the result is called that the result represents what the Australian people wish to achieve on election day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it absolutely amazing that in Australia in 1994 we have an honour system for enrolments. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) mentioned quite accurately that there are major problems with people enrolling through the university system who are not eligible to be in Australia. The universities do not require any evidence of their right to be in Australia before permitting an enrolment to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have an honour system for Australian electoral enrolments. If people wanted to rort the electoral system, then they could sit down and fill in many thousands of enrolment cards after the Electoral Office has conducted the habitation survey. Using the envelopes provided by the Australian Electoral Office, they could get thousands of nom de plumes added to any electoral roll. No-one in this House on either side would support such a practice. But it does indicate to me that it is very important that proof of identity be required prior to people being able to get on the electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, before one is able to open a bank account one must provide 100 points to prove to the financial institution that the person exists. Only real people, not nom de plumes, are able to have bank accounts in Australia. Similarly, the Department of Social Security requires some evidence of who a person is before that person is able to register for unemployment benefits. Even the drivers licence issuing process requires some evidence of identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right to vote in Australia ought to be extended only to those people entitled to enrol. Yet, while we have these fairly stringent provisions to weed out people who are not entitled to have a bank account, to be on social security benefits or to have a drivers licence, we have a situation where anyone who wants to fill in any number of enrolment cards could be enrolled on the Australian electoral roll under any number of nom de plumes. I think that is something the government really ought to look at. It is a matter of grave concern. I suggest that honourable members opposite would also be worried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a problem that we do not have continual reviews of electoral rolls. I am not blaming the Australian Electoral Office here. I think it has a very difficult job. With the very large mobility factor within Australia, with people moving from the rust belt areas of southern Australia to places like Queensland, we find that there are a great number of changes to enrolments. After a habitation survey is completed there is absolutely no check on the very large number of new enrolments or changed enrolments which arrive at the Electoral Office just prior to an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that in 1993, in the seven days prior to the close of rolls, almost half a million people changed their enrolments or sought enrolment. Again, the honour system applies to these people. They are automatically placed on the electoral roll without checking their identity, age, citizenship or their right to be on that roll. With only about 1,000 people in a selected small number of electorates across Australia determining the election result, it is pretty obvious that the present system is open to rorting and rigging. That is a matter of very grave concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the chamber would certainly like to see continuous enrolment checking. We would like to see the Electoral Office advertise widely prior to an election period to make sure as many people get on the electoral roll as are entitled to but within a time frame which enables their right to enrol to be checked. I think the last minute rush can create a situation where it is very difficult to check a person's right to enrol even if the Electoral Office is of a mind to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the 1984 election, we had a subdivisional arrangement within the Australian electorates. In the electorate of Herbert, represented by my friend the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), we had a number of subdivisions. It meant that if a person was going to vote on polling day as an ordinary voter, that person had to vote within the particular subdivision in which he or she was enrolled. If you were going to go from one side of an electorate to another, then obviously you could still cast a vote but you would be an absentee voter. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), who is in the chair, would also recall the situation that used to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In country areas in particular where people vote quite often the polling staff recognise them. We now have a situation where a person who has lodged these thousands of nom de plumes could go to any of the 40 or 50 polling booths in any of our federal electorates and vote a number of times as an ordinary voter. If we had the subdivisional system reinstated, it would be less likely that this would occur as often because a person would have to cast an absent vote in areas away from his immediate area of residence. I think that is very important as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to touch on another subject that I feel very strongly about. I have supported the principle of voluntary voting in the chamber in the past. I would certainly go to the barricades to defend everyone's right in Australia to enrol and vote on polling day. One of the things we ought to be thankful for in Australia is that we have a democratic system. When an election is called, people are able to go to the polls and vote for the party of their choice or vote to toss the government out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Australian constitution and system of government, with our system of checks and balances, have obviously made sure that we enjoy what we consider, quite rightly, to be a very basic right of democracy. Of course, we only have to turn on our television sets to see that in many other parts of the world similar rights are not enjoyed. But I believe that in a democracy, while it is a person's right to vote, it is the very antithesis of freedom to fine someone if he or she chooses not to vote. I think a person ought to be able to vote for a political party or an individual or against a political party or an individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I also think that, in a democracy, it is very important to ensure that, if a person considers no political party or candidate is worthy of support, that person has the right to abstain. After all, when a vote is called here in the chamber, we have the right to vote one way, the other way or, indeed, to abstain. </PARA>

But, in the spirit of Christmas, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have noticed that we did not comment on it at that particular time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important that members of parliament on both sides try to make sure that we have integrity in our electoral system. I am not suggesting that thousands of people lodge nom de plumes or that the rolls are rorted, but the system is open to those things occurring. I think that wherever possible, wherever we see a loophole or the capacity for fraud, we have a responsibility to the Australian people to move to close that loophole or shut off that fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government really ought to take these matters into account. They are vital matters. I am not being partisan in this debate. I think, really, I am speaking on behalf of the Australian people. I also believe that I am expressing the sentiments of probably all members in the chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a matter which touches on my electorate only in passing, but which does touch on the Australian nation. I refer to the way that people with serious brain injury are treated within this Commonwealth. Some members on the other side might find that a matter for comment; the member for Cook (Mr Dobie) might think that it is something to laugh about. But I am sure that the families of those people who have been in serious car accidents who have been classified and determined as being in a vegetative state would take his comments and laughter in the light in which they should be taken&mdash;they would view them with disdain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been approached by a Dr Ted Freeman, who has been recognised internationally and has been invited to join the international working party on the management of the persistent vegetative state. He is the author of a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Catastrophe of Coma&mdash;a way back</EMPHASIS>. Dr Freeman is in many ways a loner in the medical profession; many in the establishment have viewed the work he has done with very cynical attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like us to think about the situation where, through no fault of their own or through fault of their own, people are involved in accidents which cause massive brain damage. Often those people who are thus traumatised end up in a coma. If and when that coma does diminish and they come out of it, their state is diagnosed by the medical profession in terms of their ability to rehabilitate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad reflection that a member of such a family has commented, when speaking of a loved one who was in such a position, that the situation went from `intensive care' to `no care' to `don't care'. The reflection is that there is not a great deal of emphasis put on the rehabilitation of these people. If their medical assessment is that they are in a vegetative state from which they are not able to be rehabilitated, then those people are often shunted away to nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of angles to consider at this point. We can first talk about the personal trauma and relationships involved. Many of the families of these victims are told, `This person is a vegetable; turn away, walk away from them; go on with your life and treat them as though they are dead.' While there are many situations where that may be the case and people may be in a non-returnable condition in terms of any communication or cognitive process, there are many, according to Dr Freeman, who are misdiagnosed; in fact, he has suggested that the majority of people are misdiagnosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you as an individual&mdash;and I ask all those in the House to think as individuals&mdash;how you would feel if your cognitive processes were there but your ability to communicate, your physical ability to be able to contact the outside world, were not there? It would be the very worst of all imprisonments. It would be the very worst of all solitary confinements. To then have the medical profession advise those who loved them to turn and walk away would be a tragedy for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am led to believe that in other countries, such as the United States, Great Britain and even New Zealand, there is talk of withdrawal of what they call `life support systems'. In these instances, the life support systems which are referred to are stomach-feeding and intravenous drips to keep hydration up. Denial of those things leads ultimately to death. My concern is whether this is done on a humanitarian basis or an economic rationalist basis. It is not done in Australia at this point in time, and I am not aware of it being advocated in Australia at this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other countries ethical protocols have been developed for the medical profession in order to establish how withdrawal can take place. If Dr Freeman is right and the majority of these people who are considered to be in a vegetative state can be brought back to some semblance of control and cognitive thought, in terms of their ability to do some of the smallest things, in terms of life processes, then it is a tragedy that we should avoid at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Freeman has asked that a national register of coma cases be established. He does this for a number of reasons, the first of which is that, without ongoing support and research dollars in this area, we will find a number of our citizens subjected to this involuntary imprisonment. I cannot think of a worse fate to occur to an individual who has cognitive thought, even though it may lie deep in his or her brain, but who may not be able to communicate with others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Dr Freeman's results, shown in his book and research, show that in many instances these people can be brought back to a state of mind, a state of existence, in which they can experience some of the experiences, the norms of life, that a normal, well bodied adult may achieve, even though they may not be able to appreciate the full range of experiences. It seems to me that we need to address this matter, and to do so with compassion. Dr Freeman suggests that, despite the little research here and the lack of recognition he receives in Australia and in his own country, we are in a position where we are able do a lot more than we presently do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much understand what the National Brain Injury Foundation and Dr Freeman are about. I understand that, whilst these people may not be able to recuperate and rehabilitate themselves to the standard of their former lives, they can achieve great success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ability to scratch one's nose or to caress or recognise one's loved ones is all part of that human ability. These people are still human. To be classified as being in a `vegetative state' is virtually one step up from `brain dead'; these people are dehumanised. Some time ago, a film called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Coma</EMPHASIS> referred to this and explored the fact that these people were being used as organ banks. I am not suggesting in any way that Australia would go down that path but, if it ever tried to, I would go all the way to make sure it did not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will address the economic rationalist approach to try to reach those people whose only consideration in any argument on any issue is dollars and cents. The reality is that, once people are diagnosed as being in a vegetative state, the state governments then throw them out of the hospitals into nursing homes. This means a transfer of responsibility from the states to the Commonwealth. That transfer of dollars and cents seems to be pushing people to be declared vegetative and moved across. It takes the responsibility of rehabilitation away from the state and refers it to the Commonwealth. Somebody has to take responsibility. Somebody has to pay. But the cost of rehabilitating these people in many instances is a lot less than the $2 million or $3 million it costs for, say, a 26-year-old to be in a nursing home for the rest of his or her life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to those economic rationalists: look at the dollars and cents approach to rehabilitation. There have been cases where people have become productive members of our society again. From an economic rationalist viewpoint, we should explore every opportunity to get these people out of their comas and give them the fullest life they can achieve. It may not exactly be what we consider to be a full life but, for them and their families, it is an act of humanitarianism. It is an act that we cannot walk away from. It is something we should value, and as human beings we should encourage and do all we can to support it. </PARA>

I visited the towns of  Kingscliff, Tyalgum, Kyogle, Coraki, Bonalbo, Armidale, Tamworth, Walcha and the little town of Barraba. It was a most instructive trip. I would certainly recommend that my colleagues in this place take such a trip to enhance their understanding of what is going on in rural and regional Australia today in some of the most severely drought affected areas this country has seen for a very long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the face of a disaster, which some of the older people in the community related to me was like returning to wartime conditions and worse, the spirit in those communities was really quite amazing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are experiencing such harsh conditions that even the basic necessities of life are not available to them. Many of them are having to rely on charity in order to survive. It is, indeed, heartbreaking. It really was a lump-in-the-throat, heart-wrenching experience for me and my staff who accompanied me. Not only have they experienced several years of severe drought; they have also had to endure a government which has no regard for them and has not considered them at all in a disaster relief program. Many in some of the towns I visited do not qualify for any drought aid but have experienced severe drought over a sustained period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current rural crisis, which has been brought about by the extended and most debilitating drought in recent memories, has also highlighted the desperate circumstances that many of these rural families are experiencing. For the women in particular&mdash;who have multiple roles during this time of wife, mother, carer, community worker, business partner or operator of small businesses in their own right&mdash;the impact has been reflected in a deterioration in physical and mental health of their families and of themselves. Women are carrying additional burdens as they take up the hard labour on the farm alongside their partners to keep things going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the women who have had these multiple roles, there is evidence of some very serious problems emerging in a social sense. The pressures being exerted on rural women are exacerbated by what I think is a callous disregard of their plight and a somewhat cynical view of delivering aid to drought affected areas. Assistance measures that have been implemented have been too little and too late. The areas that have been lucky enough to qualify for drought relief should have been getting that assistance two years ago. The flow-on effects of the government's tardy consideration of the social and economic consequences of this drought were evident in every community I visited. Women I met with and listened to provided the same assessment of the degradation of life in their communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tamworth, I met with a group of 20 business and professional women from the town who recognised that, despite the tough times for those people in the town, the women on the rural properties had it even tougher. Those on the land were having to truck in their drinking water, which meant that there was no water to do the weekly laundry. The women of Tamworth got together and offered their washing machines to the women on the land so that each week those women could do their baskets of laundry in the homes of the women of Tamworth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think we have any idea of what that must be like. As we sit in the comfort of this place and see the wonderful gardens and lawns that surround us, it is very difficult for us to build that picture of hardship in those communities. It was depressing to see the result of the inaction of the government and the reduction of many women to being totally reliant on charitable assistance and welfare programs for even the most basic necessities of life. For our national government to be ignorant of and neglect the desperate social predicament of such a large and proud section of the community is, indeed, a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some likened the conditions to wartime, and some of the conditions that I saw are akin to those being experienced in Third World countries. That is not what I would have expected from contemporary Australia. While rural women may not be the Labor Party's natural constituents, they and their families deserve much better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The list of issues that are of concern to Australia's rural women is a litany of Labor's ineptitude, inaction and abdication of its responsibility to women. It is rural and regional women who have delivered so much to the development of this nation and who have received so little recognition for that great contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of income in rural towns is impacting on employment and career opportunities not only for women but also for their families. As a consequence, basic services have been scaled down, rescheduled or withdrawn and the fabric of these towns is rapidly disintegrating. Small business is suffering and education facilities are under threat as families are forced to leave many areas in order to obtain work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Casino, one woman put it to a meeting I attended that this government is prepared to pay young people to run away from home via the youth homeless allowance, yet many of these families suffering great hardship were unable to access Austudy to send their children to school. Health and welfare services and the attendant support infrastructure is, in many instances, no longer capable of satisfying the needs of women and their families who remain in these communities. Family instability is a consequence of a lack of communication between partners, and the increased levels of violence and conflict is being exacerbated by this government's disregard of the social impact and by its failure to offer meaningful assistance to the rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many women are now confronted with the prospect of greatly diminished access to comprehensive health and welfare services for their families. At a time when financial circumstances are exerting extreme physical and mental stress on families and communities, the prospect of diminished health care services increases those levels of stress, particularly on women and children. For families whose source of income is either greatly diminished or totally dependent on charitable organisations, the additional cost is simply an intolerable burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For rural women, the lack of adequate child-care and community support facilities means that women have no respite from the pressures that they are currently experiencing. The challenge of having to maintain their family structure and at the same time provide valuable support to their partner, both on the farm and off the farm, is making life very difficult indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of reduced incomes on families reliant on primary production is influencing the quality and level of educational services available in many regions. The figures are quite dramatic in terms of young people from the country being able to access university and higher education courses compared with young people within the city and urban areas of Australia. The bottom line impact is more upheaval and more pressure, added costs to already strained budgets and increased stress on and dislocation of families who are forced to try to cope with the costs associated with educating children in environments removed from their community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Career options for both women and their children are suffering enormously as employment opportunities in small businesses&mdash;both rural and non-rural&mdash;are in many instances no longer available. The list of issues of concern to rural women goes on. Unfortunately, so does this Labor government's procrastination on the important social issue facing Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I visited only a small area of New South Wales. The distressing fact is that this scenario of women and children being needlessly placed under extreme pressure is being repeated throughout New South Wales and Queensland. We are beginning to see other states, including my own state, enter this scenario. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women are desperately trying to help preserve the structure and the threads of their families and their communities. They are not looking for handouts. These are proud people. These are people who have great courage, great fortitude and a great ability to just get on and do the job. However, it is well past time when they should have received support. Labor's report card on its consideration, understanding and resolution of the rural crisis and its impact on women must surely read, `Failed to apply the necessary application to the subject; remedial classes highly recommended.'</PARA>

What is important about the Australia Remembers commemoration is that it is not just going to be a series of very large-scale national events where the nation's leaders are involved in important celebrations. It will not just be a series of events involving state leaders in various states. It is also going to be very much a community based program of events. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very important allocation of $20,000 per federal electorate. That has been very warmly received by communities across Australia to enable them to be involved in this very valuable program. I have established a Moreton commemorative committee which has been working for the last three months to develop a program of events to ensure that our local community in my federal electorate of Moreton is fully involved in the program of activities next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to place on record my personal thanks to the members of my committee for the hard work that they have put in already and for the hard work that they will be putting in over the next few months as we plan a number of events. I have been very well served by a number of important local community leaders who are involved in the Moreton commemorative committee for Australia Remembers. I have involved representatives from local RSL sub-branches. Mr Toby Fenton and Mr Frank Pitt from the Holland Park-Mount Gravatt RSL sub-branch have been very valuable members of my committee, as has Mr Bob Taylor, who is the president of the Sunnybank sub-branch of the RSL. Bob Taylor is an important member of my committee because he is also on the Queensland state committee for Australia Remembers and is able to give a dual perspective in our discussions about what we will be doing next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also made sure that I have representatives from other institutions or organisations in my electorate. Three of those people come from the education sector&mdash;Ms Roz Korkatsis, who is a head of department at Mount Gravatt State High School; Geoff Mill, who is the principal of Greenslopes State School; and Graeme Mellor, who is from the Catholic Education Office in Brisbane. They are ensuring that my local schools are very heavily involved in the Australia Remembers campaign. </PARA>

One of those is a very important facility; that is, the Yeronga District Military Hospital. Lieutenant Alison Denning is a member of my committee. She represents the officer in command of Yeronga hospital. She has been of great assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other facility in my electorate is the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital, which from 6 January next year becomes the Greenslopes Private Hospital. The sale of Greenslopes has been confirmed and it has been sold to the Ramsay Health Care Group. Mr Robert Glynn, who has been appointed to manage Greenslopes hospital, is also a member of my committee and is actively involved. As you can see, it is quite a comprehensive committee; it is quite a well based and broadly based committee. The members have been very forthright in their contribution of ideas and suggestions as to how we can get involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of the House, I will outline the four main themes of next year's commemorations for Australia Remembers. The first important theme is commemoration, which is paying tribute to those who contributed either as service personnel or by keeping our local community and the war effort going. The second is celebration, which is recapturing the joy of and commitment to peace. That is very important. It is 50 years since the end of the Second World War. It has been 50 years of peace. The third theme is education, which is allowing the youth of today to understand the sacrifices and the tragedy of war. Through that education, we hope that we never have to go down that path and that our young people never have to experience what the people of the generation of the war years had to experience. The fourth and most important theme is legacy, which is leaving a permanent memory in our national history of what the Second World War meant to our community and to the families that make up our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our local Moreton committee has a number of activities proposed on all of these themes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are particularly excited by the proposal to involve local schools in our community, senior citizens and war veterans in a musical concert. We are going to have a choir of some 600 people. The choir will be made up of primary and secondary school children and senior citizens. They will be singing some of the songs of the war years. It will also involve dances and some of the good big band music of the war years. It promises to be a most exciting event and one that the whole community is looking forward to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the theme of legacy, we are dedicating a park in my electorate to the Australia Remembers commemoration.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be having a picnic and concert in Yeronga Park. We will invite the families in the electorate to come along to a lunchtime picnic and concert. We will be very much spreading the message of Australia Remembers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is going to be an air show at Archerfield airport, which is in my electorate. Bob Taylor, the president of the Sunnybank RSL sub-branch, is very heavily involved in planning that air show. There is going to be an open day and fair at the Yeronga District Military Hospital. We will open up the hospital to the public. On the site of the Yeronga hospital is a heritage home which is more than 110 years old. That is the site of the officers mess. There are a lot of other activities that we will be engaging in during the year. We will draw up a calender of local events which we will distribute to the people in the community to tell them about these activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to all the people who will be involved in the Australia Remembers program next year. My particular thanks goes to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and his very able staff who have provided a lot of assistance in our planning and organisation of these events. My commendation goes to him for his foresight in allowing every federal member to be involved in this way. It is a non-partisan issue. It is very much a community issue.

Perhaps if they went to the whips office it may be straightened out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the welfare of the members of my electorate is being jeopardised by yet another of the organisations that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) is responsible for&mdash;Australian National. A large number of my Kilburn constituents live close to Australian National's Islington rail yards. For more than 30 years, until the mid-1980s, part of this site was used for the dumping of waste materials. Officially, the material being dumped was asbestos. This was bad enough. However, individuals who worked at the site witnessed repeated dumpings of sulphuric acid, cyanide, pesticides and engine oil in addition to the dumping of asbestos. The dump was finally closed at the insistence of the South Australian Waste Management Commission which found clear evidence that waste had been buried on the site in a manner which did not comply with the requirements of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the opinion of the Environmental Protection Authority, if the activity had been conducted by a body subject to state law, it is highly likely that a prosecution would have occurred. It was not until the end of last year that Australian National was finally forced to address this danger by engaging Coffey Partners International to assess the site. The anxiety of residents was unduly increased at this time when those assessing the site did so in fully protective clothing while children in light clothing played in the backyards of their homes close by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assessment indicated that the soil surrounding the dump had, as feared by the residents, been contaminated. A management plan to deal with this contamination was developed by the consultancy that had undertaken the assessment. South Australia's Environmental Protection Authority approved this plan while regarding it as a temporary fix. AN was to have continuing use of the land and there was no new development planned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In late November this year, Australian National tendered for remediation works at the site. It is the work that is proposed to be done through this tender that is of major concern to my constituents. My constituent's concerns are shared by the state authorities involved in this matter. I have access to a document, which originated from the Environmental Protection Authority, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the Environmental Protection Authority and the South Australian Health Commission are of the view that the tender does not fully reflect the Management plan as approved by the Environmental Protection Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an extraordinary conclusion and the reasons for arriving at it are clear. The document states further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the Environmental Protection Authority and the Health Commission have reviewed the tender and believe that it is inadequate in a number of respects: the Management Plan specifies the use of "clean fill" whereas Australian National have proposed to use material with up to 20% contamination with extraneous waste; such action would constitute a breach of the waste management act; levelling of the site using a grader presents an unacceptable risk to residents due to risk of dust arising containing asbestos; problems with dust rising from covered areas throughout the summer; and need to determine the status and material that is removed on site.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia National cannot be allowed to proceed with work that may endanger the health of my constituents. If Australian National were privately owned, the state government could force it to adhere to the plan approved by the Environmental Protection Authority. However, since the enterprise concerned is Commonwealth government owned, there is the very real likelihood that Australian National will proceed as it wishes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has certainly been the case in the past, particularly in relation to state government institutions, that Australian National consult with residents about the management of the dump site. I again refer to the document I quoted which states that the Environmental Protection Authority:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is strongly of the view that Australian National must ensure that local residents are involved more in the process. They have been advised on a number of occasions to begin a consultative process, but for reasons we do not understand they have failed to do so.</PARA>
<PARA>I have no intention of allowing the health of the residents in my electorate to be continuingly ignored and jeopardised. I call on the minister to intervene in this case and direct Australian National to adhere fully to the waste management plan approved by the Environmental Protection Authority as would be required by law if Australian National were privately owned and involve my constituents in the management of the dump site that poses such a significant threat to their health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the Minister for Transport has problems on his hands at the moment. We know the noise problems of the third runway are causing him a headache and we know about the air safety problems. My constituents are demanding immediate attention to this problem. While they are residents of South Australia they are also Australians. This is just one example of where laws are in conflict. It is a Commonwealth project involving Commonwealth land and Commonwealth laws apply. I am sure that the members of this House would understand their concerns. There has been a lot of publicity about the proven danger of the asbestos contamination. Cyanide and other poisons have been dumped there in the past. People who worked for AN 30 years ago and leading up to the 1980s continually reported how dangerous that has been. They have personally seen this dumping. One of them is well known to me and I accept what they say. They have the feeling that they are just bumping their heads up against a brick wall. </PARA>

They feel alarmed, they have not been consulted, they do not know what is going on. I call on the minister to intervene and see that their well-being is cared for. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we stop to analyse the package, what do we find? First, we find that the government still has not placed serious drought back into the natural disasters category.

There was an assistance formerly provided to farmers that enabled the federal government to assist by $4 in aid for every dollar spent by the various state governments.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wool production also will be down by about six per cent or $275 million this year. In part this is drought related but it also reflects decisions by farmers . . . to shift out of wool production in response to oversupply and depressed prices.</PARA>
<PARA>It also has an effect on the cattle industry and on other industries. The Prime Minister obviously believed that the package announced in September was enough to provide immediate welfare assistance and yesterday's announcement was looking long term. The problem is that unless the government does more by way of immediate assistance there will be many fewer farmers to take up opportunities for the farm management bonds and other assistance that was announced. The taxation incentives are worth nought unless you have money to build up fodder and store water. </PARA>

They know what has to be done with their properties to obtain that balance between viable production and environmental conservation. What they lack is money.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The cat is finally out of the bag. Australia has a high taxing, big spending Liberal state government, and that is the Kennett government in the state of Victoria. I refer honourable members to an article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> earlier this week, which confirms something that the Victorian people already know. We have finally pinned the tail on the donkey. The Kennett government is the highest taxing state government in the Commonwealth of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite come into this House and preach ad nauseam to the government of the day that Labor governments are big taxers and big spenders. The proof is in the pudding. At the state level, only one government spends more and taxes more than the Liberal government in New South Wales, and that is the Liberal state government in Victoria. In the electorate of Corio, Geelong residents now pay the equivalent of $2,000 per person to the Kennett government, making it the highest taxing state in the Commonwealth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst tax of all from this big taxing, big spending Liberal government is the $100 state deficit levy, which the Kennett government is still taking, or robbing, from Geelong residents. One of the most regressive taxes that has ever been introduced by any government at the state or federal level is still in place in the state of Victoria. Honourable members opposite come into this House and talk about low and middle income earners having suffered more under this federal Labor government. It is nothing like the suffering being endured by working families in the state of Victoria today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite talk about Labor governments being big spenders. The statistics really show the facts. The Kennett government spending rose some 2.5 per cent in the last year, higher than in the last year of the Kirner government. We could understand if this increased expenditure had gone to health, education and community services, but it has not. It has gone to Jeff Kennett's mates. It has gone to build the casino. We all know how the smelly skunk was pulled across the road there. It has gone to the Grand Prix and to other projects that have been sponsored by Jeff Kennett's mates. </PARA>

That is according to the chief executive, Mr Phil Sheedy, who made that statement in November this year. The hospital slashed 200 jobs last year, and that was due to the budget cuts of the Kennett government. As quickly as we create the jobs at the federal level, they pull them out at the state level. Then they come to me bleating about the fact that the Geelong economy is not growing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give some other examples of how this state government is ripping the insides out of my electorate. The Geelong hospital has one of Victoria's longest waiting lists. Bed capacity at the hospital has been capped at 400, 30 fewer than the maximum that has been set.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem is not the third runway as such but the bungled way in which the third runway has been brought into operation. When Wal Fife first proposed a third runway, it was supposed to mean more take-offs and landings over Botany Bay. A third runway was supposed to mean that there would be more flights in and out of Sydney and fewer houses affected by noise. Unfortunately, this government's third runway has meant fewer flights and more noise. It has had the very opposite effect of the third runway that was first proposed by Wal Fife back in 1982. This government's third runway has meant that hundreds of flights which used to take off over Botany Bay are now taking off over Marrickville and the inner west. Thousands of homes which never suffered from aircraft noise, or which suffered only minimally, are now suffering from deafening aircraft noise 50 times an hour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of this government's third runway has been that total aircraft movements at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport have reduced from 64 an hour to 50 an hour. Of Ansett Airline's flights in and out of Sydney, 91 per cent are now subject to delay. Ansett has received 30,000 complaints about these delays in a single day since the introduction of the so-called third runway. The government has spent $200 million to make a bad situation worse. Gee thanks, Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and Prime Minister (Mr Keating), for making the lives of so many Sydneysiders miserable! Under the administration of this government, this third runway is going to end up the most expensive fishing pier in Sydney, because all it is good for is for people to stand on the edge and to throw a fishing line into Botany Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the third runway has been politics, from start to finish. In the beginning the Prime Minister decided that, if we were going to have a third runway, he must close down the east-west runway. Why? So that the noise problems would be transferred from marginal Labor seats to safe Labor seats where, he reasoned, it would not do so much damage. Now that the whole thing has blown up beyond control, he wants to transfer the noise problem from Labor seats to Liberal seats. We have all heard of that classic political exercise&mdash;the gerrymander&mdash;where votes are transferred from inconvenient to convenient areas. This government has given us a new mander, the `noisemander', where noise is transferred from inconvenient to convenient areas&mdash;in other words, from Labor to Liberal electorates. </PARA>

No-one can take away the rights that people have come to expect. This government has quite simply gone in and taken away the level of enjoyment that people in so many parts of Sydney had come to take for granted. This government must close down the third runway. It must be closed down now, and it must stay shut until such time as the new control tower is built, new radar systems are in place and the third runway can be a benefit and not a blight to the ordinary people of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real villain in all this is the Prime Minister: first, because he introduced shabby and grubby politics into the original decision making; second, because he is quite happy to spend $150 million, or offer $150 million, to tear down the Cahill Expressway&mdash;a perfectly functioning piece of transport infrastructure; he is quite happy to give his $250 million gift to the arts community, but he is not prepared to spend the money necessary to put the third runway into an immediately functioning condition&mdash;and, third, because, yet again, he is protecting his mate Laurie Brereton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has been indebted to the Minister for Transport ever since the minister made the most famous Lambretta ride in history. That was the night when the Minister for Transport roared off on his Lambretta to drag Lindsay North out of bed in his pyjamas over to the balloting booths of Blaxland so that the boxes could be impounded and taken back to head office. That was a usual right wing rort practice to ensure that the Prime Minister ended up as the member for Blaxland&mdash;the sort of thing that Tom Burns of the Queensland Right said was a typical slimy, mongrel act of the New South Wales right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister may have protected his mate once too often. It is important for the Prime Minister to remember that the Minister for Transport in a previous incarnation was the main player in bringing down the Unsworth government. He has destroyed Unsworth Labor and, with this insanity over the third runway, he is doing his best to destroy Carr Labor; and it is by no means impossible that he will not play a big part in destroying Keating Labor.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) has dreams about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), because he cannot finish a speech in this House without living out his obsession with the Prime Minister. He dreams of the Prime Minister and points of order. It is no wonder he wakes up in a hot sweat. I will not in this adjournment debate be talking about the young royalist, but rather addressing my remarks to the ageing Marxist&mdash;the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently my attention was drawn to remarks made in this place by the member for Wills which were directed at my support for free trade in APEC and national competition policies throughout the Australian economy. Let me respond. The member for Wills reached his intellectual peak as a football coach. He should have stayed there. In this House he represents the politics of the 1950s. He is as much yesterday's man as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), but instead of a white picket fence, the member for Wills represents an old, dilapidated fence&mdash;an old, dilapidated, broken ideology of clapped-out Marxism. By the standards of Australian politics in the 1990s, the member for Wills is back to the future&mdash;back to the future with fortress Australia, tariff protection all around, centralised wage fixing and a monocultural ethnic base, all underscored by the burnt out, clapped out Marxist notion that the only good capital is public capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Wills takes the luxury in this House of issuing a plague on both sides of the House, but with little scrutiny of his own contribution. My purpose on this adjournment debate is to redress that imbalance and to ask some questions. Why does the member for Wills not like competition? Why does he not want to see competition in the public and private sectors produce benefits for consumers in his electorate? Working class consumers in his electorate would be denied benefits by the member for Wills because he does not want capital to compete. He does not want markets to work. He wants to go back to the failed policies of eastern Europe where you lock away markets and you lock away capital in the hands of public monopolies. He does not want capital to work, he does not want capital to compete. He stands for monopoly markets and higher prices for working class consumers in the electorate of Wills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, he stands for high tariffs&mdash;back to the 1950s with high tariffs. He is a replay of Black Jack McEwen. High tariffs potentially represent the biggest regressive tax that any politician in this country could advocate&mdash;bigger than the 15 per cent GST. The tariff walls as advocated by the member for Wills would hurt working class consumers in his electorate more substantially than any of the policies that the Liberal and National parties could inflict upon the people of Australia. He stands for high, regressive taxes whenever he calls for a return to high tariff protection in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Wills should understand a little recent economic history. He should understand the substantial benefits enjoyed by consumers all over the country from this government's introduction of competition policies. By ending the two-airline agreement, airfares fell by 20 per cent from September 1990 to September 1993. There have been benefits to the consumers&mdash;and I am sure many of them living in the electorate of Wills&mdash;of $100 million per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the advent of competition from Optus, Telecom prices have fallen by four per cent between capital cities, and the peak call rates between Sydney and Melbourne&mdash;including the electorate of Wills&mdash;fell by 20 per cent between June 1992 and May 1993. Consumers in his electorate are 20 per cent better off on the cost of their calls to Sydney because of this government's policy of competition on telephones. There has been an 11 per cent fall in the cost of overseas calls and a nine per cent fall in the cost of mobile telephone calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, deregulation of egg production and marketing in New South Wales, as an example, has produced a decrease in average retail prices of 38c per dozen, with savings to consumers of $21 million per annum. They are the sorts of consumer benefits enjoyed by working class people that the member for Wills will not endorse. He wants to go to higher prices, public monopolies and monopoly markets. The deregulation of third party compulsory insurance in my own state of New South Wales resulted in premiums falling from $350 in 1989 to $190 in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, as you would be aware, Mr Speaker, has a broad agenda for national competition policies through COAG and the Hilmer report. It places up for grabs the $8.2 billion in government business enterprise dividends&mdash;federal and state&mdash;that flow back into government budgets. Through competition exposing these public monopolies to market forces, $8.2 billion is potentially available for the benefit of consumers. If the member for Wills looked after the interests of his working class consumers, he would certainly be supporting competition so that the $8.2 billion does not go into the coffers of government, it goes into the pockets of people who need it most&mdash;the people who consume water, gas, electricity; the people who make telephone calls and undertake airline movements across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, competition produces lower prices, better services, greater market choice and, with overall efficiency improvements, greater investment and more employment all round. Ultimately, the member for Wills stands for the Albanian economic model of locking the country behind tariff walls, locking out migrants, locking out competition and locking out market forces. He is, in the Australian parliament, the Albanian finance minister. He should go to Albania and see the sort of damage that his policies and his model have caused in that nation. It should not happen here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know you will, Janice. Before I say this, I have to correct the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott). He completely misrepresented me during his speech. How was he to know that I have had over 35 years association with people who have suffered from brain damage after an accident of any sort, with people who have a congenital defect which causes brain difficulties? More importantly, he was not to know that I have been closely associated with the world of rehabilitation for the last 40 years, and I am very pleased to hear that the member for Gilmore is now on side in this tremendously important area. I trust he will now continue to show his interest and concern in this field of stimulating, if heartbreaking, activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not part of my plan, but in view of the narrowness of the member's speech, I take this opportunity to pay tremendous tribute to all those selfless people who have worked for a very long time, most of them for all their lives, rehabilitating people who have been gravely injured either at birth or in an accident. This is a matter that has been part of my inner soul for 40 years or more and I resent a new member in this House suggesting that I would laugh at anybody who has brain damage. All my life I have been associated with the rehabilitation of brain damaged people in this community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the member's speech will inspire even more people in this House to realise that rehabilitation is not a part-time activity. It is not an easy activity and it is not something about which you go away and say, `God, I must try to help them,' and forget about it for the next month, year or 10 years or whatever. Rehabilitation means daily constant care and consideration by a very large number of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Gilmore talked about people being damaged in car accidents. It is horrendous. People who live after a car smash can have no brain left at all. This happens on a regular basis. It needs compassion; it does not need political statements or party politics. I resent the way the member for Gilmore spoke during his speech today. I had no intention of raising this subject again today, but I feel it has to be raised, not just for me or for the people concerned, but for the huge number of people who have been injured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For quadriplegics and paraplegics, the situation can be even worse. Very often brain damaged people are not aware. Their brains have gone but their carers, with great persistence and under difficult circumstances, can assist them to live a very happy life. Their brains are not functioning and they do not know what they do not know. If we are going to talk about the rehabilitation needs of this country, the speeches in this place should be speeches of compassion and not of party politics at any level. It is beyond and above all those considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I did not get up to speak on that; I got up to speak about the map on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> today. Although it is not going to win my football team any marks, I am delighted to see that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) took note of my speech two nights ago in this House when I told him he could solve the problems of southern take-offs from the third, first or any runway if the planes avoided flying over Kurnell. On Tuesday night I said that, for the first time ever, Kurnell was being flown over at 800 feet and that as a safety matter Kurnell oil refinery was being flown over by 800 feet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see in the paper today&mdash;I have not been able to read the full details&mdash;the map showing exactly what I asked the minister to do, and I thank him for that. The minister and I&mdash;I do not boast about this&mdash;happen to be political neighbours. I share with him his very sincere concerns about Botany Bay and the people living around it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not read the details, so I do not know when it is going to start, but a lot of people in Kurnell&mdash;1,800 voters in fact, ignoring the very many small children they have&mdash;will be sleeping soundly tonight. I say to the Minister for Transport: thank you for doing what you have done for the people of my electorate. My heart goes out to the people west of Sydney airport. I do not know what can be done for them. For the 112 houses, this will solve nothing. I have lived under an aircraft path and I know that you become very sensitive to it. It is no use saying they have known for four years and they bought houses. That is nonsense. Nobody can understand the noise of a plane flying above them until they have experienced it themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what the solution for Sydney is going to be. Close or open the third runway&mdash;I do not know. All I know is that I am going to my godson's wedding on 17 December in Adelaide and I am having to come to Canberra the night before to fly to Adelaide because of the blockades being run by Marrickville Council on that date. I do not know if I would have used those tactics, but I wish the council well in its attempts to obtain relief for those areas west of the airport in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said here three nights ago, as I have said to meetings in Kurnell and as I have said in my letters to every person in Kurnell for the last two weeks, the decision on the runway was not made by FAC or CAA; it was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Transport. I do not like to see the bad naming we have seen here this afternoon. Goodness knows why the poor member for Wills (Mr Cleary) was attacked in that way. I believe you do not achieve anything in this parliament by bad naming anybody. I have kept to that view for 28 years and I will continue to keep to it. But the fact that the Minister for Transport was able to change the flight paths over my electorate has confirmed what I have been saying for the last two or three weeks, and that is that the decision to open runways on 4 November in Botany Bay was not a FAC or a CAA request. It was a very stupid and reckless political decision, but a political decision it was. I am afraid that, if the coat fits, they have to wear it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will not hear me criticising what they are trying to do about the problems for Sydney. They have not heard me criticising for the last three weeks what they are trying to do in Sydney. I am very grateful that the cabinet took note of my representations and returned the flights from the Sutherland shire over the sandhills and through the heads of Botany Bay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I am particularly pleased that you are occupying the chair for this speech because we are neighbours and represent seats in the Illawarra. I know that the University of Wollongong is in your electorate of Cunningham, but a lot of the students come from my electorate of Throsby&mdash;indeed, the staff of the university are spread all over the Illawarra&mdash;and had we not both been detained here today, we would have been part of a large group at the University of Wollongong to say farewell to Professor Ken McKinnon, the Vice-Chancellor for 13 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ken McKinnon took over from Professor Michael Birt as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong in August 1981. At that time the university student body was around 3,000. He brought with him a freshness of approach and an enthusiasm for the University of Wollongong and over the years has taken it to an international standard. You, Mr Speaker, not only as a former student, but also as a lecturer at that university, would know of the tremendous advances that have been made over the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as expanding the university to accommodate from about 3,000 students to over 11,000 at present, Ken McKinnon has attracted outstanding scholars to the university, has given it an international reputation and has made important international contacts, especially with China and Thailand. He came to the University of Wollongong after a long and distinguished career of 20 years in Papua New Guinea where he rose to the position of Director-General of education. Following this, he was appointed by Gough Whitlam, the then Prime Minister, to the chair of the Commonwealth Schools Commission here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given his national contacts and international standing, I thought some time ago that he may have taken up a permanent position with UNESCO, to which he has had a long commitment, having been the chair of the Australian Council for UNESCO from 1984 to 1988. He would have made an outstanding contribution to the work of UNESCO but Wollongong was the beneficiary when he did not apply for the UNESCO position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of his appointment as vice-chancellor, I was a member of the council of the University of Wollongong and had a close working relationship with Ken McKinnon. I was a member of the council of the university for some six years until the then Liberal Minister for Education in New South Wales, one Terry Metherell, decided for reasons best known to himself not to reappoint me to that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ken McKinnon has devoted his life to education. He has brought great distinction to the University of Wollongong and has many friends nationally and internationally. I hope that, in his retirement from the position of vice-chancellor, the educational world will continue to benefit from his great expertise. We wish Ken McKinnon well in his retirement and I am sure it will be a very full retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ken McKinnon has served the University of Wollongong and the Illawarra well. As you would be aware, Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was present at the University of Wollongong only last week with both of us and he was very impressed with what had been achieved and what was still being achieved there. I am sure the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) would also agree because he also covers that area and would be very familiar with the work and the distinction that Ken McKinnon has brought to that university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new vice-chancellor will be Gerard Sutton, who is the present deputy vice-chancellor, a very distinguished international scholar.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that the Australian meat industry, and in particular our beef producers, have had a rough ride of late. With drought, residue scares and meatworks strikes, the industry has never had a more horrendous time. There are genuine concerns about the effects on exports, but what we have in central Queensland at present is a totally different circumstance. The beef industry has also been hamstrung over recent times by the lack of effective reform in meat processing and other related sectors, which is reducing the competitiveness of this great industry and its product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This fundamental problem was best highlighted this week with the discovery of cheap imported American beef being sold over the counter in central Queensland, in the very heartland of the nation's biggest beef producing region. It is said that approximately 25 per cent of Australia's beef is produced within 250 or 300 kilometres of Rockhampton. I was first alerted to the situation by a Rockhampton grazier, who contacted me about cheap American rumps being supplied to the local Angliss butcher shop at North Rockhampton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Angliss advised that it did receive two cartons of American rumps from its meat supplier, Mackay based processor Thomas Borthwicks and Sons. Angliss has stressed that none of the meat was sold and that the product was returned. A Borthwicks spokesman confirmed that the company had purchased an undisclosed quantity of American rumps from a southern importer and that those rumps were being sold to other meat wholesalers and retailers in central Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spokesman said the imported rumps were purchased because of a shortage of suitable domestic trade cattle as a result of the drought. Irrespective of whether the right type of cattle was available or not, we must accept that imports occur from time to time, though I suspect in this particular circumstance they were not being brought into a niche market or for the restaurant trade but simply to be sold alongside Australian meat in Australian butcher shops. In 1993-94 Australia, which is predominantly a net exporter, imported 5,600 tonnes, worth some $22 million, mostly from New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what disturbs me is that, like the recent Sizzler beef import case, this foreign beef can be landed in this country for less than the cost of the home grown product. I have been informed that chilled cryovac rumps from the United States that appeared in central Queensland this week were landed in Melbourne for $4.70 per kilogram. Yet the same locally grown rump produced from a Rockhampton abattoir is sold for $5.40 per kilogram&mdash;a difference of 70c per kilogram between the local and imported product. Even allowing 20c a kilogram for freight from Melbourne to Rockhampton, it is still 50c a kilogram cheaper than the Australian product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether you agree with the trading practices of meat suppliers is not the question. Certainly I am not interested in any calls for boycotts of the companies involved. I accept in good grace, as do most members of the National Party, that we have become a signatory to GATT, that we are moving into APEC, and that for that reason boycotts would be inappropriate. My concern is that American beef can be landed in this country for less than the home grown product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), has said, it is staggering that an Australian beef importer can buy American cattle at prices 60 per cent higher than those paid in Australia, process the beef in American abattoirs, transport it to the seaboard and across US wharves, ship it across the Pacific, move it across our notoriously expensive waterfront, distribute it in Australia and still sell it for less than the Australian home grown product. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I will address through the chair. It is a great admission. It is one thing to be derelict about the runways at Sydney airport, but it is another thing to be derelict about dumping at a time when the Australian beef industry has probably been under the worst challenge not only from imports but also from the most horrendous drought we have ever had. My colleague might do well to be a little more compassionate and sensitive to the needs of these people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite simply, our meat processing costs are too high. A recent study into the productivity and efficiency of the Australian meat industry, prepared for the NFF by AACM International Consultants, found that the total costs of export cattle abattoir operations are approximately 70 per cent above those in the United States. It costs $A46 per head to process a head of beef in the USA and $A102 per head to process the same carcass in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take the recent Industry Commission report into the meat industry. It pointed out that the inferior and overregulated industrial relations system is the principal cause of our industry's inefficiencies. The problem with the system is simply that it does not encourage employers and employees to get together and reform work practices, improve productivity and increase real wages. Of course, the costs of all these inefficiencies are passed down the chain to the beef producer who is at the bottom of the chain. The producer has nowhere to pass on his costs. The beef producer must carry the burden of the higher processing costs, outdated abattoir work practices, excessive transport and shipping costs and rising government taxes and inspection charges which we have heard about all too often in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely there is a message in this beef import saga in Rockhampton. It is perhaps just the tip of the iceberg. We have seen what has happened to the Australian pork industry by not being sufficiently vigilant about imports into this country and by not taking action against those imports on the basis of dumping. If the government were half fair dinkum, it would be doing something about it. As I said, there is a message in this import saga for the government, the trade union movement and our meat industry as a whole. It should be a catalyst for reform. </PARA>
