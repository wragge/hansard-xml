<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation Bill has some potential traps. It was mentioned yesterday that the boundaries of the wetlands were probably drawn too extravagantly. I notice that about 26 per cent of the land encompassed within the 900,000 hectares is basically forest reserve, effective leasehold and freehold land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the complications within this wetland area is that operators want to start the Kuranda sky rail, a tourist activity which will take people from Cairns on the coast into Kuranda to witness some of the beauties of the area. This has been under some dispute. It emphasises the difficulties that charter operators face, on behalf of tourists, when operating within the wetlands. I understand that if an operator wants to start a business it can take up to 60 permits to move in and out of these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one takes into account the potential implications of the Mabo legislation and the additional permits that might be required, one wonders whether tourists will witness these wetlands as they would like. Under this bill&mdash;the same applied to the act that set up the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority&mdash;there is a system for bureaucrats to make definitions and provide guidelines for the use of these areas. Charter operators have been asked to pay an operational fee of $1 per trip for every individual going into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. I hope there is no suggestion that this would apply eventually to the wetlands as this would be of further detriment to those operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent fee for access to the GBRMP was agreed to by both the state and federal governments. The access fee cannot stay at $1. There is no way after administration costs that the $1 fee can be used for the advancement of the park. The fee is a burden on the operators who have to pay it. In the meantime, private individuals wanting to use the reef or the islands can do so with impunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak about the bureaucratisation of the acts with some authority. It is brought to my attention all the time how these guidelines bear on operators in the area. A group of water sports operators in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park operating from Hamilton Island have been trying to negotiate a continuation of their operations away from their main base when the main base is under some climatic threat, such as strong winds. For years they have used an adjoining island and beach to do just that. It is just one of their alternatives. They have now been prevented from using that outlet. Many commercial operators have been refused entry to Whitehaven beach for their operations, yet private operators can waterski or do anything on these beaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department of environment and heritage, with which they have been trying to make arrangements, has unlimited power to enter into discussions to try to find a way through this type of problem, but at the end of the discussions it hands out a pre-made prohibition order that stops operators operating in an area or having access to it. The real threat here is that the bureaucrats do not have a definite reason for doing this. The impression these people get from their ivory towers in Townsville, Brisbane and elsewhere is that if commercial operations in these areas are stopped, yet the areas are still available to private operators, in some magical way it will bring back the natural life of the areas. That is hypothetical. There have been environmental problems in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not correct to have this power of prohibition in the hands of bureaucrats. There must be some way these things can be appealed. I hope that eventually we do not see our wet tropics not being used because of the prohibitive cost of entry. The user-pays principle has to be very carefully looked at. If it is used to any great extent it will be a deterrent to people going into the areas. The revenue gained will be eaten up by bureaucrats in administration costs, which is where most of the $70 million has gone in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I first read the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation Bill I thought it was a non-controversial piece of legislation and that it would be supported wholeheartedly by the opposition as being consistent with the desire by the overwhelming majority of Australians to ensure that there is an adequate legislative framework for the management of the wet tropic rainforests of North Queensland. I came into the chamber yesterday afternoon and listened to a number of speakers on the bill. I was absolutely amazed at the content of some of the statements made by opposition speakers. I thought the bill was fairly innocuous. Indeed, the general outline of the bill, as contained in the explanatory memorandum, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to bring into effect permanent management arrangements, which are set out in the Agreement made between the Commonwealth and Queensland on 16 November 1990, and are incorporated into the Wet Tropics World Heritage Protection and Management Act 1993 (Qld) as Schedule 1. The arrangements implement the Commonwealth's international obligations for the protection of the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Property under the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (the World Heritage Convention).</PARA>
<PARA>This is precisely what the bill does&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. The bill provides, in clause 8, for Aboriginal representation on the advisory committee, and I will say something about that later on in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am one of the few members of this House who come from the wet tropic rainforests of North Queensland. In fact I was born in Tully, right beside the wet tropic rainforest. I know the wet tropic rainforest quite intimately. As a youth I went hunting through the rainforests and I have had a lot to do with them over many years. I am very much aware of the enormous value of those wet tropic rainforests to this country and indeed to all mankind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it was with astonishment that I heard the remarks made by some members of the opposition yesterday. I would like to correct some of those mistaken impressions they seem to hold with respect to wet tropic rainforests and this legislation. The shadow minister for the environment, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), complained about the Commonwealth involvement in stopping pastoralist activities at Willandra. She is wrong. The Commonwealth government has not made any decisions on pastoralist activities at Willandra. She also complained about Lord Howe Island's sewage problem, and that matter is being addressed by the Commonwealth government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has announced proposed investigations of the world heritage values of the Lake Eyre region in South Australia, and arrangements are being made for an assessment of the world heritage values of that region. It is better that we get it right now than rush this assessment and the necessary committed legislation through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) became involved in a diatribe. He showed a total misunderstanding of the world heritage values of Shark Bay. Dolphins were not the major issue for the world heritage listing of this area; the main values of Shark Bay are the marine environment, including the hypersaline hamelin pool; the offshore islands of Bernier and Dorre, which are home to five of Australia's 26 species of endangered mammals; the massive seagrass beds, the largest on earth; and the stromatolites, which the honourable member for O'Connor called strogmolites&mdash;perhaps this marks him as a person who has difficulty getting his tongue around some of these polysyllables. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Braithwaite" NAMEID="0F4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr Braithwaite</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about trogs?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OG4">Mr LINDSAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member is well qualified to make comments on that. He should not say things like that. Stromatolites represent the oldest life form on earth, being representative of some 3,500 million years. They are a very important part of our heritage. The honourable member for O'Connor also claimed that miners were going to the world heritage commission to check their rights. It is a committee, not a commission, and no impediments to actions by Australians can be brought by the World Heritage Committee&mdash;none at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) claimed that the wet tropics were already protected because they were a national park. That is wrong. Much of the area is state forest, which the previous Queensland government wanted to log. It was world heritage listing and the Commonwealth Labor government's determination to ensure logging of these ecologically significant rainforests ceased that saved the wet tropics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wide Bay also claimed that world heritage listing locks up areas. This is also wrong. There has been a dramatic increase in tourist numbers to the wet tropics and other world heritage areas since the world heritage listing. Indeed, the wet tropics have become a major tourist attraction in themselves. For example, whitewater rafting down the Tully River in the wet tropic rainforest has become a huge business. It is very popular with overseas tourists. I will be saying something about that in relation to the Tully-Millstream hydro-electric scheme later on. The world heritage area of these wet tropic rainforests is a massive reservoir of tourist potential for Australia. It should not be underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wide Bay also stated that with the appointment of an Aboriginal person to the Wet Tropics Management Authority board the Commonwealth would need to kick off either Dr Keto or Mr Donaghy. That is not so. I will explain that later on in my remarks. This government is receiving very strong support from the state government. As I said earlier, this bill has been brought in to complement the recent Queensland act. There is no problem whatsoever in accommodating an Aboriginal person on the board and retaining the excellent services of Dr Keto and Mr Donaghy. I am curious that the opposition seems to be always looking at ways to remove good people from these boards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) complained that the Commonwealth government has taken four years to introduce this legislation while the Queensland government only took three years. The Queensland legislation was passed in December 1993. This legislation, as it is complementary to the Queensland legislation, needed to wait until the Queensland legislation had been passed&mdash;again, a misunderstanding of the truth of the matter. I return to the remarks made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh in her consideration of this important legislation. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I object very deeply to tokenism. I think to write into this legislation that an Aborigine be put on to that authority simply on the basis that he or she is an Aborigine is demeaning to all indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA>I have never in my life heard such a stupid statement as that. Aboriginal people have been clamouring to have a say in the management of the wet tropic rainforest. As people who have inhabited that area literally for thousands of years, it is right and proper that they do have some representation on that board&mdash;one Aboriginal member out of five persons. She went on to say in her speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . 36 per cent of the people surveyed believe that there had been a negative effect on the local economy; in the tablelands 54 per cent believe that there had been a negative effect on the local economy.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, there were pockets of industries that were adversely affected by the declaration, but the Commonwealth government literally poured a fortune into programs to assist these people. Just north of my electorate at Ingham, huge sums of money were put in to assist the people who were adversely affected by the declaration, including the Hinchinbrook Shire Council, as I understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the comment made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh that 36 per cent of the people surveyed believe that there had been a negative effect on the local economy, at present, in my experience in that area, there has been a nil effect on the local economy. The honourable member for Hindmarsh went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a condemnation of the government, not because it is a world heritage area&mdash;I believe that is important and essential for Australia&mdash;but because, with the removal of the logging and in declaring it a world heritage area, the government did not live up to its commitment to the people of Ravenshoe and other areas to provide jobs, which was a promise that it made.</PARA>
<PARA>I was very much involved in that area at that time in 1988, as was the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). A lot of work and a lot of money were put into this area to try to assist these people. It is a pity that, with the passage of time, people get up in this chamber and make all sorts of allegations which, frankly, do not fit the facts. I turn to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Cook, a man for whom I have much respect. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I, too, am one of the people who believe that the borders of the wet tropics land were drawn far too broadly and widely and contain areas that should not be part of the world wet tropics area.</PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, I do not know what he is talking about. I am one of the few people who have flown over the remains of the wet tropics rainforests of North Queensland in an FA18. When one is up over 35,000 feet and looks down on the Pacific Ocean to the left and the wide open plains to the right, one sees that there is very little wet tropics rainforest left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a profound decision by this government to introduce the legislation in pursuance of the declaration of the wet tropics of Queensland as a world heritage area. Again, we have remarks by the honourable member for Cook on these issues. My good friend the honourable member for Dawson, who has made a contribution to this debate, said yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I go on record with others to say that there was an excess extravagance by those who drew up the boundaries which affected, and is still affecting, the livelihood of many people in that area.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Dawson, whom I also respect, knows much better than that. That is not an accurate statement of the true situation. He knows as well as I do&mdash;I know that he supports the preservation of wet tropics rainforest&mdash;that the boundaries were quite conservatively drawn. There might have been some areas that do not appear the same as a tropical jungle such as is seen in Tully, Daintree, Babinda or such places. But I would submit that the boundaries were judiciously drawn with respect to the area. Some of the comments made by opposition speakers, however well meaning they are, need to be corrected for the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me speak again about the board, about which a number of people, including the honourable member for Wide Bay and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), made some comments. Professor Ken Wiltshire is the chairman. It is a joint appointment of five people. Dr Aila Keto, a conservationist, is one of the Commonwealth appointments, as is Mr Geoff Donaghy, who is involved in tourism in the Cairns area. The Queensland government has Mr Tom Pyne, chairman of the Mulgrave Shire Council, and one other representative. This bill provides for five elected members of the board plus an executive director of the authority. As I said, the Commonwealth government is working cooperatively with the Queensland government on management of the wet tropics, including the appointment of members to the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no problem appointing an Aboriginal person, as I said previously. Dr Keto and Mr Donaghy, I understand, wish to remain members of the board, so it is not necessary or desirable that either one of them should be asked to resign. Indeed, I would hope that they would continue to serve on the board. I understand that Professor Wiltshire has advised that he wishes to step down from the board. He has provided excellent leadership in the development of the board and the discharge of its responsibilities. I record the gratitude of the Commonwealth government to Professor Wiltshire for his contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It saddens me to say that it would appear that there is a lot of hypocrisy in some of these statements made by opposition speakers. They either support the bill or they do not. They claim to support this bill, and yet we had two or three hours of unwarranted criticism on it yesterday afternoon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of pleasure to discuss the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 1993. I will briefly go through some of the summary items in this bill, which I might say at the outset has the full concurrence of the opposition. This bill was introduced into the Senate on 16 December 1993 and comes under the portfolio of the environment, sport and territories. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990, otherwise known as the ASDA Act, to allow for competitors tested under state or territory legislation to have equal rights of review as if they were tested under the ASDA Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background both to this bill and to the ASDA itself is that in May 1988 the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts received a reference from the Senate to inquire into the use by Australian athletes of performance enhancing drugs. The committee presented an interim report in May 1988, known as the drugs in sport interim report, which dealt with the use of drugs in Australian sport. A second report was tabled in May 1990, which covered the regulatory background of drugs in sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended amongst other things that an independent commission be set up to carry out all sports drug testing in Australia, including other functions such as research, investigations, liaison with law enforcement agencies and responsibility for sports drug policies. There were three other parts, including that the commission report results of testing to appropriate sporting bodies; that the commission establish and publish a register of all tests done by it in each year; and that, in order to receive state or federal funding, sporting organisations be required to impose uniform penalties on athletes returning positive drug tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1988 the Australian Sports Drug Agency, ASDA, was established in response to the committee recommendations and operated as a preventative organisation providing independent drug testing and carrying out broad education programs. As part of the response to the committee's recommendations, the committee sought to give legislative backing to ASDA, which included a legally and financially independent basis for the body, and to allow ASDA to continue testing and to report to the Australian Sports Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASDA was given legislative backing by the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. Section 9 of the act outlines the functions of the ASDA, which include testing, the maintenance of a register of defaulting athletes, and the implementation and development of education programs.

<PARA>In the 1992-93 annual report of the ASDA, the agency stated it had four main aims: first, to reduce the harm associated with drugs in sport; second, to facilitate informed decision making about the use of drugs; third, to defer the use of drugs or the carrying out of prohibited practices; and, fourth, to advocate a just and equitable response to the issue of drugs in sport. These aims and the means of their achievement are more fully explained in the strategic plan for 1992-93 put forward by the agency. The 1994 Australian Sports Drug Agency operational plan says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sport is about participation, performance, competition and achievement. Above all, it is about building character and improving the health and well-being of the nation. Drugs to enhance physical performance undermine the essential values of all that sport is about. The Australian Sports Drugs Agency is committed to reducing the harm associated with drug use in sport in order to enhance the well being of individuals and the value of sport to society.</PARA>
<PARA>I turn to the main provisions of the bill itself. At present, the ASDA Act allows for testing by ASDA of athletes competing at a national level and, where the states and territories confer power on ASDA under section 9A of the act, the testing of state and territory athletes also. Consistent with the perceived need for a uniform approach across the states and territories to the issue of drug testing in sport, this bill seeks to allow the states to confer jurisdiction on the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court to review decisions regarding testing by ASDA under state or territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Clause 3 amends section 9A of the ASDA Act by providing that a state or territory can confer jurisdiction, a power or function on the Federal Court, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or any member or officer of those bodies. Clause 4 amends section 11 of the ASDA Act by allowing a state or territory to record or delete information in the agency's register, where that state or territory has conferred power on the agency under section 9A(1) of the ASDA Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a very proud history in relation to the question of drug testing. I would like to pay great tribute to the government for its move in relation to drugs in sport.

Recent comments by the Australian head swimming coach, Don Talbot, about the random drug testing in Chinese swimming, following an announcement that the world record holder Zhong Weiyue had been banned for two years after a positive competition test, are further testimony of the fact that drug use right throughout the world and, unfortunately, in Australia is still going on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore found it quite extraordinary that last year there was a further call for anabolic steroids to be freely  available for recreational use.

I was pleased at the time that the now minister for sport, Senator Richardson&mdash;I think he is the now minister for sport, although Senator Faulkner might take issue at that&mdash;and I shared a very similar view that any freeing up of the availability of anabolic steroids would be to the very great detriment of those people operating in gyms throughout Australia and would set back the anti-drug cause in this country a long way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we are receiving international accolades, as I said in my press release at the time, for our very tough stand against drug use in sport. I hasten to add that I am proud of the coalition's involvement in the Senate inquiry into the question of drugs in sport and of our absolutely bipartisan approach to the whole question. I am sure that is freely acknowledged on both sides of the political fence. Not only are we leading the world in relation to the hands-on drug testing; we are also leading the world in relation to research. I think we can be extremely proud of that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is inexcusable for there to be any discussion about the freeing up of the use of anabolic steroids for recreational use. We are condemning many Australians to serious health risks if we do so. In this press release I also raised the question of what the Australian Medical Association should do in relation to this matter. I called on the association to take a very strong stand against members who prescribed steroids for recreational purposes, because doctors should play a lead role in stamping out the use of steroids. The April 1992 edition, volume 53, No. 4 of a magazine called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Muscle and Fitness</EMPHASIS> contained an article about a new gym drug affectionately&mdash;or not so affectionately&mdash;known as clenbuterol. Part of this article written by Bob Lefavi states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few years ago, I conferred with Tom Deters, DC, associate publisher and editor-in-chief of Muscle &amp; Fitness, about writing an article on clenbuterol and other beta agonists. At that time, these drugs were not well known in bodybuilding circles and Dr. Deters felt that we would inadvertently draw attention to the substances. The idea being that bodybuilders would then begin actively looking for beta agonists. Tom was right, and of course it was the socially responsible thing to do at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But since then, more and more bodybuilders and other athletes have gotten hold of what they believe are beta agonists (some perhaps, actually getting the real thing on the European black market). So much so that not only has the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently put U.S. Customs officials on alert for clenbuterol trafficking, but even my office is being flooded with calls from bodybuilders wanting to know about beta agonists. Well&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the important part&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">someone's got to let bodybuilders know what this stuff is all about. Many athletes are now looking for beta agonists. It's a dangerous situation that we must address. It's now time for us to speak up.</PARA>
<PARA>The next part of the article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As if this steroid scene weren't bad enough. Now a new group of drugs is primed and ready to endanger both the integrity of bodybuilding and the lives of those who foolishly look for shortcuts to success in muscledom. These new drugs, beta 2 agonists (more often just termed beta agonists), of which the most common is clenbuterol, could well make steroids look benign and may come to epitomize death in a bottle. If you haven't heard of beta agonists before, don't stop reading here&mdash;anyone who frequents a gym is sure to hear about them sooner or later.</PARA>
<PARA>The article said that these drugs are killers. These drugs are one of the many examples of drugs that people are trying to bring into bodybuilding and gym circles throughout the country as recreational drugs. Let us look at some of the side effects of the drugs dealt with in the magazine article. The minor side effects include heart palpitations, heart rate increase, severe headaches, nosebleeds, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, alternating fever and chills, muscle aches and pains, extreme irritability, nervousness and a dramatic increase in sensitivity to stress. The major side effects include fatalities from myocardial infarctions&mdash;heart attacks, strokes, violent muscle tremors, and severe haemorrhaging and tachycardia&mdash;possibly doubling resting heart rate and cancerous tumours.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Ballarat has already said, this country is at the forefront of the battle for clean competition and clean competitors. Australia has taken one of the strongest international stands against drugs in sport. Through the actions of this government and its legislation and the support of honourable members opposite, coupled with the Australian Sports Drug Agency and the Australian Sports Commission, athletes who cheat through the use of drugs are caught and sanctioned. We will simply not allow the international reputation of Australian sport to be brought into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So effective has our drugs in sport sanction been that the deterrent factor is incredibly high in our elite athletes. Few would even contemplate the risk of career disruption and sanction by taking performance enhancing drugs. The problem is that the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act provides for drug tests only for national level competitors. State and territory legislation must be enacted in order for competitors below that level to be tested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am extremely pleased to say that an assurance has been gained from the governments of all states and territories that not only is this legislation desirable but also they will seek to enact it. However, there must be a totally coordinated approach aimed at achieving uniform anti-doping legislation in a national sense. To this end, extensive negotiations have taken place on the need for all states and territories to reduce anti-doping legislation, which mirrors the existing legislation of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July last year, the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act was amended to allow ASDA to test state and territory level one competitors under complementary anti-doping legislation.

<PARA>One of the major aspects of these amendments is to make sure that any legislation which the states adopt is consistent in the protection of the rights of competitors.

It is of paramount importance that all competitors have the same rights of appeal and are treated equally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments we are debating here today will allow states and territories to confer jurisdiction upon the federal government or the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal for athletes who test positive or who fail to provide a sample. The means that athletes at all levels of competition and from all states will be treated fairly and equally. It also means that there will be a uniform mechanism of appeal for all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Sports Drug Agency is an organisation which has distinguished itself since its inception. It has caught those athletes who have used prohibited substances. Analgesics, narcotics, steroids and diuretics have all been picked up by the testing process. It is, however, pertinent in the context of this debate, as we are expanding the number of athletes who will be tested, to issue the challenge to the ASDA to develop and use reliable tests for the new generation of performance enhancing drugs. We must always be aware that, as times change, drugs change and, therefore, we must change our testing abilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are drugs becoming available to athletes which are very dangerous to their health, as the honourable member for Ballarat has already indicated, and for which detection is often difficult.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for reasons of progression that these amendments have been introduced. The successful introduction of legislation by states and territories, which will complement federal legislation, will mean that many more athletes will be tested.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1993 makes a number of amendments to a variety of laws in existing tax acts. The amendments are concerned with the fringe benefits tax, a number of income tax measures and the superannuation guarantee administration legislation. These proposals serve to highlight the ever-increasing complexity of the tax laws of this country under Labor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that omnibus bills have become an increasingly regular feature of tax legislation brought before the parliament by the present government. This parliament routinely passes into law hundreds of pages of tax legislation every year. These bills set out to address the many problems that result from the increasing complexity of tax law, while at the same time further adding to that complexity. A slack approach to legislation in the first place also contributes to complexity and the need for legislation of this type, whether in omnibus or other forms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has finally acknowledged some of the problems caused by this ever-increasing complexity with the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) announcing on 17 December last year what he called `a tax law improvement project'. Of course, this is by no means the first time that a Labor government has announced such a project. It is significant that the government once again has been forced to concede that there are problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are problems that the opposition has been pointing out for some time now, as you are well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker. They are problems that the accounting and legal professions have also been beseeching the government to address for at least the past five years. It seems that Labor has now finally been provoked into action although, if previous tax law improvement exercises by this government are anything to go by, we do not have much reason to be hopeful about the outcome of this most recent announcement. The Assistant Treasurer's statement acknowledges:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excessive complexity in the tax laws produces uncertainty and makes it more difficult than it need be for people to fully comprehend and comply with their tax obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>That is something of an understatement. We seem to have heard that song before. I remind you again, Mr Deputy Speaker, of a long forgotten tax simplification undertaking that sank without trace. The Assistant Treasurer's statement goes into detail on some of the many benefits to be realised by simplifying the tax laws of this country, which can only make one wonder why a reform process was not initiated or even completed some time ago. His statement goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The redrafting of the law will be guided by a commitment to plainer language, improved presentation and the most modern drafting techniques and style.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emphasis will be on user-friendly approaches that have as their starting point the needs and the capacities of users of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will, for example, be a more rational and sensible use of definitions to reduce the multiplicity and duplication of defined terms and their present scattered location throughout the act.</PARA>
<PARA>All that is to be welcomed if, indeed, the government manages to deliver on its undertaking this time. It is interesting, however, that we have another tacit acknowledgment that the existing tax law and the legislative process that brings it into operation are in many ways deficient, something I have been arguing here for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Assistant Treasurer's comments have a slightly familiar ring to them, that is because they bear a close relation to previous statements by the government on the subject. An earlier statement on the subject, if I recall correctly, was simply headed `Tax simplification' and was issued by one `P.J. Keating'&mdash;the then Treasurer and the now Prime Minister&mdash;as long ago as 15 February 1990. In that statement, the then Treasurer announced:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member may well ask what happened. Unfortunately, that statement was pretty much the last we heard of the then Treasurer's so-called tax simplification project. Although the simplification task force that was set up supposedly produced an options paper on the subject, that options paper has never seen the light of day. We have no way of knowing what, if any, progress has been made in implementing the options developed by the task force. The whole exercise was promptly forgotten after the 1990 federal election and the government has nothing to show for what was hailed at the time as a major tax policy initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer will have to forgive the coalition for being somewhat cynical about this most recent regurgitation of the government's interesting tax laws simplification. In fact, the Assistant Treasurer's statement on 17 December last year is a damning indictment of the current Prime Minister's efforts when he was Treasurer. The concluding paragraph in the Assistant Treasurer's statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The steps I am announcing today will commence the process of making Australia's income tax law more understandable and accessible to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will similarly commence the process of easing the cost to the community of administering and complying with those tax laws.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the word `commence'. The Assistant Treasurer is freely admitting that the government is only just beginning its tax law simplification efforts. He has all but admitted that nothing was done as a result of the government's tax law simplification project announced by the then Treasurer in February 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the past three years, the government has been asleep at the wheel on the issue, if not for its entire term in office. The government recognised the need to act in 1990, but did nothing. It is to be hoped, although not expected, that Labor's renewed interest in tax law simplification is more long lasting this time around and that the government acts with some urgency in the matter. These hopes are shared by a wide range of people, not least the members of the accounting and legal professions, who deal on a daily basis with the immense complexity and uncertainty which this government has introduced into the tax laws of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About a month before the government made its most recent announcement on the subject of tax law simplification, the presidents of the New South Wales Law Society and the Institute of Chartered Accountants issued a joint statement calling on the government to act. In that statement, the presidents said that dealing with the tax law:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . was like a Star Trek journey without the excitement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This voyage into the unknown faces many tax advisers and their clients, who in some cases would welcome the opportunity to have Scotty beam them up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All laws should be certain, ascertainable and intelligible.</PARA>
<PARA>Amen to that. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not true of our present income tax laws which are not understood by taxpayers, nor even by many tax advisers. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If anyone can truthfully say that the massive texts that cover tax in Australia are very well known or understood, even by the experts, then they must be out of touch with reality.</PARA>
<PARA>As evidence for these propositions, the presidents cited the 422 taxation instruments of one type or another issued by the Australian Taxation Office in the first eight months of 1993 alone. These include rulings and determinations as well as exposure drafts. The presidents also expressed cynicism about the government's then forthcoming tax laws simplification statement, noting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are aware that the government has said that a statement on simplification will be made soon, but we must stress that the federal government has made such promises before.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we are looking for from the government is a real plan for progress on the simplification process.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, we have not been given a real plan by Labor, only a few vague commitments and some reassuring noises. Just as important as tax simplification is the question of tax reform more generally. This was highlighted by Mr John Tucker, President of the Taxation Institute of Australia, in a speech he gave to the general council meeting of the Asia-Oceania Tax Consultants Association held in November last year. In his opening remarks he said, about the importance of tax reform for Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian taxation system is in urgent need of fundamental reform if it is not to become an impediment to the internationalisation of Australian business, seen by most economists as the key to future development of the Australian economy. In our view, Australia has little choice but to produce a simplified and internationally competitive tax system, one which will at least not contain tax disincentives to the establishment or conduct of business in this country when on other grounds, Australia is an appropriate location. This will require the abandonment of some existing policies such as those which have sponsored complex provisions in the income tax law, such as those to raise tax at the margins and deal with prospective avoidance (particularly of liabilities which are of themselves of little value to the revenue). A serious rationalisation of the tax base both at federal and state level will sooner rather than later be needed in this country to achieve what is in economic terms an essential end.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Tucker is worth quoting at length on this subject because his remarks neatly encapsulate the importance of these issues for the future economic wellbeing of Australia. More specifically, a recent report from the accounting firm Ernst and Young has called for tax law simplification in a number of areas currently causing problems for business in Australia. These include the controlled foreign company, or CFC, rules, the introduction of a new regime for taxing export profits and the renegotiation of tax treaties to bring them into line with OECD conventions on the treatment of income and capital. As Ernst and Young say in their report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian taxation system must make it attractive for firms to locate their headquarters activities in Australia and to export their goods and services from Australian factories and offices.</PARA>
<PARA>All of these comments serve to put into proper perspective the government's complacency about tax reform and tax simplification. The government does not need to take any of this on the authority of the opposition. The tax and accounting professional communities are crying out for action, and the government should heed their calls in a timely fashion. The Assistant Treasurer's press release of December last year has signalled the government's intention to act once again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are now looking for is some action and some results and the sooner the better. The increasing number of calls for the government to act on tax law simplification are the result of a growing realisation that our complex tax legislation is costing us dearly, both in terms of the compliance costs faced by taxpayers and because of collection and administration costs that are incurred by the tax office and that are paid for out of tax revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These costs were highlighted recently in a study carried out by the Australian Tax Research Foundation entitled `The compliance costs of employment related taxation in Australia'. The study notes that compliance costs&mdash;what it terms `the hidden costs'&mdash;imposed by our tax system of personal and company income tax amount to around 10 times the published cost of running the Australian Taxation Office. That means that, for every dollar the Australian Taxation Office spends on collecting taxes, individual and corporate taxpayers are forced to spend $10 in meeting their tax obligations. This is what it means to refer to individuals and companies as the `unpaid tax collectors of the Australian taxation system'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one considers that the tax office spends 1 per cent of all the revenue it collects in the administration of the tax system, one begins to realise the enormous sums that must be outlaid by corporate and individual taxpayers every year in compliance costs. The Australian Tax Research Foundation notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A figure of this magnitude exceeds what most economists would consider to be the distortionary or welfare costs of the tax system on account of its effects on incentives.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the costs Labor ignores when it declares Australia to be a low tax country. Whatever the government's total tax take as a share of gross domestic product, the fact remains that Australia has one of the most expensive tax systems in the world in terms of compliance costs, and these costs are in large part attributable to the complexity of the legislation that underpins our tax system&mdash;and we have more of it here before us today. The fact that many of the expenses incurred in complying with the tax law are deductible makes no difference to these tax calculations. The deductibility of these expenses simply translates into higher tax rates to compensate for the revenue forgone in allowing tax deductibility, it is as simple as that. The overall resource costs to the community remain the same. The fringe benefits tax, which is dealt with in the legislation before us today, provides a very good example of some of the problems already mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study I have been referring to found that the compliance costs incurred by those meeting their obligations under the fringe benefits tax legislation amount to more than 10 per cent of the total revenue that the tax collects. In 1989-90 total compliance costs of the fringe benefits tax were estimated at $128 million, which was nearly 11 per cent of the total fringe benefits tax revenue of $1.2 billion. These compliance costs are highly regressive, falling particularly hard on small businesses. The study found that employers spent on average 1,100 hours per year complying with the fringe benefits tax, which amounts to about one half-time worker per week just to comply with this one tax. These figures are hardly surprising when one looks at the sorts of amendments we have in the legislation under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to address a new threat to Labor's tax on car parking fringe benefits&mdash;the humble kerb-side parking meter. The issue arises from the definition of a commercial parking station contained in the original act. The current definition refers to the provision of an all-day car parking space for the payment of a fee. Unfortunately for the government&mdash;and it is evidence of its slack approach to legislation&mdash;some kerb-side parking meters, particularly those on the outskirts of central business districts, provide all-day parking for a fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that a business within one kilometre of one of these parking meters is liable to pay fringe benefits tax, despite the fact that there may be not a commercial parking station anywhere within a one-kilometre radius of the business. By the same token, businesses within a kilometre of one of these parking meters that do have a commercial parking station within a one-kilometre radius can use the cost of the all-day parking meter for the calculation of the taxable value of the fringe benefit provided to their employees. Of course, the value of such parking is much lower than that provided by commercial car parking stations, resulting in a lower taxable value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that employers have taken advantage of the wording of the existing legislation to use kerb-side parking meters to achieve a lower taxable value for the car parking benefits made available to their employees. So we have an amendment before us today to write into the tax law a form of words which excludes kerb-side parking meters from being commercial parking stations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is typical of so many that we deal with in this place that are designed to address the unintended consequences of the government's tax legislation. These unintended consequences are the result of needless complexity in the tax law and the stupid tax measures that give rise to that complexity&mdash;bearing in mind that the tax on car parking fringe benefits has been dubbed a Monty Python tax. Is it any wonder that the tax law in this country is now so complex that the entire body of it can only be moved about by loading it onto a large trolley with a very good set of wheels? This is the same body of tax law that individuals and small businesses are expected to comply with and by which they must self-assess their liability and risk enormous penalties if a mistake is honestly made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to measures dealing with the fringe benefits tax, the bill seeks to correct a deficiency in the application of the penalty for deliberately overfranking dividends under the imputation system. Under dividend imputation there is a penalty of franking additional tax when a company deliberately overfranks a dividend, and this gives rise to a deficit in the company's franking account at the end of its franking year. The amendments contained in this bill seek to ensure that franking additional tax can be applied where an initial payment of company tax reduces the franking deficit tax otherwise payable in respect of the franking account deficit. The amendment applies to companies that deliberately overfrank a dividend after 14 December last year, when this bill was first introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of problems with this proposed amendment. Not the least is the fact that under changes to the corporate tax payment system many companies will pay 85 per cent of their prior year tax liability within 28 days of year end, so there should be no problem in allowing companies to include the 85 per cent tax payment in their calculation of franking credits for the prior year. In any event, retrospectivity arises from the processes that a company must follow in paying a franked dividend. Before a franked dividend can be paid, there must be a resolution to pay the dividend and a declaration that the dividend is a franked dividend. The company must make the declaration before the day on which the dividend is paid. The listing rules of the Australian Stock Exchange specify a minimum of nine days between the declaration of a dividend and the closing of the books on shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public companies, as honourable members may well know, take up to two weeks to register all share transfers and to close the share registry before a dividend can be actually paid. Where the declaration of a dividend and the determination of its level of franking have been made before 14 December 1993, based on the existing law, the payment of the dividend after 14 December will give rise to an adverse tax position. The commencement date for these amendments, the date of their introduction, therefore provides insufficient notice if we are to avoid a retrospective impact from this measure. In addition to being retrospective, the amendment as it stands would be quite discriminatory in that it would apply to relatively few companies but particularly to those with substituted accounting periods. These problems can be remedied through a minor amendment to the proposed clause 51, and the coalition urges the government that it be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes provision for a rebate of 20c in the dollar for expenditure on approved heritage conservation works of at least $10,000 on historic buildings that are listed on statutory heritage registers. The total amount of work which will be eligible for the rebate will be limited to $9.5 million, to be issued in provisional certificates each year. The rebate scheme will cost the revenue about $2 million for each financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Institute of Australia has expressed concern over this measure being included as a separate division of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The institute points out that it merely serves to add further complexity to the act at a time when the government is supposedly engaged in a tax law simplification exercise. The TIA's suggestion, which I believe is a sound one, is that this scheme should have been administered as a grants scheme through one of the relevant government departments which will, in any case, be involved in the administration of the rebate scheme simply because they issue the certificates that make a taxpayer eligible for the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Institute points out that the rebate for heritage conservation works may well be totally unrelated to any income earning activities of the taxpayer. Introducing special incentives into the Income Tax Assessment Act that are unrelated to the derivation of assessable income is a recipe for unnecessary complexity in taxation law.

<PARA>While the coalition does agree with the overall content of the bill, we do have strong reservations on two matters that should be of concern to the government, as they are to many in the community. The operation of the superannuation guarantee charge discriminates against many casual, part-time and itinerant workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extending the coverage of the superannuation guarantee charge to contractors will severely impact upon contractors who are relying on their own superannuation to fund their own retirements. The coalition has received many representations from working men and women who have been hard done by by the rules currently applying under the SGC. No doubt members in this House are familiar with who is covered by the SGC, but I will repeat some information anyway. Sections 27 and 28 of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 state that salary or wages are not to be taken into account where an employee is under 18 or is 65 and over, an employee who is not resident in Australia performs work outside Australia, an employer who is not a resident of Australia pays an employee who is a resident of Australia for work performed outside Australia and an employee earns less than $450 per month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Casual, part-time and itinerant workers are severely penalised under these sections. The problems are many. Administration fees are usually set at a fixed amount, as I am sure honourable members know. Casual and itinerant workers often work for many employers and change jobs regularly, resulting in membership of several and multiple superannuation schemes. Exit fees are also fixed and they take no account of the available balance. For example, a worker earning $600 per month would receive a superannuation contribution from an employer of $18 per month or an annual benefit of $216. However, there is a contribution tax of 15 per cent that reduces the balance to $184 and there is a further administration charge of $50. The remaining balance in this example is, therefore, reduced to $134&mdash;$82 was gobbled up by taxes and administration fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What hope does this hold for a worker that works only for a few hours a week or can get only occasional work? The answer is, of course, false hope, because after the taxes and charges have come out of the SGC contributions the amount which is left could never be expected to provide a meaningful retirement income.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have broadened the income tax base in this community and, in so doing, we have been able to reform the taxation system, to drop the corporate rate of tax to 33 per cent, to get marginal rates of tax down from 38c in the dollar to 34c in the dollar for average income earners and people have received from this government a tax cut on average of $8 a week. We have been able to do that because we have plugged all the holes that those opposite left open when they made taxation optional for very many people in this community. When they come in here and complain about the complexity of the tax legislation, they should at least acknowledge the benefits of the government's approach&mdash;an internationally competitive business taxation system which a GST would not have delivered because of its consequent effects on the inflation rate and so on. </PARA>

That is the decade in which the tax reforms that this government has brought in have begun to show significant effect in the community. So much so that a recent report from Clayton Utz called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Doing business in Australia</EMPHASIS> details just how attractive Australia has become as an international destination for business.

All of that adds up to what has been the success of this government that we are now the lowest taxing country in the OECD.

In fact, the Leader of the Opposition's rating has dropped from 40 per cent to 30 per cent since last December. Why is that? It is fairly obvious why that is the case. There is no alternative policy approach emerging from the opposition.

It has former Senator Bishop running around the country saying that we should be dropping the capital gains tax.

At the same time, we have the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) running around the country advocating Asian levels of taxation. Asian levels of taxation in Australia would mean cutting revenue to the tune of $10 billion to $20 billion a year. At the same time, members of the opposition come into this House and argue that no government expenditure cuts are justified. So what they have is a policy of dropping the revenue, keeping the expenditure going and blowing out the deficit. No wonder they criticise the government for its deficit reduction program.

There may well be some commonsense and sincerity in some of the remarks they make about the technical nature of these amendments and other amendments to do with the tax act. Trying to devise a taxation system that stops the smarties from driving trucks through loopholes and from producing the sort of leakage that we had in our taxation system under previous coalition governments is indeed very difficult. The consequence of that is that the community does pay a price in terms of complexity and compliance costs. But those opposite should acknowledge why we have to do that. They should not come in and cry crocodile tears about complexity and about the government not having any integrity in its approach. It clearly does.

In particular, I would mention the provisions relating to the exemption of certain bereavement payments which apply to most pensions. I think this is a very worthy measure. The existing law does not provide for the exemption of any bereavement payments in relation to a number of allowances which currently are being introduced by the government. One particularly good reform to be introduced by the government is, of course, the mature age allowance for those long-term unemployed males who, through no fault of their own, are unable to get work. The government is recognising that and not applying the activity test. That has consequent flow-ons throughout the system, and that has been recognised in this bill. I congratulate the government for that. </PARA>

The bill will provide a tax rebate of 20c in the dollar for expenditure on approved conservation work on buildings listed in a Commonwealth, state or territory register. I noticed that the honourable member for Curtin criticised that initiative. I cannot quite understand why. I think it is one that is long overdue. It was part of the government's election campaign commitment. I believe that over time it will have an enormous take-up rate. But I think it is a very important initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also acknowledge some of the points made by the honourable member for Curtin in relation to the superannuation guarantee act and some of the technical amendments which are made here.

They have opposed at every turn the efforts of this government to put in place a national superannuation system which can provide for this work force through the next century.

While the SGC should apply to payments for labour, I am concerned that this definition may be too narrow and it may have an adverse effect on a number of independent contractors in the community. That is a matter which I will continue to take up with the government over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, having said that, in matters of superannuation, as in matters of taxation overall, this government has a very good record which has delivered very positive benefits to not only the business community but also the work force of this country. The opposition has no policy when it comes to wages, except for lower wages; it has no policy when it comes to taxation, except for higher taxation. All that usually adds up to is a standard prescription from the conservative parties of lower living standards for ordinary people. Nothing has changed in that debate in terms of the contributions from those opposite today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have the opportunity to respond to the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) who seemed to get off track a bit. I thought we were here to debate the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1993, which I note is one more in a great long list of omnibus bills that seem to be favoured by this government. We amend, amend, amend, amend, amend and change. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Lilley is leaving the chamber so I will not be able to tell him what is wrong with this bill and have him understand it in any great detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lilley spent some considerable time directing his remarks to opposition policy as it was prior to the last federal election on 13 March 1993 and also prior to the Labor Party coming into government in 1983. He seems to be obsessed with what the Liberal Party and the National Party might or might not think about taxation spending and a whole raft of other things, which generally had no relevance to the bill that is before us today. But let me say to the honourable member for Lilley and any other honourable members on the government benches in this parliament: if they think we do not have policies, wait for it. I assure them that the Australian people will warm to our approach, as they are getting heartily sick of a government which not only is incompetent but which also has no accountability. It is increasingly seen by the community to be tired, out of touch, sick, perhaps decayed&mdash;that is a good one, a rotten carcass hanging up there in the breeze, a bit smelly. That seems to be all around us, does it not? Just about everything it seems to touch winds up in that sort of context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This omnibus bill goes to a whole range of taxation matters. We have talked about this issue before in this place, and I want to raise it again. It makes it particularly difficult for individuals, taxation advisers, accountants, companies and business people of all descriptions&mdash;small, medium and large&mdash;to know how to plan their affairs when the taxation rules constantly change. They not only change but, by putting a whole raft of measures together in one bill, those individuals have no idea of where to turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill reminds me in some respects of the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993, which we debated long and hard in this place. That act had so many amendments to the principal act, the IR act of 1988, that we need a road map to be able to follow the amendments to the original bill, and then the amendments on the amendments to the original bill. They make it such a confusing mess that it will be a very major accomplishment if the principal industrial relations players in this country manage to sort out what their responsibilities are, what the legal system means and how it is to work. We are faced with the same sort of problem with this bill because of its omnibus nature and the fact that it addresses specific taxation measures across a whole range of issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the government addressing anomalies in the tax act and in various sections of that act, but I really do deplore some of the measures inherent in this bill which are further attacks on industry, on business and on commerce generally. That is an important battle. This government really does not seem to have much concept of why we have businesses. We frequently hear in this place moaning and groaning about the high rate of unemployment and the government's inability to deal with the problem. References are made by government ministers and backbenchers to situations overseas. They say, `Oh well, we're not quite as bad as country X and country Y, but we're desperately worse than country Z'. But the point they miss is that, in all of this, private enterprise is the driving force behind our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few years this government has propped up our economy by expanding the Public Service&mdash;by expanding the number of people we pay to administer government programs and government initiatives. Whether or not they are doing useful work one can only judge by the raft of massive, voluminous legislation that we get before us in this place, exemplified by this kind of a bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not really understand business. Very few of those opposite have been involved in business in a real sense, so how could we expect them to understand? We cannot ask a teacher to explain the ethos or the mental workings of the mind of a true entrepreneur, one who is going to develop new products and new services and help build jobs for an expanding, growing and dynamic nation. School teachers are good at teaching at school, but I suspect they are not very good at understanding business. Yet we have rafts of school teachers who come into this place and tell us how we ought to develop industry policy and industrial relations policy, improve productivity and alter the taxation system, without any base understanding of how those businesses operate or the mentality behind the people who drive them and what they are trying to achieve&mdash;not only for their companies but for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax act has become so complex that a whole industry has developed&mdash;not in taxation avoidance but in just trying to cope with it and do the right thing to make sure that individuals and companies are not slammed with penalties which arise out of many of the sections of the act in case someone, accidentally or otherwise, violates some provision in the act. Those complexities cost money. They are expensive for individuals because individuals now increasingly have to go to taxation advisers or accountants in order to have their taxation returns done. They find that taxation legislation has become so complex that they can no longer fill out their own taxation return and be confident that they will not violate one of the hundreds of thousands of provisions of the act. Businesses are placed in an even more invidious position, having to spend increasing amounts of money on the increasing detail incorporated into the taxation act. Those complexities cost money. Perhaps they contribute to the gross national product&mdash;I certainly hope not, because they are a negative expense; they do us no good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message that I bring to this government is simplicity in legislation, particularly in the tax act. I think former Senator Bishop, who will soon join us in this House, is right in that perhaps we should dedicate a portion of time in this place to not introducing legislation but getting rid of it. That is not a bad idea. Let us get rid of a whole raft of it. Perhaps then we would be a bit more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, business oncosts are attacked by this kind of legislation. If we want productivity in this nation, if we  want the competitiveness that government ministers and members talk about, and if we want to go out and play in the broader world community, we need low oncosts for business and commerce. The kinds of provisions incorporated in this bill increase the oncosts of businesses&mdash;both directly, through taxation that they must pay, and indirectly, through the accounting and record keeping required by the taxation measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government uses the tax act for all kinds of things. The government says it would be desirable for more businesses and more industries to provide more effective training for their employees. Nobody would ever disagree with that kind of a motherhood statement. It is absolutely true. So what does the government do? It creates a taxation measure to tax companies if they do not train the way the government thinks they ought to train. So oncosts of business and industry are continuously attacked through the tax act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the topic of retrospectivity. Time and time again in this place we seem to argue over retrospectivity. Once again, unintended or otherwise, in this bill we address retrospectivity. In this case it concerns the overfranking of dividends. I understand that not many companies are involved, but it is retrospective legislation. There is some possibility that the government's definitions which are hidden in the bill with respect to contractors are also retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Retrospectivity tears the life out of the confidence of business and industry that government knows what it is doing. How on earth can we plan effectively when the rules are changed in the past tense? It is hard enough to cope with the raft of changes that this government introduces which are required by industry for compliance. It is hard enough to deal with the new ones, much less with the ones which deal with the past. I deplore the introduction, once again, by the government of an element of retrospectivity into legislation in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major elements of this bill is the superannuation guarantee charge. In the back of the bill the government has buried some definitions which affect so-called contractors.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also make a number of other amendments to facilitate the smooth operation of the superannuation guarantee scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>When he talks about other arrangements and smooth operations, he is talking about changing the definition of a contractor in order to sweep all the contractors in Australia, in so far as it is possible, into the PAYE system and into the superannuation guarantee charge system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I notice the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) nodded his head in agreement that, yes, that is what the government is about&mdash;`Let's get rid of contractors, because they are bad for unions. Let's make everybody a PAYE employee and make everyone belong to the union. Then the union bureaucracy can control government, can control the tax act and can control the country'. Why bother electing us in the first place to come into this place to argue about it? Let us just let the unions run the country and everybody will be happy. That is a terrific idea!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider what the government says about contractors in this bill. The purpose of this particular amendment to the act is to remove any doubt that payments made to contractors wholly or principally for their labour are salary or wages. It is intended to ensure that the superannuation guarantee scheme operates as intended. We are not really sure what was intended, but the date of effect of this amendment is 1 July 1992. That makes it retrospective. The government will argue&mdash;erroneously, I think&mdash;that it is only clearing up some language that left some doubt. The amendment says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An employee is defined in subsection 12(3) of the SGAA to include a contractor who works under a contract which is wholly or principally for the labour of a person.</PARA>
<PARA>But then it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A contract is considered to be wholly or principally for labour if more than half of the value of the contract is for labour. It was clearly intended that payments for labour under such contracts were to be subject to Superannuation Guarantee contributions.</PARA>
<PARA>Boy, does that raise a whole raft of problems! For example, a bricklayer may work for 50 different companies during a year. I agree that it is unusual, but it is possible. If that bricklayer supplies labour only, including perhaps his mixer, his tools, his transport and those sorts of things, he invoices the building contractor that he is working for, or the house builder, or whomever. Largely his contract is for labour. That means that the principal contractor or builder must now pay superannuation on behalf of that bricklayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How on earth does a bricklayer get any benefit out of superannuation payments that are made to perhaps as many as 50 different superannuation schemes? All that means is that the charges by the superannuation supervisors for operating costs will exceed the amount of payments made to the account and that a whole amount of money will be wasted on bureaucracy. It will be of no benefit to the bricklayer. Anyway, the bricklayer took out his own superannuation in the first place and has made his own arrangements. He really does not need the complexity of the people that he works for adding to that superannuation&mdash;not to the scheme that he has set up for himself but to sundry superannuation schemes. It is an absolute nonsense and it will create a nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government intends to eliminate contractors, then this is one good way to go about it. I think it was in 1992 that the government, through the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), made a concerted effort to bring contractors under the control of trade unions. Contractors were not allowed to deal separately with those people who employed them if they came up with an agreement that the union did not like. So the union could act for the contractors, notwithstanding the fact that the contractors did not like the idea, and go to the commission and complain that their contract was not fair because they might have received more money had they been employed on wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of industry in this country, some of the most efficient and effective industry in the world, is built on the contractor and subcontractor system. If this government intends to destroy that system, then it wants not only to attack the independence of people&mdash;their desire to do their own thing, be their own bosses and work in the manner that suits them rather than in the manner someone else tells them they have to work in&mdash;but also to help destroy some of the most effective industry in the world. What benefit will this achieve? It will not benefit the mums and pops of Australia, because they will pay more for their houses. It will not benefit the mums and the pops who want to send their children to school, because the government will be paying more money for new school buildings and that means we will all pay higher taxes. So what benefit is all of this? None. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being an independent contractor has absolutely nothing to do with ripping off the taxation rules. Honourable members cannot point to any evidence that indicates that it does. The last government brought in a system which required independent contractors in the construction industry, for instance, to have some of their payments made as taxation until they could prove that they were reliable taxpayers, and fair enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Casual, part-time and itinerant workers are another issue that we very strongly wish to bring to the attention of the government because those people, like the contractors or bricklayers in the example I gave before, will wind up with no superannuation benefit to their account. It is long past time that this government gave up and accepted our proposition that banks be allowed to accept those contributions without having all the charges that go together with separate superannuation funds with no benefit ever going to the people involved. The complexity of this legislation requires addressing, as does the complexity of the fringe benefits tax system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of the importance of this issue is the contrast between two major arterial roads in inner Melbourne&mdash;St Kilda Road and Royal Parade. St Kilda Road was once a very beautiful street; unfortunately, most of the older buildings in St Kilda Road were pulled down and replaced with high-rise office blocks now populated by insurance companies and various other organisations. Although it still has certain features, it is nothing like it once was. </PARA>

There are some extraordinary examples of 19th century architecture.

<PARA>people who would have been great promoters of these high-rise towers in the past now recognise this&mdash;for all of us that there has been a change of emphasis and a change of orientation in what we value and what we think is important.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I warmly commend the government for this initiative. If honourable members do not think that things such as preserving some of our older buildings, particularly in the inner areas of cities where obviously they tend to proliferate, is all that important they should have a look at some of the cities around the world.

It really is quite an extraordinary city and it has many beautiful features. But one of the things that it really does lack is that sense of time and history over many different ages that can be found even in a relatively young city such as Melbourne because of the fact that it has grown so rapidly in the modern era. Of course it has its great ancient era landmarks such as the Parthenon, the Temple of Zeus and so forth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time remaining to me, I will make some broader comments about the question of taxation which all the various issues in this legislation relate to. Unlike some, I take no pride in the fact that Australia is now close to or is actually the lowest taxed country in the OECD. That is really looking at the issue the wrong way around. We should be looking not at the raw figure of how high or how low our tax is; we should be looking at the outcomes, particularly with respect to quality and equity. Are we getting the best value for money? Are we spending the money that is raised collectively from the community and spent collectively as effectively as we could? Do we have the fairest distribution of wealth and opportunity in the OECD? Do we have health, education, housing, community services and transport systems that deliver to everybody on a reasonably equitable basis and on an efficient basis? These are the key questions that we should be asking ourselves&mdash;not how much tax we all pay but what we get for it. Are the outcomes effective? Are they what people need, what people want? Those are the critical questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good to see, for electoral reasons, that the apostles of Reaganism are still alive and well on the other side of the House. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) is an arch-Reaganite. What the Reagan approach has delivered in the United States is effectively a collapsing public education system with high levels of illiteracy and extreme problems with training and retention rates, a grossly inequitable health system, poor infrastructure and, of course, massive and growing inequality which entails a whole range of social problems which are increasingly coming to the surface. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1980s in the United States are a clear example of the true consequences of the trickle down approach, of the notion that if we make the wealthy wealthier they will go out and create jobs for everybody and we will live happily ever after. Now we have the re-emergence of the throwbacks in the coalition, with people such as ex-Senator Bishop aiming to enter this House and taking an increasingly prominent role in opposition policy. Former Senator Bishop is suggesting that we need to get rid of things like the capital gains tax. We have the hysteria that is thrown at this government&mdash;which, as I indicated, has reduced our level of tax to virtually the lowest level in the OECD&mdash;in still being described by, amongst others, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), as the great `tax and spend' government. One wonders what sorts of adjectives he would use if we were in fact a high taxing and spending government. The reality is somewhat different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others in the coalition have been pushing the notion of income splitting as, I suspect, a device to try to turn back the clock and to reintroduce their notion of the traditional family as the dominant social unit in our society. The fact is that our society has changed a great deal. We have many types of families, a much more complex framework. To crudely examine the issue in the way that some in the opposition are doing and to suggest simply introducing a tax structure based on income splitting is, in effect, a recipe for favouring the better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to ask where the opposition is coming from. Let us look at the track record. Hark back to the Fraser government. One of the key things that the Fraser government did in 1976, if my memory serves me correctly, was to reduce the number of scales in the income tax schedule from six to three. The net effect of that was to shift the burden from the wealthier taxpayers back down the scale to lower income earners. That was what it was designed to do. With fewer steps in the income tax scale, the end result will be that the relative proportions of income tax being paid by people at different levels will change, and they change adversely to lower income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In more recent times, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) in his contribution, we have had the GST. In amongst all of the hysteria, rhetoric and so forth that we have heard from both sides on this issue, there is one fundamental point: a tax change such as that which was envisaged in Fightback would have substantially shifted income and wealth away from lower income earners in favour of the better off. Shifting from a mildly progressive income tax arrangement to a consumption related arrangement through the GST would have had that consequence. It is difficult to determine until it is actually enforced precisely by how much, but that is what it would have done. That is why I think it is reasonable for us to come to the conclusion that the opposition is primarily here to represent the interests of the better off in the community, the wealthier sections of our society. Whatever those opposite say, whatever crocodile tears they cry about inequality and the like, that is the consequence of what they have done in government, and of what they propose in opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the income splitting issue, the Labor government, through the green paper on restoring full employment, is addressing some of the issues, some of the legitimate concerns. I commend the parenting allowance proposal in the green paper to the consideration of honourable members. That proposal provides a basis for people&mdash;male or female&mdash;to have much greater support in their role as carers for children. One of the things that will be important to attach to that initiative if it is adopted by the government&mdash;this recommendation has been put forward by ACOSS&mdash;is that some form of scheme equivalent to the JET scheme which applies to single parents should be developed to ensure that those who are out of the work force for a time are assisted to return to the work force, particularly if they have been out of it for a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems we have in this country&mdash;the honourable member for La Trobe is a very good example&mdash;is the culture within business that someone else is to blame, that there is a nasty government imposing costs on us, these taxes and charges and on-costs, et cetera. There is always somebody else to blame for the failures of Australian business in international competitiveness. It is never us. It is never management. It is never poor quality decisions. It is never lack of innovation. It is never lack of genuine entrepreneurialism. It is always somebody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier this month in a speech in this House, that is not where the main game of international competitiveness is. Costs obviously are an issue, but they are a lesser issue than the key issue; that is, the ability to innovate, to develop quality products that the rest of the world wants to buy and that the rest of the world needs. That is where Australian business is still too often falling down and that is where government intervention is important.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened to the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). It never ceases to amaze me how, after the event, one can hear views on taxation which, in many cases, seem to be so far from reality. He seemed to have completely confused the fundamental problem about the ratio of tax which should come from income as distinct from that which should come from consumption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall only too well the position of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the whole question of indirect tax a few years ago, which was only knocked out by the ACTU and not because of any economic argument in its own right. Therefore, I reject the honourable member for Melbourne now claiming that somehow or other the proposals of the coalition at the last election were going to be grossly unfair to low income earners&mdash;we went to considerable efforts to demonstrate quite conclusively that that was not the case. It demonstrates what a coordinated policy of lies and deception can ultimately achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the whole issue of the GST is now no longer on the public record. As far as the opposition is concerned, it is no longer our policy. But the issue as to what proportion of one's income should be the subject of direct, as distinct from indirect, taxation will clearly remain something which all people who are interested in taxation will have to refer to in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation which we are debating today is technically related to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). It covers a number of subjects of interest. I want to draw specific attention to the question of superannuation in so far as it affects both low income individuals, especially part-time employees, and subcontractors. This has been amply covered by my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who spoke eloquently about this very serious issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the SGL was introduced into this House, we in the opposition expected that the fundamental definitions under the Income Tax Act would remain consistent for both superannuation purposes as well as tax purposes. Unfortunately, that has not been the case. Consequently, we are concerned that the handling of subcontractors under the superannuation laws will now create a series of perhaps unexpected consequences which, nevertheless, will certainly not be in the interests of the hundreds of thousands of small business men and women in this country who are subcontractors, whose existence depends on their ability to trade in an open market situation and who, therefore, can see their position considerably undercut by the provisions in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take one case as an example. Large numbers of larger companies in the building industry want to deal only with subcontractors who have incorporated themselves; in other words, they have gone to the trouble of going to their solicitors, buying $2 companies and so forth. They have established, therefore, a different legal entity. They wanted to be seen as employees of a company providing a range of services for a given length of time for the completion of a specific project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are now effectively being told, `We do not want to deal with you'. Why? Because of the impact of the SGL and the fact that, in this case, the building industry faces the problem of having to have a different set of structures for the handling of subcontractors because of the SGL compared with the position when dealing with employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This in turn has resulted in a situation where, in our opinion, the act should draw the line. In other words, if people are declared to be subcontractors under the tax act, what is the logic for saying that they are not the same subcontractors performing basically the same work under the Superannuation Act? Clearly, there is a serious question of logic here which should be addressed by the government. I sincerely hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table and who is very learned in these matters, will, at the conclusion of this debate, be able to address this very fundamental problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, if a person is regarded as an employee under the tax act, surely it follows that the superannuation legislation should take the same basic definitions right through. If an employer now has to make a whole series of deductions under both federal and state legislation for every single employee, it obviously becomes a major difficulty if there is a different set of laws relating to the handling of superannuation payments under the SGL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to reach one important conclusion in this regard. In June 1983, we first started debating the fundamental issues of superannuation in this House. We seem to have never stopped debating them ever since. One point has come out very clearly: in many cases, the definitions are not clarified in the respective bills before this House. We have to wait for the regulations before we see the definitional aspects of legislation. Usually, that in turn creates difficulties with the industry as well as with employers, out of which we find another set of amendments coming before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I strongly urge the government, when it continues to bring forward superannuation legislation, to make every effort to marry that legislation with the existing tax act so that there is a continuity of definitions right across the board. Above all, it should not regard regulations as a fail-safe mechanism which only has to go to the Senate so that, regrettably, it has no impact on this House. Therefore, those who have to live by the law of this parliament are influenced by regulations over which members of this House have effectively no control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I want to address is the whole question of how this legislation affects superannuation and the effect of small SGC contributions and fees. In answer to a question from my colleague Senator Watson in an estimates committee on 11 May last year, the parliament was advised that the retirement incomes modelling task force assumed in its work that average weekly earnings growth would be 5.5 per cent; that the CPI growth would be four per cent&mdash;fortunately that has proved to be wrong to date; that the fund earning rate would be eight per cent; and that the effective rate of fund earnings would be seven per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of these assumptions, a person on the minimum amount subject to the SGC, which is $450 per month or $5,000 per year, would, like everyone else, see his or her money start to grow from day one. That is the premise upon which the whole analysis was made. However, when we take account of the task force models for the fees charged by funds and when we use the same assumptions but include a one-off joining fee of, say, $5 and a weekly administration fee of, say, $1, a person in receipt of the minimum contribution will not break even. The person will not have as much in the fund as has been contributed in real terms until contributions have been made for some 18 years, which is a fairly long time in the life employment history of most people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that, under current economic circumstances&mdash;and anybody who looks in a crystal ball at the future will probably come to the same conclusion&mdash;the presumption of long-term, continuous employment in the same industry, much less the same employer, is a doubtful prospect for the future. In other words, many people will find themselves changing jobs more frequently and many of those people will require periods out of employment in between those jobs when they are effectively being reskilled for a changing work force requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad fact of the matter is that the SGC contribution regime, as it currently operates, does not take that into account. I want to give the House a clear example of this. I refer to a person on a low income who worked for a golf club as a casual waitress. She was there for 1 1/2 years and she was paid an hourly rate of $8.98. She was made a compulsory member of the club superannuation fund because her total income was in excess of $5,000 a year. But when the employer contribution account was analysed, it was noted that, on 1 July 1993, the opening balance was $80.20. The account keeping fees were $8.80. When that person ceased employment with that club on 31 December 1993, the actual closing balance, including the account keeping fees, was not $80.20; it was $71.40. In other words, the total contribution had gone down by $8.80. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the end of the sad story. That particular person knew that she would not be going back into employment or into a fund in the foreseeable future because she was still a university student. So what happened? She sought rightly that the fund should be paid out. In so doing, she was told that, due to regulations, she would have to wait for almost one year to claim the remaining money. Furthermore, she was told that it would take five to six weeks to get processed and that it had to be signed by the trustees and go through the normal internal processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the end of the sad story. This particular person was then told that, in addition to having made those losses due to account keeping fees and so forth, it would cost her a further $25 for early release and that&mdash;this is perhaps the most cutting point of all&mdash;she would then be taxed at a further 21.4 per cent. So being taxed at 21.4 per cent of $71.40, minus the cost of the early release of $25, meant that the person was left a superannuation fund with a grand total of $46.40!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I may be wrong in thinking that this government of compassion and concern, which is always looking after the problems of the underdog and so forth, is really interested in these sorts of issues. But I have raised these problems year after year in this House, as have my colleagues, and so far there have been no effective results whatsoever. I even addressed this issue in the coalition's superannuation policy. We put in that policy the concept of retirement savings accounts. One of the specific advantages of the retirement savings account is that the 1.9 million Australian part-time workers&mdash;and that is a seasonally adjusted figure&mdash;would get a better deal than the one I have just outlined. How can the government seriously put to people on a low level of income of, say, $5,000 a year, or not much more, that they will have a viable superannuation fund when they finally leave the work force at 60 or 65 when it knows that the prospect of their getting anything is significantly undercut due to the effect of the regime as it applies to those sorts of people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation has always been of great benefit to high income earners. It was so under the old regime and it remains so under the present regime. But the whole logic of the superannuation policy is based on the premise that, when Australia's demographics catch up with us, as they certainly will over the next 30 years, the outcome will be that a higher proportion of the population will, through superannuation, have achieved a degree of financial independence. In other words, they will not have access to the age pension, which presumably will be restricted to those people as in the case I have just referred to. These people will, through no fault of their own, effectively lose access to their superannuation because of the impact of the current SGL requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of national savings, which is fundamental to this issue, was well addressed in the national saving report to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) by Dr FitzGerald in June 1993. He made a number of salient points which I would like to put on the record. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the timing of measures to strengthen national saving over the medium term will have to be set in close relationship with policy to manage the recovery. But measures to strengthen national savings over that time frame remain of key importance. Stronger national savings is an essential ingredient of any sustainable approach for pursuing ongoing healthy growth in the economy over the mid and late 1990s and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The national saving goal should be higher&mdash;to restore the underlying national saving rate over the coming decade to around the average for the past three decades, 22 to 23 per cent of gross domestic product&mdash;i.e. to lift it by about 5 per cent of GDP&mdash;and to lift the efficiency of our investment to best practice.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the most stunning fact of all was the point that Australia's national savings, at some 16 per cent of GDP in 1991-92, are at their lowest level in two generations. The government has responded to that by quite simply saying, `We'll solve the problem by having effectively a compulsory superannuation levy applied to employers with a voluntary capacity for employees to also make a contribution if they so wish'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am trying to make is that, quite clearly, the government has missed the fact that it has not considered, except in aggregate terms, the impact of the demographics of Australia against a clear and lateral analysis of what makes up the Australian work force. Any system which is meant to be universal and which affects in a negative sense anywhere near 1.9 million part-time employees must be seen for what it is; namely, a very faulty system indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We suggested in our retirement savings account concept that, instead of people under these circumstances losing $25, as this young woman is going to, they would have the right either initially or subsequently to take out a retirement savings account with a bank. The employer would make contributions to that account. The employee could make contributions to that account if he or she wished on the clear understanding that those funds would be put aside for long-term savings purposes and, ultimately, for their retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They would not be funds which could be accessed in, say, five or 10 years time. For that reason people would not suffer, as this young person did, the considerable cost of trying to take funds out of a scheme when in fact they had no choice. For every year such people remained out of the scheme, they would continue to lose, in some cases, at the rate of $1 a week in the basic quantum of the fund because they would not be contributing to it any more, and nor would the employer because those people would no longer be employed. That fund would become smaller and smaller until it finally went out altogether, except if it were making a significantly higher rate of return to cover these additional costs. The sad fact is that in recent years that has not been the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has been addressed by the banks; it has been addressed by the ACTU; and it has now been addressed by consumer organisations. Everybody is saying to the government that this is a fundamental problem affecting hundreds of thousands of Australian workers who are simply saying, `If you want us to forgo part of our wages for so-called long-term savings purposes'&mdash;FitzGerald demonstrated the need for savings and we in the opposition totally support that view&mdash;`clearly you must have an administrative system which is seen to be fair'. That is all we ask for: a system which is seen to be fair so that people do not see superannuation as a new hidden form of tax and part of a system in which money comes in one door and goes out the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad thing in this case is that it is not even going to the national good in the strict sense of the term, because it is not going to the tax office at all; it is, in fact, going to the fund managers, to the superannuation industry and to those people who are involved in the actual administration of these schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response to these proposals, whether it be retirement savings accounts or the SSAs as proposed by the banks, has been less than satisfactory. The government's position seems to be that it does not want to introduce a universal funding mechanism because that may be seen as a subsidy from the taxpayer. That is well and good. That is why we suggested the retirement savings accounts. They would give people an additional option. They could make a long-term commitment to fund their superannuation through the bank in the knowledge that they would not be taken to the cleaners every time they changed their job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people do change their jobs. Even worse, many of them have one, two or three jobs. If the actual quantum of the income that they earn from each of those individual jobs is less than $5,000, they do not have any superannuation paid at all, because their employer is not required to make a contribution to their schemes. They could have three jobs which give them a gross income of, say, $15,000 a year and effectively have no SGL cover at all because of the idiotic nonsense built into the present system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to see a system that allows people with three part-time jobs to make a contribution to their retirement savings account which affects all three incomes of $5,000 each. Then we would be talking about a sensible system. But it is deluding these people to give them the impression that somehow or other their long-term funding will be protected. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

But when we are looking at superannuation, it must be remembered that it is taxed only once. That is, if someone goes into superannuation with tax-free dollars, then the benefits are paid in taxed dollars; on the other hand, if someone goes in with after-tax dollars, then the benefits are paid tax free. We tax them only once. The government recognises that in some cases people may have to make some arrangements to accommodate that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clauses 80 and 81 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) make it clear that payments made to contractors for their labour will be treated as salaries or wages. This provision is also retrospective, with a starting date of 1 July 1992, and I remind honourable members that the bill was first introduced into the House on, I think, 14 December. It is our contention that some contractors will be faced with great hardship as a result of this new provision. Section 82AAS(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act defines eligible employment as any sort of work that results in a person being treated as an employee for SGC purposes. Also, section 82AAS(3) states that, where people are engaged in eligible employment and that eligible employment provides under 10 per cent of their total income, they can tax deduct their own contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill extends the definition of an employee and further tightens the definition of a contractor, with the result that contractors are further drawn into the employee net, as it were. The Labor government, instead of recognising the stupidity of the previous definition of a contractor and loosening the definition to reflect the reality of the labour market, has instead tightened it. This is simply a sop to Labor's mates and the union dominated superannuation schemes. It is also a reflection of Labor's inherent contempt for independent contractors who, by their very existence, facilitate much needed flexible work practices. I agree that this is not the place to debate the finer points of who qualifies as a contractor and who qualifies as an employee, except to say that the SGC definitions are clearly stricter than existing ones in tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor tells us that this finetuning of the definition of a contractor is only an administrative adjustment. It is, however, a threat to the very existence of contractors. The big sting from this bill is that even more contractors who have been putting aside money in a personal superannuation scheme for their retirement will lose tax deductibility for their future contributions. If contractors who receive only small SGC contributions were to stop making personal contributions and instead rely on the SGC, their retirement incomes would, in an overwhelming majority of cases, plummet and increase the pressures on the social security system for full or partial pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the main problem is that the definition of an employee is far too broad. The ramifications of these clauses will be very widespread. A privately practising doctor, for example, who works at a local hospital and earns 12 per cent of his income there, is now generally treated as an employee for the purposes of tax deductibility on his personal superannuation contribution. The bill further reinforces this bad situation. The government should now be fixing this problem but instead is making it worse. This occurs because the Income Tax Assessment Act defines an employee by using the definition provided in the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act. This measure establishes an environment in which genuine contractors will be discouraged from providing for their own retirement. I am going to leave my remarks there because my time is up but I will continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further matter of great concern is the retrospective nature of the provision that backdates the application of clauses 80 and 81 to 1 July 1992. It is yet to be seen what the ramifications of this measure will be but retrospectivity in this circumstance is clearly a denial of administrative fair play by the government. The situation is iniquitous and we refuse to support such a measure. Coalition members do not oppose the bill, as we have already indicated. However, we do have very strong reservations about the way in which the SGC discriminates against many casual, part-time and itinerant workers, and further tightens the noose around the necks of contractors who want to provide for their own retirement in a way which is much more rewarding than under the SGC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Labor Party does not give employees the right to select funds or transfer their entitlements from fund to fund, employees&mdash;particularly low income earners whose superannuation savings are held in several accounts&mdash;must pay several sets of fees and charges leviable by each fund. The choice to consolidate benefits into one fund has to come. It has to come and, as sure as night follows day, it will happen. Why not now? Ultimately, these low income earners are paying for Labor's inability to develop a more flexible superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have outlined possible policy prescriptions that the government should be examining, though it is hard to imagine it supporting retirement savings accounts or freedom of choice in picking a superannuation fund. Labor will never allow freedom of choice because of its incestuous relationship with the trade union movement and the trade union dominated superannuation funds. We then have the case of contractors who, for the purpose of the SGC, are defined as employees and are increasingly defined as employees in clauses 80 and 81. It appears that Labor's justification in proposing these two clauses is not to extend the level of superannuation coverage but to reduce the numbers of contractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a move will, in many cases, result in reducing the levels of superannuation benefits available to contractors, because those who are subject to the SGC will lose tax deductibility for personal schemes and will simply stop making personal contributions. As honourable members would readily appreciate, this will have a long-term detrimental impact on future social security expenditure. The government desperately needs to address the problems that the SGC holds for low income earners and recognise those faced by contractors now. I advise honourable members that we will be dividing on these clauses. </PARA>

I remind the Assistant Treasurer, who was not here during the main part of the debate, that my view is that this action by government is simply one more link in the chain of the government's intent to try to destroy the contracting and subcontracting system in Australia, one which I have noted and believe strongly to be of great benefit to Australians and the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people out there who wish to be independent, who wish to do their own thing, who do not really desire to be told how they must work, how long they must work, for what wages they must work, who would like to work for themselves and receive reward for their effort. That system has produced great efficiencies in Australia, but this government link by link adds to the chain that will ensnare all of our contractors so that eventually we will no longer have contractors and subcontractors. All those who work&mdash;who do useful work, who allow us to be here, who pay the taxes that pay our salaries and the wages of those who keep this parliament running&mdash;are under attack from this government when it attacks the free enterprise contracting system. There is no question about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer ought to take note of the words of the honourable member for Curtin about changing the definition of what is a contractor for tax purposes because it has further impact down the line. It not only affects people who hire those contractors in terms of the administrative burden they have in dealing with the superannuation guarantee charge but also brings into play state taxation systems in terms of workers compensation, long service leave and payroll tax. That means that a contractor, an independent businessman or woman, may now be caught up in another tax chain as well because of this definition. It will be impossible for many small contractors, small business people, who work for many employers but who largely supply labour and not materials, to justify any longer under the taxation laws that they are independent contractors. They will wind up having bits and pieces of superannuation money in all kinds of pots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have brought before the House the example of a bricklayer who might well work for 52 different home builders in 52 weeks. He will then wind up with 52 different superannuation funds on top of his own personal superannuation which now will not be tax deductible. At the end of 12 months, 24 months or 36 months those 52 little pots will be worth nothing because the administrative charges will have wiped them out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Towards the end of my speech at the second reading stage, I made some remarks which are relevant to clause 88. I had given an example of a hypothetical worker, earning $600 per month and whose employer's superannuation contribution would be about $18 a month for an annual benefit of $216. I pointed out that there is a contribution tax of 15 per cent out of that $216 and an administration charge of $50. The point I arrived at was that, of the original $216 only $134 was left, $82 having been gobbled up by taxes and administration fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is even worse for workers who have several jobs, either concurrently or at different times of the year, because they have to pay the administration fee for each of the superannuation funds they are in and subscribed to by each different employer. Many of these amounts in schemes into which contributions are made by employers often lie dormant after a casual worker has moved to another job, as we all know. These dormant superannuation contributions, if more than $500, or less than $500 but not withdrawn from the superannuation fund, will continue to be charged an administration fee of approximately $50 a year or, at best, a dormant account fee of $26 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also the exit fees which apply when workers may decide to rationalise their superannuation holdings. These provisions penalise women proportionately more than they do men as they are more inclined to work in part-time positions at occupations that are also lower paid, according to accepted statistics. Some might wonder why a few hundred dollars is such a big deal, but, naturally, if it was not it would hardly be worthwhile continuing with an SGC that discriminates against working men and women on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One option for the government would be to increase the income threshold from $450 per month after which an SGC contribution is made. The government could also consider the availability of retirement savings accounts for workers on low incomes. Such an approach would reduce the level of erosion of superannuation contributions which is prevalent in conventional superannuation schemes. The other option would be for contributors to select the fund of their choice and transfer their funds to another fund if they are not satisfied with its performance. As I already indicated in talking to another clause, this is unlikely because Labor is committed to supporting the superannuation schemes that are essentially award based and are controlled in part by appointees of the union movement. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in his response to the second reading debate acknowledged difficulties of the kind I am now canvassing. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All these problems were also acknowledged by the then Treasurer in August 1993. He announced that he would give high priority to resolving the problems experienced by casual and itinerant workers under the SGC scheme. To date, Labor has done nothing except give vague assurances that it is aware of the problem. We are sick of assurances. Glib words such as `we are in transition' and the like just are not good enough. The scheme has been going long enough. The government has acknowledged the problems; it is simply failing to act.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret that I have not been able to speak extensively on this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992. There are a number of areas which concern me. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) will be aware of my having raised with him last year this very matter of itinerant and part-time workers and their superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a most wasteful and debilitating process. The Assistant Treasurer ought to be aware of it and he ought to be able to get his act into gear quickly enough to resolve it. The superannuation industry and employee groups have been raising this with the government intensively, to my knowledge, for the last six months and less intensively for over a year. How does this thing work? What it means is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! I feel constrained to remind the honourable member for Mitchell that we are dealing with the remainder of the bill which is from clause 82 onwards. His remarks are wide ranging over the whole of the bill, and that is not appropriate at this particular time. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am dealing with the specifics in that, because of the nature of this legislation, it is obvious to me that the government has failed to meet the exactitude of requests which the parliament has previously made of it. I am indebted to my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) for indicating that the flat dollar rate contribution for part-time employees is in chapter 13 of the explanatory memorandum, the superannuation guarantee amendments, on pages 94, 95 and 97.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard, the government's slowness to act has left many employees in a very difficult situation. What has happened, in fact, is that employers have continued to make a contribution to the scheme. Employees think that they are getting more money than they actually are. They think their funds are going into some superannuation pool that will benefit them. Actually, they are going into a pool the cost of which is higher than the actual contribution that is being paid by part-time employees, or their employer on their behalf. Where do they come out of this? That bill, against the employee's contribution, is added up over successive periods of employment. The employees never get in front; they always have a notional debt to the superannuation company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has known this. The industry has suggested a simple remedy of lifting the barrier and making $600 a week a minimum figure for employment so that the contribution really covers the cost of administration. Many part-time and itinerant workers have jobs such as part-time teachers at TAFE colleges and adult education centres; then, of course, we have more commonly considered itinerant workers, such as fruit pickers and so on. All of them represent costly additions to the employer. The cost of employment is increased by this process, and nobody benefits. The superannuation company does not benefit because it does not cover the cost of its administration; the employee benefits not one jot; and the employer has extra costs. The government has continued with this program for months and months and months after being made aware of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to know what it is doing&mdash;give us a timetable. People out there want to know what the intention is. It is not good enough to be told that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) will come in here in May with an alternative. It should be in this legislation; it should be part of the amendments we are debating today. If the government were competent, it would have done that. The solution is simple.

<PARA>This bill provides for a range of mainly administrative amendments to be made to the Patents Act 1990, the Trade Marks Act 1955 and the Designs Act 1906. These acts form the legislative basis of Australia's national industrial property system, a system which plays an important role in our nation's economic prosperity and growth. Patent and design laws encourage technological advancement and stimulate industrial development. Trademark laws, which assist in ensuring that the goods and services of one enterprise are distinguishable from those of other enterprises, enable orderly marketing and benefit both producers and consumers alike. The bill also amends sunset clauses in the Industry, Research and Development Act 1986 in line with the government's decision to extend the competitive grants scheme of the industry innovation program until the end of 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like briefly to detail the legislative changes made to these acts by the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1992, the organisation that was known as the Australian Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Offices became the Australian Industrial Property Organisation. Along with the name change came some structural changes. AIPO is a division of the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. The divisional head, who holds the non-statutory position of director-general, has, in addition to his statutory functions as the commissioner of patents, registrar of trademarks and registrar of designs, the responsibility for the overall administration of AIPO. As part of the structural changes I referred to, greater emphasis is to be placed on the management responsibilities of the director-general as distinct from the statutory roles of commissioner of patents, registrar of trademarks and registrar of designs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes relevant changes to the above acts to enable the statutory functions of the commissioner of patents and the registrar of designs to be carried out by the head of the Patent and Designs Offices, and the functions of the registrar of trademarks to be carried out by the head of the Trade Marks Office. This will help the director-general to concentrate on the overall financial and general management of AIPO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other minor changes allow the above statutory office holders to delegate their powers to staff working in the relevant offices. The delegation of powers, however, will be limited to staff designated in the regulations made under each of the patents, designs and trademarks acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a signatory to a number of multilateral international conventions dealing with the protection of industrial property. One of these is the multilateral Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. Australia has also entered into a number of bilateral arrangements that impose similar obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each piece of patent, trademarks and designs legislation makes provision in relation to recognising a right of priority for what are called `convention applications'. This means that an application for a patent, trademark or a design in a `convention country' will, subject to the fulfilment of certain requirements, be regarded as if it had been filed in Australia on the same day as it was filed in the particular convention country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 17 August 1993, a memorandum of understanding on the protection of industrial property rights between the Australian Commerce and Industry Office and the Taiwan Bureau of National Standards was signed. Amongst other things, the MOU provides for a mutual right of priority. For AIPO to meet its obligations as an `implementing authority' under the MOU, regulations are required to declare Taiwan to be a convention country for the purposes of the patents, trademarks and designs acts. The regulation making power to provide for this is available in the Patents Act, but not in the designs or trademarks acts. These latter acts only provide for regulations to be made declaring convention countries with a view to the fulfilment of a treaty, or other like instrument between the Commonwealth and another country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An MOU in Australia does not have the status of a treaty. Changes are therefore proposed to the Trade Marks Act and the Designs Act which will allow for regulations to be made declaring a country to be a convention country for the purposes of those acts, as is currently provided for in the Patents Act. These changes will remove the limitation of the declaration being made with a view to fulfilling a treaty or other like instrument between the Commonwealth and another country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, changes are proposed to the Designs Act which will provide regulation making power to allow the Registrar of Designs, either on his own motion or on request, to correct an entry in the Register of Designs for the purposes of correcting a clerical error or obvious mistake. Currently, the only way such an error can be corrected is by the application of the registered owner of the design to the Federal Court or a state supreme court. This is not only costly, and therefore a disincentive for owners to have errors corrected, but also puts an unnecessary impost on our already heavily loaded courts. These changes require no net additional expenditure. The amendments to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 accommodate the government's decision to extend the competitive grants scheme of the industry innovation program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a two-part strategy to encourage private business expenditure on research and development. The strategy consists of the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development, which is now a permanent feature of the tax system, supplemented by direct grants to firms under the industry innovation program. Business expenditure on research and development in 1991-92 reached a record $2.2 billion. In real terms this represents almost a doubling of business investment in R&amp;D over the last decade. Small and medium enterprises often lack the substantive cash flow to take advantage of the tax concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry innovation program grants scheme plays a valuable role in providing assistance to help these firms develop their capacity to undertake technological innovation. In 1994-95 approximately $40 million will be available to assist projects under the industry innovation program. A further $20 million will be available in the first half of 1995-96. I am pleased that the government is able to continue to assist Australian firms to undertake research and development through this comprehensive package of measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members would know, the bill as introduced in this House includes amendments made by the Senate on the motion of Senator Spindler for the Australian Democrats. During consideration of the bill in detail in this House, however, the government will be moving further minor amendments that will complete the picture in the spirit of the Senate amendments and clear up any possible unintended effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A detailed explanation of the changes made by the bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum and the supplementary explanatory memorandum to this bill. I commend this bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum and the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus bill which amends a number of acts and programs falling within the industry, technology and regional development portfolio. My remarks this afternoon will address most of the proposals contained in the bill. However, my colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the shadow minister for science, technology and export development, will address the amendments to the Industry Research and Development Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the amendments proposed in the bill are the consequence of the amalgamation of the Australian Patents Office and the Australian Trade Marks and Designs Office into the Australian Industrial Property Organisation, otherwise known as AIPO. The two offices amalgamated in 1992. AIPO is quite important to Australian industry. Its mission is to provide industrial property protection rights which enhance innovation, competitiveness and trade. In essence, AIPO protects new ideas and inventions. This is crucial for business. In doing this, it has responsibility for administering the Patents Act, the Trade Marks Act and the Designs Act, as well as a host of associated regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AIPO is also a receiving office, an international searching authority and an international preliminary examining authority under the Patents Cooperation Treaty. As part of the new arrangements, AIPO operates as an autonomous body on a cost recovery basis. As of July last year, it no longer receives any government funding. Accordingly, the management  structure has been changed to reflect AIPO's new objectives. The director-general takes on a greater management and administrative role, while his powers to approve and register patents, trademarks and industrial designs are delegated to a second tier of management. This bill seeks to put into place the framework for the delegation of these powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second but unrelated amendment allows for the correction of minor administrative or clerical errors made by AIPO staff in the course of registering designs, trademarks and patents. Currently, administrative areas can be amended only by application of the registered owner to the Federal Court or a state supreme court. The government advises that it considers this to be both costly and time consuming and that it acts as a disincentive to having these details corrected. Errors which may be corrected under the new provisions include the names and addresses of applicants, the details of registration, and notification of the assignment or transmission. I have been assured that in no way does this bill provide for any substantive changes to be made to trademarks, patents or designs, including the date of registration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AIPO has been kept quite busy in recent times. For example, in the last financial year, 28,736 applications for patents were filed. That is an increase of 5.6 per cent on the previous year. In 1992-93, 24,391 applications for trademarks were filed. That is an increase of 6.7 per cent on the previous year. In 1992-93, 4,018 applications for registered designs were lodged. That is an increase of 6.5 per cent on the previous year. This appears to indicate that Australian industry is becoming more innovative and creative. This is a good thing, especially if it translates into the development of successful products which capture new markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second key proposal in this bill relates to the protection of industrial property. Australia is currently a signatory to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. The Paris convention was first established in 1883. Australia became a party to that convention in 1907, joining other countries such as Great Britain, most of Europe, the United States, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, Trinidad and South Africa. The Paris convention governs the industrial property rights of individuals, of member countries and of all the other nations which are signatories to the convention. The convention applies to industrial designs, patents and trademarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic principle of protection afforded under the convention is that of national treatment. This means that each member country must grant the same protection to owners of patents granted in other signatory countries as it would grant to those of its own nationals. The convention does this by establishing a system of priority. A person filing an application for registration of a design in a member country has the right of priority to file a design application in any other member country simultaneously or within six months of the date of lodgment of the first application. The applicant may therefore obtain the same priority date in all member countries without having to make simultaneous or individual applications in all countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention also seeks to ensure a similarity, if not uniformity, of rules and obligations relating to the registration and validity of patents, trademarks and industrial design across all member countries. The scope of the protection offered is limited by each signatory country's own domestic laws. The convention deals with issues of importation and compulsory licensing of patents in such a way as to allow domestic law to regulate much of the detail while still having overall regard for the protective nature of the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, however, a range of countries which are not signatories to the Paris convention. Reciprocal protection arrangements with these countries have been documented in a memorandum of understanding and approved by the Governor-General. This bill seeks to circumvent this rather cumbersome process by introducing regulations which will allow non-convention countries with whom reciprocal rights have been negotiated to be declared convention countries for legislative purposes. A similar provision is already a feature of the Patents Act. The bill also seeks to extend the termination date for the discretionary and generic technology grants scheme from 30 June 1994 to 31 December 1995. As I have noted earlier, this measure will be discussed in more detail by my colleague the shadow minister for science, technology and export development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since we are debating the needs of Australian industry today, it would be remiss of me not to make some comments on the forthcoming industry statement. As I travel around the  country talking to manufacturers, service providers and their representative associations, I hear the same things. These messages have also been given to the government, and I believe the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Senator Cook) must address them in his forthcoming statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments made to me fall into three basic categories: firstly, concerns about high government taxes, charges and other business input costs; secondly, problems with an inflexible labour market; and, thirdly, lack of micro-economic reform. According to the latest KPMG Peat Marwick manufacturing survey, these problems are widespread and are a major barrier to clients increasing their level of investment. Interestingly, they are also among the issues nominated by clients as being the areas in which the government has had little success in improving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the survey a whopping 60 per cent of respondents nominated high labour on-costs as being a major barrier to new investment. In fact, the greatest number of respondents suggested that this was the key factor holding back their investment. Fifty per cent of respondents noted the high labour on-costs were also a significant deterrent. Government regulation was nominated by 50 per cent of respondents as being a barrier to investment while excessive regulation was found to be a major deterrent by nearly 40 per cent. Inefficiencies in the transport and waterfront were also of concern to around a quarter of all respondents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results were equally dismal in terms of government performance in these areas. Micro-economic reform on the waterfront and in transport was seen by respondents as delivering benefits of only 0.1 per cent. The survey indicated that industrial relations reform, such as it was, delivers gains of only 0.5 per cent. Once we move to labour on-costs the results become even more interesting. The respondents said that the training levy represented a 0.6 per cent impediment to their business while the superannuation levy hinders their business to the tune of 1.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures are not a ringing endorsement of the government. Indeed, to the contrary, they are a firm condemnation of the government's lack of action in these areas. The challenge for the government in framing its forthcoming industry statement is to address the sentiments underlying these results as well as a wider range of concerns expressed by business in their submissions to the minister. Put simply, the government must take up the challenge to create a better environment for business. There is no doubt that the industry statement is crucial to business and that industry is placing great store by it. The Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation said in a recent newsletter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of the Industry Policy Statement can hardly be exaggerated&mdash;it is vital for this country's future and is something PATEFA has been calling for years.</PARA>
<PARA>Industry is seeking big things from this statement. This process has been actively encouraged by the former minister for industry and is reflected in comments made in industry submissions. The following comments made by the Metal Trades Industry Association in its submission to the minister are representative of the thoughts of industry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seeks the development of a policy framework which assists Australian industry to maximise the opportunities and manage risks in doing business in the international marketplace in which it now finds itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It defines industry policy very broadly, to encapsulate `any government action which seeks to remove obstacles to industry efficiency and competitiveness', and to emphasise the importance of linkages between various areas of policy to achieving our national objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It evaluates industry policy to its crucial position in the national policy agenda, in recognition of the fact that as effective and coherent industry policy is essential to generating more wealth, higher living standards, new jobs and new confidence in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>The New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures also put industry's thoughts quite succinctly in a recent newsletter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see the Minister's Industry Policy Statement as a unique opportunity to establish a joint venture between government and industry which will guide the growth of the manufacturing sector into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe the industry strategy must be approached as a true partnership. We in fact describe it as a joint venture between stockholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context we think it should set out what is required of governments and their agencies, industry, employees, others in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If all these people have a commitment to this strategy, they will use it to continuously focus on the agreed outcome. It will also help mobilise support for industry development and rebuild confidence in the productive sector of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will also require governments to alter the way they view their roles. In particular, the way programs are made more accessible and their delivery better integrated; and regulations are developed and administered on a best practice manner.</PARA>
<PARA>My greatest fear about this statement is that industry will be disappointed. The previous minister for industry, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), placed a lot of emphasis on this statement. He told a meeting of the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am determined to see this government do whatever it can to give Australian industry every assistance to improve its performance and achieve export success.</PARA>
<PARA>In a speech to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry the former minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Statement will provide a stable, predictable framework for business. Its aim will be to foster a competitive, dynamic business environment.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister went on to say that the statement will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . consider the need for additional measures to ensure that Australian companies continue their success in international markets.</PARA>
<PARA>The former minister noted that he favoured a `pragmatic, real world but light touch approach'. In particular, the minister noted that he was supportive of a sectoral approach to industry policy. He suggested that it was appropriate that government look at the impediments facing different sectors of industry and develop individual strategies to overcome them. The minister even went so far as to nominate 13 sectors, namely: agrifood, construction, petrochemicals, marine, light metals, renewable energy, forest products, aviation, music and audio visual, telecommunications and information technology, environmental, health services, and pharmaceutical industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry generally endorsed this approach. It recognised that some of the issues facing the food processing sector, such as labelling and market access, are different from those facing the telecommunications industry. Businesses in the construction industry face a different set of circumstances again. The previous minister also flagged some quite considerable spending initiatives. He put a figure of around $200 million on proposals to be contained in the statement. The former minister also suggested that a stick and carrot approach be adopted to ensure that superannuation funds invest more of their money in small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, Senator Peter Cook, has poured cold water on most of the plans of his predecessor. In fact, he has gone even further by distancing himself from the policies of his predecessor and hosing down the expectations of business. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, Senator Cook told a recent meeting that `he had scrapped the almost-completed industry statement of his predecessor, Mr Alan Griffiths'. In a very clear warning to business, Senator Cook said on the night of his swearing in that `the era of the hand-out mentality is dead'. Reports of his address to a recent meeting of small business organisations confirm this. These reports suggest that the minister has abandoned his predecessor's sectoral approach. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper reported on 17 February that Senator Cook had told the meeting that he `was not a fan of sectoral planning'. The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sources at the meeting said Senator Cook made it clear he did not support sectoral plans for his industry statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is seen as a clear rejection of the framework of Mr Griffiths for 13 industry development plans to tackle specific impediments to growth and to offer targeted assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reported similar comments, again quoting Senator Cook as saying, `I am not a fan of sectoral planning'. In the same address Senator Cook scotched all reports that the statement would cost $200 million. According to reports, he told the meeting he would be `very surprised if the statement costs anywhere near the $200 million figure floated in the media'. I understand the minister went on to say that he believed the statement should be judged on its contents, not its cost. Senator Cook has also distanced himself from the former minister's plan to encourage superannuation funds to invest in small business. Instead he favours a revamp of the failed pooled development funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that most of the initiatives which were sought by industry have been disregarded, it is prudent to ask just what industry can expect from the forthcoming statement. As I suggested earlier, industry can be expected, in my view, to be disappointed. I believe the statement will be full of platitudes and motherhood. It will be lacking in the real initiatives needed by industry. Micro reform, which has been proven by the KPMG survey to be critical to industry, is likely to be referred to, but it is also likely to be flick-passed to the state and local governments to take care of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook is on record as saying that he believes that the Commonwealth has a role in micro-reform, but that role is primarily to lead with the real implementation at the state and local government level. Labour market reform and labour on-costs are unlikely to even rate a mention. We can expect some comments and proposals to assist manufacturers and small businesses who want to export. Specifically, we can anticipate proposals to further encourage benchmarking and world best practice. This is a very good thing and should be welcomed. Benchmarking and meeting world best practice are important elements in making our firms internationally competitive. But they are all useless if our firms are rendered uncompetitive because of high taxes and charges, low productivity and high labour on-costs. These are the real issues which must be addressed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the lack of real reform in the statement, my concern is that it will soften up industry for tax increases to be announced in the May budget. I am concerned that any benefits given in the statement will be taken away in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members on both sides will be aware that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have both failed to rule out a budget increase in business taxes. I cannot emphasise enough the detrimental impact which this would have on industry, especially manufacturers who are moving into export markets. Australian industry's  competitiveness is fragile enough as it is. Any extra costs would be devastating, not only to exporters but to our domestic firms' ability and willingness to invest and create jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I would like to reiterate my challenge to the government to deliver a genuine industry statement&mdash;one which addresses the real issues of concern to business and which proposes viable solutions. The challenge for government is to avoid the approach of the past which has seen it deliver statements which promise much but deliver little. Australian industry, especially with regard to our manufacturers, has great potential. The government now has the opportunity to enable them to realise that potential. My plea is that this opportunity not go to waste. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the passage of the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill through the House and to support the comments of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment bill is an omnibus bill which provides a range of administrative amendments to the Patents Act 1990, the Trade Marks Act 1955 and the Designs Act 1906. It is interesting that government is continually having to review legislation that has been on the books and can build up and often create difficulties. I am sure everyone would agree that we have moved a long way since 1906. One of the things that this government is doing is continually sorting out some of these old acts and revisiting them to get them right up to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation of statutory functions is a major part of this bill, as has been mentioned. The Australian Industrial Property Organisation is a division of the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. The Director-General of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation has control over statutory functions in the role of commissioner of patents, registrar of trademarks and registrar of designs. To enable the director-general to place greater emphasis on his management responsibilities, the bill amends the above acts to delegate the director-general's statutory functions to be carried out by the head of each of the relevant offices. This will enable the director-general to concentrate on the overall financial and general management of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation. I think it is important that we consider this revamping of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation, because it is in line with the sort of structure reform that this government is making in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiatives in reforming a number of organisations into the revamped Australian Industrial Property Organisation were to deal with the following issues. Firstly, the policies and structures needed to adapt more flexibly to customer demands, as well as meet the objectives of the government's industrial property program. Secondly, there needed to be financial structures that would not only impose disciplines but also allow greater operational freedom. Thirdly, there needed to be an organisational culture that would change attitudes and outlook, to meet the challenges of a more commercially orientated organisation&mdash;which is, of course, what the government has required of AIPO. These changes were to include the devolution of responsibilities; greater acceptance of risk management principles; greater alignment between responsibility and accountability and, therefore, a focus on performance; a management approach that would give greater emphasis to commercial considerations and a results orientated ethos; and a clearer corporate identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These structural changes will position the Australian Industrial Property Organisation to provide better value for money in delivering its services. This has been necessary because of the requirement that AIPO operate under a full cost recovery regime which was instituted in 1986. So the government is requiring of its own organisations what it obviously would encourage business to do. It creates a clear link between what AIPO does and what it earns. It promotes a greater focus on the revenue side of the business and provides incentives for AIPO to better exploit the assets at its disposal. So here we have a reform of an important government sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several other administrative matters contained in this bill. One is the extension of eligibility as a convention country. The current patent, trademark and design legislation recognises a right of priority for convention applications. These are applications made in countries which are signatory to international conventions dealing with the protection of industrial property. This priority enables an application for a patent, trademark or design in a convention country to be treated as if it had been lodged in Australia on the same day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to the Designs Act and the Trade Marks Act enables regulations to be made which declare a country to be a convention country, where a bilateral agreement has been entered into concerning the protection of industrial property rights. This would bring these acts into line with the Patents Act, which already makes provision for these purposes. It should be said that these acts help Australia obtain international credibility. They form the legislative basis of Australia's national property system&mdash;a system which is a crucial factor in our nation's economic prosperity and growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another item in this bill is the correction of entries on the register of designs. This is an amendment which streamlines the administrative process and gives it greater practicality. Rather than needing someone to reapply to correct an obvious clerical error or mistake, this amendment enables the registrar of designs to correct an entry in the register for the purpose of correcting that clerical error or mistake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Patent and design laws encourage technological advancement and stimulate industrial development. The federal government has a two-stage policy to encourage business expenditure on research and development. Firstly, the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development is now a permanent feature of the taxation system. We have already seen the success of this tax incentive, with over $2 billion every year being spent by business on research and development. In real terms, it represents almost a doubling of business investment in research and development over the past decade. This has been an area where business in this country has been rather lax in the past, and whatever we can do to encourage research onto the agenda of business is not only going to be in the interests of those businesses, making them more competitive and more successful, but it is also going to make our export initiatives more successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, under the industry innovation program, direct grants to firms are a further feature of the government's approach to encouraging research and development expansion. This program enables grants to be made to small and medium enterprises to give them a chance to develop their capacity to undertake technological innovation, and was referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development in his opening remarks. In 1994-95, the program will allow for approximately $40 million in grants to small to medium enterprises, so this is a very important initiative for those businesses that are too small to really benefit from the 150 per cent tax assistance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer a little more to the industry innovation program. The IIP provides direct support for industrial R&amp;D and associated activities. It supports all the key areas of industry activity in which the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development has an interest. The grants elements are brought together to improve client access to available assistance and they involve introducing better articulated and more market focused eligibility and merit criteria, streamlining the application process, making decisions more transparent and providing improved client feedback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These types of initiatives are very important when we look at regional development, because one of the issues for businesses in regional areas of Australia is that they feel rather remote from information about the initiatives that are available to assist them to do business better. If they have difficulties in communicating with different areas of government, they usually give up because it is too difficult and too time consuming, as they are focused on the day-to-day operations of running their business and trying to make it effective. One of the issues that we do need to look at is providing effective opportunities to make sure that business enterprises in regional Australia have quick and easy access to those issues. One of the innovations that have been developed in the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and Energy is the idea of the one-stop shop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we look towards our industry paper and our white paper on employment and the response to the Kelty task force, one of the issues we do need to focus on is providing much more effective access to information. This does not necessarily mean a vast expansion of bureaucracy; in fact, I think that is not the way this government is operating. It means providing for facilities in regional areas where small business and local government can have coordinated access to information about industry programs, programs that will assist them to invest in their businesses, to obtain more effective information on export opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) made mention of labour on-costs. I believe there are many other issues that impact on small business. Recently in Rockhampton I and the local tourism and development organisation, the Capricorn Tourism Development Organisation, developed a seminar to allow business and other community organisations to provide some feedback on the government's green paper. It was disappointing that very few business organisations chose to avail themselves of that opportunity, because one of the things this government has done is consult, and all the reports that I referred to earlier have been the result of extensive nationwide consultation. As a result of this apparent lack of interest, I sent out a short check list to 300 business organisations in the Rockhampton area and was delighted to get a very positive response. I had simply asked them to fax back the check list so that it was not a time consuming issue. As I said, time is money in small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will run through that check list. While it certainly does not claim to be a representative survey or provide sophisticated sampling techniques, it was an opportunity to get some feedback from business. I was interested in some of the responses, which will find their way back into the response to the green paper. About 50 people responded out of 300, which I thought was a pretty good response rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first question related to the putting on of new staff&mdash;that is, about developing and expanding new business&mdash;and whether access to credit was a factor in their decision to put on new staff. The majority said no, which surprised me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for concern about the strength of the economic recovery, we got about a fifty-fifty response. Concerning evidence of a pick-up in demand for the goods and services of their business, once again there was a fifty-fifty response. Information about improvement of profit margins in other businesses in the region did not seem to be a concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of hiring new staff was indeed expressed as a concern. On issues such as superannuation contributions we got a fifty-fifty response. There is certainly concern about award wage levels, but we would expect that to be the case. On fringe benefits taxes, et cetera, there was a fifty-fifty response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of penalty rates there was a majority response indicating that that was a factor, and we can understand that in a small to medium sized business. Interestingly enough, there was no definitive response on the subject of government red tape and they were able to differentiate between local, state and federal governments; in fact, federal government red tape was not seen as an issue. Information about training initiatives and social security assistance did not seem to be a problem but there was some concern about the effectiveness and the helpfulness of the CES, and particularly the attitude of prospective employees was seen as an issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So across a range of issues I do not believe we can say that small business has a particular view, but as a government we need to be out there consulting with them. I suggest that one of the most effective ways we can do this is to have a unit or a task force that moves from the centre of policy development in either Canberra or Brisbane and regularly goes out to the regions providing information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to an innovation in the Central Queensland area, the international business exchange organisation of Central Queensland, which is the idea of our University of Central Queensland vice-chancellor, the very proactive Jeff Wilson. That organisation has been supported very favourably by the state Department of Business, Industry and Regional Development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of this organisation is to bring export information to businesses in Central Queensland. Towards the end of last year a very successful seminar was held on the Capricorn coast where a number of trade specialists were able to talk to business organisations, large and small, from the Central Queensland area about the fantastic development opportunities that exist in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After getting some information from the university this morning I am pleased to say that next week in Rockhampton this organisation will be hosting two speakers from Austrade, the commissioner for the South Pacific region and the Queensland commissioner. Austrade has also been very supportive of the initiative and it is this sort of organisation that I would hope that our government will be providing more effective support for. It is getting together those people in the regions who have involvement in research and development, in business, and who are focused on value adding for export potential, that will really make our regions take off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many proposals that are coming forward into the government's white paper, the industry statement, and in response to the Kelty task force. I believe that the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) will be very much across the issues that are of concern to the honourable member for Forrest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most effective aspects of this government's track record, apart from its vision and its innovation, is its ability to bring together these differing strands. This government is able to develop creative and innovative solutions to the sorts of difficulties that face us as we pick up on the upswing in the economic cycle and continue to improve our position as a competitive trading partner in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Industry Extension Service is just one of the very important initiatives of the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. I would like to remind honourable members just what those programs are doing. We cannot just be negative about what the oncosts are. We have to help businesses become more effective, more cost efficient in their own terms, and we have to help in providing them with managerial expertise. One problem in the regional areas of Australia is access to new ideas for industry management to make those businesses, from their own point of view, more efficient. NIES is very effective in helping to promote business plans and in making sure that businesses are using their most effective resource&mdash;their work force&mdash;effectively and efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is conscious of the concerns raised by the opposition but, more importantly, at a policy level it is making the changes that are outlined in some of the technical amendments to these bills to make Australian industry more competitive, more export oriented, so that we very effectively take our place in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>

The amendment to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 extends the competitive grants schemes of the industry innovation program by 18 months, from 30 June 1994 to 31 December 1995. The primary objective of the industry innovation program is to encourage private sector investment in research and development, and innovative activity generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That program is designed to facilitate market driven innovation, leading to the successful commercialisation of new products, services, processes and systems. Administered by the Industry Research and Development Board, the major financial component of the industry innovation program is the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development. This program was described by a recent Bureau of Industry Economics report as `the major program' aimed at encouraging technological innovation in Australia. The concession was introduced in 1985, and the coalition supports it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The range of competitive grants that make up the other part of the industry innovation program, such as the discretionary and generic technology grants dealt with by this particular amendment, are in place as complements to the tax concession. Formerly known collectively as the grants for industry research and development, or GIRD scheme, these grants aim to provide the initial impetus `toward creating a competitive advantage for relatively small, technology based companies'. The continuation of the industry innovation program arising from this amendment will involve provision for new projects in 1994-95 up to a value of $40 million, while a further $20 million will be available in the first half of 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In today's global market, a strong investment in science, technology and innovative practices generally is a principal means by which Australia can secure competitive advantage. Given the strong investment in technology by our main international competitors, such investment by Australia is essential to avoid competitive disadvantage and our slipping further behind. A country that recognises this must have a national strategy to maximise its capacity in these critical areas, underpinning future industrial development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, despite the rhetoric mouthed by the government, such a strategy is conspicuously absent. Time and again we have seen the fruits of Australia's excellent efforts in scientific research and technological development leave our shores to be profitably developed overseas. There is a widespread disillusionment about the limited opportunities available for Australia's youngest and brightest scientists and technologists. The brain drain has seen many of our top minds pursue their careers in other countries because of the uncertain future offered at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the past decade, Australia has remained firmly stuck somewhere near the bottom of the OECD ladder in terms of its industry effort in research and development. In fact, the Bureau of Industry Economics report, to which I referred earlier, found that even with the recent lift in business expenditure on research and development, Australia has languished at 17th out of 24 OECD countries in this area since the mid-1980s. Entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">R&amp;D, innovation and competitiveness</EMPHASIS>, the report of the Bureau of Industry Economics highlights the limited impact the 150 per cent tax concession is having on improving our performance in technological development. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the report, since its inception the tax concession `has not increased the stock of consistent R&amp;D performers'. The report states that any increase in business expenditure on research and development `has thus only allowed Australia to maintain its relative (low) ranking'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It points out that only 1,000 out of 500,000 or more Australian companies are consistent R&amp;D performers. Importantly, it also notes that the majority of private sector R&amp;D is concentrated in relatively large firms across only a small number of industries, such as computer software, mining, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there has been some change in this trend in more recent times, with small and medium sized enterprises increasing their R&amp;D effort, again this increase has taken place only in a few industries. For example, the report states that rapid growth in R&amp;D expenditure in computer software accounts for nearly 40 per cent of overall growth in business R&amp;D between 1984-85 and 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the critical link between innovation and the economic growth of nations, Australia's relatively low and narrow effort in this regard is cause for considerable concern. The story is even grimmer when read from the South-East Asian and east Asian perspective. According to the first UNESCO world science report released just last month, countries such as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea have overtaken Australia in their technological effort. Development of their own ideas and those of other people has become a way of life for our chief competitors in the region. The UNESCO report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comparisons with the newly industrialised countries cause Australia's R&amp;D to be seen as inadequate for sustaining economic development or increasing international competitiveness. Australia's private industrial R&amp;D is still considered too low.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's manufacturing sector has had one of the lowest comparative levels of growth in the OECD in the past 15 years, despite recent growth in exports of elaborately transformed manufactures. This growth has been off a very low base. As a merchandise exporter, Australia fell from 18th in 1980 to 22nd in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our export performance still remains far below that required to correct the alarming foreign debt. Yesterday's balance of payments showing a $1.26 billion deficit is a timely reminder that as a nation we are still living beyond our means on a grand scale. Our relative decline as a world trading nation highlights the fact that under this government we remain uncompetitive in too many areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background paper on micro-economic reform, released by the Economic Planning Advisory Council late last week, shows just how uncompetitive we really are. The paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic effects of micro-economic reform</EMPHASIS>, outlines the enormous benefits in terms of economic growth, improved living standards and employment generation that could be gained through a comprehensive program of further micro-economic reform. It identifies reforms to the labour market and in transportation and communications, improving the delivery of government services, and moving to world best practice in the manufacturing area as key areas for potential gain, and concludes that reform could raise output by over 15 per cent in the long term and help generate the rates of growth required to reduce unemployment to five per cent by 2001.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Until the government grasps the nettle, Australia will continue to lose jobs and industries overseas. Australian business will continue to be hobbled in its effort to introduce innovative practices that will lead to increased international competitiveness and generate growth in exports. The opportunities for coming generations of Australians will further erode. As I have said, the forthcoming industry statement provides yet another opportunity for the government to take up the reins.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until now, there has been very little to indicate that any sort of comprehensive science and technology policy will form part of the industry statement. The new Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Senator Cook) has had his hands full in trying to rejig the document left to him by his predecessor, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths). He has obviously not been pleased or satisfied with what he has already found in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitude of the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) is already well known. This is the minister who, upon his appointment, decided that the best thing to do for Australian science was to break up the CSIRO. Senator Schacht has admitted that he finds meetings with scientists a bit boring. Although he has stumbled from one debacle to the next and although he has failed to generate any great enthusiasm for matters scientific within his own government, and apparently none at all within his leader, Senator Schacht survives. After all, as a key numbers man and mate of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), he is a member of the inner sanctum. It seems that, as the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) with the sports rorts affair, Senator Schacht's tenure is supported by a maxim of the New South Wales Right: that party politics takes priority over good policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the need to improve our effort in relation to research and development is only one element of the strategy that is required to create an innovative culture. Innovation should be defined in the widest possible sense as the successful exploitation of new ideas. As the Business Council of Australia's innovation study commission recently pointed out, innovation is more than just science, invention and technology. It is a total process&mdash;a process that is about people and enterprises, about leadership and customer demand. It is also a process that can mean different things to different companies. For example, in the food industry, innovative forms of packaging and processing are important. In the clothing and footwear industry, the design of new fashions is an important part of innovation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report was highly critical of the government's failure to push ahead with effective reform in the workplace which would ensure that Australian companies have the flexibility to respond to market opportunities. The report identified this as one of the major impediments to improved innovative business practices in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important conclusion from all this is that, whatever form innovation takes, it is absolutely vital if Australia is to become more internationally competitive. We must strive to create a more innovative culture by removing the impediments to business investment in R&amp;D, such as restrictive labour market practices, by stimulating demand for scientific, industrial and engineering skills, by encouraging greater links between the research providers and the research users and by promoting science and technology in our schools&mdash;the breeding grounds for the decision makers of tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> last week, I said that the primary task of national leadership today is to articulate a vision of Australia that builds on our outstanding capacity in science and technology, and on a highly enterprising national character. The national strategy that is required to fulfil this vision must first of all foster excellence in education. It is simply unacceptable that 25 per cent of young Australians leaving primary school have inadequate literacy or numeracy skills, as a bipartisan committee of this House found last year. Curricula need to focus on the development of key knowledge and skills and avoid the problems that led the Australian Academy of Science to condemn the draft science profile for `downgrading scientific knowledge and skills' and for pursuing `social and political agendas'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The highly centralised university sector created under the government's unified national system has seen uniformity gradually replace diversity. This is not the answer, nor is the excessive bureaucracy of the so-called national training agenda. A national strategy would also need to face up to `the serious shortcomings in equipment, libraries, space, technical support and general infrastructure in universities', identified by the government's own national board of employment, education and training with little subsequent impact on policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of the disruptive, politically motivated attacks on the CSIRO that have been a feature of the Keating government's period in office, a national strategy for science and technology would spell out in clear terms the roles of the main research institutions in basic, strategic and applied research. It would provide the framework of policy and funding certainty so essential to the scientific enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, I would like to draw the attention of honourable members in this place to the funding crisis currently looming within the CSIRO. This is the last financial year of the CSIRO's current funding triennium and the government has as yet failed to give any indication of funding levels for the next three years. Faced with a potential $50 million annual reduction in funding, the CSIRO is understandably greatly concerned about the future of many of its key scientific programs. The threat to some 600 research staff is also very real. That such a situation has been allowed to drag on for so long, effectively leaving the CSIRO suspended in a state of funding limbo, is indicative of this government's attitude towards and neglect of science and technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has great areas of strength and potential on which a national reputation for quality and excellence can be built in our region. These areas include communications technology, food processing, land care and environmental management, scientific instruments, gene technology, medical and pharmaceuticals, education and training. We need a national policy framework that will help us to maximise this potential instead of one that impedes and hinders it at every turn, as is currently the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the most important matters that should be addressed by this national strategy are cultural. The status of engineering and science as careers must be lifted. Business should be encouraged to see the value of expertise in these areas at senior managerial and board levels. An export culture needs to be more vigorously promoted. The success of the mining and farming sectors notwithstanding, approximately 80 per cent of Australian manufacturers either have no export sales or export less than one-tenth of total sales. Much broader awareness is required also of the cultures of the countries in our region and their attitudes to business. The greater the delay in implementing such a national strategy, the faster Australia will plunge towards national mediocrity. In the chilling words of the Business Council of Australia's Innovation Study Commission, `Nations that do not nurture innovating enterprises suffer incalculable economic costs'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 before the House this afternoon deals with changes to the discretionary and generic technology grants schemes. The discretionary grants scheme is designed to support company based commercial R&amp;D for enterprises unable to benefit from the tax concession, while the generic technology grants scheme provides for the development of new or emerging technologies of strategic importance to industry competitiveness. New program management arrangements were introduced to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of these grants schemes in February-March 1993. This involved the development of a revised decision framework and the restructuring of the board's granting committees to better reflect an industry focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both these grants schemes were the subject of independent reviews during 1992-93. First, there was a Price Waterhouse study aimed at identifying the benefits gained by individual grant recipients and wider social and community benefits. Based on a small random sample of grant applicants, successful and unsuccessful, this study found that increased sales were derived particularly from the discretionary grants, while wider benefits such as improved R&amp;D management skills, enhanced linkages between researchers and firms and improved product quality resulted from both schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Industry Economics report on the 150 per cent tax concession also evaluated other elements of the industry innovation program, including these grants schemes. While holding some reservations about both schemes, mainly due to gaps in their ability to fully complement the concession and some overlap with other programs, the BIE was largely supportive. It did, however, recommend a broadening of the discretionary grant scheme allowing other categories of companies to be eligible and an investigation of the low application rate for the scheme by tax loss companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey of Australian manufacturing firms conducted by KPMG Peat Marwick, however, found that increased spending on research and development is urgently required if innovation and new ideas are to flourish. The impact of current schemes, while positive, seems slight when viewed in the broader context. In fact, more than 50 per cent of the companies surveyed had never used grants for industry R&amp;D and, of those that had, a majority apparently found them of little or no benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September 1993, the Industry Commission commenced an inquiry into research and development undertaken by industry. This commission will examine the effect of R&amp;D activities on innovation and, as part of the inquiry, the effectiveness of the industry innovation program. Given that the commission is to report by mid-1985, this legislation merely extends the duration of the grants to accommodate the findings of the inquiry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry package that is coming in the budget is a very important aspect of this budget and a very important aspect of our strategy. Do you notice the difference, Mr Deputy Speaker? We did not rest on our laurels after expending that money in industry development, we have said, `Okay, that has been done, but more needs to be done'. So we initiated the idea, through the former Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), of a further industry statement in the budget context to come together with the response to the green paper and the response to the Kelty paper on regional development and other significant policy developments. In fact, there are more policy issues coming into this federal budget than at any time since we have been in government. It is a massive amount of policy development coming together in this year's budget. From the opposition all we have had, as I have said, is a few platitudes, a bit of waffle and the regurgitation of the New Right philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we really need is actual concrete suggestions in the area of industry development, and we are not getting them from the opposition. In terms of development, all of the ideas are coming from the Labor Party, from the different committees of the party, the union movement and others associated with the party. We are getting ideas from sections of industry, but we are getting absolutely nothing from the federal opposition when it comes to serious suggestions on industry development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this package we will be looking at a number of key issues. Let me explain some of them. One issue that has been raised is the question of whether there ought to be further industry plans or sectoral arrangements. This is a very important matter. The plans and arrangements that we put in place over the years have worked: the steel plan, the car plan&mdash;even the TCF plan, which had some difficulties at the beginning, is now working, particularly in the area of processing of raw materials such as wool and cotton to go into our industries. So we have some development in industry with those plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is necessary is to think about other sectors where we might develop sectoral plans. Some that have been suggested are, for example, the area of waste management and cleaner modes of production; the areas of renewable energy, in which we are quite good; the area of eco-tourism; the area of processing of raw materials, value-adding to raw materials&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the parliamentary secretary says, the area of clean food. We have a number of other areas in which Australia is now participating and competing with the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the areas is the development of electronics industries, especially telecommunications industries. For example, the work done in Australia by Ericsson and other telecommunication companies is first-class and rates with the best in the world. We have the potential for further investment. We have to do this through a judicious process in which the government discusses with industry what it needs and how government can support it. We want a judicious approach&mdash;not a heavy-handed, interventionist approach&mdash;whereby the government plays a part by assisting where it can, especially in getting things moving in the early stages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of these strategies is only part of what can happen. We also can look at ways and means of encouraging more capital investment in industry development, especially manufacturing. I hope that the industry paper will address these measures, because all of them together are very important. Without such industry development the base from which we can generate employment into the future will not be there and it is very important for this country that we concentrate on the goal of generating employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it is not some kind of heavy-handed intervention in industry. The government is not trying to pick winners in the sense of trying to pick individual companies that are going to succeed or fail. As I have mentioned, there are programs, which have been outlined by the parliamentary secretary, where individual companies can make applications for grants to assist them&mdash;that is a different matter&mdash;but the government will not go out and pick individual companies to be winners. The government can identify areas of activity in which Australia can be strong and support those; that is a legitimate role for government. It is not a matter of excessive government intervention but rather one of sensible intervention where we have identified a whole sector of industry that can do with government support. There ought to be bipartisan support for the development of such sectoral plans and for such approaches to industry development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect is research and development. We have done a lot in research and development, but what is important is getting the chain from research through to development and production: we have not always been good at that. Some brilliant Australian scientists and researchers have produced new products which could go onto production lines but there has not been the capital investment in Australia. That has partly been a problem of our managers in Australia being a bit reluctant to take risks when it comes to developing new products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has certainly done its part in  encouraging the process of getting more production, but we still do not do enough. It is still the case that significant Australian inventions end up on production lines overseas, without sufficient reward for the people who produced them in Australia and for the Australian nation which have generated the intellectual and scientific atmosphere for those products to go forward in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to address this issue together with identifying of those areas of economic and industrial activity, as I mentioned earlier, where we can have a positive edge in competitive terms with other countries. If we do both those things we will certainly be in a very good position in the development of our industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did mention before the investment allowances and the accelerated depreciation allowance and, although we have spent $1,105,000 on that allowance, I must say that I have been a little bit sad that more companies have not taken advantage of this huge depreciation concession because it was a very generous concession. There was a time, especially during the last days of the recession, when too many companies were afraid and as a result they did not take advantage of the existing allowances, including the depreciation allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I would like to see, and what the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development would like to see, is  more companies and managers of companies being bold in these matters and saying, `Look, we can do it here in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to make a contribution to this debate on the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. This is an omnibus bill and from our side of the House of Representatives chamber, the shadow minister for manufacturing and service industries, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), has addressed in detail a substantial portion of the bill. The remainder of the bill has been addressed by the shadow minister for science, technology and export development, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who just spoke started his contribution to this, as he put it, wide ranging debate, with an overt attack on the shadow minister for science, technology and export development. He said that the honourable member for Goldstein was a leading member of the new right and was a proponent of views which said that the federal government should withdraw all government assistance for all industry programs. The parliamentary secretary not only got it wrong but is so ideologically driven that he cannot see the forest for the trees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one on this side of the House has ever suggested that there is no role for government to play in an overall integrated approach towards industry development, job creation and planning for the Australian economy. On this side of the House, the converse view is held, minister, parliamentary secretary, or whatever. There is, on this side of the House, a substantial number of people with dirt under their fingernails who understand industry in Australia, who understand its requirements, and who know a good industry and who know a bad one. I suggest that the parliamentary secretary might have difficulty defining a good industry. He probably would not know what it looked like if he fell over it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary went on to talk about zero tariffs. Zero tariffs were never part of the policy platform of the opposition. The opposition did say that we took a policy of reducing tariffs to a negligible level by the year 2000. We did that for a good reason because we offered cost offsets to industry that were far greater than the tariff reductions which would have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would have meant that industry came out ahead. Industries' costs would have been reduced and their selling prices would have been reduced because of the reduction in tariffs. The whole Australian economy would have benefited. Australian consumers like those people in the gallery would all have benefited from that kind of policy proposal because very simply the cost of the things which they buy which are not made in Australia&mdash;which might be but which are not&mdash;would have been substantially reduced. That policy is no longer a policy of the opposition but the parliamentary secretary carries on like a two-bob watch in his normal way of trying to build an issue over and above its stated importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us today, which contains an extension to the discretionary and generic technology grants scheme, offers some benefits to Australian industry. I am happy to support that extension because I believe that those schemes offer some value to Australian industry. I do, however, condemn the government for the extremely poor marketing of the industry initiatives that are on the government's books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no single source, no one-stop shop in any government agency or department in Australia, where a small or medium sized business can find out what government programs are available. That information is available from my office in Boronia in the electorate of La Trobe. We have a paper that tells people what the government's programs are, but the government cannot tell people. It wants to keep it a secret. Why let industry know? It might take advantage of it, and Australia might benefit therefrom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I want to canvass innovation, productivity and culture. Innovation is an important term which to me implies more than just new products. It implies innovative or new ways of doing all sorts of things, including management of people, personnel relations, the way we move goods from one place to another, how we produce products, and new products themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister for science, technology and export development, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who preceded me in this debate, said in an article which was reproduced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 26-27 February 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The status of engineering and science as careers must be lifted. Businesses  should be encouraged to see the value of expertise in these areas at senior managerial and board levels, an export culture needs to grow and a much broader awareness is required of the cultures of the countries in our region and their attitudes to business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A vision based on clearly stated goals for the nation's research and development effort is essential.</PARA>
<PARA>I applaud the honourable member for Goldstein for taking up the cause of engineers and scientists. It is often said that, as a professional engineer, I am biased in favour of engineers. If that is true, then I am happy to accept the barbs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a number of problems in Australia, and one of them is that too many of our companies are run by bean counters. I have absolutely nothing but praise for accountants and good accounting practice, but if we talk about innovation, an innovative culture and a vision for products and services for tomorrow, then we need people who have some capacity to understand what might be developed, what the community might desire in the way of products and services, and what it is possible for us to sell in the world market and in other markets, even within our own country. Engineers are very good at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I support any program which helps raise the status of engineers and scientists in Australia. More of them should be involved in our businesses. Research work done in universities and in the CSIRO should be integrated with research done in the private sector so that we have an expanded research base from which to work. We should take primary research work, move it into the development stage and then actually get to the commercialisation of the products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the big failures that we have had in terms of industry policy. Industry policy has concentrated almost entirely on research and development. It has concentrated on the development phase. We have not introduced programs to encourage the commercialisation and marketing phases of product development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It takes a long time in generic research and a lot of money to come up with one new idea. The pharmaceutical industry is a good case in point. Not once in the history of this country have we developed a new chemical entity which has gone on to become a prescription pharmaceutical available from the pharmacist. But we now have discovered a new chemical entity which we believe has every chance of success in curing the flu. Would it not be terrific to have a drug that could cure the flu in 48 hours maximum?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The generic basic research work for that drug was done by an officer of CSIRO and then shifted to a company called Biota Pharmaceuticals. In conjunction with Glaxo, an international pharmaceutical company with major research and production facilities in Australia, it is now developing that drug and taking it through the clinical trials to prove that it will be safe and effective. If it is successful, this will be the first time that Australia has developed a new chemical entity and taken it through to the production stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are successful, and if Australia manufactures that product, it could mean as much as $1 billion a year in exports out of my electorate, out of the village of Boronia. Would that not be terrific for Australia? Would that not give science and technology, industry policy, a shot in the arm?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the kinds of things we need to examine. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services, who preceded me, said that the opposition had no ideas about industry development; all the ideas are from the great Australian Labor Party. I have news for the parliamentary secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some ideas for him to consider: firstly, deregulate the industrial relations sector in Australian industry; secondly, bring on tax measures that will encourage investment and new productive capacity in Australia. Such measures would give business, industry and technology some taxation advantage in building new production lines, in buying new vehicles to transport their equipment, in coming up with technologically innovative solutions to moving materials from one place to another and in developing new packaging techniques that can make us competitive in the overall world sense. Then we can accelerate our micro-economic reform. That is a good idea that we talk about constantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government pays lip-service to micro-economic reform. At the conference between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the premiers of the states of Australia last week it was said that it is now intended that the heads of governments of both sectors would work together to try to increase the rate of micro-economic reform and would do more about the waterfront, telecommunications, electricity supply and rail and road transport. Let us hope that we do, but it is all too slow and the costs to Australian industry are too high. We can reduce those costs substantially. That is a good plank for the government's industry policy platform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be a good idea to encourage engineering and science expansion in terms of business activity. If we had more engineers and they were effectively employed, if we encouraged the universities to train them and we encouraged business to use them effectively, we would have more products. That would mean that we would have more production lines and more jobs for Australia. We would do something about reducing this horrible unemployment queue that we live with from day to day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another plank for the government's policy platform might be to develop renewable resource energy potential which is available in Australia. That is an item that I have spoken about in this parliament on more than one occasion and that I will continue to speak out about. We have a huge potential up in the Kimberleys to develop the tidal energy potential from that region. As the tides go up and down, we can produce electricity, turn it into hydrogen and burn the hydrogen, which turns back into water. So we use a resource which is available; it costs us nothing. We need to spend the money only on the capital development. We improve the environment. We build jobs for Australians. We build technology and we teach the world how to do something important. We are number one. That is important for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another plank for industry policy to encourage savings might be tax measures. Earlier today in debate on an income tax bill, the government constantly commented that the only mechanism available to really encourage savings is its superannuation guarantee charge. What a lot of nonsense! We are subtracting productive savings out of Australian society by two methods. We force-feed one sector and that is the government's superannuation charge. At the same time, we do nothing to encourage private savings that can be put into industry development. That is another plank for the industry and technology platform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might encourage commercialisation of new and innovative products. We might do that through government schemes; we might do it through advertising; we might do it by helping industry to learn more about marketing. We did live behind a tariff protective wall for a very long time. We are only now learning what it is like to deal in the world economy and to be a major economic player on the world scene. We are no longer protected by that huge wall behind which we lived for so many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to learn how to deal with that, we need to learn how to market. That is something we have never been very good at, in general, because we have not had to. We assumed that we had products and, therefore, that other people would buy them. Generally, that was true. They bought our iron ore, coal and wool. We had it and they needed it. But times move on and we now need to be involved in the manufacturing and services sector. We must overtly market to the world what it is that we have to offer. Anything that government industry policy does to encourage marketing development and the expertise of the individuals working in marketing companies is to be absolutely encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a range of very innovative companies in my electorate of La Trobe. Very briefly, in the time available to me, I will mention some of them, because I think they are important examples of helping to encourage innovation in Australia. Johnson Tiles has the first continuous ceramic wall-tile kiln in Australia. It has been successfully producing tiles and helps to reduce the number of imported tiles. This is called import replacement. This firm is an important part of the overall strategy and runs without industrial relations problems in a happy harmonious environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke before about Glaxo pharmaceuticals and its involvement in the new flu drug. Glaxo's exports in the last few years have expanded almost exponentially because it has developed innovative packaging techniques for drugs. The packaging technique involves making little nebules out of plastic and injecting them with the drug. This is done automatically. The plant runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with 12-hour shifts. It is very innovative. In fact, it is leading the world in terms of that packaging technology. It is a very important company for Australia and for our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telspec is an example of a new company which is innovative because of its people. Its people came from Telecom. A similar thing has happened to a number of other companies. The engineering and scientific knowledge and capability have come from a major Australian involvement. Telspec makes a very interesting product. This is called a line splitter. One pair of copper wires can have four telephone numbers. It is important for remote areas. It is important for Indonesia, Malaysia and, ultimately, it will be important for China. The company is working on a line splitter which will handle 34 telephone lines on one pair of copper wires. It is fantastic technology which is growing at a rapid rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mark Sensing is a company which has developed an alternative mechanism or method for manufacturing and producing fax paper. We now compete with the Japanese and the Americans so well that there is a tremendous cost advantage to the Australian product and that product is being exported, as is the technology. That company also makes betting tickets and it is interesting that it makes all the betting tickets for the Hong Kong racecourse from Bayswater in Victoria. It is another interesting and important company doing innovative things. Last year it made a substantial profit and gave the work force the opportunity of either taking fairly substantial wage increases or putting the money into new plant and equipment to mean new jobs, and the work force voted for new jobs. That is an excellent example of work force cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Design 2000, another company in my electorate, makes high quality telecommunications equipment. This is an increasingly important area in terms of exports, particularly to the eastern European countries. Other companies are Moldflow, a computer design company which designs a very large proportion of the plastic extrusion moulds used throughout the world by industry; Siemens Industries, which we all know about; and the Dandenong Bulb Farm, which now exports vegetables to Noumea and Tahiti from the Dandenong Ranges in Victoria. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Dr Theophanous) made reference to research and development in Australia, and he made the point that we were not always all that good at the end product. Whilst we have been very good at researching and developing a whole range of products, we do not always have the capacity or industry is not prepared to take on the development of a lot of those new and innovative ideas. For example, CSIRO has developed many promising ideas&mdash;the gene shears is one that I know many honourable members in this place are very well aware of&mdash;and unfortunately Australian industry did not have the capacity or the wherewithal to take them on. We should take the opportunity when debating bills like this to reflect on some of those things and also to use every opportunity we can to encourage industry to move into some of those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes amendments to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986. The discretionary grants and the generic technology grants are very innovative things for industry in Australia. They give us the opportunity to encourage small businesses which cannot take the benefit of the 150 per cent tax concession to actually get some grants to help them develop their markets. Austrade has the ability to help to develop a lot of those opportunities in the export marketplace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last year I asked a question of the Attorney-General but he did not get to answer it; the Prime Minister leapt in and cut him off. That is not going to happen today because the Prime Minister is not here. The Attorney-General will be aware that courts have repeatedly decided that it is for the court to determine whether a claim by a minister of public interest immunity is to be upheld or is to be rejected. Courts at all levels regularly inspect documents in respect of which such a claim is made in order to determine whether the document is immune from production. The question is: has the Attorney-General provided any advice to the Treasurer that parliamentary committees exercising the powers of a house of parliament do not have the right which is exercised every day by courts? Will he table any such advice? If the Attorney-General has not provided any such advice, will he now advise the Treasurer that the Senate print media committee has the power to uphold or reject the claim by the Treasurer for public interest immunity in respect of documents relating to foreign media ownership called for by the committee?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the shadow Attorney-General points out is quite correct in terms of the role of courts in determining claims of public interest immunity. Indeed, there have been many decisions on this point. I suppose the most important recent decision I recall is the High Court decision in the cabinet notebooks case. In that decision, the High Court recognised the existence of public interest immunity. On that occasion it was accepted to apply to cabinet notebooks but the High Court did reserve to itself the power to examine documents in a particular case and to determine whether a claim for public interest immunity could be established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the fundamental weakness in what the shadow Attorney-General has advanced is in equating the role of a committee of this parliament, in particular, a Senate committee, with the role of a court. The fundamental difference, which has been well understood in terms of claims of public interest immunity by the executive which have been questioned or challenged by either house of the parliament or by parliamentary committee and, indeed, which was canvassed at some length in a very detailed document produced by then Attorney-General Ellicott back in 1972, I think, is that a house of this parliament or a parliamentary committee is not akin to a court. It is not a disinterested party making a dispassionate judgment against competing claims of two parties before it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What essentially is being argued is that the parliamentary committee should be able to get the document in front of it, make a judgment as to whether there should be a claim for public interest immunity, and decide whether the document then should be given to itself. That is the fundamental difficulty with this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not easy to compare the situation of a court making a judgment in a case of public interest immunity and the situation asserted by the executive and disputed by a committee of this House. This government has continued to rely on the practice&mdash;it has been adopted by governments over many years; as I said, it was spelt out in 1972 and followed by the Fraser Government, and it has continued to be followed by this government&mdash;that certification by a minister as to the public interest of a particular document to be kept confidential should be accepted by a parliamentary committee inquiring into the subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member asked me expressly whether I had provided advice to the Treasurer on this point. I have not. The Office of General Counsel has provided advice to the Treasurer on this issue.

The government is considering the question of appointment of a person holding the title of chief whip. I do not know why it has come as a bit of a surprise to those opposite, since I talked about these matters at some length on a number of occasions when these issues were debated in the chamber when we were looking at the reforms of the House.

They will obviously be necessary when the second chamber starts functioning. I think all parties here operate with two whips. Those two whips are fully engaged in the operations of this chamber. In many ways, the burden on the whips in the new chamber will be much greater than in this chamber. They will have difficult standing orders to operate and they will be effectively obliged to keep that chamber going in terms of the people who are getting up on their scrapers speaking in the place. It will not be as easy a chamber to monitor as this one. So there will be a requirement for additional whips across the board.

It will also look at the interaction of the social security income and assets test and the taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this review is timely. It has been some considerable time since the assets test was reintroduced in the mid-1980s. A range of issues has emerged as to the treatment of various kinds of investment products. Of necessity, the treatment of some of these has in some cases become complex, and I think it is reasonable that we explore the possibility of achieving a system which is both fair and equitable but also transparently fair and equitable. That is easy to say, but doing it will be rather difficult. So, to achieve that objective, we will be relying on the work of the consultant that we have appointed. The consulting group that we have put in charge of this exercise is Ageing Agendas, headed by John Barber. That will be assisted by a reference group which is broadly representative of retiree organisations, the finance industry and relevant government departments. We have had the first meeting of the reference group. I am sure the group will make a very good contribution. There is a very good spread of expertise and background there and I am sure it will work very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this review was announced, the honourable member for Berowra had to have his swipe. He expressed some concern about Mr Barber's appointment. The terms of his concern were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Barber's long association with one particular association, which has concentrated on defending those who already receive benefits . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is a rather extraordinary objection that Mr Barber has been associated with an organisation representing pensioners. I find it rather extraordinary that it would be seen to be objectionable that somebody who has a background in an organisation representing pensioners should be involved in the conduct of a review of the pensioners' income and assets test. Quite frankly, that is a pretty weird sort of objection. The honourable member for Berowra claims that there appears to be little time left for a full and comprehensive review and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This broad ranging review will be a test of Mr Barber's capacity to quickly grasp an extensive and complex policy area.</PARA>
<PARA>I think there is perfectly adequate time to conduct the review properly and to conduct a proper consultation process. Mr Barber and his consulting group are also confident of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to contrast the point of view expressed by the honourable member for Berowra with the view expressed by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Senator MacGibbon, who has a very different view about the capabilities of the consultant. He is quoted as saying that the report could probably be written in a weekend. It is a pretty inane comment to suggest that he could achieve that. I think the consulting group is pretty capable but I do not think that even it would claim to be that capable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst thing about that statement is that it just shows contempt for one of the key features of this review: the need to consult very extensively with the retiree population. The way in which this review is to be conducted allows considerable opportunities for consultation to occur and for submissions to be lodged. I am confident that the work of the consultant and the reference group, serviced by a group within the department that will do some of the technical work, will produce a very useful and worthwhile review of the scheme the results of which I hope will feed into some concrete government policy decisions.</PARA>

It is true that the government is funding this service. In this budget we have set aside $300,000 as seed funding to set up a comparative financial information service where for a modest fee consumers will be able to get comparative information on all those enormously complicated and varied financial services that are now available. That has gone out to a tendering process, which will be a very careful and well supervised process. The advertisements have been in the newspapers.

The fact is that they could get this service freely from the banks in a properly operating marketplace. It is the banks we have been asking to provide this service for some time.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the honourable member referred to the International Year of the Family, I might point out that this government is now spending something of the order of $5 billion a year in family assistance. If we look at what has been done over the last 10 years or so, we will see that the level of assistance provided to families, particularly low income families, has increased dramatically with the introduction of the family allowance supplement, which is now called the additional family payment, the achievement of adequacy benchmarks for that payment and regular indexation since. That is a very significant reform and is recognised as such by just about all commentators on families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also draw attention to the government's election commitment, which has been overfulfilled, to introduce a home child-care allowance, which comes into operation later this year. That is a major structural reform of assistance for families caring for children. It involves expenditures of some $230 million over and above the with-child, dependent spouse rebate which it replaces. It means that some 55,000 low income families which did not have an income adequate to receive the full benefit of the dependent spouse rebate will benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 120,000 families will benefit from the fact that under the new arrangements, which are based on a current income test rather than a financial year income test, people caring for children will be able to move in and out of the work force and resume eligibility for payment of the home child-care allowance, which did not apply to the dependent spouse rebate. All in all, what this government has done in the year of the family is a pretty creditable effort, and it shows a very major commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The specific question of the young homeless allowance was raised. This is an extraordinarily difficult area. I have attended a number of meetings with people who are concerned with this issue. Nobody denies the need to have a payment of that kind. Whether we like it or not, there are cases of significant abuse of children&mdash;physical abuse, sexual abuse and so forth&mdash;and domestic environments which are clearly untenable. Nobody disputes the need to have a young homeless allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument is about how we determine in particular cases who gets it and who does not. We rely heavily on our social workers to verify the circumstances. The decisions to allocate the payment are made by a senior officer, but it is inherently a very difficult area. It does require the making of fine judgments where we have to weigh claim against counterclaim. It is not a simple matter. It is a very sensitive area and there have been a range of complaints from people, including parents who claim that the payment was being made available inappropriately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been enough such complaints for me to think that we do need to have a careful look at the administration of that scheme. I have asked my department to review the administrative arrangements from a number of points of view, including trying to make sure that we maximise the potential to achieve a reconciliation between the children and their parents. Obviously, we need to do as much as we can there. We are currently constrained by the privacy provisions in the Social Security Act, but we are having a think about that. We are having a look at a new disallowable instrument that might overcome some of the concerns there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member pointed out, a parliamentary committee, chaired by the honourable member for Newcastle, will broadly review the area over the course of this year. That review will not just be looking at the young homeless payment. It will also be looking more broadly at the factors that lead to homelessness occurring in the first place. I hope that committee will be able to produce some very valuable information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the rate of growth in the numbers receiving payment, this payment was introduced in the mid-1980s. There is always a period in which the eligible population becomes aware of the payment, and there is a build-up of the take up over a period. Under those circumstances, together with obvious things like the recession, I do not think the increase that the honourable member referred to was unexpected, particularly if we take into consideration what Burdekin had to say about the number of homeless youth being in the range of 12,000 to 24,000. If that is correct, and there are 10,000 receiving the payment, if anything, there might be some who ought to be getting it but who are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, it is far better for people to be on this payment rather than having to make their way by robbing houses or prostituting themselves. It is very important that we have that payment. It is also very important that it is well administered and that judgments are made as well as they possibly can be. Inevitably, there will be errors in something as subjective as this, but all we can do is review the situation to make sure that the system works as well as possible. We are doing that in two ways: by an internal departmental review to ensure that we get consistent administration and by a broader parliamentary inquiry. I have referred terms of reference to the committee chaired by the honourable member for Newcastle.</PARA>

Can the minister inform the House of the progress these organisations are making in the quest for improved productivity by way of workplace bargaining?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that the honourable member for Macarthur is a strong advocate of the public sector and I am pleased to inform him that, in addition to the productivity improvements taking place within the Australian Public Service proper and all the people engaged in workplace agreements, there have been some tremendous advances in government business enterprises and statutory authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to inform him and the House that there are now over 200,000 people employed in government business enterprises who have struck agreements and have set themselves on a path to higher productivity. Over 99 per cent of those people employed in government business enterprises are now covered by agreements. Similarly, in the 42 statutory authorities, which the government controls but whose staff are not directly employed under the APS, something like 93 per cent of the staff are covered by agreements&mdash;more than 26,000 workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the House some examples of how these agreements are driving productivity in particular instances. Australia Post introduced what it called a quality service 1 initiative and has worked to raise individual productivity as a means of entering into bargaining agreements. This has worked so well that Britain's Royal Mail has taken up the idea and is now using the notion of quality service 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old government aircraft factory at Avalon&mdash;we now call it Aerospace Technologies of Australia Aircraft Services&mdash;has investigated the use of what it calls cellular manufacturing. The work groups themselves determine how to get greatest productivity from a particular manufacturing exercise and they have raised productivity through these means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation has now embarked on an enterprise agreement, such that it is picking up a lot of the practices that we would commonly find in the finance and insurance sectors. It is also lifting its productivity. Also, the old munitions factories, now Australian Defence Industries, have invoked a number of arrangements such as total quality management and just-in-time practices that have also lifted productivity in ADI enormously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only have we produced improvements in productivity here for the Commonwealth, the worker and the taxpayer but also improvements often mean the lowering of charges to the private sector. The Civil Aviation Authority, for instance, as a result of its workplace bargaining, has seen real charges to the aviation industry in 1992-93 drop by 16 per cent. We are expecting by the completion of the 1993-94 financial year a further drop in charges to the aviation sector of 17 per cent. I think the honourable member is quite right in his question: these public sector authorities and GBEs have a great deal to contribute to the Australian economy and workplace bargaining is driving that improved productivity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member has clearly seen the excellent article that appeared in the press the other day which recorded the setting up of this group of people who are engaged in attempting to use our comparative advantage in matters of health services to export to the burgeoning Asia-Pacific region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the latter part of the honourable member's question as to the extent of the market, real work is only just beginning into what clearly is a very big market. A survey will be completed quite soon which will give us more information on that. But I assure the honourable member that the market is at least of the order of three figures of millions&mdash;$100 million, and possibly considerably more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the first part of the honourable member's question is concerned, that is to say, the extent to which the aid program can assist in penetrating this market, I am happy to be able to tell him that the aid program is already making a substantial contribution to health sector exports and is well placed to contribute to the emphasis which the establishment of that network, to which he referred in his question, will facilitate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The priority of health assistance in our aid program is great and increasing. In the course of the last financial year, around $73 million was spent on health related activities in 30 countries, but the bulk of those were in the Asia-Pacific region. The prime aim of those activities is not primarily to assist health exports but to support appropriate health care which supports the basic human needs of people in the Asia-Pacific region. But at the same time, in so doing, the government seeks to maximise the use of Australian expertise and equipment and to showcase Australian capacity, both in the technical sphere and in the services, the policy sphere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give just a few examples of AIDAB's current or planned activities which complement the focus of the health export network: the China hepatitis test kit production project, which will assist China to construct and design an international standard laboratory in Beijing to produce test kits, diagnostic kits for hepatitis B. By doing so, the project will provide opportunities for Australian companies to provide training as well as Australian sourced technical assistance with equipment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance arises out of a contemptible decision by the government to renege on a stated commitment to waive the assets test for applicants for Austudy who have been granted the health care card. The reason this decision to back away from yet another promise deserves contempt is twofold. First, the government stated to the people of Australia on no less than four occasions in four different ways that it would waive the assets test for the holders of health care cards when applying for Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the decision is despicable because of the secretive and sly way in which the government has sought to avoid admitting that it has broken yet another one of its budget and election promises. The manner is indicative of the endemic failure of sound administration which has been highlighted repeatedly in the last year and in the last few weeks of this government. It says something also about the attitude of this government towards those in regional Australia, particularly those in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt about the government's stated intention and its stated commitment in this matter. I note by way of passing that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) is not here. The minister has been running away from saying anything to anybody about this decision since it was brought to light some three weeks ago. He has refused point blank to talk to the media. He has refused point blank to debate, or even comment about, the matter on radio. We see once again today that the chair in which the minister ought to be sitting is empty at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt about the commitment that the government made in relation to this matter. The minister made the commitment on four separate occasions. I welcome the minister to the chamber, who has been brought in here at last to make some sort of public announcement about this yet again broken promise on behalf of the Labor government. The first of four occasions on which this commitment was stated was in the department budget kit on student assistance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1994, special assessment will be extended to students whose parents hold a current health care card. Such students will qualify for Austudy without parental income and assets test.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the first occasion on which there was a stated commitment from the government on this measure. Then on 13 September last year we had a Department of Employment, Education and Training media release which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Major changes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>arising out of last year's budget&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective January 1, 1994, students from families holding a Health Care Card will qualify for a maximum AUSTUDY entitlements, with means and assets tests waived. This measure is especially beneficial to low income families which are not on Department of Social Security or Veterans Affairs benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>They are two occasions on which this commitment has been clearly stated to the people of Australia. Then we had the 1994 Austudy guide, a glossy publication which is put out by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and by the National Union of Students. On page 36 of the publication, in relation to independent students, the question is asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are there any other situations where assets are not counted?</PARA>
<PARA>We find here, shaded and highlighted in a box, the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1994, the assets of both you and your spouse generally won't be counted if your spouse&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and, of course, we know what it is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">holds a Health Care Card.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to dependent students, the same statement is made&mdash;highlighted, once again&mdash;in the department's own glossy publication, which goes to students right around this country. This is the third occasion on which a commitment has been made to the people of Australia about Austudy and the health care card. Finally, we have the Austudy application form itself. At the bottom, it quite clearly states that if people tick the box which says they have a health care card then they jump over the questions which deal with their assets and do not answer them on the application form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On four separate pieces of paper from the department&mdash;a media release, the booklet, the application form and, of course, the briefing notes after the budget itself&mdash;we have the simple, clear, unambiguous statement to the people of Australia that if they have a health care card and they apply for Austudy then they do not need to satisfy the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was fine from the budget right through until February of this year&mdash;but what did we find in February of this year? On 21 February we had Senator Schacht telling the Senate that the budget decision was misinterpreted in the material circulated to students and that&mdash;wait for this as one of the great excuses of all time&mdash;the normal DEET quality control measures failed to pick up this diversion from the intention of the government policy. Forgive me if I am a little sceptical&mdash;in fact, exceedingly sceptical&mdash;about this explanation; it simply does not convince us at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, there is the whole series of contrary statements which have been made by the department in its material. But let us also look at the initial response from the minister's office, which was quoted in a newspaper article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 15 February this year under the heading `Austudy rethink may hit farmers'. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Mr Free, yesterday held talks with DEET officials, the Treasurer, Mr Willis, and the Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley, to discuss the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is understood Mr Free was angered by DEET's directive&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, a directive reneging on the promise that had been made&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but it was uncertain whether the Government would be able to honour its Budget commitment.</PARA>
<PARA>Why was the minister angry about this directive if, in fact, it was simply a directive which was incorrect, as has been suggested, and that there was simply a mistake about the policy? Surely the minister would be pleased, if this were simply a mistake about the policy, to say to the department, `You'd better tell the people what the current situation is and fix it up'. But the first response is that the minister is angry. Why is he angry? Because he has been found out for having changed the policy which this government promised the Australian people. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A spokesman for Mr Free said yesterday an "administrative contradiction" between the Department of Social Security and DEET&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is not just a quality control failure; this is an administrative contradiction&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had occurred and that some people applying for Austudy benefits might have been affected.</PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The Government intends to honour its policy but at this stage it is not clear whether it can&mdash;this will take a few days to sort out," the spokesman said.</PARA>
<PARA>The government intends to honour its policy. What was that stated policy? None other than to waive the assets test for those persons who held health care cards and were applying for Austudy. If the government intended to honour its policy, how can the minister&mdash;who is finally being brought before the chamber to say something about this matter&mdash;come in here and argue that this was simply an administrative error? The minister cannot have it both ways in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DEET's directive, of course, was not passed on to regional offices. My office, for example, checked with the regional office in Melbourne on a number of occasions and it did not know about the directive. We had it checked with other regional offices around Australia and last week we were contacted by the staff of one of the DEET offices&mdash;in Dandenong, in fact&mdash;to ask for my press releases so they could find out what was going on. So much for communication in the minister's department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there was an error of interpretation why did the government quietly leave this provision out of the regulations which it published last December? There is very little point if the regulations merely say that people who qualify for a health care card, and therefore satisfy the income test, do not need to go through the process again in order to satisfy the Austudy test. The regulations are a nonsense and they do not add anything to the current situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister cannot have it both ways. Either he is reversing the policy&mdash;which we believe he is doing&mdash;or he knew about the error in November and December last year, secretly left it out of the regulations and did nothing about informing the Australian people until he was found out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the effect of this? Why are we today raising this as a matter of public importance in the national parliament? The Senate has been told by Senator Schacht that only 100 people had qualified under this system and that only 20 others have put applications in that might be refused. Of course, there is no way of the government knowing how many people miss out under this system. Why would people bother to put in an application if they have been told that their application is going to be refused?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last couple of days we have been in contact with people who put in applications and were refused. I can assure the minister that far more than 20 people, which was the figure it seems Senator Schacht wanted to remind people of, missed out on qualifying for Austudy. In any event, we are talking about perhaps tens of thousands of dollars, and why is the government breaking a promise over tens of thousands of dollars if only 20 people missed out? The minister has to go one way or the other and it is about time we heard a clear explanation from him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were first told by the minister's office that some $25 million was involved. That figure then came down to $10 million, and we do not know what it is at the present time. It does not matter whether one person or 2,000 people are affected by this broken promise because there are two issues here. The first is that this is a broken promise by this remote and uncaring government which always employs the language of social justice but arrogantly says to the young people of Australia, `We are prepared to cut you off from any opportunity for education'. Even if this broken promise affected only one family, the government's original commitment won bouquets throughout the length and breadth of Australia because, through it, the government said to people who have for years suffered from droughts, floods, rain and bushfires and from world commodity prices falling, that it was going to do something to help the educational opportunities of their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These things have had a devastating impact upon these communities. Minister Crean and Senator Richardson went through Queensland last year telling many of these people that they qualified for the health care card and, implicit in that, that they would qualify for Austudy as well, yet we have this total backdown on the part of the government today. We have to ask what the role of the minister is in this saga. The statement was made in the Senate by Senator Schacht. Senator Schacht, not Minister Free, was sent off to talk to the estimates committee. I do not know what Minister Free was doing&mdash;perhaps he has rostered days off from the estimates committee as well, but he was not in the Senate estimates committee when he could have answered these questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no statement, no explanation. I have been told by at least six radio commentators or journalists on radio throughout Australia that when they ask for a comment from the minister, they get the single response, `The minister is not prepared to make a comment on this matter'. Why is the minister not prepared to comment? He has been dragged in here kicking and screaming today. It is about time that we got a simple statement from him about this question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have restrained myself from asking the minister a question during question time so that a backbencher has the opportunity to ask the minister a question&mdash;we have had a series of dorothy dixers on a whole lot of inane subjects about what great new program the government is actually engaged in&mdash;so that he can say quite honourably to the people of Australia, `This is the change which we have made.' Do honourable members think that in the four dorothy dixers that have been presented to the minister there has been one question or one word about what the government has done in this total backdown? There has been nothing but resounding silence on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are stories from different parts of Australia of people who have been affected by these proposals. This morning we spoke to Bill and Marilyn Taylor&mdash;no relation to the honourable member&mdash;from Charleville. For the last four financial years they have had a nil income. They do not get the health care card. They were encouraged to get it and to apply for Austudy and now they find out that, even though the application was in before this magic arbitrary date of 7 February, they have had no notification. Presumably the educational opportunities of their children are still in doubt. There are other people like them right around Australia. For the government to say that this measure affects just 20 families shows the uncaring and remote attitude of this government generally to people in Australia. This is not an isolated incident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year this government tried to cut Austudy to 16-year-olds and to move them over to family payments, which meant the reduction in the amount of assistance they would get for their education. We know of other stories of rorts in the Austudy system. People are getting paid more to stay on jobsearch than to go on to Austudy and complete their education and training. These questions and a whole lot more remain unanswered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By his own admission the minister has had since 7 February to investigate how this happened and who authorised the changes which he purports were made. What does he say to the students who have commenced courses on the basis of the information that has been provided to them? I can understand his embarrassment but he has to honour the commitment he made. If he has got some honour, he should stand up here today and say, `This government is going to honour the commitment. I am going to go back and fight for this commitment'. Otherwise he will be seen as part of a government that is uncaring and arrogant, that is remote from the Australian people and whose sloppy and corrupt administration makes it unfit to govern this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I forget which fast food chain adopted the singing commercial, `you ought to be congratulated', but I almost feel like singing it to the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) today because he needs to be congratulated. He has graduated from raising spurious points of order during question time to actually getting around to proposing a matter of public importance. Unfortunately, it is a spurious matter of public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter before the House proposed by the honourable member&mdash;the government's disregard for the welfare of families in its recent decisions to limit eligibility for Austudy for many students&mdash;is a spurious proposition. There is no disregard for family welfare. Austudy is a scheme which is targeted to take into account both the income and assets of families so that assistance is targeted to those students most in need. There is no `recent decision' as referred to in the proposition. What transpired flowed from a departmental misinterpretation of a budget decision and that original budget decision stands unaltered. It follows, as a matter of simple logic, that there is therefore no removal or limitation of eligibility. Before taking the honourable member for Menzies through the details of what occurred in terms which I hope will make it clear to him and maybe even to his coalition colleague Senator Boswell, I invite him to join me on a trip down memory lane, a trip down the time tunnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time is early 1983; the place is Liberal Party Australia. It is the eighth year of Malcolm Fraser's prime ministership. Peter Reith has just won the seat of Flinders in a by-election but it is going to take him two years to take up his seat because he is about to lose it in March to the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), who is sitting behind me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983, there were 348,000 students in Australia attending 19 universities located almost exclusively in our cities. In our secondary schools, one-third of students went on to complete year 12. The tertiary students at the time were assisted under a scheme known as TEAS, tertiary education assistance scheme&mdash;a tired and complex scheme. Students in senior secondary years were assisted under the SAS scheme, the secondary assistance scheme. I think at the time it paid about $25 a week. People could actually do twice as well on the dole at the time, as I recall it. Under the last Liberal administration in this country, 16-year-olds were being paid to leave school because the dole was twice as attractive as the miserable allowances which were paid to them in Liberal Party Australia of 1983. Now more than 560,000 students are attending 38 universities on 111 campuses across Australia. Compare that with 348,000 students attending 19 universities back in 1983. Today almost 80 per cent of secondary students go on to complete year 12. Remember that back in 1983 it was around one-third of secondary students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for student assistance, in 1983 around $330 million of assistance was made to some 200,000 students. This year we will pay more than $1.5 billion in student assistance to more than half a million students. The Austudy scheme was introduced in 1987 to provide assistance on a non-competitive basis to those eligible secondary and tertiary students following years of the stagnant underfunding of the old TEAS scheme. Since 1987 Austudy beneficiaries have more than doubled. Since 1983 student assistance beneficiaries overall have more than trebled. As I mentioned, last year more than half a million were assisted at a cost of around $1.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of changes were announced in the 1993-94 budget which are of importance. The assets test for the assistance for isolated children scheme was abolished, recognising the hardship faced by many rural people. Students who had completed courses more than 10 years ago became eligible to receive Austudy so that they could update their qualifications. The maximum amount that Austudy and Abstudy tertiary students could receive as an interest-free supplement was increased from $4,000 to $6,000. Fringe benefits received by parents were taken into consideration as a means of ensuring better targeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, from the 20th of this month new arrangements under the two systems&mdash;the Department of Social Security and the student assistance programs conducted by DEET&mdash;will allow for a smoother transition so that those clients moving from unemployment benefits to student assistance will continue to receive social security payments for three weeks to take account of any delays in processing of student assistance. Equally, those jobsearch and newstart clients who are undertaking courses of less than six months duration at the direction of the local CES will remain on Department of Social Security payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, we have been able to introduce vastly improved processing through the introduction of the 1994 version of the computer system for processing student assistance application forms known as ESAS. We have made remarkable progress in that area as well. By 18 February, student assistance centres had processed 529,000 assessments, representing an improvement of almost 20 per cent as against the same time last year. Of course, this significant improvement in performance means a much better service to clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the period following the 1993-94 budget, an error was made. My budget press release of 17 August last year, which announced simplifications to Austudy, said, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Streamlining assessment procedures for students entering the AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY/AIC system where families have a Health Care Card.</PARA>
<PARA>Streamlining assessment procedures was the intention of the decision. Unfortunately, the students assistance reference kit, to which the honourable member referred, contained an incorrect statement. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Students from families holding a Health Care Card will qualify for maximum AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY entitlements, with means and assets tests waived.</PARA>
<PARA>There is one incorrect word in that statement. The word `assets' should not have been referred to, for the very good reason that the original budget decision did not include a reference to waiving the assets test. For that reason, therefore, the press statement of the honourable member for Menzies of 14 February is wrong, at least in this respect, where he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is contrary to a Budget decision to waive the assets test for Health Care Card holders.</PARA>
<PARA>There was never a budget decision to waive the assets test for health care card holders. This matter arose out of a decision to allow those parents or spouses, where they hold a health care card, to fast-track access to Austudy on the grounds that they have already met the appropriate means administered by the Department of Social Security. The intention of the decision was to allow the speedier payment of Austudy for parents suffering sudden drops in income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the budget decision was misinterpreted in material circulated to students by the department, as I have just illustrated, stating that holders of health care cards were exempt from the Austudy assets test. This was not the intention of the budget decision. There was no intention to remove the Austudy assets test from the holders of health care cards, because to do this would lead to inequities in the distribution of Austudy. Not all health care card holders are required to undergo an assets test. It would not be responsible to allow a loophole to be exploited in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents of children and their spouses who have applied for Austudy after 7 February on the basis of holding a health care card will be asked, as per the directive, to supply information about their assets if these details have not already been given to the Department of Social Security. Their entitlement will be assessed accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This fact, with the help of the ABC, appears to have penetrated even the consciousness of the honourable member's colleague in the Senate Senator Boswell.

<PARA>Senator Boswell then said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is very little we can do.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely right. I refer to the behaviour of the opposition on this matter. Its return to the original claim that the government was reneging on a decision made in the budget is clearly wrong. The government is maintaining the original decision, which had the intent of giving speedier access to Austudy for families suffering a sudden drop in income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the charge that the government is reneging on a promise cannot be sustained either by reference to my budget press release or to the regulations. That fact is even recognised by Senator Boswell, but it is apparently not recognised by the honourable member who has put this proposition before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth reminding honourable members that last year Austudy grew to the point where it is now assisting over half a million students at a cost of over $1.5 billion. It is hardly surprising that, while the opposition has chosen this afternoon to attempt to score some points on this issue, it ignores&mdash;it suits the opposition&mdash;the government's unquestionable record on student assistance. While this matter is so important to those opposite, I can find nowhere in Fightback a commitment to remove such families from the assets test. It is not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has equally been silent this afternoon on whether it stands by its Fightback commitment to slash student financial assistance by $30 million per year by raising the Austudy cut-off point. Had the opposition been elected in March last year, that measure would have removed 30,000 students from Austudy. Those opposite are here whingeing about 20. Its proposal would have cut 30,000 students from Austudy. So, while Senator Boswell and the honourable member for Menzies complain about 20 students, their proposition in Fightback would have removed 30,000.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that the government, through the pathetic response from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) this afternoon, has taken the Australian public for a ride with its short-lived promise to waive the assets test for Austudy applicants holding health care cards. What has outraged many rural communities in my constituency about this whole sorry tale is that there has been not one sign of remorse from the government&mdash;not one admission of guilt; not even a whisper of apology&mdash;for the families whose plans have been thrown into turmoil as a result of this broken promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allow me to recap on this incredible bungle; it is an extraordinary bungle even by this government's very low standards. On 13 September last year, the Department of Employment, Education and Training issued a press release that announced:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . families holding a Health Care Card will qualify for maximum AUSTUDY . . . entitlements, with means and assets tests waived.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a press release from the department. This announcement was enthusiastically received by rural families across the country who felt it was a fair recognition and an acknowledgment from the government of the difficulties that the assets test has caused during this unprecedented rural downturn, where many have been affected by drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 January this year, the initiative officially commenced and, as the honourable member for Menzies pointed out quite clearly, it was even in the application form that Austudy circulated around the country. From the day it commenced, approximately 100 students accessed the Austudy benefits without submitting to an assets test. Then just five weeks later, on 7 February, the department issued an internal statement to the effect that Austudy applicants from health care card holding families would have to face an assets test. There was, however, no public announcement by the minister of this policy backflip. In fact, the announcement was so quiet that the Department of Employment, Education and Training did not even tell its staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Menzies pointed out, as late as 22 February, two weeks after the policy change, the Dandenong DEET office was still advising health care card holders that they did not have to face an assets test to receive Austudy benefits. It is not difficult then to appreciate the confusion that reigned in the community. Students who took the government's initial pledge in good faith were submitting their applications and planning their school and tertiary education commitments, safe in the knowledge that the assets test, which has unfairly plagued many rural families and regional students for years, would now not apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On reaching their local Austudy office, the students were told of the policy change and were instructed to submit to an assets test. This was a blow in itself. It was nothing short of a blatant broken promise on the government's part. Worse still, it was done on the quiet, after the initiative had already been in place for five weeks. This broken promise naturally created anger and frustration throughout rural Australia, which once again felt cheated by this government. However, this anger turned to outright disbelief when the students and families caught up in the bungle read the newspapers over the following days, in which the minister was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government intends to honour its (original) policy but at this stage it is not clear whether it can.</PARA>
<PARA>That threw more confusion into the debate. The minister certainly did not clear it up. That statement was made on 15 February, some eight days after the department decided to quietly drop the idea. The confusion was described by the minister's spokesman as an `administrative contradiction'. This resulted in a completely farcical situation whereby the minister was saying to health care card holding families, `No, you don't have to face an assets test' and his departmental staff were saying, `Yes, you do'. So whom do we believe? This situation clearly revealed a minister with no authority, no discipline and obviously no regard for the students and families of rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister will pass this off as an administrative hiccup, a vagary of human nature or a breakdown in communications. It is, however, much more than that. This whole sorry mess has hurt families and, worst of all, the great tragedy of it is that it has hurt students who had already started to plan for that education, but who could now well be denied access to that education. Most of those affected are from rural and regional areas and are already struggling with a whole range of climatic and industry problems that this government would never understand. In some cases, more hardship has been inflicted through government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received a phone call from a distraught constituent on the day the minister's desperate denials were published in newspapers across the country. The next day my constituent was due to pay a deposit on his daughter's accommodation which would allow her to attend university in Sydney. He had a health care card and had made his daughter's arrangements on the strength of the government's promise to waive the assets test, as this would enable her to receive Austudy benefits. On the same day he had been requested by Austudy officials to supply asset details. He also read the minister's statement which said that the government would stand by its commitment to waive the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He rang my office in desperation. He knew an assets test would rule his daughter ineligible for Austudy, but the minister was publicly contradicting his department, saying that there would be no assets test. This family had to make very real and very hard decisions affecting their daughter's education and, ultimately, the education of their other children. These decisions had to be made on the basis of the contradictory advice from the minister's department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the remarks of Senator Schacht in the upper house and at the Senate estimates committee, it seems that the department will win out&mdash;and, as we have heard from the minister today, he has certainly given up on it&mdash;and that the assets test will prevail. So the young woman to whom I referred will now not get her Austudy. I have received many documented letters from constituents outlining similar stories to this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a story of just one family in my electorate. There are dozens more right across Australia who have been strung along by this government's deceit. This government cunningly teased them by telling them that the assets test would not apply and by allowing a few lucky families to make the cut. Then, in the blink of an eye, the initiative was over. Life was back to normal and rural families were out in the cold once again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was clearly an insensitive and callous trick. Clearly, the government could not afford the initiative for whatever crooked reason, but it knew, or should have known, that at the time the initiative was announced. However, the government continues to gloss over the matter on the grounds that it was an administrative contradiction. In fact, the minister's performance today really has not improved the matter. He now seems to have confirmed the worst fears of those rural families who will now not receive Austudy, notwithstanding the fact that they may hold a health care card. What the minister is saying is that it is all right to have good health in the bush, but it is not all right to have a good education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debacle has struck at rural areas in particular, as it is the families from rural Australia who are most affected by the inflexible assets test attached to Austudy and a range of other government benefits. The real tragedy is that many of these families may have assets beyond the limits, but one cannot eat one's assets. Many of these assets are not realisable and there are many cases of people having to consider these assets as saleable and realisable assets. As we have seen in the last 12 months, in many cases they cannot get people to look at these assets. </PARA>

The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) acknowledged the group working on behalf of isolated children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the bleating of the opposition, the government is aware of the very special problems of rural children. This is why the assistance for isolated children scheme exists. It helps isolated parents with the cost of sending their children to school. The assistance is significant. Last year 13,000 students qualified for assistance at a cost of $22 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the opposition does not tell anyone is that the assets test for isolated children was abolished last year. In any case, the assets test for Austudy is particularly generous. To fail the assets test, a farmer or business person must have unleveraged equity worth $738,700, and these are net assets assessed at current market value, minus outstanding debt incurred in gaining or improving. The house and acres of surrounds are not counted as assets at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is saying that this does not take into account natural disasters such as drought. Not even this government can make it rain. In any case, honourable members should understand that Austudy is about education and not about drought relief. When the honourable member for Menzies and his colleague the honourable member for Maranoa rose in this House, I could not help feeling that it reminded me of a couple of roosters I once owned, who used to crow quite often because they believed the sun came up for them. Those opposite crow on such trivial issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When substantive issues affecting education are raised in this House, the coalition and particularly Dad's Army on the front bench&mdash;everyone here knows this is true&mdash;greet their introduction, let alone their substance, with a big yawn. The opposition simply does not take education seriously. In stark contrast to the appalling performance of the opposition when it was in government, and more latterly the neglect of schools by Liberal state governments, this federal Labor government has steered a remarkable revolution in education in this country. Certainly, that process is not complete. Schooling of five- to 14-year-olds, which is in the main the responsibility of state governments, requires much needed additional resources. This is an area for future debate in this House that would be in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, over the last 10 years Australia has considerably raised the education levels of its work force. As the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) pointed out, the proportion of young people who now complete secondary school has risen from 36 per cent in 1982 to well over 80 per cent. The number of students enrolled in higher education has increased from 335,000 in 1983 to 533,000 last year. TAFE colleges are approaching 1.8 million full-time, part-time and external students, including 700,000 students in non-vocational, recreation and leisure courses. These are remarkable figures; figures which a mean-spirited opposition should acknowledge but never does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister indicated, Austudy was introduced by the federal Labor government in 1987. I remind opposition members that the scheme is about targeting and is about access to education. The aim of the scheme is to assist students from low income families, or whose own incomes are low, to stay in education until the end of high school and then to gain a post-secondary qualification. It is a targeted scheme; it should be a targeted scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Austudy scheme involves substantial expenditure of taxpayers' money. Spending on student assistance has risen from $269 million in 1983 to $1.56 billion in 1993-94. The federal government's policy on income support for students has led to an increase of over 120 per cent in the number of students receiving assistance. I remind opposition members that in 1983 there were 152,000 students in the schemes that preceded Austudy. Last year, as the minister also indicated, 500,000 students benefited from this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, there are assets limits. Perhaps it is useful to remind honourable members just what they are. For families with dependent students there is an assets limit of $369,350; for single independent students it is $110,000; and for married students it is a combined $156,800. Austudy takes into account the net market value of assets. The scheme also applies a 50 per cent discount on certain business and farm assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assets test is waived where the student's parent or spouse receives certain pensions from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It is also waived where a parent or spouse is receiving assistance from farm household support. Certainly, the Austudy assets test operates on an all or nothing basis; we accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Income test thresholds also apply. I remind the House again that it is a targeted scheme for low income families. It is about access for ordinary kids to education. Yes, there is a personal income test, which has been modified over the past couple of years, and so there should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assessable fringe benefits&mdash;this seems to be an area of concern to the opposition&mdash;involve the total value of fringe benefits in excess of $1,000 received in the relevant fringe benefit year through the employment by each parent or spouse in respect of organising lower salaries through the payment of school fees, private health insurance, housing, low interest loans and provision of a motor vehicle. This is income. Surely, the opposition does not dispute the fact that these fringe benefits are in effect income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Family income is also adjusted for dependent children in the following amounts: $3,700 for each dependent child aged 16 to 22 in full-time education; $1,200 for the first other dependent child under 16; and $2,500 for each subsequent dependent child under 16. One could mount an argument for a more generous income and assets test, but that is a bit rich coming from the opposition. In fact, it is outrageous for the opposition to claim that this government is disregarding the welfare of families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite belong to the party of youth starvation wages, the party which believes that access to education should be driven by high incomes; that, irrespective of people's ability, they should get into university as long as they have the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is in no position to talk about the needs and aspirations of Australian families. This is the party which was committed to slashing $20 million from payments to Australian children by raising the minimum Austudy cut-off by 50 per cent. In fact, those opposite have not abandoned that commitment. It is still there even though they do not like to be reminded of it. But let us not be misled: it is still on the opposition's policy books. In fact, an analysis shows that it would have accomplished even more than they hoped, because it would have taken more than $30 million from the pockets of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition feigns moral concern in this matter; the opposition feigns indignation; and the opposition feigns concern for Australian families. But nowhere in its policies does it even think about abolishing the assets test for Austudy. Will any member opposite deny that? The simple fact is that nowhere in its policies does it even think about abolishing the assets test for Austudy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Austudy program illustrates the tactical idiocy of the opposition in attacking the government for one of the government's greatest and most accepted programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austudy is about kids having access to education. It is an extremely complex scheme. It has to accommodate the enormously different needs and circumstances of over half a million Australians and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister rightly pointed out, this is a spurious matter of public importance, as those opposite know full well. However, as I said at the beginning, it does focus on education and this very important portfolio does deserve attention from the opposition. Unfortunately, that seldom happens. Hitting the roof with fake outrage about minor matters simply indicates that there is little in the attic. I challenge honourable members opposite on future days in this House to raise substantive, constructive matters of education. That is right and proper. However, they would do themselves greater credit if they analysed what they are doing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill before the House will provide the necessary means through which Australian industry will be able to approach the next century assured that its intellectual property and innovative ideas will be accorded proper protection. In the past, Australia has failed to make the most of its innovative products and ideas. Indeed, it is really only since the present government came to office in 1983 that we have seen the expansion of the intellectual property sector. It is important to realise that the promotion of new ideas and inventions is critical to Australia's development over the next few decades. The process of making the necessary changes that will provide the conditions to transform our economic and industrial culture to an export oriented, high-tech culture is one that the government is committed to. I welcome that initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to realise that the recognition of Australian intellectual expertise will not only benefit the export of physical products but will also lead to an increase in international demand for Australian expertise and educational services. Indeed, as was stated in the Senate on Wednesday last week, the foreign earnings from the tertiary education sector in 1993 were in excess of $1.2 billion, and are forecast to pass $2 billion by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Industry, Research and Development Act 1986 allow for the extension of discretionary grants under the industry innovation program to the end of 1995. Government support of innovation by industry has been very helpful in transforming the export sector. The McKinsey report of June last year stated that the activities of Austrade and other government support schemes contributed to the changed attitudes of many firms to exporting. Once again, this is a very important initiative for improving Australia's export opportunities and balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of industry assistance programs are of the kind that actually make a difference to businesses wishing to increase their levels of research and development. They do not promote a handout mentality, but actually encourage the reshaping of corporate structures to develop good ideas over time that will obtain a commercial or market outcome on their own merits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not Menzies-style protectionism that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) referred to on Monday. The National Party members of the opposition cannot seem to accept that the days of relying on quotas and high tariff protection are over. As unfortunate as that is, it is a fact of life in the modern trade world. The only way to assist industry is to come up with meaningful ideas that will enhance competitiveness and encourage innovation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The discretionary grants scheme is aimed at those companies which cannot adequately benefit from the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development purposes because they are unprofitable or have a company structure which is ineligible for the deduction. The generic technology grants scheme is aimed at supporting innovative, commercially driven research and development projects which are likely to be of particular significance to the growth of Australian industry. Five technologies have been identified for support under the scheme: biotechnology, manufacturing and materials technology, environmental technology and&mdash;the two of most interest to me in this debate&mdash;information technology and communications technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As some honourable members might recall, last Wednesday I mentioned the work of the Ipswich Regional Development Corporation in my electorate. The IRDC is a body made up of representatives of the city council, other local authorities and local business people who are heavily involved in trying to establish new and innovative industries in the Ipswich region. The corporation has a stated aim of transforming the Ipswich region into an area in which new technologies and ideas can be used, firstly, to establish new sunrise industry, and, secondly, to make existing industries more competitive by increasing their involvement in the emerging technologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good example of their objectives can be found in the plans to establish the Ipswich global info-links project. I suppose honourable members are wondering what that is all about. I will try to explain it. It is a joint development initiative of the IRDC and the Ipswich City Council. It is exactly the sort of project that is needed in the Ipswich region, and I am sure in other regions in Australia. It is a great example of a small organisation thinking big. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, the concept of the info-links project involves providing a link between the information highways, which have developed through the creation of international databases, and the Ipswich region. Info-links will be incorporated into the new resource centre under construction at present. This will also house the new Ipswich City Council Library. It will enable all people, but particularly the business sector, to access the latest available information in their field of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Via info-links, the region will be connected to the rest of the world and will be able to build special relationships with the business community, TAFE, universities, primary and secondary schools, community groups, government authorities, individuals, international organisations and news services. The university concept will be very important. Also being pushed in Ipswich at the moment is the establishment of a new campus, either as part of the Queensland University or the University of Southern Queensland. This will flow on from and become a very important part of that initiative. Being able to receive the latest information from these groups will ensure that the region becomes more competitive and innovative. To those associated with this project I offer my congratulations. I think they are really on the right track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This project is the result of a very long process of consultation. It did not happen without a lot of hard work and lobbying on the part of the IRDC and the council. Their commitment and dedication to their goal is a promising development in the area of technological innovation in the Ipswich region. They are to be congratulated on their efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also enthusiastic about the info-links project&mdash;I am trying to encourage it to be enthusiastic about it and I have been getting a lot of encouragement from the Minister for Communications (Mr Lee). I have arranged for a delegation from the IRDC and the Ipswich City Council to meet with the minister on 23 March to discuss the info-links project and to see whether there is any way the Commonwealth government can support this project. I thank the minister in advance for making that time available. I look forward to the discussions we will be having with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment before us today also seeks to change the way Australia reciprocates with other countries in terms of our rules relating to the protection of industrial property; in other words, the level of protection provided by foreign trade mark and patent laws to Australian inventions, and the concurrent security we provide for foreign innovations. Australia is a signatory to a number of international conventions dealing with the protection of industrial property. At present the wording of subsection 48(1) of the Designs Act 1906 limits the definition of these conventions to the terms: treaty, convention, arrangement or engagement between the Commonwealth and another country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government feels that these terms are unnecessarily limiting and could potentially inhibit the formation of reciprocal industrial property arrangements that would be in the national interest. During the process of transforming the economy into the export driven, high-tech economy it must be to survive and prosper in the next century, we must not lock ourselves out of any potentially beneficial agreements. There is little doubt that our future does lie in a high-tech economy. Australians are particularly smart in the high-tech area, and they will certainly need every encouragement from government and our community as time progresses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August last year a memorandum of understanding, the MOU, was signed between the Australian Commerce and Industry Office and the Taiwan Bureau of National Standards. These amendments to subsection 48(1) of the Designs Act 1906 would give the same level of recognition to arrangements like MOUs as that given to more formalised agreements, such as treaties and conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members by now know, as indeed most Australians know, how necessary it is for Australia to succeed in the reorientation of our economic interest into the Asia-Pacific region. This process will be aided by the establishment of industrial property agreements with countries that may not be signatories to formal treaties. The Taiwanese MOU is very encouraging, particularly in view of the recent developments in my own electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of weeks ago I met a trade delegation from Taiwan in my electorate office. Their visit was arranged through the auspices of the IRDC, which I mentioned earlier. The delegation expressed interest in investing in primary and secondary industries in the Ipswich region, which includes the Brisbane and Lockyer valleys. Developments like this are extremely encouraging for industry and will assist in the process that this amendment legislation is concerned with. The MOU signed between Taiwan and Australia will provide the necessary protection for the innovative measures in the primary and secondary industries in the region and allow them to become commercial export earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to take up too much time of the House, but I would like to say now that this legislation will provide the necessary conditions under which the research and development can power the future direction and prosperity of the economy. By amending the laws relating to trade marks, patents and designs, the legislation will give producers greater incentive to increase the pace of technological change. This will lead to commercially focused research and development aimed at improving product, process and service innovation. The amendments will also allow the innovators to proceed with their plans with greater security than presently exists with regard to international protection of industrial property. The extension of the industry research and development grants, which I referred to earlier, under the industry innovation program will give further incentive to industry and will assist in the development of Australian expertise in important technological areas of the international economy. The administrative amendments to the Designs Act will streamline the process of registering patents and the granting of industrial property rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to have the opportunity to support these amendments which are before the House today. Some of the earlier speakers today&mdash;as I said before question time today&mdash;have already taken the opportunity to talk about a lot of the government's innovations over the last 10 or 11 years. Those innovations have been very important. It is good to have this sort of bill before the House to explain a lot of those innovations. It has been a wide-ranging debate and it has been important both for the government and the opposition. I congratulate the minister on the initiatives that he has taken in bringing forward these amendments which actually streamline a lot of things and which will help industry in Australia to progress further in these times when things are not progressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to talk about the need to assist industry. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) asked a question today about interest rates in one particular banking sector. It is important to highlight those matters. I know there is a bit of interest in the honourable member's question and he raised a very valid point. The honourable member was referring not only to the particular banks or lending institutions but to the fact that not always do we have the flexibility in the banking system that our businesses need. We need to monitor interest rates very closely because, whilst interest rates are considered to be down at the present time, in reality they are not always low in a lot of our lending institutions. I hope the minister will take that on board today, investigate it and take the Treasurer (Mr Willis) through those processes to ensure that the banks are brought to heel on that issue. Unless our banking industries, our lending institutions, become more flexible in how they assist business, we are not going to get anywhere in assisting our industries to develop. There needs to be more flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a deregulation process in the banking industry over many years and the banks have those opportunities now to provide more flexible lending. I do not think they are doing as much as they can. I encourage them to do something like that because we often see that the smaller industries which need the greater assistance do not get the assistance they need from our banks. The big fellows are often big enough and powerful enough to negotiate the best deals. It is not always the same for a lot of our people in small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us think about the number of small businesses in Australia and link that to the unemployment factors. It is often said that we have 700,000 or 800,000 small businesses&mdash;there is probably a lot more than that with the small family operations&mdash;and the small operations are the ones that do need a lot of assistance and encouragement from their lenders. Naturally, there are some risks in those areas but banks have to be prepared to take risks and to spread their risk in some of those areas to help those businesses. If we do not get some sort of flexibility in those areas we will need to use our opportunities in this place to say to the bankers out there in the commerce world that they must look for ways to encourage and assist all the industries that really need genuine help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have discussed research and development ideas in this debate&mdash;all the great ideas Australians actually have&mdash;and the fact that we cannot get Australian industry to participate in those areas. We have a problem. It is because our lenders are probably far too conservative in their lending when it comes to picking up some of these ideas&mdash;even when looking at trying to encourage some more joint ventures within Australia. Honourable members on both sides of this place realise that there are so many great Australian ideas that are lost to overseas. History is full of the great ideas that we have missed out on&mdash;there are too many for me to mention here this afternoon. Often I think it is because there is a shortage of funding in that area. We should encourage, once again, our lending institutions&mdash;whether it be the existing Australian banks or whether it be those foreign banks who want to come into Australia&mdash;to take a risk. Perhaps when the foreign banks come here to take out their licences we should say to them, `We want you to help our industry in this particular way'. In saying that, they might look at niche marking in some areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier today, we are good at research and development, through CSIRO, but after that we do not get to the manufacturing side of things. That is where we are lost and that is where we really need to focus a lot of our efforts&mdash;it is a whole community effort as well. It is not entirely a matter for government but government needs to encourage the efforts, but we also need to encourage our banking industries and all those businesses to be more innovative in a lot of their ideas. A bill like this is a good opportunity for us to put those sorts of things on the record, and hopefully someone will pick up on them. I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to rise to support this bill today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Oxley has some good ideas. I am sure that he would improve the banking industry, the way it stands in Australia. The Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 that we are discussing here is quite important to Australia. We have seen a lot of technology developed in different areas. It is probably going to help to secure that technology for Australia. Certainly, other areas in that field not addressed by this bill need to be addressed by the government to maintain that technology in Australia and also to nurture and to help develop that so we can manufacture those things rather than having the drain that we have seen and that the honourable member for Oxley mentioned in his address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be fair to describe this as a fairly dry piece of legislation which is non-contentious. However, I would like to discuss some important points. The main issues that I would like to discuss today involve Australia's commitment or lack of commitment to research and development and Australia's continued lack of attention to the brain drain that is currently taking place in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is supposed to be not only the lucky country but also the clever country. Our competitive advantage is supposed to be found in our science and technology, our research and development and our commitment to innovation. If we listen to the speakers from both sides in the MPI this afternoon, that will continue. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) told us about</PARA>
<PARA>the increased number of people who have been retained in high schools, the increased number of people who are going on to tertiary education in all forms, so that we can become a highly educated country. We can see the development of further technology that will go on in this country with the assistance and guidance of government, but we have to look beyond that. The emphasis is on research and development. But the government is not emphasising the ongoing development of that technology&mdash;manufacture and marketing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, I have yet to see this happen. In my brief time as a federal member, I have had several constituents come into my office with excellent, practical ideas that would be an advancement for our society in some shape or form. They have been near desperate to find some sort of funding and support but have been unable to find it within this country. One gentleman, having just completed a course under the government's new enterprise incentive scheme, NEIS, which is one of the much touted labour market programs that the government is always talking about&mdash;I agree that it is a very good program; it is working well in my electorate&mdash;has been unable to find sponsorship, venture capital or support for the technology that he has developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is he now? He has left the country and taken his technology elsewhere. He had to go elsewhere to get funding for the product that he had developed and to get the support to develop, manufacture and market it. Another person who had developed technology within the electorate of Lyne came into my electorate office at the end of last year. Where is he now? He is in America. He had to go to America to get support to get his product off the ground, to get support to develop and manufacture it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must not lose our focus that towards the next century science, technology and education will be the principal means by which a nation secures its competitive advantage. We must start developing a national strategy to maximise our capacity in these areas, underpinning future industrial development. We must start incorporating research and development into our overall approach to industry. We must start getting smarter in the way we approach these matters so that we have in place a mechanism that is able to prevent our ideas and initiatives from going overseas, as is currently happening. We are taking a step forward here today, I believe, but we are ignoring the next stage in the development of technology. We must focus on that from here on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To emphasise my point, an example which the government seems to enjoy drawing upon so much is our comparative position within the OECD. In the area of industry investment in research and development, a decade ago Australian industry ranked 17th out of 24 OECD countries. Today, despite all the government's rhetoric of recent years and despite an efficiency drive and lift in business effort by most businesses, our position within the OECD remains the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as manufacturing is concerned, we have one of the lowest comparative levels of growth in the OECD in the past 15 years, despite recent growth in exports of elaborately transformed manufactures. As a merchandise exporter, Australia fell from 18th in 1980 to 22nd in 1990. In important key east Asian markets&mdash;the ones that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) believes our future lies within&mdash;Australia's market share fell from 4.3 per cent in the mid-1980s to 3.8 per cent in the early 1990s. This fall in market share has been described by many, including the government's own Industry Commission, as a result of our declining competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly, the competitive edge in all industries is technology based, yet there are only about 1,000 consistent R&amp;D performing companies in Australia. This is out of a total of around 500,000 or more. This is extremely worrying for the future direction of this country. Developing competitive advantage is the key to our nation's future in this area. The government must start taking the hard decisions in addressing the issue of why markets are failing in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth taking time to quote from the NFF's pre-budget submission for this year, which also falls into line with its industry policy submission. To its credit, the NFF has brought up this issue of market failure and has argued its case clearly and succinctly. The NFF states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One specific area where market failure appears to occur to some degree is in the provision of finance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is going back to the comments made by the honourable member for Oxley&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to small and medium sized businesses, including farmers. In the case of debt markets, the absence of a legislated requirement for banks to publish a comparative cost of credit on their loan packages amounts to a restraint on competition.

<PARA>In the areas of innovation and R&amp;D, we have seen market failure over the last few years. They have failed to provide sufficient competitive pressures to produce economically and socially desirable outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be fair to this government, it has almost been forced to intervene, but it has intervened in a debilitating fashion. Instead of using government intervention in a way that overcomes market failure, the government has intervened in a negative way that has, if anything, imposed new distortions. The government must address these distortions that it has created so that R&amp;D and industry innovation can at least be given a chance to contribute to Australia's future. In saying this, I think now is a very important time for the future of Australia's industry, with the COAG meeting in Hobart taking on board many of the Hilmer recommendations. Therefore, I call on the government to review this area of industry R&amp;D and structure its interventionist policies so that it provides a real competitive advantage for the future of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that we should do away with government intervention altogether. I am saying that we need to review our current tariff and protectionist policies to see whether they can be used more efficiently. There are real dangers in the free market economics of economic rationalism, and I think Australia has built itself historically into a position where a positive mix can be developed and should be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, under this government, I think we are seeing in many sectors of industry an inefficient approach to government control. The area of R&amp;D and innovation industry is a clear example of government indecision about what it perceives for the future and what it perceives its own role for the present to be. It is clearly evident. The government must put its own structure in place that actually encourages private investment in innovation and R&amp;D and not as currently exists where R&amp;D is totally hamstrung by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer here to the legislation and, in particular, the range of amendments to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986. I welcome schemes such as the discretionary grants schemes and the generic technology grants from the government. However, if we are looking towards these industries as our future, we must be putting legislation in place that will secure our place in the marketplace for years to come. Therefore, I will be interested to see how these legislative changes operate when they become law and to see how successful they are in further encouraging reform in the areas of innovation and R&amp;D. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the recent success of the Hilmer report, we need to identify some of the dangers of joint venture funding in the commercialisation of R&amp;D. One company in my electorate of Lyne has already had the experience, and had its fingers burnt, of going into a joint venture with one of this government's instrumentalities. Gerard Cassegrain and Co. entered into a joint research and development arrangement with CSIRO. At the time, the agreement was heralded as a great example of the commercialisation of Australian research and development. The company that was formed, Cassiro, was an incorporated company owned equally by CSIRO and Cassegrain. The aim was to maximise the economic benefit of existing and future Australian innovations through commercialisation in the best interests of Australia. Several products were launched, such as a soil slotting project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go any further into the details of the outcome of this joint venture between CSIRO and Cassegrain, but it certainly was not in the best interests of the taxpayers of Australia or of development of R&amp;D and technology in this country. Some very good technology was developed and it is presently located in a cupboard somewhere without gaining any benefit for the Commonwealth or the taxpayers of this country. It will be interesting to read the Auditor-General's report into that aspect of the commercialisation of R&amp;D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to welcome the opening up of R&amp;D and innovation to the free market. It is naturally the goal that we must strive for, but we must be extremely wary of the dangers that are faced by this sector, such as the problems that occurred with CSIRO and the Cassegrain family. We must not sacrifice this sector in our rush to incorporate the ideals of the Hilmer report because it is a vital sector of industry that really is the future of this country. I therefore put it to the government that, while the coalition welcomes these minor administrative changes within this bill, the government must not lose sight of the need to make industry innovation and R&amp;D a key to the future of this country. I believe the opportunity to restore some energy and vitality to this sector of the community is now before the government and this opportunity must not be lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must not be lost in the approaches the government is taking in protecting and ensuring that the technology being developed through R&amp;D projects is undertaken in Australia. But we have to go further and look at, once that is developed and realised, how we capitalise and market that technology. That is where we are losing out at the moment: we are not going on to the next stage. I often wonder why. Every constituent we bump into, when we start talking about research and development, innovations and technology development, says, `Why are we losing all these things to overseas countries? Why do they go to America? Why do they go to Europe? Why do they go to Britain?'. A lot stay here, but some very good developments go overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hark back to the comment made by the honourable member for Oxley that we cannot fund these developments. Why can we not fund them? Is the commercial banking industry in this country not good enough to fund some of these things? Are a lot of our industries developing this technology not good enough to support financially? Having regard to the way the banking industry during the 1980s supported a lot of the entrepreneurs and got their fingers burnt, are they not good enough to support? Those of us that are small fry, as it were, to the banking industry are paying the price for that. </PARA>

Why have we not got in this country some government or semi-government instrumentality that can provide that venture capital to a lot of these smaller enterprises that are developing world standard technology? They cannot get funding or support in this country, so they leave. We see them setting up in countries such as the United States of America where the government gives them all the tax breaks under the sun and provides them with interest free loans to develop factories and to develop the tooling to manufacture their technology. Then what happens? It is exported to Australia. We import products that were originally developed in this country. That is a very sad situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government&mdash;it does not matter whether it is the Labor government that is in power now or a future coalition government&mdash;has to address this situation because we are spending an absolute fortune in taxpayers' money in this country today educating our young people to a much higher level. We will be developing much higher technology and manufacturing new products in the future. We have to be prepared to fund the manufacture and the marketing of those products. Special consideration needs to be given to developing the tooling and the manufacturing skills and providing the venture capital to go on and market those products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that deserves comment in this debate is the fact that we need to have far more focus on and direct special consideration to the development of R&amp;D and technology in industries that are located in regional areas of Australia. The Country Manufacturers Association of New South Wales last year conducted&mdash;I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Newell, have some members of the Country Manufacturers Association of New South Wales in your electorate&mdash;a very extensive study on a broad range of issues concerning manufacturers located outside of the metropolitan areas of Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong. It came up with some astounding statistics. The study found that they were very competitive, did not receive the sort of consideration that they should be receiving from government&mdash;both the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments; I will not just lay the blame here&mdash;and that they are relieving the pressure, as it were, on not only the infrastructure but also the environment in the Sydney basin. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), who is at the table, comes from that area of the Sydney basin that needs relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another study was done by the Country Mayors Association of New South Wales, funded under the OLMA program&mdash;another labour market program in place at the moment. That study highlighted the need for more consideration to be given and for greater focus to be put on those manufacturing industries that are really moving ahead in leaps and bounds in a lot of their R&amp;D and technology outside of the metropolitan areas of New South Wales so that it becomes easier for them to operate and so that they can become more competitive. That will enable them to operate on an equitable basis in their locality with those industries operating within metropolitan areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A big challenge there for the government is to seriously consider its approach to the development of manufacturing industries in areas such as my electorate, the electorate of my colleague the honourable member Cowper (Mr Nehl) and your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the comments made by my colleague the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) and take great heart from what he had to say. He has shown great enthusiasm and great support for the part that industry and technology will play in the development of Australia. With this legislation, the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, it is quite obvious that the government at long last is making some attempt to recognise the strong part that industry and technology play in the development of industry and the development of technology in Australia. I was delighted to see the change to the portfolio and the description of regional development being included in the portfolio when the changes were made. It was recognition at long last of the part that regional areas play in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment on the document that was put out by the task force on regional development entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Developing Australia: a regional perspective</EMPHASIS>. The way in which this task force developed under the chairmanship of Mr Bill Kelty was quite interesting, as was the way in which it carried out its task. It visited a number of centres throughout Australia; no less than 60 regions were visited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the deliberations of the task force, I found myself in the unusual situation of receiving a copy of a media release which was forwarded to my office under the letterhead of the task force on regional development and entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Task force report to boost Ballarat and Central Highlands</EMPHASIS>. I proudly indicate to the House that I represent the area of Bendigo, and at the moment the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) is at the table. I read this release with great interest because I wanted to see what the task force was proposing for Ballarat under regional development, what it would be doing for industries in that area and what it would be doing for technological development in regions outside the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read this document which, in fact, went on to spell out what the regional task force was all about. But it made one very bad error. Quite obviously, in the word processing of this particular press release the areas got mixed up. I suppose that after visiting 60 centres the members of the task force did not quite know whether they were in Bendigo or Ballarat but they made the following reference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would also be the opportunity to establish a new regional development framework, improved access to Tullamarine airport and the port of Melbourne&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>My colleague the honourable member for Ballarat would be the first to agree that Ballarat probably has the best access to Tullamarine airport of any area in the whole of Australia. It is part of the national highway grid&mdash;a beautiful four-lane highway which goes all the way from Ballarat almost to the airport door. So I am quite sure a very bad error was made in this press release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contacted the secretariat of the task force asking if it would mind forwarding down a copy of the release on Bendigo. Surprise, surprise! Bendigo, which has one of the worst highways in the state, which connects with Tullamarine airport, does not rate a mention; it simply does not rate a mention. However, there is mention of improving the road infrastructure. I am sure the task force got it wrong, and I have reminded it of that. I have been in contact with the task force, told it that it got that wrong and that it should do something to correct it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very real need to improve the road links between centres like Tullamarine airport, the capital city of Melbourne and regional centres like Bendigo. This is one of the aspects that needs particular attention. I am concerned&mdash;and I think the honourable member for Lyne would share my concern&mdash;that the government's thrust in regional development includes capital cities in some of the regions. There is concern amongst other regions throughout Australia that capital cities, which already are congested and have enormous environmental problems and associated costs, will end up getting the lion's share of any money that is put into regional development because they will be considered with other regions outside of capital cities in the allocation of funds for industry and technological development. That is a concern of mine, and I am sure it would be a concern of the honourable member for Lyne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task force went further. It recognised the fact that one of the major impediments to the development of Australian industry is the infrastructure requirements not only in the capital cities but also in regional areas. The task force recognised that there must be new roads, fast train links to regional centres and improved port and airport facilities. In fact, it went quite a long way down the track of recommending that airport facilities should be privatised in many instances to improve their efficiency, so that industry and manufacturers in Australia can have access to good overseas flight services and transport facilities so that they can get their products into overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An interesting recommendation from the task force, chaired by the ACTU secretary, Mr Kelty, was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the creation of new financial instruments and markets to increase the ability of regions to attract private investment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that the task force falls back upon private investment to start stimulating the economy and get those regional pooled development funds up and operating. I think the government would be wise to take note of that, but whether it will be able to encourage private sector investment and development in areas outside the metropolitan area will be a task that it needs to address very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area that attracted my attention in this release was the admission by the chairman of the regional task force that the government's policy on industry matters was simply not working. The second page of the release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bendigo could also benefit from the recommendation for a regionally sensitive industry policy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I think the same words were included in the release for the city of Ballarat. To me, that is a clear admission that the government's industry policies in regional centres are simply not working. I think there is a recognition there. Obviously, this task force had been to these 60 centres throughout Australia, had looked at the opportunities for industry development in regional centres and had found that the government's industry policies were simply not working. Quite obviously, that recognition by Mr Kelty, the chairman, has been relayed to the government. It will be interesting to see what response the government gives to that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transport infrastructure, which I mentioned earlier, was an issue which repeatedly cropped up in any discussions of regional development. Quite obviously, Australia is a very major manufacturing area, but it also has the difficult problem of being a large country. The additional transport costs incurred where industries are established in various locations throughout the country can be a significant impediment to the development of industry. One of the recommendations which this task force came up with was that transport infrastructure should be financed through a combination of private and public investment, together with the part or total sale of major airports&mdash;which I mentioned earlier&mdash;and, for roads, the exclusive use of additional revenue from any increased petrol taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say to the government that any suggestion of increased petrol taxes in country Australia would be absolutely abhorrent to its residents and would add markedly to the costs of their manufacturing enterprises as well as their domestic travel and any other business travel. Country people already pay an excessively high amount of fuel tax and excise because they are reliant upon their private vehicles and their business vehicles for their transport. Public transport throughout many centres of Australia is sadly deficient. In fact, country manufacturers and country residents are already paying a much higher impost on fuel prices in regard to tax and excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Mr Kelty's recommendation to the government should be discounted if there is to be any proper regional development throughout Australia. We must remember that most of the food produced in Australia comes from and is processed in many regional areas. Adding another impost by way of increasing the cost of fuel would impact not only on our domestic market but also on our overseas markets because of the cost of that food. I ask the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), who is at the table, to relay those matters to the government because this issue is of great importance in developing the regions of Australia to an efficient level. These people could not bear any further increases in petrol prices. I commend the minister at the table. I know he has had a lifetime interest in science and technology. I compliment him on his interest in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long in this country we have neglected the development of the brains in the science field. There is still a brain drain out of Australia. Young people with ability and knowledge are still going overseas because of a lack of opportunities in this country. I know that from personal experience, with two of my children at various times living and working in other countries. Fortunately, one of them has come back, but one is still away, waiting for the Australian economy to improve and for an opportunity of employment back here in Australia. That is just one isolated example; there are many thousands of examples throughout Australia. I think it is great that young people take the opportunity to go overseas and develop their skill and expertise, but I would like to think that, ultimately, after they have gathered that information and knowledge, they will be able to come back to this country and put that knowledge and expertise to good use for the development of this country, particularly in the fields of industry and technology. I think it is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the two volumes of the report from the task force on regional development have been handed back to the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), who was the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development at that time. I am a little uncertain at the moment about where the industry portfolio is really moving. We will be waiting with great interest to see what the government does in response to that report and what the new minister who has the responsibility for industry and technology does with the response to it, because it is absolutely crucial to Australian industry and technology and the development of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the most revered wish of manufacturers and industry in this country is for government to get out of the way, to reduce some of the restrictions and impediments and red tape that surround their activities, and to allow business to get on and become internationally competitive and efficient and to develop Australia's industry to a very high level. </PARA>

I have yet to see a government bill which leads me to believe that the Australian Labor Party is looking after regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate of Grey can be described as regional. I can say without exaggeration that the government has made the task of development for Grey a very hard one. In fact, I can recall no substantial development or injection of jobs in Grey since the establishment of Olympic Dam, apart from the recent $100,000 grant to one of the regional cities during the state election campaign. However, this money pales into insignificance when we consider the rises in excise, which the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) mentioned. Of course, we have the wholesale sales tax as well. The excise and the wholesale sales tax were collected in a matter of weeks. By that standard, the government funding injection is insignificant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olympic Dam was very strongly opposed by Labor. Olympic Dam, which is a real jewel in South Australia&mdash;and certainly in the electorate of Grey&mdash;is based on the latest technology in mining. If we look at Labor's record on this matter, we see that it was opposed not on a technological basis but on environmental grounds and an opposition to uranium mining, but it does typify this government's role in and attitude to regional development. If it were not for the courage of one Labor man, Roxby Downs, or Olympic Dam, would be just a few test holes in the desert. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Woomera is another community in the electorate which would benefit greatly from improvements in industry policy and in the application of technology through the Australian Space Agency, particularly, and through the technology of satellites and any other option that the new technologies might offer. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has made his views quite clear about the future of Nurrungar. Whilst it is not proven at this stage, I think we all must be aware of it. The community of Woomera would very much appreciate every opportunity made by this parliament to apply new technologies and use the facilities that are currently lying relatively idle at Woomera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned Olympic Dam and the encouragement that the Liberal government gave to that project. I also mentioned the opposition that came from the Labor Party at that time. In my electorate, the Liberal government was also behind the power station at Port Augusta, the Moomba gas fields, Stony Point, and Whyalla's great period of expansion during the Playford era. I have to go back that far to look at when Grey, and electorates like Grey, had significant development. It stands in contrast to what we have seen from the Labor Party. At Whyalla we saw the shipyards close down and the steel industry simply contract. On Monday the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who I acknowledge has had an interest in regional development, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have found that in the many and diverse parts of Australia there are many people who have a strong desire to make their community fully participate in Australia's development. A key role of this government will be to tap into that desire and harness it . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I say to the honourable member that this desire to fully participate has been with regional Australia for a very long time&mdash;long before he discovered it. Further, regional Australia has been participating and doing more than its fair share. It has been producing most of this country's exports for over 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that the honourable member for Herbert's use of the word `harness' was unfortunate. It describes rather aptly the government's tying down, its restriction, of regional development. Rather we should be considering, as the highest priority, the harnessing of our technology, our people and equally as important our private enterprise ethic, particularly that of small business, which sadly this government with its corporate approach loses track of. The government has made a habit of putting hurdles in the way of regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already mentioned fuel excise, but I will mention it again for the record. The Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) yesterday described fuel excise and other increases in taxation in the last 12 months as minor matters. I will keep reminding him of these minor matters for I know that the regions do not regard the price of fuel as minor. This minor matter, the fuel excise, collects $8.4 billion for the government coffers. This minor matter will collect an extra $788 million in 1993-94 as a result of the government's hiking up the price of fuel. This minor matter touches everything we do in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I questioned the Minister for Resources on the impact of the budget tax increases on our exporters, particularly our agricultural exporters. This is the irony of regional development; we get so carried away with the mood of the moment that we forget that our agricultural exporters still offer great potential for development. The productivity rates are still double the national average. In reply to my question about the tax increases on exporters, the minister said that the diesel fuel rebate of $440 million was far bigger than any increases in taxes imposed on exporters. The budget increase in general sales tax alone is estimated to raise an extra $435 million for the government in 1993-94; added to that, tens of millions of dollars have come from the wine tax and $788 million from the fuel excise, which we have already mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is true that some exporters derive relief through the diesel fuel rebate scheme, the manufacturing and tourism industries must pay for the full impact of the fuel excise increase. All export industries are affected by the increased costs of road, rail and coastal shipping transport since all of these modes will pay the full increase in fuel excise. On top of the government's hike in the price of fuel, the regions face a differential pricing policy&mdash;the honourable member for Bendigo touched on this&mdash;where suppliers of fuel in the regions cannot buy fuel for the same price as their city counterparts can retail it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear much criticism from this government about the view that we should let the market rule. It is a politically selective process which ignores what the market is doing presently.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An article by Julian Cribb in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> drew attention to the population drift from regional Australia. Mr Cribb had to dig deep to find this information because it is not abundant. I dare say that it is not information which this centralist government is terribly concerned about. The article stated that of the 240 communities that shrank in 1990-91, 210 were in regional areas. That is, 88 per cent of communities that shrank in size in this nation came from regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After reading this article, I studied a report on population growth and predictions for Australia and my own electorate. Not surprisingly, the report found that the top 20 areas for growth were municipalities of the six main capital cities. The report ranked 65 cities on their expected population growth. Town number one could expect the most growth, town number 65 could expect the least. The largest town in Grey is Whyalla, which ranked 58 in the list of 65. In fact, Whyalla had a negative ranking. Its population is expected to fall from about 26,000 in 1991 to 22,000 by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whyalla, as many honourable members would know, is the site of the BHP steelworks and a former shipyard. It is an industrial town that is desperate for new enterprises. The state government has come to the party by declaring Whyalla an enterprise zone with tax incentives to attract investment. The new Liberal state government has also met with potential investors to discuss new ventures for Whyalla. I cannot recall any federal government initiatives. According to the population report, all other regional centres in my electorate face a declining population&mdash;there is no expected growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cities, of course, have the communications, the transport services, the schools, the post offices, the banks and the TV channels which people want. These services are gradually being withdrawn from regional centres, helped in no small part by the centralist attitude of this government. People living in regional Australia do not give up easily; however, some are becoming pessimistic about the future of their regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An excellent report on the rural crisis, commissioned by the district council of Cleve and released in December last year, carried a survey of 50 local business operators. It asked the business people whether they felt Cleve was losing or gaining from the rural recession in contrast with other towns. Almost 50 per cent of the business people said they were losing while only 14 per cent felt that they were gaining. We are entering critical territory when local business people feel so pessimistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regions have a wealth of ideas for new industry and development, however they are faced with what has become an increasingly distant and arrogant federal government which thinks it knows best. We need to listen to the region, show a lead for development and give maximum encouragement and confidence to investors. That is what the regions need, but will they get it? So far all they have got is Bill Kelty and his task force on regional development. Kelty's task force has been criticised by almost everyone who has commented on it. One damning statement came from the previous Labor minister Peter Walsh, who said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> last month:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having set the Taskforce up, the Government will feel obliged to throw some money at its silly recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA>I fear he may be right. However, the new Minister for Industry Technology and Regional Development (Senator Cook), on taking on the role, said that the era of the handout mentality was over. One of the hallmarks of this government has been its handout philosophy. While some sections of society, and it just depends on which section we find ourselves in, need support&mdash;such as our aged widows, who do not get it&mdash;others need encouragement and not handouts. Encouragement from this government is sadly lacking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the incentive for people to take the risk to set up their own business? Where is the incentive for people to take responsibility for their destiny and contribute to Australia's wealth? It is a great irony of research and development in this country that, although we have ideas out there by the bucketful, I think only one in six come to fruition. It comes down to individuals being prepared to have a go and risk their effort, dollars and time to get these new concepts and new technologies going. That is what this country lacks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government makes many demands on business, which it does not bother itself with because a good old whiteboard will suffice. When a person contemplates setting up a small business he or she must also contemplate our convoluted superannuation system, which is particularly difficult for casual employees to benefit from; the training guarantee levy; workers compensation; and a myriad of legal requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers are also looking down the barrel of the government's Industrial Relations Reform Bill. I have the word `reform' in quotation marks on this page which I am reading from. I note that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Council Bulletin</EMPHASIS> also placed that word in quotations in an article last week. I guess that is what we would expect; it is an adversarial situation. But I think at the end of the day the Business Council and the trade union movement ultimately have to take joint responsibility and a joint approach which serves the national interest. In other words, the government's bill can only make things harder for the unemployed, not easier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Business Council also described the government's consultation with business employer groups as perfunctory during negotiations on the bill. The bill was damned as a missed opportunity. So there we have two of the government's latest ideas to pull Australia out of the mire&mdash;the Industrial Relations Reform Bill and the jobs levy&mdash;which were dumped on by the Business Council. Thankfully, the jobs levy seems to be attracting less and less support from those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Herbert stated on Monday that the government wished to preserve and enhance the institutions that have served the Australian people well. I think the Labor government has forgotten one of our greatest institutions&mdash;the institution called regional Australia.

<PARA>As was foreshadowed in the second reading speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay), the government is moving 17 amendments to the schedule to the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill consequent on the amendments to the bill agreed to in the Senate. None of the amendments are monumental. They do, however, tidy up the legislation and remove any unintended effects or ambiguities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the amendments, namely, those numbered 1 to 3, 7 to 9 and 12 to 15, do no more than remove the reference to regulations made under this act or any other act consequent on and consistent with Senate amendment Nos 1, 3 and 5. Amendment Nos 4 and 15 as proposed in this House by the government omit the now redundant changes to section 8A of the Designs Act and section 11 of the Trade Marks Act as originally proposed in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining amendments, Nos 5, 6, 10, 11, 16 and 17, are consistent with the intent of the Senate amendments but remove unintended and undesirable effects that would flow from the amendments as they currently stand. For instance, amendments Nos 5, 6, 16 and 17 will avoid any question arising as to whether `employee' in the Designs Act and the Trade Marks Act would have a different meaning from that in the Public Service Act. There is no doubt at present that the meanings are the same. However, the new reference to a `prescribed employee' within the meaning of the Public Service Act, which is to be included in the new section 8A of the Designs Act and the new section 11 of the Trade Marks Act, might import a meaning different from just `employee' within the meaning of the Public Service Act. It is not certain what the difference might be, but amendments Nos 5, 6, 16 and 17 avoid the question ever being raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other unintended effects of the Senate amendments as they currently stand flow from the amendment of the definition of `employee' in the Patents Act. In order to provide for parliamentary scrutiny of the delegation of powers by the Commissioner of Patents, the bill proposes that it will be necessary to prescribe the person to whom these powers could be delegated. This was intended to be achieved by revising the definition of `employee'. However, that has the undesirable effect, for example, of exempting employees&mdash;other than those prescribed as being able to exercise delegated powers&mdash;from the statutory prohibitions of trafficking in inventions and disclosing without authorisation information about the matters before the commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed amendment Nos 10 and 11 will amend the Patents Act with the same effect as the amendments to the delegation provisions of the Design Act and the Trade Marks Act but without the unintended and undesirable effects.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the requested amendments be not made.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments from the Senate do not take into account a lot of the advantages of the home child-care allowance. I want to say a few words about some of the advantages of the home child-care allowance, HCCA, and about some of the matters that were brought up in the Senate by the opposition with the support of the Independents, excluding the Australian Democrats. The government's proposals for the home child-care allowance were designed to provide significant advantage over the dependent spouse rebate, DSR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of advantages. Firstly, there is a more direct recognition of the support given to children by parents, generally mothers, who stay at home to raise their children. For the first time this support will be paid direct to the parent caring for the children rather than to the other partner as a tax concession. Some 840,000 families are expected to receive the HCCA at any one time. It will be paid at a higher maximum rate of some $60 a fortnight, almost $6 a fortnight higher than the with-child rate of dependent spouse rebate. About 55,000 families whose tax liability was too low to get the full value of the with-child DSR will receive up to $60 a fortnight extra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is greater responsiveness to families' needs than there is under the DSR because of an income test on current income rather than on income over the financial year. This will allow a parent leaving the work force at any time during the year to care for children to get the HCCA. This will help an estimated 120,000 families whose circumstances change within any year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there is a far more generous income test for dependent children for the DSR. A child is not considered dependent and cannot attract a DSR where the income exceeds $1,785 a year. In contrast, for the HCCA purposes, a child is still considered to be a dependent child if it has income up to $5,860 a year. Overall, the HCCA will cost $1.13 billion each year, an additional $230 million on the cost of the with-child dependent spouse rebate and will advantage some 840,000 families. The coalition and the Independents in the Senate are holding all these families to ransom with their proposed amendments which the government cannot and will not accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some points relating to the amendments and to some of the explanations that I believe are absolutely correct in refuting what has been said in the other place. Amendment No. 1 seeks to change the definition of `income' used to calculate a person's entitlement to HCCA. The definition proposed by the government is one based on existing social security concepts of income used for other purposes under the Social Security Act. The amendment would incorporate instead a concept of income used in taxation legislation for the separate net income or SNI test that is used to determine the amount of a tax rebate. The coalition claims that this would assist many families; for example, under HCCA income from shares is assessed at a rate of return based on capital growth and dividends paid over the previous 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DSR only assesses income from dividends. However, for this to affect eligibility for the HCCA, the shares would generally have to be the only income held by the dependent spouse. Any other investments would already be counted in the DSR test and only if the shares were purchased after August 1992. Unrealised capital growth on shares purchased before this time is not assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The numbers affected by this would be tiny. Having different definitions of income would bring confusion to both clients and administrators and the following disadvantages. Firstly, the SNI definition of income is embedded in the concept of the financial year. It would remove access to the HCCA on a current income test basis. This would deny the HCCA to at least an extra 120,000 families at any one time that would otherwise not receive the with-child DSR. One of the significant changes of the HCCA is outlined above. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SNI definition would include a number of items of income: for example, the remote area allowance, rental assistance and the pharmaceutical allowance. This impact falls largely on those who are or have been on very low incomes. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, the HCCA is paid during a year in advance of entitlement being determined. It may prove not to have been correctly paid. This could give rise to the recovery of substantial overpayments from clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment would change the conditions of qualification for the HCCA for certain families. In all of these cases, the government's proposed legislation would allow families access to the dependent spouse rebate at the without-child rate of $1,188 per year. The net effect for a small number of families is that there would be a disadvantage of a maximum of $4.56 a week compared with what they currently get through the DSR. The government's best estimate is that only a very small number of families would be in this group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also stress that families would be affected by these tighter provisions only if all children or an only child were ineligible. For example, in about half the families with student children, a younger child would continue a family's entitlement to the HCCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise a few other matters that seem to concern our colleagues in the Senate. One of them is overseas payments. In transferring the HCCA into the social security system, the government has tried to align it as closely as possible to the family payments structure. The basic family payment is payable if the family is temporarily absent for up to three years. The additional family payment is only payable overseas for up to 13 weeks if only one partner is away and both the children and other partner remain in Australia. The HCCA will be paid overseas for up to 13 weeks if the children or one or both partners travel. Extending the period to match that of the DSR would make it far more generous than all the other family payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern expressed involves children receiving Austudy and other prescribed educational allowances. For the most part, Austudy students do not attract the with-child rate of DSR. This is because Austudy is paid at a minimum of $1,040 for those under 18 years or $1,219 for those aged 18 and over. The DSR cuts out when the student's own income is $1,785, and the income taken into account is Austudy plus any other income. The number of cases where a student's total income is between $1,040 and $1,785 is small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern involves the payment of the HCCA until the dependent child is 25 years old. The age of 25 that is contained in the current with-child rate of the dependent spouse rebate is longstanding. There are doubts that it currently represents social reality. It is extremely difficult to justify a parent needing to be at home caring for a child aged 24. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Twenty-four. Allowing students up to the age of 25 to be counted as dependents would be contrary to other social security programs, which cater only for those at secondary school and those no older than 18. The age limit at which parental income testing ceases in the Austudy program is now 23 years and will reduce further in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of the changes in the amendments are costly in program terms. Indeed, we expect that amendment No. 1 will save possibly in the order of $60 million in a full year. However, further work would need to be done on costing the administrative effects of all the changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, overall, the government firmly believes that the amendments proposed by the Senate would create confusion, significantly withdraw one of the major advantages of the HCCA and create anomalies in the government's policies for supporting families. Therefore, the government rejects them quite emphatically. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heard the use of the words `holding to ransom'. He has repeated them. The parliamentary secretary is attempting to blackmail those families who will suffer as a result of the government's bill&mdash;the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill&mdash;and the way in which these proposals are being implemented by saying, `If we seek to do justice to those families, we, the government, will withhold the passage of this bill'. If that is the government's objective, I say quite clearly that we will take on this matter and continue to press these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it very clear to the parliamentary secretary&mdash;he may not have been aware of this and he may not have read my press statements, which foreshadowed clearly what we were about on this matter&mdash;that this bill is one in which the government, in its consideration of the matter, had before it a promise by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The promise of the Prime Minister was that the Keating government will increase the dependent spouse rebate and pay it directly to the spouse who is at home caring for children. He also said that the new home child-care allowance will be $30 a week and will provide some source of independent income for women at home who are caring for children. He never said that it would exclude some of those people who are now eligible for the dependent spouse rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know in consideration of this matter that it was not until the opposition did the work&mdash;it was never made clear in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) or the speech by the parliamentary secretary&mdash;that we made it clear that numbers of families were going to be worse off. If those who are now benefiting from the dependent spouse rebate were transferring inadequately into the social security system, they would no longer receive these benefits. I, my staff and the parliamentary library undertook extensive research and an examination of both the taxation and social security systems. The fact is that the government could have addressed this matter at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were concerned that the government had seriously misled people. I raised it in the debate in this House when this bill was last before us. I foreshadowed that in the Senate we would be seeking to have this bill postponed; that is, the Senate would defer the committee stage of the bill until after the government had drafted amendments, which would prevent these families from being excluded from the HCCA. The fact is that we foreshadowed very clearly to the government that there were these groups. The parliamentary secretary has not denied it. He has tried to say that they are small numbers and that it is not significant. He then came up with this argument in relation to those aged between 18 and 25 in full-time education who now benefit. He said that that benefit should not have been made available in today's society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Prime Minister had intended to make that change, he could have foreshadowed that quite clearly in his promise to people so that, when they voted on it, they would know that they were going to lose the benefit. We said to the government, `Honour your promise. Amend your legislation. We'll give you time to make these amendments in the Senate and we'll even let you do the drafting'. But the government said that it was not prepared to buy that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary would know that Senator Harradine said, `I'll have a go at the drafting. Give me a day or so', and the Senate agreed to that. Senator Harradine brought forward some amendments to achieve this objective, which we support. The government says that those amendments will have unforeseen consequences. All I am saying to the parliamentary secretary is that, if he is of good faith, he should withdraw the bill and talk to us about amendments that will achieve the government's objectives and our objectives. They are perfectly compatible. The amendments can be drawn up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not seeking that this bill with its amendments should have unforeseen consequences. I am conscious of the difficulty associated with drafting provisions of this sort, but we are not letting the parliamentary secretary, his government or his Prime Minister off the hook on this matter. The government has severely misled the families of Australia since the last election not only on this matter but on a whole host of other matters which have been before this parliament and which we have commented on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 January, when the government implemented certain other social security changes, it reduced the income ceiling for the basic family payment for families with one child from $64,938 to $60,000 and it reduced the additional amount allowed for each child from $3,249 to $3,000. In the same legislation, the government reduced the existing assets test value limit for the basic family payment from $607,250 to $550,000. The government applied the family payment income and assets test to new student parents. The government was also involved with amendments to legislation which took employer provided fringe benefits into account in the income test for the family payment. The government also took family foreign income into account in the income test for family payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of those matters was the subject of any announcement in the election, yet they clearly would have been drafted, ready and able to be pursued by the government when it came back into office, as turned out to be the case. If the government were of good faith, those matters would have been dealt with at that time. After the government had mouthed all these slogans that families with children often have greater financial needs and that it is up to us as a society to ensure that the next generation is clothed, fed, sheltered and educated&mdash;that was a quote from the Prime Minister&mdash;it sought to remove benefits from some families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are doing with this legislation is another sleight of hand. People who had a clear entitlement to the dependent spouse rebate are now being told, `When we transfer it into the social security system, I'm terribly sorry old chum, you're an anomaly. We can't provide these benefits for you'. When Australian aid workers, working for one of the important non-government organisations that the Australian government supports, are sent overseas to undertake work for their agency and they take their family offshore with them for a year or so, because they are still Australian taxpayers and Australian residents offshore, they are entitled to the dependent spouse rebate. But, if they go away for more than 13 weeks, the government says that they are not entitled to the home child-care allowance payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, Australian aid organisations will be disadvantaging many of their workers offshore as a result of these changes. That is not the only group. It can affect public servants. But when I raised the issue of public servants, the government said, `We can make it up to them because they're our employees'. But it is too bad for aid workers; it is too bad for Australian academics going overseas on extended leave as part of their furlough or sabbatical. Their families can suffer. If people working for an Australian company are transferred overseas, their employer may be able to make up for this disadvantage that they will suffer, but the government will make a saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an unforeseen consequence. But the parliamentary secretary tells us that there is not a great deal of money involved in this; it is just difficult. We knew it was difficult, but we have shown the government that amendments can be drafted to achieve this objective. Quite clearly, we will be rejecting the government's proposal to refuse this request, but I do hold out an offer to the parliamentary secretary, as I did in a letter I wrote to the minister today concerning this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not seeking to be difficult. We believe that the government ought to be accountable for its trickery. We believe that those people who were entitled to believe that they would receive this benefit should still be eligible to receive it. We are quite happy to allow the matter to be deferred either here or in the Senate for the necessary number of days&mdash;and I expect it would be only days&mdash;for the government to get the expert advice of Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and to undertake the drafting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let it be clearly understood that this offer was made originally and the government rejected it. Senator Harradine said that he could get the amendments drafted within a day, and he did. The Senate has supported them. If the government believes that they will have unforeseen consequences, then it should articulate them clearly and make the amendments in the time that is available to it. But it should not try this line that it intends to blackmail the opposition over this matter and that it intends to say, `We will deny to 840,000 Australian families their entitlement under this bill because the opposition has proposed amendments to ensure that all of those who receive the promise benefit'. The government should not try to blackmail us. That sort of trickery and blackmail will bring the parliamentary secretary and his colleagues very much unstuck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite prepared to stomp up and down the country, making sure that people know that the government is quite prepared to use those families as a weapon of blackmail and as a weapon with which to ransom this issue. I do not believe that any Australian would give the government credit for that. I think they would see it for the shabby, tricky statement that it was. It did the parliamentary secretary no service at all to have made that threat. I encourage him to retrieve the situation for his colleagues and to take the opportunity to step back and have a go at drafting amendments that will achieve the government's objectives and ours. I assure the parliamentary secretary of my willingness to sit down in good faith to ensure that objective is reached. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill has three purposes. First, it provides new procedures for enabling authenticated foreign testimony to be admissible, subject to appropriate safeguards, in certain criminal and civil proceedings. Secondly, it includes provisions to implement the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents. And finally it re-enacts, with minor changes, parts IIIB and IIIC of the Evidence Act 1905. The new procedures for enabling foreign testimony to be used are in parts 3 and 4 of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 makes foreign testimony and exhibits authenticated in a prescribed manner provided to Australia pursuant to requests made by or on behalf of the Attorney-General admissible in evidence, subject to specific exclusions in the interests of justice. The part will apply in any court conducting criminal proceedings in relation to Commonwealth offences and related civil proceedings. Related civil proceedings cover civil proceedings arising from the same subject matter from which the relevant criminal proceeding arose. They include proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the Customs Act 1901 or proceedings for the recovery of tax, or of any duty, levy or charge payable to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To provide national uniformity, the states and territories may request the Commonwealth to apply the part, by regulations, to criminal proceedings or related civil proceedings in their courts for offences against the law of that jurisdiction. To ensure that traditional evidentiary safeguards are not undermined, the legitimate rights of the accused will be protected by way of the court having a wide discretion to refuse to admit foreign material. The court will be required to take certain specified matters into account when exercising its discretion, but will not be limited to those matters.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also other safeguards, such as the requirements of authentication by the foreign country and certification by the Attorney-General and the non-admissibility of certain material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present law, documentary foreign material available pursuant to mutual assistance treaties or arrangements frequently cannot be admitted into evidence unless witnesses are made available to give oral testimony in conformity with the traditional rules of evidence. Currently, only a small proportion of the material received from foreign countries is admissible as evidence without a foreign witness giving oral testimony in Australia. It is costly and cumbersome to make a foreign witness available in Australia. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Implementation of the part is expected to reduce the need for foreign witnesses to be made available, thereby lowering the overall cost of obtaining foreign evidence and improving the capacity of the courts to have regard to all relevant material received from foreign countries pursuant to requests by or on behalf of the Attorney-General. Implementation of the part will improve the effectiveness of mutual assistance in criminal matters arrangements and thereby assist in complex prosecutions involving foreign evidence. A resolution passed by the National Complex White Collar Crime Conference in Melbourne in June 1992 called for action to overcome such deficiencies. Part 3 meets the concerns expressed in the resolution, whilst continuing to protect the legitimate rights of the accused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 of the bill sets out a similar scheme, adapted to meet the specific needs of the Australian Securities Commission in civil proceedings arising from the Corporations Law and the ASC law where the ASC is a litigant. The part will facilitate the admissibility of foreign evidence in such proceedings. The globalisation of capital markets in the past few years has required business regulatory agencies such as the ASC to liaise and offer assistance to each other in carrying out their regulatory functions. This will often result in requests by the ASC to foreign agencies for information, testimony and documents where the ASC is involved in civil proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 provides the ASC with the statutory framework to ensure that so far as practicable foreign material is successfully admitted in civil proceedings in which the ASC is a party. The bill contains provisions, in part 5, implementing the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents, so that Australia can accede to the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention abolishes the requirement, imposed by many countries, for legalisation of foreign public documents. Legalisation is a system for authenticating an official document by certificates. Often a chain of certificates is required, and where the document is used in another country, frequently the final certificate is given, upon payment of a fee, by an official of a foreign embassy or consulate of the country where the document is to be used. The convention provides for the issue by a convention country of a single certificate which is sufficient evidence to authenticate the signature or seal on the original document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the convention is concerned specifically only to abolish legalisation by a diplomatic or consular official of the country in which the public document is to be produced, the effect of the convention is also to render unnecessary previous certificates in a legalisation chain. After accession Australian residents sending foreign public documents to countries which normally require legalisation, but which are parties to the convention, will be able to obtain a certificate from an Australian authority, rather than having to get the documents legalised by foreign diplomatic or consular officials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill substantially re-enacts, with minor modifications, parts IIIB and IIIC of the Evidence Act 1905. This is because the rest of that act is being replaced by other legislation. Part 2 of this bill, which replaces part IIIB of the Evidence Act 1905, provides for obtaining testimony from a person in another country by means of an order for examination of the person, issue of a commission for examination of the person, or issue of a letter of request to the judicial authority of a foreign country to take the person's evidence. Part 6 of this bill, which replaces part IIIC of the Evidence Act 1905, sets out a procedure by which the Attorney-General can prevent, on national security grounds, testimony being given or documents or things being produced in Australia for proceedings before a foreign court. The bill will provide less expensive means of obtaining some foreign evidence but is not expected to have a significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. I table the explanatory memorandum for the bill. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">FOREIGN EVIDENCE (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is consequential upon the Foreign Evidence Bill 1993 and sets out transitional arrangements for that bill and makes consequential amendments to the Evidence Act 1905. Likewise, that bill is expected to have little impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. I table the explanatory memorandum to that bill and commend both bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Foreign Evidence Bill 1993 attempts to simplify the means by which foreign evidence can be introduced in some criminal and civil proceedings in Australian courts. This is a reference to part 3 and 4. It also re-enacts with some variations provisions of the Evidence Act 1905, dealing with the examination of witnesses abroad and the taking of evidence for proceedings in foreign courts. This is a reference to parts 2 and 6 respectively. It also implements the requirements of an international convention dealing with the authentication of foreign public documents in part 5.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the bill is designed to stand on its own, it is being introduced by the government as part of a package of wholesale reform of federal and potentially state evidence law. The Evidence Bill 1993 was introduced into the House of Representatives in December last year. That bill basically seeks to rewrite the law of evidence at the federal level. The government hopes that states will follow suit and introduce complementary legislation, with the ultimate aim of achieving broadly similar evidence laws in all Australian jurisdictions. It is yet to be seen whether that proposal will obtain the support of all state and territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The merits or otherwise of the Foreign Evidence Bill can be considered in isolation from the Evidence Bill, but the relationship between the two bills does give rise to some technical issues concerning the application of other laws. These issues will need to be worked out if the Evidence Bill is passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Foreign Evidence Bill is not opposed by the coalition. Broadly, the objectives sought  to  be  achieved  by  the  bill  are worthwhile. There are some questions concerning the particular methods by which those objectives are to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2 re-enacts with some variations part IIIB of the Evidence Act 1905. It sets out the procedures for examination of witnesses outside Australia pursuant to court order after the commencement of proceedings in Australia. It applies to criminal and civil proceedings in courts exercising federal jurisdiction. Given that the part essentially re-enacts existing law, it is in itself uncontroversial. However, in a recent case, the constitutionality of some provisions of part 2 has been challenged. I will refer to that briefly later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of the bill is new. As the law stands, there are very few situations where foreign material is admissible in Australian courts without the foreign witness giving oral testimony in Australia. A resolution of the National Complex White Collar Crime Conference in June 1992 called for action to reduce the need for foreign witnesses to be made available. Part 3 is designed to improve the effectiveness of arrangements for mutual assistance in criminal matters and thereby to assist in complex prosecutions involving foreign evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The part applies to criminal proceedings in Australian courts dealing with an offence against the law of the Commonwealth. It applies to civil proceedings only to the extent that the civil proceedings are related to criminal proceedings, that is, a civil proceeding arising from the same subject matter from which the criminal proceeding arose. Examples are proceedings for recovery of tax or a duty payable to the Commonwealth or proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A mechanism is provided for the provisions to apply to state courts dealing with state laws if agreed to by the state. A request for foreign testimony and any accompanying exhibits must be made by the Attorney-General. Presumably, the relevant law enforcement agency will request that the Attorney-General make the request. It is necessary that the testimony obtained be certified by the foreign country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the material is before a court, the court must not allow the material to be adduced if the person who gave the testimony is in Australia and is able to attend the hearing, or if the evidence would otherwise have been inadmissible. The court is otherwise given a discretion to exclude the material. Specific matters are listed which the court must take into account in exercising that discretion. However, the court may also take into account any other relevant matters it wishes to take into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question arises why under part 3 the procedures are limited to proceedings which involve or have a relationship with criminal proceedings. A related question is why the provisions are designed for the benefit of law enforcement agencies only, rather than the accused in criminal proceedings or the defendant in civil proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These questions are answered when it is recognised that part 3 builds on the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. That act provides a legislative basis for Australia to enter into arrangements with other countries whereby it can request and grant assistance in criminal matters. It seems that the practical opportunity for law enforcement agencies to be provided with foreign testimony derives from the relationship that has developed with a number of other countries since the passage of that act and the making of associated bilateral treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Senate the government accepted an amendment to part 3, and specifically clause 25, which was moved by Senator Ellison. After further discussion with the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and officers of the Attorney-General's Department, I will move an amendment which modifies the language of the Senate amendment and applies it to section 33 as well. I will deal with that after mentioning part 4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 contains a scheme similar to part 3 that allows the Australian Securities Commission to obtain testimony from its foreign counterparts for the purpose of civil proceedings. The ASC must be a party to the proceedings. The request can be made directly from the ASC to the foreign securities agency. Once the testimony is provided the court has a discretion to exclude the material, as it has under part 3. Under the Corporations Law, the ASC has power to intervene in a variety of proceedings commenced between private parties. It is presumed that intervention of that nature would make the ASC a party to the proceedings for the purpose of part 4. To some extent, it seems incongruous that in those cases the ability to adduce testimony from foreign agencies should depend upon whether the ASC has intervened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Senate debate, Senator Vanstone commented that the Attorney-General's Department had indicated that the use of part 4 was intended to be limited to foreign agencies that have formal memoranda of understanding&mdash;MOUs&mdash;for the exchange of information with the ASC. The minister has advised that the use of part 4 of the bill to adduce evidence is not limited to evidence obtained in those countries whose business regulatory authorities have an MOU with the ASC. The provisions of part 4 will be available for use by the ASC in relation to evidence obtained from any country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has advised that the ASC has indicated that, in practice, it will limit the use of the part 4 provisions to  evidence obtained from those countries which have legislative provisions controlling the disclosure of information to foreign regulators such as the ASC or, in other words, countries which have equivalent legislation to the Australian Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Act 1992. The ASC policy, the minister has said, in this regard reflects the fact that the large majority of overseas jurisdictions are not able to assist the ASC in the absence of legislative support for the disclosure of information to foreign regulators such as itself. Only countries with developed business regulatory regimes have enacted such legislation; the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand being examples. Even in those countries, the ASC's counterparts usually require an assurance of reciprocity before complying with requests under their legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To create a framework for such reciprocal relationships, the ASC has signed MOUs with three of its foreign counterparts and will seek to enter into more in the future. Of the three MOUs signed by the ASC, those with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the United Kingdom's Securities and Investments Board and Her Majesty's Treasury provide for requests to obtain testimony and related documents pursuant to the relevant reciprocal legislation in those jurisdictions.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third MOU signed by the ASC, namely, that signed with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, does not in fact provide for such requests as Hong Kong has not enacted equivalent legislation to the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Act 1992. On the other hand, it would be open to the ASC to seek to obtain testimony under the New Zealand legislative equivalent of the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Act, notwithstanding that an MOU has not yet been negotiated by the ASC with the New Zealand regulator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the debate in the committee stage in the Senate, Senator Ellison proposed an amendment to part 3 of the bill, which was passed by the Senate. Part 3 of the bill deals with the use of foreign material in criminal and related proceedings. By proposed subsection 25(1) the court is given a discretion to exclude the evidence. In exercising that discretion, the bill sets out a number of matters the court must take into account. Senator Ellison was particularly concerned to ensure that the court should be required expressly to consider whether exclusion of the foreign material would cause prejudice to either party, and particularly to the defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Senator Ellison's original proposition was couched in terms that exclusion not cause prejudice to either party, the final amendment dealt with his main concern. It was resolved that an item (e) would be added to subclause 25(2) to read `whether exclusion of the foreign material would cause prejudice to the defence'. The bill in its form before this House includes that provision. The government has considered the Senate amendment further and has advised that, in its view, it is more appropriate that the court consider whether exclusion of the foreign material would prejudice the prosecution as well as the defence. I have no difficulty with that proposition. It is what was proposed by Senator Ellison in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the Senate debate on the amendment, the government proposed that the prejudice in question must be substantial. That was objected to by the opposition and the government agreed that the prejudice need not be qualified. The government has reconsidered that question and the minister has advised that the appropriate terminology is `unfair prejudice'. Unless the term is qualified, the minister has suggested, the court's consideration of foreign material obtained on behalf of the prosecution will prejudice the defence in all cases within the ordinary meaning of the term. The coalition equally has no difficulty with the requirement of unfair prejudice. It is appropriate that the amendments made to part 3 are to apply to the corresponding provisions of part 4, which deals with civil proceedings to which the ASC is a party. Accordingly, I foreshadow the following amendments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)Clause 25, page 10, lines 30 and 31, omit "cause prejudice to the defence", substitute "unfairly prejudice any party to the proceeding".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)Clause 33, page 12, at the end of subclause (2) add the following word and paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"; and (e) whether exclusion of the foreign material would unfairly prejudice any party to the proceeding".</PARA>
<PARA>The addition of the proposed paragraphs raises another question which I have this morning discussed with officers of the Attorney-General's Department. It is a well-established principle that in a criminal trial the trial judge has a discretion to refuse to admit evidence if, in his or her opinion, its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. It appears not to be settled whether a similar discretion may be exercised by the trial judge in a civil trial. The reference in the proposed new paragraphs to unfair prejudice must be carefully distinguished from the trial judge's discretion relating to unfair prejudice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is enlightening to examine the manner in which the provisions of parts 3 and 4 will operate in this respect. I take part 3 as an example. Assume that a person is examined outside Australia for the purposes of criminal proceedings before an Australian court to which part 3 relates. The record of the testimony, appropriately certified, will be tendered to the Australian court. The foreign material is not to be adduced as evidence if, under subsection 24(2), the evidence would not have been admissible had it been adduced from the foreign witness at the hearing in Australia. It is at that stage and under that provision that the trial judge should exercise the discretion to exclude the evidence on the basis that its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only after the judge has determined not to exclude the material as being inadmissible will the question of the special power under subsection 25(1) to exclude foreign material in order better to serve justice arise. In considering that question, the trial judge may take into account any matter relevant to whether or not justice would better be served by the exclusion of the foreign material. However, the judge is directed by subsection 25(2) to take specified considerations into account. On the basis of the amendments I have foreshadowed, one of those considerations will be whether exclusion of the evidence would cause unfair prejudice to a party. In light of that analysis, the issue of the admissibility of prejudicial evidence is a matter quite distinct in the statutory scheme from the exclusion of evidence where the exclusion could unfairly prejudice a party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 5 of the bill deals with the recognition by Australian courts and public officials of certain foreign public documents. The Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents of 1961 seeks to simplify procedures for certification of public documents generated in one country and required for official use in another. At present, certain public documents are required to be certified by the foreign embassy or consulate of the country where the document is required. The convention abolishes that practice and provides for the issue of a certificate by the country which generated the document, which is sufficient to authenticate the original document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has indicated that it wishes to accede to the convention. The bill implements the convention by requiring that Australian courts and officials recognise the certificate as evidence of the authenticity of the document. It should be noted that court recognition is not limited to Australian courts exercising federal jurisdiction but is applicable to courts exercising state jurisdiction. It would appear that power to make the extension to state jurisdiction derives from the external affairs power of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General's Department has advised that in practice foreign documents do not generally require formal legalisation in Australia. The convention is being acceded to and these provisions implemented so that the benefit of the convention can be claimed by those seeking to adduce Australian documents in other countries which are parties to the convention. The provisions are not controversial or of difficulty to the coalition. They may result in some savings to persons engaged in litigation through the elimination of unnecessary formality and, as an additional consequence, the need to pay fees in respect of the formality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, part 6 re-enacts, with some variations, part IIIC of the Evidence Act 1905. The part deals with a situation where Australian courts are taking evidence for use in foreign proceedings. The part provides that the Attorney-General may prohibit the taking of evidence in the interests of Australia's security. Unlike under the Evidence Act 1905, the Attorney-General's power is not limited to civil and commercial proceedings. I am not aware whether the Attorney-General has used the power under the 1905 act frequently, infrequently or at all. It is also not clear why the power under the Evidence Act 1905 was confined to civil or commercial proceedings. There appears to be no justification for the distinction on policy grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that there is a case in which the constitutionality of provisions to be re-enacted in part 2 of the bill is under challenge. The case is of interest because of the challenge to those provisions. The argument is that the provisions in the Evidence Act 1905 allowing for the taking of evidence overseas are unconstitutional. Those provisions, as I indicated, have now been incorporated as part 2 of this bill. The Commonwealth Attorney-General intervened in the case in respect of the constitutional objections. The arguments of the accused in the case were rejected by the court. I understand, however, that the decision has been taken on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case in question is the Director of Public Prosecutions v. Alexander. The judgment on the issue was delivered on 29 September 1993. The trial judge was Mr Justice David Hunt, Chief Judge at common law. The case concerned an application by the DPP pursuant to sections 7V and 7W of the Evidence Act 1905 for the issue of a letter of request to the judicial authorities of the United States to take the evidence of two United States residents. The substance of the two sections is now contained in proposed sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 in part 2 of the Foreign Evidence Bill. The defendant to the proceedings had been charged with two offences pursuant to Commonwealth law. The DPP wished to obtain the evidence of the two United States residents. Pursuant to the DPP's request, the evidence of the two individuals would be able to be taken in the United States with legal representatives of both parties permitted to attend and participate in the process and the evidence would be recorded by audio-visual equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was argued by the accused that the provisions in the Evidence Act 1905 are constitutionally invalid, in so far as they relate to a trial for a federal offence on indictment, on two grounds. First, the provisions permit the conduct of that trial to take place in the absence of the jury in breach of section 80 of the constitution and, secondly, the provisions confer federal jurisdiction on a person or persons not part of the court in which the trial is to take place. I say no more of the second ground except that it was rejected by the trial judge. The relevance of the first argument extends beyond the provisions which re-enact provisions as to the taking of evidence pursuant to a letter of request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2 contains another two mechanisms for taking evidence overseas. The court may make an order for examination on oath or affirmation at a place outside Australia before a judge or officer of the court or before any other person. Alternatively, the court can issue what is described as a commission for the examination of witnesses overseas. The accused's argument would apply in relation to this bill to the extent that it permits admission of testimony from witnesses overseas without that witness being before the jury at the time the testimony was taken. The argument would, it seems, also apply to part 3 to the extent it provides for admission of foreign testimony in Australian proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument is based on section 80 of the constitution, which provides that the trial on indictment of any offence against the law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury. What Alexander argues is that the constitutional right to trial by jury imports an obligation that the jury confront all witnesses. Section 80 of the constitution was modelled on an identical provision in the United States constitution. The provision in the United States constitution is amplified by the sixth amendment which provides in relevant part that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all criminal prosecution, the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . . public trial, by an impartial jury . . . [and] to be confronted with witnesses against him . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The accused argued to the Supreme Court of New South Wales that the confrontation clause should be read into section 80 of the Australian constitution. The trial judge rejected the argument that section 80 of the constitution was infringed. He did that on three principal grounds, which I summarise. The first was that in the United States the sixth amendment is not applied as a strict rule. As an example, admission of evidence pursuant to a letter of request has been expressly permitted in at least one United States decision. The second was that Australian authority makes it questionable whether the sixth amendment is to be incorporated into section 80 of the constitution. The third was that section 80 is to be construed as an adoption of the institution of trial by jury, as that institution was known in Australia at the time of that adoption. This is a principle that was ventilated in the judgment of the High Court in the recent case of Cheatle v. The Queen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the appeal proceeds to a hearing, the arguments will, I presume, receive further consideration. I think it appropriate at this stage that I make no further comment upon them. I indicated previously that the coalition has no objection to the bill. I commend to the House the amendments to be moved in my name at the consideration in detail stage. </PARA>

I pay tribute to the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) for his careful and considered analysis of the legislation. It is, I think, helpful to see that there has been a high degree of cooperation and consideration on this bill both in the Senate and in the current debate in this House. I think it indicates that on many matters there is a high degree of cooperation on both sides of the House to provide for real progress in many areas of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An up-to-date and relevant legal system is crucial to providing citizens in social democracies with real social justice. As the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) said in his second reading speech to a related bill, the Evidence Bill 1993, on 15 December 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comprehensive evidence law reform is not easy. Many challenges have accumulated over too many years for that to be the case. But this government is taking evidence law reform out of the too hard basket and making it an important feature of the law reform agenda.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister quoted the Law Reform Commission, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present law is the product of unsystematic statutory and judicial development. It is a highly complex body of law which is arcane even to most legal practitioners. It contains traps and pitfalls which are likely to leave the unrepresented litigant baffled, frustrated and defeated.</PARA>
<PARA>The reform process, of which the Foreign Evidence Bill is one part, was initiated in 1977 by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a review of the whole evidence law should be undertaken by the Law Reform Commission with a view to producing a wholly comprehensive code of evidence based on concepts appropriate to the present day.</PARA>
<PARA>A reference was given to the Australian Law Reform Commission in July 1979 by the then Attorney-General, the Hon. Peter Durack. Following substantial review, its final report and draft legislation was presented in 1987. In 1991, both the New South Wales and Commonwealth governments introduced legislation based on the Law Reform Commission's draft bill. As the minister made clear in his second reading speech on the Evidence Bill I have just referred to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth wants this bipartisan approach to achieving uniformity to be taken up by other states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth, state and territory governments now have an opportunity to improve the law, to remove inconsistencies and, as a result, make them more just, reasonable and comprehensive.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence law reform is micro-economic reform. A reformed evidence law will simplify and shorten proceedings . . . Reform is necessary to assist the courts to achieve just and proper decisions with a minimum of expense to all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>As a non-lawyer in this debate, I think it is very important to make it clear that, from the community's perspective, the law as it is presently understood and practised in this country is seen to be in the province of the very rich and the very powerful, in the hands of and available to large corporations and, to a very limited extent, the poor and dispossessed through legal aid assistance. But there is certainly a feeling in the community that the general community is not able to access justice through our legal system because of its complexity and expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very heartened to see that this government, represented by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice, has a very strong commitment to the reform of our legal system, to make it available, understandable and accessible to people in the wider community so that they may perceive that they can obtain real justice and, through that justice, social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Foreign Evidence Bill 1993, as I said, is part of the government's comprehensive evidence law reforms. The amendments in this legislation will repeal much of the Evidence Act of 1905. The Foreign Evidence Bill will be an important component in adding a more contemporary approach to Australia's evidence laws. This bill contains provisions omitted from the Evidence Act pertaining to international considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) and the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney, the bill has three broad purposes. With minor changes, it re-enacts parts of the Evidence Act 1905 enabling evidence from other countries to be used in Australian proceedings and preventing, for reasons of national security, certain evidence from being obtained in Australia for use in foreign proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it provides a range of new initiatives to enable authenticated foreign testimony and exhibits to such testimony to be admissible, subject to appropriate safeguards. In this era of rapid technological advancement, our legislative arrangements should be aware of the need to be flexible in acquiring information to be used as evidence. In this respect the Foreign Evidence Bill provides the necessary legislative framework to bring our evidence laws to this standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill enables Australia to accede to the Hague convention abolishing the requirement for legalisation of foreign public documents. The benefit of accession to the convention will relieve Australian residents of the need to get public documents legalised for use in countries which are parties to the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to a couple of aspects of the bill in somewhat more detail. The bill provides for the obtaining of testimony from a person in another country by means of an order for examination of the person, the issue of a commission for the examination of a person or the issue of a letter of request to the judicial authority of a foreign country to take that person's evidence. It also provides for a procedure by which the Attorney-General can prevent, on national security grounds, testimony being given or documents being presented to a foreign court. It includes the differential that it is not limited to civil or commercial matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to these amendments relates to the current circumstances in which Australia is increasingly part of the world marketplace. It is now commonplace for Australian individuals and companies to have links with foreign countries and institutions. Where charges are laid alleging misconduct in relation to corporations, it is necessary for both defence and prosecution in Australian proceedings to obtain evidence of foreign transactions. Existing evidence laws do not meet the needs of complex criminal cases where evidence of foreign transactions is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of the bill overcomes existing deficiencies whereby foreign evidence cannot be admissible unless witnesses are available to give oral testimony to conform to traditional rules of evidence&mdash;and these were matters obviously referred to in the speech of the honourable member for Tangney. These requirements of availability of witnesses are costly and time consuming. The legislation is concerned to maintain a careful balance between the ability of the criminal justice system to deal with complex criminal matters and protect the legitimate rights of the accused. Other safeguards will require authentication by the foreign country and certification by the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain evidence will be declared inadmissible when those witnesses are available in Australia. As both the parliamentary secretary and the shadow Attorney-General have said, part 4 relates to the use of foreign materials and records of foreign business authorities in civil proceedings which will bear on proceedings instituted by the Australian Securities Commission. This is seen as crucial to proceedings under the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the matters under consideration in the Foreign Evidence Bill will go a fair way to updating what is now a very old bill and demonstrate the commitment of this government to real reform across the board, including the reform of our legal system. On this basis, I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The black plague that swept Europe in the 14th century has a clear resemblance to the insidious creeping noxious weed called the serrated tussock, in that they are both devastating and affect the sustainability of life of man and beast. Each serrated tussock plant produces 100,000 seeds, which can be scattered by the four winds throughout southern Victoria. Given the right soil conditions, this noxious weed could become a major environmental problem to farmers and city dwellers alike.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The serrated tussock is an unpalatable fibrous plant with little nutrient value. Sheep and cattle lose body weight if they are forced to eat the plant. Stock selectively graze other plants, which in turn encourages the growth of the serrated tussock. Serrated tussocks are prolific seed producers and, as is often the case with undesirable weeds, they are able to reproduce at a frightening rate. Serrated tussocks are able to establish themselves in rocky outcrops and bare patches and on fallowed land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Infestation of serrated tussock has now occurred in the Geelong region and around the Inverleigh, Sunbury and Bacchus Marsh areas, with other smaller patches appearing in neighbouring districts such as the You Yangs Regional Park and the Brisbane Ranges. Given that serrated tussock is able to take total control of a paddock or a rocky outcrop area, it is almost impossible to eradicate. This indicates the magnitude of the problem facing Victorian land holders. It is possible to remove serrated tussock from arable land with cultivation; however, much of the affected area is rough country, which is most difficult to control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Duncan Campbell, the secretary of the serrated tussock task force, has spent $40,000 on his 6,000-acre farm attempting to eradicate this weed. He, along with John Thornton, from Inverleigh, chairman of the task force, and other committee members, are totally committed to controlling the serrated tussock to a minimal area. Further, they are concerned to alert the policy makers that a stitch in time saves nine&mdash;so much so that an early eradication program could save millions of dollars for the farming community and Australia. The cost of chemical spray is very high. A 20-litre drum of frenock, the most effective herbicide available, costs $700. Research indicates that only this brand is effective against serrated tussock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, whilst it has the legal responsibility for the control of serrated tussock on both public and private land, is not up to the task because of a lack of funds. Landholders who are familiar with the problem are now prepared to take action at the community level. Whilst the Landcare schemes have been generally successful, I am recommending that the federal government allow Landcare programs to be part of the control of this noxious weed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Duncan McNab, an experienced farmer from Anakie, has personally indicated to me that the serrated tussock is `on the march' and that urgent action is required. Given the depressed rural conditions and the necessity for farmers to pay their way, noxious weed eradication falls lower down on the list of priorities. Federal and state governments should assist farmers by matching their efforts on a dollar-for-dollar basis so that the broader community problem can be solved in its infancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is clear evidence that because of the prolific propagating capacity of the seed from serrated tussock, Victoria's national parks could be overtaken. The catchment and storage areas of Geelong's water could become damaged by the infestation of serrated tussock, and there is the possibility that suburban gardeners could suddenly find serrated tussock seeds in their own backyard. Also, the Tullamarine airport is overrun with the tussock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The serrated tussock task force, which has a budget of $40,000, is to be commended for its public awareness program. This volunteer group hopes to coordinate national Landcare programs, and is seeking support from the Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and the Agriculture Department. It is a self-help program, and has my total support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst there is evidence of considerable economic damage to parts of New South Wales and New Zealand by the serrated tussock, it is fair to say that the problem is reasonably well contained in this local area in Victoria, but has the potential of a major explosion within five years. The delicate balance of native flora would be upset if the serrated tussock took control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has had a long history of not attacking the base problem of introduced species before they multiply to plague proportions. For instance, the Austin family introduced rabbits for recreational purposes, which then became the major animal pest to Australian woolgrowers. Likewise, the prickly pear was introduced for landscaping reasons, and if it had been exterminated at an early stage would not have become such a major national problem. The serrated tussock has all the wonderful characteristics of a capacity to spread itself quickly, to grow in difficult terrain, and to be useless as a stockfeed. Finally, like the rabbit, it could get totally out of control unless immediate action is taken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I rise to put on the record the magnificent victory by the Maritime Union of Australia in the stevedoring dispute, which has captured the attention of this nation, as has the stevedoring industry for well over a century. In looking at the history of the stevedoring industry in this country, we recall some of the historical documents such as Rupert Lockwood's book on the Melbourne wharves, which traced a history of the two stevedoring unions there which eventually amalgamated into the Waterside Workers Federation. They have now been amalgamated into the Maritime Union of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In steering to the need for micro-economic reform on the waterfront, I suggest to the House that we go back through history and look at where some of the problems are. The problems, as I noted earlier, came initially from the avoidance of responsibilities by the stevedoring companies, and I believe that any acceptance of responsibilities has just been thwarted again. But there is a second tier: the charges which are laid by state governments and the dividends which are taken by state governments from the boards which control the facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry is complaining that it is not getting the benefits of the micro-economic reform. Over 3,000 wharfies have gone, so they are not seeing the benefits. They are not seeing the benefits because the states' imposition of tariffs and their returns on their investment are such that they are bleeding the stevedoring industry dry. I suggest that we look at the real culprits and have a look at where the money that must have come through has gone. We have a duopoly in place and 3,000 wharfies have gone. The benefits of that micro-economic reform have been snapped up by others who are not necessarily entitled to them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since I have been a member of this place I have been campaigning for the extension of SBS television to my electorate. I was pleased when early last year the western part of the electorate received SBS television signals for the first time, largely because of the extension of services directed to the Toowoomba area in southern Queensland. But the coastal cities of my electorate&mdash;Maryborough, Hervey Bay and Gympie&mdash;still do not receive SBS television.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SBS has a small but enthusiastic audience&mdash;an audience that is growing year by year, particularly as people lose confidence in the ABC. These days the SBS news service, particularly its international news service, is considered to be the best. It is the only telecaster these days of domestic soccer and most of the important soccer fixtures around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a growing demand from the community to see SBS television, even from those people who do not have a particular ethnic background. SBS was established originally to provide this link for people who have come to Australia, and who perhaps do not have English as their mother language, to help them become a part of the Australian community and to help them enjoy the lifestyle that we have in Australia without the loss that is associated with language difficulties. SBS has provided a useful role as far as that is concerned. Its subtitles have helped many people to learn the English language when it has not been their mother tongue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that extending SBS television around Australia be given priority, but over recent times it seems that SBS is putting its emphasis on radio transmissions. I noticed an announcement from the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) on 1 February this year which boasted about the extension of SBS radio to Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Darwin. I welcome the fact that SBS radio is available not only in Sydney and Melbourne, but it seems to me to be a strange priority for the government to be moving to extend SBS radio&mdash;which does not offer anything like the benefits to the community that SBS television offers&mdash;to other cities, while the majority of Australia still does not receive SBS television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note also that SBS is moving towards second radio transmissions in Sydney and Melbourne before most of Australia gets SBS television. Those priorities are all wrong. As early as 1985, the SBS annual report indicated that SBS television was to be extended to the Wide Bay region, but that has not happened. I have written repeatedly to ministers. As recently as 21 December 1993, the last minister to whom I wrote, the then Minister for Communications, now the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), merely said to me that the government was extending SBS television signals as funds became available, but there was no promise to include the Wide Bay area in that list. All I could get was an assurance that he had noted my views about the need for the residents of Wide Bay to be included in the list of areas to receive SBS television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am hopeful that the present communications minister will consider areas on their merits. I ask him to bear in mind that the Hervey Bay area is one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. Its population is being boosted by large numbers of people moving to the region from Sydney and Melbourne&mdash;people who have been used to receiving SBS television for years. Now that they have moved to sunny Queensland they are not getting the benefits of SBS television. The demand to receive the soccer telecast is growing. The ABC has refused, even when SBS offered them the rights, to extend soccer telecasts into areas where SBS has no signal. It is becoming more and more important that SBS be available to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I presented a petition in the House last month which was signed by 657 people in the Hervey Bay region, urging that SBS be extended into their area, and more petitions will be presented in the weeks ahead. One of the local newspapers has put out little coupons that say, `Yes. I want SBS'. Hundreds of those have now been returned. I hope that the minister for communications will take on board the fact that the people of Hervey Bay are petitioning and are prepared to write letters on this matter. They are keen to receive the SBS signal and hope that the government will act quickly to extend SBS to the Wide Bay area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address the issue of the failure of the New South Wales government to plan properly for the provision of transport links to and from the Badgerys Creek airport site. Many honourable members on this side and, I hope, many of those opposite, would be pleased by the action that the federal government has taken in recent times regarding the development of Sydney's second international airport. I noted with interest that the opposition raised this matter in question time today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations and Transport (Mr Brereton) has said that the government is keen to accept and examine detailed propositions from the private sector about its interest to own, build and manage the international airport at Badgerys Creek. Of course, the government has committed itself to the development of the facility. The only question is one of timing&mdash;whether the international airport comes on line for the year 2005 or private investment can expedite that process. Most significantly, we will see the commencement of construction for the general aviation facility this month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem with this process, now that private sector investment has been welcomed and invited, is the failure of the state government to allocate a land use corridor from Glenfield through to the airport site on which we could run the essential rail and road links. Investors are looking at the absence of proper planning and are starting to shy away from the project. They legitimately ask why they should be spending hundreds of millions&mdash;even billions&mdash;of dollars, on this project if we have not got cooperation between federal and state authorities to do the transport planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It all comes down to the consideration by the New South Wales government that Badgerys Creek is a marginal seat held by one of its ministers, Anne Cohen. She has made representations to the New South Wales minister for planning to see that a handful of landowners in her electorate are not upset by the prospect of a land use corridor and a rail link. Even though in October 1991 the state government examined and exhibited a regional environment plan for the South Creek Valley sector the minister, Robert Webster, visited Badgerys Creek in the middle of 1992 and announced:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The route of the public transport corridor as identified in the draft plan is to be abandoned; the whole issue of public transport in Sydney's south-west is to be re-examined.</PARA>
<PARA>It is almost two years since that announcement. There has been no re-examination of public transport needs, and certainly no identification of the essential land use corridor from Glenfield to Badgerys Creek for a rail line. In no other advanced or trading nation would we find so little cooperation and goodwill from a state authority. Work will commence this month on the site for an international airport without the state government undertaking any of the planning or allocation of land that is needed to provide the rail link. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is made more relevant by the announcement by the state opposition yesterday that it will build the rail line. It is to be fully funded. We have a promise from Bob Carr to build the rail line. Here we have the federal government inviting private investment, the state opposition saying that it will fund the project if elected at the next state poll, but the New South Wales government&mdash;for base electoral reasons&mdash;doing absolutely nothing to allocate the land on which the rail line would be constructed. This is a tragedy for western and south-western Sydney. This failure of planning is holding back the prospect of the development of 35,000 new jobs on and around the airport site over the next 20 years. It is debasing the spirit of federal and state cooperation. As you would appreciate, Mr Speaker, it is holding back the whole networking of rail links that could arise out of this project. If we had the link from St Marys to Badgerys Creek to Glenfield it would make much more feasible the development of the Maldon-Dombarton line through the Illawarra to Port Kembla. That would open up a whole range of economic benefits across New South Wales and, most importantly, in my region of south-west Sydney, access through to that very efficient port. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is a shame when Australia is trying to become more internationally competitive and south-west Sydney and regions like the Illawarra are trying to join that drive that, for very narrow electoral reasons, in a state marginal seat we cannot even get a land use corridor on which an essential rail link would be constructed to and from an international airport. The Fahey government needs to do a lot better and all members of this House should be urging it in that direction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The recent Hilmer report which has been accepted by all of the states and the federal government plumps very strongly for liberalisation of all competition throughout Australia and the elimination of any restrictions whatsoever. Consequently, the Premier of Queensland is currently advocating the extension of trading hours for shopkeeping in flagrant breach of a promise made by him to the people of Queensland before the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I praise very greatly and put on record the excellent work done by the Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association which has fought tirelessly and effectively for its members throughout Queensland under Ian Baldock and, before him, under Rod Black. The last time the National Party government attempted to do this in Queensland, not only did I speak up about it but also the minister at the time, Vince Lester, very strongly objected to the trials. The trials were abandoned after a short four weeks. I suspect and hope that the same thing will happen if the Queensland government attempts to proceed down this path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No country in the world suffers from the monopolistic situations that exist throughout almost all of the economy in Australia. Three major companies in Australia account for 70 per cent of the food sales throughout Australia. I would be very surprised if any intelligent person would assert the principle that that is not a monopolistic position which militates very strongly against the food producers of this country and very strongly against the consumers of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States the 10 major companies hold 12 per cent of retail food sales; in Australia the 10 major companies hold 40 per cent of retail food sales; and in the United Kingdom the three major companies control only 28 per cent of food sales. Under the proposals that are being forced on the Australian public not only by the federal government but also via the Hilmer report, people in Queensland and other parts of Australia will suffer decreased services. The after-hours corner stores will close and the smaller family run businesses will close. Not only will that restructure Australian society whereby family businesses will cease to exist, as will the concept of the owner operator, but also there will be a shrinkage in the number of outlets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of poor people in this country that simply do not have access to motor vehicles any more and they have to walk to their nearest shop. In Queensland outside of Brisbane there is virtually no commuter transport system. So in Queensland a lot of people will find it very difficult to get the amount of food necessary to live a healthy and acceptable lifestyle. That will apply to not only old people but poor people, and people on ordinary incomes. They will be placed in very grave difficulty because they simply do not have access to transportation systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, there is a finite amount of money that can be spent on food and clothing. If that finite money is extended over Sunday trading as well as the other days of the week, the same amount of money will be spent but the cost of servicing and providing retail outlets in Queensland will increase dramatically because the big and small shopkeepers will have to pay staff for an extra day's trading. But, of course, the number of consumer dollars will not increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only will there be an increased cost of transportation in the city to get people to these places but there will also be a cost to the individual shopkeepers, many of whom will go broke. Yet we are told that we need to do these things, that we need to catch up with the rest of the world. We have only 2.4 million tourists to Australia paying us $53 million, and they are not paying us for Sunday trading. Berlin, Paris, Athens and the United Kingdom have no Sunday trading. New York, in fact, has fewer trading hours than Brisbane!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the big chains and corporations are so untrammelled in their greed that they wish to increase their market share over the broken backs of the owner operators throughout Australia. That push is being sponsored by people in this House through such reports as the Hilmer report. I strongly urge the people of Queensland to rise up, as they did before when my own government attempted to move down in this direction, and fight tenaciously against the continual moves towards monopoly ownership throughout Australia and a crushing of the great Australian tradition of getting up and having a go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this International Year of the Family we will be going through the process of redefining the Australian family. Some myths will be exploded and it will be recognised that the home is not always the haven in a heartless world. I am referring to the research that has shown quite unequivocally that every year thousands of our citizens&mdash;women and children in particular&mdash;suffer physically, psychologically and financially within their homes as a result of acts of violence against them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Millions of dollars are spent annually on policing, court services, hospital and other medical services, welfare services, women's refuges and social security benefits as a direct consequence of violence. Domestic violence is no longer a private issue. It is a matter of public concern. For the first time a study has costed domestic violence in dollar terms. Data obtained from 20 victims revealed costs of well over $1 million for these 20 alone. We now know that 43 per cent of homicides are within the family and almost half of all female victims are killed by their spouse. We know also that only 56 per cent of victims contact the police in spite of having sustained serious injury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a nation, it is imperative that we reduce this deeply troubling and pervasive form of violence afflicting our society. In 1991, the federal government took up this challenge and allocated approximately $3.5 million to be spent over three years in ways which would alert the community to the problem of violence against women. This initiative came from the Office of the Status of Women, a policy making unit of the federal government and a part of the national agenda for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A pilot scheme to identify needs in local areas resulted. Applications for the first round came from a wide variety of community organisations. Included amongst them were churches, women's health centres and Aboriginal and rural organisations. Due to the efforts of Bronwyn Rademaker of the Maitland youth development unit in my electorate, a grant of $23,000 was obtained for the employment of a domestic violence court support worker for 21 hours a week. She would carry out a year's work of identifying local needs and providing education in awareness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very capable young lady, Vicki King, was appointed for the year to provide a counselling service at Maitland court for women who are the victims of domestic violence and to carry out training programs for various agencies and government departments that work with women victims of domestic violence. Vicki King has worked tirelessly. Last year, over 100 women received court support counselling and 89 were assisted to obtain apprehended domestic violence orders. Previously, many women had been forced to return to a domestic violence situation, but last year, thanks to Vicki's efforts, 52 women were able to find alternatives to these threatening home situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Children are often the forgotten victims of domestic violence. Last year, 158 Maitland children were victims. There is no doubt that the work done by the Maitland domestic violence court support worker has exposed a great need in the community, which is exactly what this program was designed to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So where do we go from here? As Vicki King said, what has been revealed is only the tip of the iceberg. Only a few of the women living with domestic violence have had the courage to come forward. Presently, there is a three-month wait for victims of domestic violence to see a counsellor at the local community health centre. Furthermore, resources available to local police, who are often the front-line support workers, are limited and over-stretched. This is totally unreasonable and unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State governments are responsible for the administration of the court system. The need for domestic violence court support workers is indisputable. Only yesterday John Fahey outlined his program for the remainder of this year and declared that family issues would be to the fore with his government. I challenge the Premier of New South Wales to respond to the needs of women in his state that have been identified so strongly by the Maitland project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The offence of domestic violence is so abhorrent that it demands immediate and thoughtful action. It is not something that can be placed on hold. What better way could Mr Fahey keep faith with thousands of families in New South Wales than by providing urgently needed counselling services for all the victims of this horrific crime? What better way has he to show whether this is merely empty rhetoric or a sincere commitment? I call on him not to abandon the women and children at risk, in the Maitland area in particular. A practical response is the proper response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened to the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) a few minutes ago. I thought it a great pity that he did not come here 10 years earlier. If he had, he would have been able to significantly speed up the implementation of a decision taken by the Fraser government to build a third runway at Sydney airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to draw attention to what is emerging as a major crisis in country Victoria and probably other country areas in Australia. We have seen some very great work done throughout my region by people in volunteer groups, individuals and service clubs in developing a recycling system for plastic, paper, cardboard and glass. All of this is now at risk. Despite the great work of all these people, we are now seeing the whole thing coming to a halt. In fact, as one operator has put it to me, it has become a shambles. All this has happened at a time when the former Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, who should have been looking at this and acting on it, was too busy playing around with whiteboards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Service clubs and others that used to collect paper have ceased to do so. Local councils are horrified at what is happening. When I drew this to the government's attention, the response I got was very disappointing. The then minister said that the task of developing markets for wastepaper and products from recycled paper requires urgent consideration and that the Commonwealth was endeavouring to address the recycling issues. She also said that the government intended to have the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency evaluate progress towards the various national targets for recycling and waste minimisation. Furthermore, she said that the government would get the agency to sponsor the Bureau of Industry Economics to examine plastics recycling in Australia. In other words, we are going to have yet another inquiry. I think it is pathetic when we have this situation, which is an emerging crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has really happened? To give a couple of examples, plastic drink containers were raising about $700 a tonne. That has fallen to half&mdash;$350 a tonne. If we stopped to think about it, we would realise that it takes a hell of a lot of plastic drink containers to make up a tonne. Let us look at the situation with paper. If it has to be sent to Albury, which is where some of the paper from western Victoria has to go, one is lucky to get $75 a tonne. The freight costs $68. In other words, there is virtually no margin there for the person who is assembling it or the service clubs that have been collecting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few months we have seen the extraordinary situation of the government making the freight even more expensive by putting up the fuel tax. The same situation applies with cardboard and paper. In Melbourne people are getting about $40 a tonne, but the freight to Melbourne is more than $30. Not only that, there has to be a special mix of 70 to 30 cardboard to paper, and for many small towns it is impossible to meet that mix. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at glass, we find that this year ACI intends to cut the recycled glass price by nearly $20 a tonne. This at a time when one operator in my electorate has just invested more than $70,000 in receiving points to try to facilitate recycling. Now all of that is at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of this we have the situation where many tips are already overloaded, and so the crisis is compounded. We do indeed have a major crisis. Efforts have been made by so many volunteers, service clubs and community-minded people who have set about to try to do something in the recycling business in country areas, but have now found themselves utterly frustrated and have had to give up in disgust. I call on the government to act, and to act quickly. As one constituent said to me, `The whole recycling situation in western Victoria is in a shambles'. I do not think that we need another study. What we need is some action, and we need some action quickly. </PARA>

What was different and of great interest to me on this occasion was that I was asked to present awards to two of the students.
