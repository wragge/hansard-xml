<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill continues the historic process that began with the High Court's Mabo decision. The government moved quickly to respond to that decision. Last year parliament passed the Native Title Act, giving legislative effect to the court's rejection of the doctrine of terra nullius and its recognition of native title to land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is enormous symbolic value in the Mabo decision and the subsequent legislation. For the first time in our history, the inherent rights of indigenous Australians have been recognised and given statutory protection. These developments indicate that as a nation we have had the collective courage and wisdom to acknowledge the violence and destruction done to indigenous Australians and their culture since European occupation. They signal that as a nation we are willing to accept our responsibility to work towards a new relationship. Much has been achieved, but justice has not yet been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice has not been done because the majority of Australia's indigenous people live on the margins of economic, social and cultural life in this country. We may ask how this can be so in a country with one of the highest standards of living in the world, a country which prides itself on giving everyone a fair go. It is so, Mr Acting Speaker, because the vast majority of indigenous Australians have been dispossessed, either in whole or part, of that which is most precious to their sense of history and spirituality, that most essential component of their heritage&mdash;their land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contemporary Western culture tends to view land as something of a commodity, something which may enrich us, but not something which goes to the essence of our culture. It is difficult for non-indigenous Australians to understand what Australia's indigenous people feel about the loss of their land. It is difficult, therefore, to comprehend the extent of their dispossession. Yet it should not be too difficult for us to comprehend. It should surely not be difficult for Australians who have always placed such a value on owning a bit of Australia, the people who have taken much of their literary and artistic inspiration from the bush and who still find their greatest comfort in the natural landscape of Australia in the great outdoors. The land has a cultural and spiritual significance for all Australians and we all can surely come to an understanding of what total and uncompensated dispossession meant. We must try to comprehend it. Unless we understand the importance of land to indigenous peoples, we cannot come to terms with the extent of the loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great ambition of this government to establish a new relationship between indigenous Australians and the wider community. We established the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to guide the nation towards greater understanding and justice, greater unity and universal respect for Australia's indigenous heritage. We introduced native title legislation in recognition that indigenous peoples owned the land before colonisation and to facilitate the formal legal recognition of those native title interests which have never been extinguished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But the process has only just begun and, significant as the native title legislation is with its profound symbolic significance, it will not and cannot be of benefit to all indigenous peoples simply because most who have been dispossessed have been unable to maintain the continued association upon which proof of native title depends. As a consequence, we are now ready for another historic step; a step represented by this bill which recognises the injustice flowing from dispossession and goes some way towards redressing it by providing a means for indigenous communities to acquire, manage and maintain land. The facility of the bill and the high order of the funding provided under it will give indigenous Australians a significant and recurring opportunity to re-establish their relationship with the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land fund will be the centrepiece of the social justice measures to be undertaken by the government and represents the major financial element of those proposals. The further measures will be the subject of advice to the government by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and ATSIC later this year. These measures will form part of the social justice package I announced when introducing the native title legislation, and which will be directed towards removing structural and institutional barriers to full participation in Australian economic life by its indigenous peoples, and safeguarding and developing indigenous culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation by its nature is an important and necessary complement to the native title legislation and, like that act, the bill before the House is the product of wide-ranging consultation. We sought the views of peak indigenous, farming, environmental, industry and church groups. I have had meetings with Aboriginal representatives and a measure of consensus has been reached on the main features of the bill. I have sought the views of premiers and chief ministers, and of our colleagues on the other side of the House, as well as the Democrat and Green senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our colleagues on the other side have expressed their opposition to the concept of the land fund, saying there are higher priorities in Aboriginal affairs. There are indeed many other things to be done, but we maintain that land ownership is fundamental to the wellbeing of the indigenous community and should be addressed as a matter of priority. The benefits flowing from re-establishing indigenous attachment to the land will not only be cultural and social, but will lead to improved economic wellbeing. I hope the opposition will be swayed in the interests of justice and equity, in the cause of righting historic wrongs, to let the Aboriginal and Islander community have the bill with bipartisan support and, in the end, not be left to describe the third reading in negative terms, as happened with the native title legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that the opposition intends moving amendments relating to health, housing and other matters of welfare to Aboriginal and Islander people. The government will, of course, consider all amendments, but will maintain the primary view that the fund must be about land and that other social problems best be addressed with functional appropriations. In the event, the veracity of the opposition's recent claims of concern for indigenous people will be tested by two events&mdash;the vote on the second reading in the House of Representatives and the same vote in the Senate. For the sake of the indigenous people I hope that both events are marked with bipartisan approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now turn to key aspects of the legislation. The bill establishes the land fund and the Indigenous Land Corporation, with the purpose of enabling indigenous people to acquire land and to manage and maintain it in a sustainable way to provide economic, social and cultural benefits for future generations. The Indigenous Land Corporation will be a new, independent and commercially oriented statutory body. The government has adopted this structure because such a corporation will ensure a dedicated focus on land matters and will have specialised expertise in land management, land use assessment and environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the land fund will receive an allocation from consolidated revenue, pay to the Indigenous Land Corporation a specified amount each year for land acquisition and management, and invest the remainder. After 10 years, it is intended that the investments made by the land fund will provide sufficient income to cover the allocations to the corporation, and Commonwealth contributions will cease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first instalment was allocated in this year's budget&mdash;$200 million into the fund, with $25 million to be paid to the corporation and the remainder to be invested. The government will commit $1.1 billion in 1994-95 dollars to the fund over a decade, but with maintenance in real terms the commitment will be substantially greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fund will be set up as a trust account under the public account and will be subject to the provisions of part IX of the Audit Act. To make for a smooth transition, for the first three years ATSIC will continue with its land acquisition and management programs and will receive its annual allocation from the land fund. After this period, ATSIC's financial allocation will transfer to the Indigenous Land Corporation. Using the moneys paid to it by the land fund, the corporation will be responsible for acquiring land and transferring it to indigenous communities. It may also make grants to indigenous organisations for the purpose of acquiring land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like it made clear that the government is very much aware of the need for land to be managed in an effective manner. The corporation will therefore carry out an equally important function of promoting and supporting the sustainable management of indigenous held land. It will do this mainly by entering into agreements with the land-holders about the use and management of land. The corporation will have the flexibility to be able to take a direct role in the management of indigenous lands to the extent set down in the agreements. On occasions it may also provide direct grants to land-holders for land management purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government accepts that not all indigenous people will seek to make profits from their ownership of land, we are concerned that they receive sufficient assistance and encouragement to manage their land in a sustainable way. The operations of the Indigenous Land Corporation will be governed by a number of principles. It is to adopt a strategic approach and, where it operates on a commercial basis, it will do so in line with sound business principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, in carrying out its functions, the corporation must have regard to maximising the employment of indigenous people and utilising indigenous enterprises. The corporation will be required to prepare national and regional land strategies covering three- to five-year periods and dealing with land acquisition, management and environmental issues. Copies of the document setting out these strategies will be available on request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional bodies, including ATSIC regional councils, will also be involved in planning for acquisitions at the local level. The corporation will be able to establish subsidiaries to carry out its functions allowing for direct participation by local indigenous representatives in land management activities in their area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is designed to meet the aspirations of indigenous people and they must therefore have control over decisions made by the corporation. This is reflected in the structure of the board of directors administering the corporation. At least five of the members must be Aboriginal people or Torres Strait Islanders and the chairperson of ATSIC will be included as an ex officio member. In recognition of ATSIC's role as a vehicle for indigenous self-determination,  at least one other member must be an ATSIC commissioner. All the directors must have experience in land or environmental management, business or financial management, or in indigenous community life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation will have significant powers to conduct its business in the interest of self-determination, including significant commercial functions. The minister also has a power to request and obtain information about the activities of the corporation in line with his or her portfolio responsibilities. As well, the minister makes the appointments to the board of directors but will do so in consultation with ATSIC and the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On another point, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory has expressed reservations about the land fund. His concern is that land acquired under land fund provisions and subject to normal title holding rules will be claimed under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, and thus lead to an inappropriate increase in land held under inalienable title. This will not result from the legislation before the House today. We have included in the legislation a clause prohibiting claims under the Land Rights Act being made in relation to land acquired by the Indigenous Land Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of implementation, the Native Title Act provides for the establishment of the land fund under section 201. However, it does not provide enough scope for the establishment and operations of the Indigenous Land Corporation in the way we consider essential for an effective response to the need for land. That is why this bill was necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an interim measure, the fund will be set up by regulations under the Native Title Act. We plan that the corporation begin operations on 1 January 1995 when this legislation comes into force and section 201 of the Native Title Act, which sets up the fund, will then be repealed. There is a need for the interim arrangement as moneys have already been allocated and will have to be invested pending the establishment of the Indigenous Land Corporation under this bill. ATSIC, as the body with primary responsibility for the management of indigenous affairs, will from 1 January undertake the day-to-day administrative arrangements for the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude on these points. Through millennia the indigenous people of this continent have demonstrated extraordinary strength and resilience and never more so than in the past 200 years. Since European settlement they have survived the alienation of their land, the destruction of their culture, brutality and disease, the heartbreaking severance of family and community bonds. They have survived, but the losses have been immeasurable and proof of the damage remains all too plainly to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the native title legislation, Australia took an historic step by finally acknowledging the truth that Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders were the original owners of the continent. In the legislation before the House today, we are giving the spirit of that legislation more tangible expression. We are creating the means by which land may be returned to Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders and, with the foundation of their traditions and identity thus partially restored, we trust that they may be able to protect and revitalise their communities, their culture and their heritage. Mr Acting Speaker, I commend this bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition has carefully considered its position on this legislation since the introduction of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill on 30 June because it attempts to address an issue of critical importance to this country&mdash;namely, the systematic disadvantage of Australia's indigenous people. It is, however, the firm belief of the coalition that this bill does not address in an adequate way the unacceptable deprivation of Aboriginal people in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time to test the government's bona fides. Is it serious about reconciliation and bipartisanship or are these words merely idle talk for political advantage? Are they phrases simply trundled out to hide the need for genuine debate and reform or do they have substance? Is the government serious about the things that matter&mdash;including health, education and housing&mdash;or does it just have a part-time conscience? I challenge the government to embrace our amendments to this bill. These are amendments which go to the heart of Aboriginal economic and social disadvantage. Now we will see whether the government is truly concerned with the welfare of Australia's indigenous people or whether it is simply playing for political advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before explaining why I believe this bill is inadequate and in need of reform, I feel it is appropriate to take some time to outline the nature and extent of Aboriginal disadvantage. It is important to do this because, to have a clear understanding of the problem and to have any hope of finding a solution, we must understand the heart of the problem. Land is an important aspect of Aboriginal health. The concept of Aboriginal health is a holistic one which encompasses the special and unique relationship that Aboriginal people have with the land. It is for these reasons that I support the various state mechanisms for purchasing or otherwise acquiring land for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land is important, but to focus on land to the exclusion of other pressing issues is to ignore the facts and simply re-run previously failed policies. Land alone is no panacea for Aboriginal health, education and social problems. Health workers estimate that up to 60 per cent of Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory have hearing deficiencies as a result of infectious ear conditions. The resultant hearing loss has a very serious impact on the educational opportunities of these children. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will address these issues, as I said, because we think it is intolerable to allow these things to go unchallenged. Any attempt to address seriously the disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people must begin with candid recognition of the root cause of the problem and a determination to address it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, the matters we are attempting to address are too important to be used for political advantage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Unfortunately, the early years of Labor's current period in office were marred by a divisive and self-serving approach to these issues. Who can forget Susan Ryan's wild boast that the problem of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander housing would be solved within a few years? The government's inept attempts to develop a national approach to land rights, which were foiled by Brian Burke and his state Labor government, is another example of Labor raising Aboriginal people's expectations to a point where they were cruelly crushed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the bill itself, I want to say that the coalition will support it subject to the government accepting our amendments. Three principles govern our amendments. Firstly, the land fund and the Indigenous Land Corporation must be structured in such a way as to give priority to Aboriginal health, education and wellbeing overall. The critical element in any decision regarding the grant must be the advancement of the people as a whole. This means that the potential for economic improvement and the attainment of self-sufficiency cannot be ignored in the administration of the fund. The value and utility of the grant must be considered. To do otherwise is to abrogate our responsibility in search of a quick fix. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we recognise that at present much of the land held by indigenous people is underused. The land management section of the bill must be strengthened and enhanced so as to give priority to the development of land which is underutilised. The failure to date of new land grants to guarantee improvements in Aboriginal health demands that resources be channelled into giving indigenous people the chance to build and develop their existing homes and communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, a $1.5 billion fund must be subject to scrupulous accountability. It must be accountable to its intended beneficiaries&mdash;the indigenous people of Australia&mdash;and it must be accountable to the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), will detail to the House the amendments upon which coalition support for the bill will rest and which we trust the government will accept in good faith. Those amendments are based upon the concerns that I have outlined in this speech and upon the principles I have identified for consideration of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House has before it an unparalleled opportunity. It is an opportunity that I give the government for bipartisan reconciliation.

In the course of making this speech today, which I make on behalf of the coalition and with goodwill, I can only say how disappointed I am at the response of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and some of the backbenchers. </PARA>

The Leader of the Opposition is cloaking his words seeking bipartisan support for this bill. He is really saying that, unless the government is prepared to totally overlook the purpose of this bill, totally distort what this bill is all about and fully accept all the amendments proposed by the opposition, the opposition will not support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That action shows that the opposition has absolutely no understanding or knowledge of what this bill is seeking to achieve nor of the importance of land to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The opposition has completely lost the plot. It does not understand the fundamental tenets of this proposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the last four years that I have been in this place, I have witnessed many efforts by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) to achieve a bipartisan position on Aboriginal affairs. There was one occasion in this House when that was achieved, and that was on the passage of the legislation to establish the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. But on most other occasions the opposition has failed to accept its responsibilities in Aboriginal affairs and to take up the challenge of having a unified position in the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That was clearly demonstrated last year by the position of opposition members on the native title legislation, and I think most of them now realise that theirs was a foolish position to adopt which marginalised them from the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it appears that opposition members are going to engage in that same hopeless, useless process on this legislation. What they have outlined to us today through the address of the Leader of the Opposition is that, unless this government totally changes and distorts the purpose of the land acquisition fund, they will not support it. So all the statements they have made in the last two days about now supporting the land acquisition fund have been false. It is an attempt at a confidence trick on the people of Australia and particularly the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We do not have a position where those decent people on the other side of the House, those who claim to be called the moderates, have actually had any sort of victory. Nothing could be further from the truth. Once more, we have the opposition totally controlled by the far Right, by the ideologues. That is the essence of the position that the opposition leader has just outlined to us on this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that opposition members have no understanding of the essential point of this bill, and that is the importance of land to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. All of us in this House want to do something to address the appalling health situation, education situation and unemployment situation of Aboriginal people. But what members of the opposition fail to understand is that, unless we heal the spirit of the Aboriginal people, we are not going to heal the body. To heal the spirit we must address the question of land. That is the first and most essential component of our actions. The opposition 20 years ago recognised this because it established the first form of a land acquisition fund&mdash;which in recent years ATSIC has been administering&mdash;but it was just small bickies at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, with this legislation we are now building substantially on the initiative taken 20 years ago by the much more progressive coalition parties, which were in power at that time. I take this opportunity to try to instil into this debate some sense and understanding about what land means. I will start by quoting Mick Dodson, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To fully understand why land rights are so important to indigenous peoples, you have to move out of the paradigm that sees land as purely a commodity to be exploited. . . For us, land has a spiritual, cultural, political and economic value. It supports our identity, our spirit, our social relations, our integrity and our survival. Land is the source of our physical and spiritual sustenance. Removed from our land we are literally removed from ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA>To understand the importance and significance of this legislation we are debating today and its contribution to the wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, non-Aboriginal Australians have to throw off their European cultural and economic values and open their eyes, their hearts and their minds to what it is to be an Aboriginal person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an enormous body of evidence and argument, stretching back over more than 100 years, which explains the importance of land to Aboriginal people. Yet, despite this overwhelming evidence, despite the fact that the right to land has been the unifying campaign of Aboriginal people for more than 30 years in this country and despite the recognition of this by our most important legal institution&mdash;the High Court&mdash;in its Mabo No. 2 decision, we still witness the unedifying spectacle of members of the opposition desperately grappling with this basic tenet. The position of opposition members on this legislation further demonstrates that they still have lost the plot and do not understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To set this debate into some context and to try to assist the opposition members to come to grips with the reality rather than their rhetoric that we have just been exposed to from their leader, I would like to spend some time responding to the proposition that the government is wasting the money on land acquisition when the greater priorities are health, housing, et cetera. I would like to quote from the introductory section of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Aboriginal Health Strategy Report</EMPHASIS> of March 1989:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Health" to Aboriginal peoples is a matter of determining all aspects of their life, including control over their physical environment, of dignity, of community self-esteem, and of justice. It is not merely a matter of the provision of doctors, hospitals, medicines or the absence of disease and incapacity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Traditional Aboriginal social systems include a three-dimensional model that provides a blue-print for living. Such a social system is based on inter-relationships between people and land, people and creator beings, and between people, which ideally stipulates inter-dependence within and between each set of relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ABORIGINAL SPIRITUALITY WAS, AND IS, ESSENTIALLY LAND-CENTRED.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal people were totally dependent on the land and on all it could provide. To cope with this, they developed a social organisation that would enable them to use their natural environment successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal health methods practised then are often still prominent in the delivery of health care in many Aboriginal communities today. This is despite the introduction of Western style health systems which are primarily interested in the recognition and treatment of disease. Aboriginal medicine seeks to provide a meaningful explanation for illness and to respond to the personal, family, and community issues surrounding illness. Aboriginal medicine and practices are a complex system closely linked to land based cultural beliefs. For this reason, Aborigines in contemporary Australia see health as a sovereign issue&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a land issue. To understand it from a traditional Aboriginal cultural perspective, I would like to quote Mrs Nellie Camfoo, the Deputy Chairman of the Aboriginal Protection Authority of the Northern Territory:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One thing we have talked about a lot at meetings is the need to explain to. . . (Europeans) about the responsibilities custodians carry under Aboriginal tradition. For my people ceremony is life for us, body for us, culture for us. We are all ceremony people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our law if say. . . (the Europeans are) digging and breaking up that ceremony ground and other ceremony leaders know we have been selling out or have done a lot of damage to it we are going to get "sung". That's why we believe that, when say mining people come and dig up a sacred site, we are going to die. If other people don't kill us, we are gonna get sick and die.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When he ruins our "ceremony area" by mining, that's our body he's busted up. He dig that, that's our body, and all that stone that's our culture.</PARA>
<PARA>To give another perspective to this concept, I quote from an article by John Avery provided by the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority in its submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where Aborigines live in proximity to traditional lands, identification with land, which is substantially through sacred sites, has far reaching implications. The tendency to live close to ancestral territories is a corollary of the tendency to live with relatives: a graph of the relationship between geographical and genealogical distances among Aboriginal people typically would show a relatively smooth decline of genealogical relatedness with distance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this social order, landedness and kinship combine in a cultural vocabulary which defines where and with whom Aboriginal people live, with whom they marry, their social relationships, the organisation of rites of passage, their roles in sacred ceremonies and a broad spectrum of other rights including the allocation of non-Aboriginal resources and collective or community property.</PARA>
<PARA>The Mabo decision in the government's native title legislation, combined with the Northern Territory land rights act and other acts of state governments, has gone a considerable way towards addressing the land needs of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders living in rural and remote areas or on their traditional lands. However, almost 70 per cent of Australia's 260,000 indigenous people live in cities and towns and have not had their land needs addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the people and the descendants of people who have been the victims of the colonisation process. They are the dispossessed. It is wrong, however, to consider that they have lost their spiritual connections to land. In the national report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, this point is made very clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of land to Aboriginal people who have moved or been moved to other places as a result of colonisation is one that is perhaps less understood by non-Aboriginal people, yet the population of Aboriginal people who have moved away from traditional lands or experienced a complete transformation of their relationship to land, at least in the economic sphere, is a very significant proportion of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding this break from specific traditional attachments to land that some Aboriginal groups in the more remote areas of Australia have been able to maintain, Aboriginal people in the settled areas of Australia have continued to maintain the core elements of their spiritual association with land. This association is an assertion of their Aboriginality. Their loss requires redress that is, in essence, the same, even though the form of redress may vary considerably.</PARA>
<PARA>In essence, the message is clear: as I said before, we cannot heal the body unless we first heal the spirit of Aboriginal people. The spirit of Aboriginal and Islander people is intertwined and interconnected with land. Access to the land and rights over land are essential to the achievement of better physical, social, economic and cultural outcomes for Aboriginal and Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important point that needs to be made is that, for many Aboriginal people, there is at present no security in their occupation of some lands or their current housing. Without securing title and therefore control over their own land, Aboriginal and Islander people cannot secure the necessary funding to provide the infrastructure which will raise their living standards. They need title to the land. They need security in their occupancy. They also need a commitment to build the water supply, the sewerage systems, the garbage disposal systems, the roads and drainage, the recreational facilities, the housing, the educational services and the medical services. As Lois O'Donoghue, Chairperson of ATSIC, said earlier this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot divorce the issue of land from others that will affect our well-being . . . Land will not automatically give Aboriginal people physical health&mdash;although spiritual health is another matter. This will only happen when governments . . . put their rhetoric into action and provide their Aboriginal citizens with the basics&mdash;housing, sewerage and the other infrastructure. At least if Aboriginal people owned their own land, that's one less excuse for governments to justify their inaction.</PARA>
<PARA>A central objective of the land acquisition fund, strongly supported by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, is its focus on greater independence and self-reliance for indigenous people. They do not want to be forever dependent on the government. They wish to build a self-reliant future for themselves and their families. The land fund will contribute to the achievement of that objective. This land fund is consistent with the key recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody which recognised dispossession as the root cause of the disempowerment and marginalisation of Aboriginal and Islander people in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is totally inappropriate and unacceptable that the Leader of the Opposition says that the opposition wants the funds which the government has allocated to go to the land acquisition fund diverted into what he sees and states are the more important priorities of health, education and housing. There is not a pecking order of priorities. Those things have equal priority. It is clear from the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition today that, unless we support his distortion of the use of those funds in that way and the transference of the money that has been allocated for the purchase of land to those other services, he will not support this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the Opposition well knows, this government has been involved in a number of initiatives to address those other issues. In the budget in which we allocated the first $200 million to the land acquisition fund we also included a substantial increase in the allocation of funds for Aboriginal health. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) achieved a substantial increase in the budget allocation for Aboriginal health. Of course we would all like to see much more, and we will continue to fight for more. As opposition members well know, there is still a social justice package to be completed by the government which will be announced next year and which will contain further increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the be-all and end-all of our initiatives for Aboriginal people in this country. It builds upon the national Aboriginal health strategy; it builds upon the Commonwealth's comprehensive response to the recommendations arising from the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody; it builds upon the government's establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation; it builds upon the passage of the native title legislation last year; and it will build upon the substantial increase in Aboriginal health expenditure that was contained in this budget. It is one more important plank; it is not the only plank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one person in this House who has been attempting to distort the purposes of this land acquisition fund to score cheap political points on the Aboriginal funding issue and that is the Leader of the Opposition. His attempt to score cheap political points today by trying to make out that he is opening the arms of a bipartisan position on this, and that it is up to the government to accept or reject it, is a total distortion of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With no opportunity to understand exactly what the opposition's policy would be, because we have not seen any policy documents from the current Leader of the Opposition, all we can do to reflect upon what the opposition would do if it were in government at this time is look at its last policy manifesto. Let us compare what that contained with the rhetoric we heard just recently from the Leader of the Opposition. It is important to understand that, had this country had the misfortune to elect the coalition in March last year, we would have seen from a coalition government a $90 million a year cut in expenditure on Aboriginal health and housing. That is the reality of the opposition's policy position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only ones who have been engaging in political point scoring and rhetoric today have been those opposite.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must express my disappointment that the current Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is at the table, has allowed himself to be used in this way. May I point out that the minister wrote to churches urging them to come to the coalition to urge us to support the fund. This was a very nice political ploy. He did not write to them in private; he let the press know of his letters. It would have been very good if the minister had actually come to me as the shadow minister and said, `We want to sit down; let's talk.' If we had not had any sort of meeting, he could then have written to the churches. But to have done what he did to gain publicity and then look holier than thou I think is not worthy of the minister at the table.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disadvantage faced by Australia's indigenous people is very real. Last century and earlier this century, many were dispossessed from their land.

The latter half of this century has seen a series of attempts by all governments&mdash;Labor and Liberal; state and federal&mdash;to address the problems of a century and a half of neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike previous governments, this government has attempted to make a political issue out of addressing the disadvantages faced by Aboriginals. In doing so, it belittles the genuine plight of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In seeking dramatic and often popular solutions, it fails to address many of the real problems facing Australia's indigenous people. Addressing the problems faced by indigenous Australians requires thoughtful measures that go to the source of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the government's efforts&mdash;many of which I believe are sincere, many of which are misguided and many of which are simply populist&mdash;a great deal of its actions have failed to address the real issues. This brings me to the comments of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who misquoted what the Leader of the Opposition said and accused the opposition of diverting funds from the land fund to other issues. I point out to the honourable member for Moreton, who was not interested in remaining in the House to hear what I have to say, that he has got it wrong. The actions of the honourable member in leaving the House show the real level of interest of those opposite in this debate. I suggest that, if the interest of those opposite matched their rhetoric, their side would not be&mdash;as it is now&mdash;empty except for those speakers preparing to speak on the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How will this land fund advantage Aboriginal people? Nowhere have I heard this question addressed&mdash;not specifically, not generally and not in the second reading speech of the Prime Minister&mdash;and that is one of the great absences in the bill. The coalition accepts that land is and always has been central to Aboriginal culture and that alienation from the land suffered by many Aboriginal people has been a cause, but not the total cause, of many of the problems they now face. However, some of the communities suffering from the worst health problems and the poorest education of their children do own their own land. The people in these communities suffer from poor housing, bad water and appalling sanitation conditions. I have seen those conditions, and the minister at the table has seen them. Therefore, land by itself is not enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Giving land to people in an Aboriginal community does not in itself improve their health, housing and educational standards. The coalition accepts that for outback Aboriginal people at least it is an important part of the solution to the problem. But, as I have said, we will not accept that land alone is the solution to a host of very real and genuine problems. Consequently, we will be seeking amendments to this bill to ensure that, before land is purchased for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the Indigenous Land Corporation&mdash;which is set up by this bill to purchase land to hand to corporations and, hopefully, to be bought by individuals&mdash;must show how that purchase will improve the health, housing or education of that community. This measure is central. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We seek demonstrable benefits to Aboriginal communities as a key condition for purchasing land.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us today is so general as to be directionless. It has not addressed the key questions. In setting up the Indigenous Land Corporation it does not give direction as to what are the key purposes for buying land, how purchases will assist either outback or urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, who is to be assisted, who is not to be assisted, and how determinations are made between competing claims on the fund. There is no indication whatsoever in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister originally made claims that led Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians to believe that Aboriginal people would have almost $1.5 billion to spend on land. Technically this may be correct, but the real figure that is available for the purchase of land is $45 million per year indexed, of which $21 million is already available through the ATSIC land fund. Therefore, the only new money available for the purchase of land by Aboriginal people is $24 million per year indexed. This $24 million will not go totally to the purchase of land. Some of it will go on administration and some will go on the upgrading of newly bought land and existing Aboriginal properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latter use of the fund is supported by the coalition, as there is a need to provide funds to return Aboriginal owned stations to productivity. One of the problems we have faced is that many of the stations that are owned by Aboriginal people are not productive. The funds have not been available to allow them to upgrade&mdash;to provide fences, to provide capital equipment. They have been taken out of the stock of Australia's wealth. That has not assisted Aboriginal people and it has not assisted the economic status of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened in this bill is a long way from the Prime Minister's original rhetoric. With the exception of Tasmania and Victoria, the states already provide mechanisms for acquiring land for Aboriginal people. As there is a danger of a plethora of land funds competing with each other and of lacking coordination, we do not see the need for a separate land fund in ATSIC and the Indigenous Land Corporation. We will therefore be moving that these two funds be combined into one as soon as the ILC is operational so that the ILC will retain $45 million per annum instead of $24 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes reference to national and regional land strategies. However, it is extraordinarily vague. There is no real requirement for the ILC to produce strategies that stand up to scrutiny that would be expected of similar organisations, nor is there a requirement that the strategies be in place before land is purchased. We will therefore be moving in the detail stage of this bill that the national land strategy be a disallowable instrument in both houses of parliament. The minister will be required to table in the parliament the national indigenous land strategy and the ILC will be able to commence its land purchases only after the strategy has sat on the table for 15 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This in no way lessens the powers of the ILC; it is asking for a level of detail and accountability that would be expected from any organisation which has a budget of $45 million a year. As the strategy is a disallowable instrument, the parliament will not be able to change it but only send it back to the ILC if the parliament believes the ILC has not provided a strategy that properly fulfils its brief or if the strategy in some way contravenes the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred before to the land programs of the states. As it is important that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land fund and the land acquisition programs of the states not be in conflict and do not overlap, we will be moving an amendment that ensures the regional land strategies be implemented in concert with the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also want to address the composition of the board. The coalition would like to see the qualification requirements tightened as at present a situation could arise where no board member has experience in the areas of either business and commerce or land management. The coalition also believes that the states should have a nominee on the board to ensure that the land acquisition and management functions of the board are coordinated with the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to speak specifically to some of the amendments that we will be raising. At this stage they are in general form only. We will be moving them in their specific form in the consideration in detail stage of this bill. First and foremost, as I foreshadowed earlier in my speech, we wish to change the focus of the bill so that when the ILC purchases land it must show there will be an improvement in health, housing and the economic situation of the Aboriginal community for which the land is purchased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned that we wish the national land strategy to be a disallowable instrument, and that no land be purchased by the ILC until that land strategy has sat on the table for 15 days to allow the scrutiny of parliament. This does not mean that the parliament can amend the strategy; it simply means that the parliament can return it to the ILC if it finds it deficient, as would be the case with any similar organisation. I have also foreshadowed that the regional land strategy must be drawn up in consultation with the states and through the states with local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board of the ILC should be appointed on the basis of skill and experience in investment. Land acquisition and management and other significant roles required in the corporation are not limited to only five Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. There are many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders with skills, and their talents should be used in the corporation. It is paternalism indeed to expect that Aboriginal people would not have these skills, and to suggest that the board could not comprise only Aboriginal people who have such skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In purchasing land, priority must go to those areas where Aboriginal people cannot claim native title. You will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that native title was the reason for this bill in the first place. All the rhetoric of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs said that we need to provide land for people who cannot benefit from the Native Title Bill, yet there is nothing in this bill that addresses that issue whatsoever&mdash;and it must be addressed in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be moving that the upgrading of Aboriginal and pastoral properties be given priority in those areas where there is already a substantial land-holding for Aboriginal people. It is important that Aboriginal people on those properties be able to use them as viable economic concerns. We will also be moving that the money from ATSIC be incorporated into the ILC so that there is only one land fund and not two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will be amendments that we will be moving in the House of Representatives, but that is not the full comprehensive list of amendments. There will be a series of other amendments that we will be moving in the Senate because we will be asking that this bill be passed to a Senate committee for consideration. There are many weaknesses in this bill that I, as an individual, am not competent to address, and neither is this parliament, without input from those people whom the bill affects. For that reason, we will be moving in the Senate that it goes to a Senate committee to be properly and thoroughly examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, at this stage, I want to clearly foreshadow some of the amendments we will be moving in the Senate so there can be no doubt as to where we stand on this bill. We wish to exclude the possibility of native title on land purchases. We do this because we believe that Aboriginal people, like other Australians, have the right, as do other Australians, to have land able to be dealt with by future generations unencumbered by special title. Therefore, land purchased is to keep the title of freehold or leasehold under which it is purchased with no special additions or deductions. To do otherwise is to treat Aboriginal people as if they were different or inadequate in the area of land ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also be moving that the fund include individual ownership of land. We note this bill allows the ownership of land only by corporations. We believe there are families, individuals, trusts and Aboriginal partnerships that should benefit from this fund and should be able to use moneys from the fund in a wide variety of ways to set up businesses&mdash;which could include ecotourism businesses but would not be limited to them; there is a whole range of possible businesses. As I have said, there is no reason why, with Aboriginal people, legislation should not include individuals and families, but always a corporation, and why Aboriginal people should differ in this from other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be exploring ways to identify land that has an ILC interest for those innocent third parties who might be caught up. That is a detail of the bill that we will be going through further. States should have a nominee on the ILC board and a suitable mechanism should be available. This is an important amendment. I would have preferred to have been able to move it in the House of Representatives. I am not doing so because obviously a mechanism has to be found to do this and, as the in detail stage will be tomorrow, there is simply not the time for us to negotiate what sort of mechanism might be available. That is why that will be moved in the Senate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your indulgence in granting me an extension of time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And those who voted for it. Assistance for the economic development of land should include the possibility of assistance to minority Aboriginal interests. As the bill stands at the moment, there has to be a 50 per cent interest of Aboriginal people for a group to be considered as an Aboriginal corporation under the bill. We can envisage the situation where there would be fewer Aboriginal people, perhaps 25 per cent, involved in a business interest. We believe that assistance should be able to go to that minority group which does not have a 50 per cent interest. Again, we will be looking at this in the Senate to find an appropriate way of wording such an amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would also wish to move that the land subject to native title should not be able to be purchased. A provision to ensure that a non-claimant application is lodged to give notice to potential native title claimants prior to any contract being entered into for the purchase of land is a potential safeguard for native title claimants themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have flagged a number of amendments that we will be making in the Senate. We are not limiting ourselves to these amendments alone. We are very serious about these amendments, but we will be extending them in the Senate after this bill hopefully goes to a Senate committee and we hear evidence and submissions from people who will be affected by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the coalition is very sincere in its efforts to be part of the Aboriginal reconciliation in this country. We acknowledge the genuine and real problems facing Aboriginal people today. We acknowledge that in the past what has been done has often been done with goodwill but, in the end, it has not served the interests of Aboriginal people. I would ask the minister to have dialogue with the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate the words of the Leader of the Opposition that bipartisanship does not mean the opposition simply saying yes to the government. It means that the government must come to the opposition, sit down and negotiate to reach a solution that is acceptable to both sides. If the government is prepared to do that, the opposition is more than willing to do that, but we will not simply say yes in the interests of bipartisanship. We will fight hard for what we believe are the correct ways to address the real and genuine issues of Aboriginal disadvantage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill this afternoon. Firstly, I want to make a few remarks about the previous speakers this afternoon, particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), my colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal and Islander affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who has just completed her contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have seen a clear distinction here today between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. The Prime Minister's contribution showed his very caring approach to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and showed the commitment of this Labor government to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The attack today by the Leader of the Opposition on the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is at the table and who is now the longest serving minister in that portfolio, was frivolous and unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition should have withdrawn his remarks earlier today, because they were certainly not correct. Both the Prime Minister and the minister have been trying to work towards a bipartisan position on the plight of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. We are very proud of this, particularly the efforts that the minister has made in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the attacks made by the Leader of the Opposition today are frivolous and should be considered as such. It is the opposition, certainly not honourable members on this side of the House, which is trying to turn this bill into a political issue. We have worked collectively with the whole community and have tried to include the opposition in that process, but it has another agenda. The Leader of the Opposition certainly has an agenda and I think it is his survival as Leader of the Opposition. That is what he has been on about over recent weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in the debate when the Prime Minister was speaking I looked up to the galleries at the young children from the various schools that visit parliament. In years to come those children will look back and say, `Yes, I was there when the Prime Minister spoke on that land acquisition bill.' It must have been a proud occasion for those children to see the great commitment by our Prime Minister to the process of reconciliation with the Aboriginal people, as distinct from that of the Leader of the Opposition. I am sure that all his colleagues opposite must be feeling somewhat wounded by his miserable contribution here today and his miserable efforts as the Leader of the Opposition in the reconciliation process since he has been the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indeed a great pleasure to have this opportunity to support one of the most important pieces of legislation that this House has debated in the interests of this nation, as it was with the Native Title Bill at the end of last year. It is quite appropriate that we are discussing the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill at this time, coming as it does so soon after Cathy Freeman's wonderful display of pride in the heritage of her people at the Commonwealth Games last week and over the weekend. I know that some honourable members do not agree with that but they should understand that pride, essentially, is at the centre of this bill&mdash;Aborigines' and Torres Strait Islanders' pride in their present day selves, pride in their past and hope for their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no such pride when people are continually reminded on a daily basis that they have been denied social justice. The main purpose of this bill is to bring an end to that feeling by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land fund to provide for the acquisition of land for Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders who are unable to benefit from native title. I make that point because, clearly, the opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs does not understand that and nor does the Leader of the Opposition. So the opposition's other speakers might like to correct the ignorance of their colleagues who have already spoken on this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the honourable member for Maranoa knows it too, so when he makes his contribution he might be able to correct his leader and the honourable member for Hindmarsh who are dead-set wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also establishes an Indigenous Land Corporation to manage the acquisition of land and to provide for the management of indigenous held land. On 3 June 1992 the High Court handed down its historic Mabo decision in recognising the existence of native title in Australia: native title survived only if the traditional owners had maintained their connection with the land, and if no inconsistent title over the land had been granted to someone else. As most Aboriginal people would not benefit from native title, having previously been dispossessed of their traditional lands, the government announced that it would establish a land fund to allow the acquisition of land for these groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, in his second reading speech on that most historic piece of legislation, the Native Title Bill 1993, observed that the Mabo decision gives little more than a sense of justice to those Aboriginal communities whose native title has been extinguished or lost. He went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While these communities remain dispossessed of land their economic marginalisation and their sense of injury continues. As a first step, we are establishing a land fund. It will enable indigenous people to acquire land and to manage and maintain it in a substantial way in order to provide economic, social and cultural benefits for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to add some telling statistics to that statement to illustrate the position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders whose desperate social situation is still misunderstood by many Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following figures are taken from the June 1994 edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aboriginal and Islander Health Worker Journal.</EMPHASIS> It says that ATSI peoples' death rates are three times that of the general population; their infant and perinatal mortality rates are three times that of the general population; life expectancy is 15 to 20 years less than non-ATSI people; 33 per cent of Aboriginal men live to their 65th birthday, whereas 75 per cent of non-Aboriginal men live to 65; and 50 per cent of Aboriginal women live till their 65th birthday but 90 per cent of non-Aboriginal women live to 65. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To quote Mick Dodson, these are the figures of death. And such conditions are not accidental&mdash;they are related to the social standing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who, because of two centuries of neglect, suffer endemic poverty and have little control over the only resource they have: land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation seeks to attack the social conditions that follow upon dispossession. The government's specific objectives in establishing the land fund and the Indigenous Land Corporation are to enable indigenous people to acquire land and to manage it in a sustainable way, and to provide self-generating economic, social and cultural benefits. The establishment of a self-sustaining capital fund will provide a secure and ongoing source of funds for the Indigenous Land Corporation to spend on land acquisition and management. This will provide Aboriginal and Islander groups with the vital increments which are so necessary for a well-planned, long-term strategy to raise their socioeconomic standing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said before that few Australians have a real understanding of Aboriginal and Islander issues&mdash;of course, that is specifically the case with members of the opposition. This lack of real understanding is not necessarily anyone's fault; rather, it is a result of a lack of education of indigenous issues in past generations. For instance, how many average Australians know that the majority of ATSI people live in major and smaller urban areas as opposed to rural areas? You would think those opposite believe that the country is the only place where they live. Yet the idea persists in some sections of the community that the only legitimate Aborigines are those living a traditional lifestyle. It points out how much further as a nation we have to go in the reconciliation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of this bill are aimed at those people who can no longer live on their traditional lands. Figures released earlier this year by the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research in its discussion paper titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Relative Economic Status of Indigenous People in Queensland 1986-91</EMPHASIS> showed that a large majority of indigenous people live in urban areas. Between 1986 and 1991, the number of Aborigines living in cities and major urban areas went from 9,695 to 13,922&mdash;a 43.6 per cent change&mdash;representing more than a quarter of the Queensland Aboriginal population. A similar trend emerged in smaller urban areas. In 1986 there were 21,218 Aboriginal people living in these areas; by 1991 the figure had increased to 24,000&mdash;a 13 per cent change. That 24,000 represented 43 per cent of the Aboriginal population at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the paper reveals a different story in rural and outback areas&mdash;supposedly the domain of Aboriginal people. In 1986 there were 17,185 Aboriginal people living in the Queensland country. By 1991 this figure had hardly moved&mdash;there was an increase of 420 persons to 17,605, a two per cent change. This group represented 31 per cent of the total Aboriginal population in Queensland&mdash;only six per cent more than the number in cities and 12 per cent less than in smaller urban areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar story emerges with Torres Strait Islanders. Between 1986 and 1991, the number living in cities increased by 95.4 per cent, giving a total of 2,730&mdash;or 19 per cent of the total Islander population. There was a slight decline in numbers in smaller urban areas, but a 28 per cent increase in rural areas was an early indicator that the drift away from the Torres Strait in the 1980s&mdash;which in 1986 saw 62 per cent of the Torres Strait Islander population of Queensland living in areas located away from the Strait&mdash;may be reversing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that several members opposite, when given a chance to show bipartisan support for the promise of this bill, have chosen to make some questionable comments. Those members range from the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;whose contribution to the process prior to last night's announcement was to repeal the act&mdash;to the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), whose outburst over Cathy Freeman last week has, I would suggest, given greater impetus to the debate about our national identity than just about anything else that has occurred. The member for Groom probably would not agree with me, but I think he knows that the majority of Australians were on Cathy's side when he made those comments. He was not interested in appealing to the majority of Australians; I would suggest that he was only interested in the extreme Right in his own electorate. It is unfortunate that he is not here to take part in this debate&mdash;he is overseas at the moment. But I, along with everyone else here, would have been very interested in his comments on this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the remarks made by the former leader of the opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), who said on radio over the weekend&mdash;after being so shabbily treated by his current leader&mdash;that he fears for the future of the Liberal Party. He is not the only one. He said that the Liberal Party is in danger of being taken over by the hard Right. This man is the architect of Fightback, which proposed cutting off unemployment benefits after nine months, reducing industrial protection for workers, introducing below award wages, slashing social security and other government spending, and destroying the public health system. And he says that he is worried about the hard Right taking over! I am glad that we had a caring, sharing opposition when he was around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether we saw the first sign of that takeover when the current Leader of the Opposition said in Western Australia four weeks ago that he would repeal the Native Title Act if the opposition won government. That statement astonished me&mdash;and, I am sure, millions of other Australians. It certainly was a disappointing shock for indigenous people in this country. After the last few years of the community and government coming together on this issue in order to forward the cause of the reconciliation process, we now hear that sort of remark from the party that aspires to lead the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Repealing the Native Title Act would be a slap in the face of true progress and justice in Australia and would constitute a threat to the sense of unified nationhood achieved with the passing of the native title legislation last year in the International Year of the World's Indigenous People. Having had the opportunity to see quite a few Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities first-hand as a member of the House of Representative Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I can say that we still have a long way to go in the reconciliation process. The last thing we need is comments like those from the Leader of the Opposition made to a room full of miners and the Western Australian tory government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need from members in this place is leadership. We have that leadership from the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, who is at the table. Members on this side of the chamber are prepared to show that leadership in this place and to show our community that we really do have a commitment to reconciliation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I put it to those opposite that they should find a little bit of goodwill amongst their people to do something about aiding the true reconciliation process with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There is no indication of that happening now. We, as elected representatives in this place, must show that leadership. There is no leadership in the Liberal Party or the National Party at the present time that is anything like what is needed. They really do not have any commitment to the reconciliation process and now is the time for them to change their attitude and I challenge them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I must give credit where credit is due. We all welcome the announcement by the opposition that it will support this land fund bill. However, that is undermined by the amendments proposed by the opposition as conditions of that support. That is certainly some sort of Clayton's support. I would have liked to comment on some of those amendments but I will have to leave it until we consider them in detail later in this debate. They are not available to me and they are not available to the minister; I asked him about that before. How do those opposite expect us to respond to some of the comments they made earlier today? Of course, we cannot respond. Those opposite certainly do not want to debate the frivolous amendments that they will put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I was unaware of the Leader of the Opposition's newspaper column until the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) brought it to my attention in question time yesterday. I listened to the quote she took from that column where the Leader of the Opposition wrote that he recognised the link between the issue of land and the health of indigenous Australians. I am encouraged by this statement but, given his recent public comments and his further comments here today, it tends to confuse anyone trying to ascertain the opposition's stance on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think everyone in this place&mdash;and, I would venture to say, most fair-minded Australians&mdash;would acknowledge that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are still the most disadvantaged group in the country. With regard to housing, health, education and employment, there is still a lot of room for improvement. We on this side of the chamber acknowledge that and that is why we are debating this issue today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the core of their social position is the issue of land. My colleague the member for Moreton said earlier that the problems in housing and the other areas can all be traced back to indigenous peoples being dispossessed of their traditional lands. For indigenous people, the connection with the land is essential for their spiritual wellbeing. The cutting of this connection has led to a deep feeling of loss which makes it difficult for many of them to participate fully in contemporary Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures I mentioned before illustrate the fact that the majority of indigenous people do not maintain traditional links with their lands, and so they will find no benefit in the Native Title Act. The government set out to provide other social justice measures, of which the land fund is the most significant, as part of an integrated package to benefit as many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as possible. A recognition and understanding by the wider community of indigenous people's connections to the land and sea was one of the eight key issues for reconciliation identified by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of key issue papers 1-8: addressing the key issues for reconciliation</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If enacted, this bill will establish a new land fund to be called the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land fund, or the land fund, which will take over the money allocated to the land fund established by the Native Title Act. One of the reasons for setting up a new land fund was that the fund established by section 201 restricted the money to be spent on land management to those properties acquired under the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new land fund allows money to be spent on land management for any indigenous held properties regardless of whether they are acquired under the land fund or through the native title process. The new land fund is also placed within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 rather than the Native Title Act, and its detail is provided for in legislation rather than regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important issue in this debate is that this new land fund process cannot be accused&mdash;as some sections of the community continually do&mdash;of giving handouts. After 10 years, the land fund will have significant capital to be able to make payments to the Indigenous Land Corporation from the interest generated by its investments. The land fund is to remain the property of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also establish the Indigenous Land Corporation, or ILC, which will receive an indexed amount from the land fund each year. Until the 1997-98 financial year, the ILC will receive an annual indexed sum of only $24 million because ATSIC will continue to receive the $21 million it currently uses for land acquisition and management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to raise a few more points about the bill, but I think time will beat me. We can probably come back to those points at a later stage when this bill is dealt with in detail. There is a wide scope for further debate on this bill, and I hope that we can have that. One could speak for a long time on the various aspects of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and how the land fund and the ILC will benefit those people. However, I wish to make a few more points. There can be no doubt that reconciliation in this country is perhaps the biggest issue we face both now and in the future. The future will condemn us if we do not get it right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, together with the Native Title Act, gives us as a nation the opportunity to address these important issues in a practical way. Our nation will be brought together when all groups in this country can come forward to take their rightful places in this society.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Three years ago, I reached across the table in this House and shook the hand of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). That was the one and only time that has happened in this House, and I am not sure whether it happened in the old House. Let me tell you how it came about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, the then Prime Minister wrote to the then Leader of the Opposition and asked whether there was a possibility of a more bipartisan approach to Aboriginal affairs. We in the opposition discussed that in opposition committees, in the shadow cabinet and in the party room. The Leader of the Opposition wrote back to the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some months later, the Prime Minister again wrote to the Leader of the Opposition to see whether there might be any possibility of supporting a council for Aboriginal reconciliation. Again, we debated that within the party. I was the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs at the time. I went around the country and discussed the issue with every state and territory leader of the coalition in Australia. We had some concerns and the Leader of the Opposition wrote back to the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the six months that this took place, the minister and I talked and expressed our concerns. I drank his whiskey and he drank my red wine. We got some draft legislation. In fact, the coalition saw it before it came into the House. It never leaked or became public. We told the government of the areas with which we had difficulty. As shadow minister, I took that legislation around the country. Again, I discussed it with every state and territory leader in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major legislation was introduced. We still had some minor concerns, although the minister had already addressed a lot of them. In the end, when this debate came into the House, we did not get everything we wanted and the government did not get everything it wanted. But we were able to have this legislation passed with the unanimous support of the parliament after nine months of work between government and opposition. That has relevance today as I think we can learn something about the process that occurred back then. It tells us how we might go forward in the debate of helping Australia's Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) say the opposition has never had any commitment to bipartisanship in Aboriginal affairs beyond the council for reconciliation. I would remind him of the response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I would remind him of the response and approach to the national Aboriginal health strategy. I would remind him that for the first three years ATSIC was able to establish itself in a constructive environment, in an environment where criticism was meant to help not hinder and an environment where ATSIC may not exist today had that not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 18 months, the Aboriginal affairs debate in this country has not been an easy one and at times it has been personally distressing to me. I can remember the Chairperson of ATSIC, Lois O'Donoghue, coming to the coalition and asking for a generosity of spirit. In the political debate we are having here, that generosity of spirit is perhaps the most important thing we could find, and it is the ingredient that is missing at the moment. Without that generosity of spirit, I do not think we are going to achieve very much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I admit we have not been 100 per cent correct, but I do not accept we have been 100 per cent wrong either. Last year when debating the native title legislation in this parliament I talked about how the debate on Aboriginal affairs is essentially one of false choices&mdash;a debate where things are portrayed as black and white, where things are portrayed as extremes and where it is portrayed as, `You are either for me or against me; you support this legislation or you do not care about the welfare or advancement of Aboriginal people.' That debate was destructive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finished my speech by saying I hoped we could put this debate behind us. We have yet to do that. But there is the possibility of doing that, and I think that possibility exists here. This legislation is a turning point. I believe in the future people will look back and make an assessment whether that opportunity was seized or wasted. The start is not terribly good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning on the radio the minister said he was hoping that we were not going to have political trickery. The Chairperson of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, the member for Moreton, was in this House a few minutes ago accusing us of a massive fraud. I would ask them for a little generosity of spirit too, to perhaps try to take this debate away from party politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill goes to the very heart of Aboriginal disadvantage and, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) has said, dispossession is the root cause of Aboriginal disadvantage. Anyone who has spent significant time with Aboriginal people can find that easy to understand. You just have to go to Cape York and look at the difference between the cape, where they have been dispossessed, and the islands, where they have not; at the difference between the people; and at what a process of dispossession did to an indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land is important, and this bill is important, but that does not mean it is infallible and that we do not have the right to have concerns and have those concerns heard and addressed. Our concerns fall into two main areas. The first area is the focus of the bill and the second area is the accountability of the bill. I will talk about them both in turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moreton accused us of wanting to totally change the bill, making it impossible to purchase land, and to divert all the funds into health, housing and education. That is not true; that is completely at odds with the speech that the Leader of the Opposition gave. What we would want to see does not preclude purchase of sizeable amounts of land for the benefit of Aboriginal people. But let us be honest with ourselves and not kid ourselves that land alone will fix the problem. Let us be honest that this is not an easy task. If it were easy, it would have been done already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this chamber there are people with enormous experience in Aboriginal affairs. I would like to talk about part of mine, because it colours my approach to this bill. I have spent a lot of time in Central Australia. At one stage I spent one week as a doctor working in a remote Aboriginal community. That community was one of the first to receive land under land rights in 1976 because it was on an existing Aboriginal reserve. So the people in this community have had access to a sizeable area of land for a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people in this community have a health clinic that has detailed health records going back to 1945. For every five-year period, the life expectancy of an adult Aboriginal male in that community has decreased. Today, if you are a male in this community, your life expectancy is less than that of an adult male in Sierra Leone, which has the lowest life expectancy of any country in the world. At any point in time, that same Aboriginal community has an incidence rate of sexually transmitted diseases which is somewhere between 25 and 30 per cent of adult people&mdash;a factor that will have enormous implications when the HIV-AIDS virus gets into that community, as it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, land is important to Aboriginal self-esteem, and it is an ingredient. But unless there is some focus to that land&mdash;unless there is some purpose; unless we say at the same time how we are going to best utilise it; unless we put it in terms of a package of providing some sort of economic base for the people who are purchasing it; unless we provide the training; and unless we provide the ongoing assistance to upgrade it&mdash;we will not get very far. We want to see much more of an overall package that will have a direct impact on the wellbeing of Aboriginal people. It does not preclude the purchase of land; it means that that land has some hope of making a difference for the better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major area of concern is, broadly, accountability. Accountability is important. If Aboriginal people are going to be able to get full benefit, it has to be at least with the acquiescence, if not the support, of the broad community. The community will only accept the $1 1/2 billion land fund if it thinks it is getting value for money. We have a number of specific concerns. I will raise some of them. They are not major issues, but collectively they help to give the bill focus and make sure that Aboriginal people will get some value for money and the taxpayer will be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the bill there is a strategy that at the moment goes to the minister only on request. It should go as a matter of course. There is no requirement in the bill that money be used for the purpose as granted. There should be. There is no requirement that the strategy plan be laid before both houses of parliament. That is quite different from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation strategy plan. The system of laying it before both houses of parliament works. The provisions of the bill are framed in a way that assumes that the Minister for Finance will delegate his or her authority to ATSIC. That should not be assumed. The audit by the Office of Evaluation and Audit is at the request of the minister. With a fund of this size, it should not be at the minister's request; it should be regularly audited&mdash;for the protection of Aboriginal people as well as the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> So these are issues of accountability. In one sense, they are not issues of great moment, but they are in another sense. Unless we demand value for money and demand that Aboriginal people get some benefit out of this, the Australian public will not tolerate continuing failure. So these are things on which we must start a dialogue. These are things which the coalition thinks will improve the bill and they are things on which I hope we can take a more bipartisan approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have sat through two days of debate on this bill by my party. I have listened to every person. They have all said, in one way or another, pretty similar things. They have said that they want to see something done to help address Aboriginal disadvantage that will succeed. They do not want more promises that are not achieved. They do not want expectations to be raised and then to be dashed, and they do not want more failure. Let us be honest: there is failure in this area all the time. It is not easy. If it were, it would have been fixed ages ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us be honest. When the national Aboriginal health strategy came in in 1990, there were going to be measurable benchmarks for the improvement in Aboriginal health. Over four years later, where are the benchmarks and where is the improvement? When the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill came into this parliament three years ago, there were going to be benchmarks for addressing Aboriginal disadvantage. Where are those benchmarks? They are important. This is not some obscure economic concept. We have to know whether things are getting better or worse and whether what we are doing is  making a difference for the better. It is not axiomatic that that will happen. If things are not getting better, let us at least be honest with ourselves and say that we should perhaps try something else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This is an emotional debate. I understand the emotion and why those on the other side get emotional, because I, too, can get emotional about this. I had three years as shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. I had the privilege of moving freely throughout Aboriginal society around Australia. As I mentioned, at one stage I worked as a doctor in a community. In other communities, I have watched mothers with infant children fill bottles out of dirty water and feed them to their kids. I have evacuated sick kids with diarrhoea. I have seen success and I have seen failure. But emotion in itself is no good. We will not be remembered for our emotion or our good intentions. People will remember whether we actually did something constructive to address Aboriginal disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What can we learn from the process that we went through in getting a more bipartisan approach to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation&mdash;an approach that has stood the test of time and allows the council to still operate in a pretty constructive environment? We learnt, firstly, that it takes time; secondly, that it takes a degree of trust; and, thirdly, that one side of politics is not always right about everything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some in the Labor Party would paint themselves as being purer than the driven snow. I find that a bit tough, because when trying to take a constructive approach on matters relating to Aboriginal affairs as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I was subjected to the National Media Liaison Service taking the most minute nuances in every one of my statements and attempting to turn them into party political advantage. I was also subjected to being asked to a dinner at ATSIC to celebrate its three-year anniversary. The office of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) rang up and demanded that my invitation be withdrawn, purely for party political purposes. Let us be honest: there is politics on both sides of the House and it is getting us nowhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us look at these three things in turn. It takes time to discuss and argue backwards and forwards to get to understand where the other side is coming from. Bipartisanship is not throwing something up and saying, `Take it or leave it.' It is having a dialogue. That has not occurred, and it is going to make it hard here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also takes trust. That is a difficult thing in politics but it is possible when this parliament decides that it is time to do something. The other element of trust is at least recognising that there is a different point of view, recognising that there might be some goodwill from the other side, that there may not necessarily be political advantage in trying to manipulate that, and recognising that there might be things that could make this work a bit better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier that I thought this legislation would be a turning point. I think that is correct. Either we can now address this issue seriously with a degree of goodwill or the Australian public has every right to believe that we are no more than just a bunch of politicians talking about something that has no relevance to you, me or anyone else in this country. There is an opportunity here to establish a dialogue; to try to work for something that both sides of politics may be able to support. We may not succeed. In the end we may not be able to support this legislation but we at least have to try. We have to have a degree of generosity of spirit that perhaps has not been there in recent times. We have to accept that no-one has 100 per cent of the</PARA>
<PARA>answers on this and, above all, we have to seize this opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be involved in the debate this afternoon and to support the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994. Before the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) leaves the House, if that is what he is intending to do at the present, I have to say that, in terms of generosity of spirit, I take what he said in the way I think he intended it. If I may, I pay him a compliment. It is probably the end of him, as he rightly pointed out, but I have to say that the time he was the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs was the most productive I have seen in terms of the relationship between the government and the opposition on the issue of Aboriginal affairs. So I give what he says the credibility it deserves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I say to him&mdash;as I say to some other members of the opposition&mdash;that, whilst he has that generosity of spirit, there are those around him who do not. In terms of today's debate, the contribution by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) was testimony to that fact. I will go into more detail on that later, but again I say that I know there are people in the opposition with goodwill in relation to this issue and the honourable member for Chisholm is one of those. I understand also that the parliamentary secretary at the table, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne), has similar views to those of the honourable member for Chisholm. I wonder how long he will last as a parliamentary secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already heard this afternoon that land is of importance to Aboriginal people. I will not go into that subject in great detail apart from saying that land is a source of being for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and land is what makes the law for Aboriginal people, which in itself provides a religious, legal, social and economic code for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Pat Dodson once said that land is the generation point of existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land also, of course, is important psychologically, and perhaps there is no better way of saying that than what was said by a Noonkanbah elder speaking to an Amex mining official who was about to enforce drilling rights on Aboriginal land at Noonkanbah. He said, `Can't you see you are killing our minds?' The importance of this relationship to land has been reflected in various reports to parliaments over the years and by judicial inquiries, and I will refer to the Woodward royal commission later in my speech. The 1980 report of the New South Wales parliamentary select committee on Aborigines stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Committee's considered opinion that unless the question of land rights is satisfactorily settled there will be little progress made in the many other areas of Aboriginal socio-economic deprivation, or in the broader fields of race relations . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It stated further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the land remains the key to Aboriginal spiritual and physical survival . . .</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite simply, if Aborigines are going to benefit from health, welfare, education or any other programs, then they need the mental, spiritual and physical sustenance and support of being on their own land.</PARA>
<PARA>In the context of this government's commitment to the Mabo legislation and to issues involved with social justice, and as rightly and properly pointed out by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during his speech this afternoon, this is landmark legislation&mdash;of that there can be no doubt. I am sure that even those opponents on the opposition benches regard it as being landmark legislation, again testified to by the approach adopted by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the land fund recognises the dispossession and the right to land of Aboriginal people whose economic marginalisation represents the effect of that dispossession. The land fund will be accessible to all Aboriginal people and in particular will provide access to land for those&mdash;the great majority&mdash;who would otherwise not have benefited directly from the Mabo decision. It will allow Aboriginal communities to purchase land and to develop sustainable economic programs. It will allow the development of multiple and mixed land uses, such as cattle stations, parks, Aboriginal cottage industries and cultural and land related activities on both native title land and other Aboriginal held land. The land fund will promote the incorporation of traditional Aboriginal land management practices. It will provide funds for the acquisition of land and conversion of land to native title. I think that is of fundamental importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funds available will be used in the acquisition and management of land. There will not be any diversion of funds through various tiers of government or government agencies. That is also important. I will come later to the approach adopted by the opposition in relation to those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions on the development of regional and national strategies will be based on the aspirations and needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and made by them, as will the decisions on the disbursements of the land fund. Yet the opposition's proposals would effectively give state and local governments a veto over how land funds would be used. I ask any reasonable and fair minded person: if we are actually talking about social justice&mdash;justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians&mdash;why would we embark on such a course? Again, I am sure that will become clear when I highlight the comments made by the Northern Territory Chief Minister in relation to Aboriginal land rights and the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land fund will not be used&mdash;and nor should it be  used&mdash;as a slush bucket by the government to substitute for the provision of services and infrastructure that are the responsibility of all governments to provide to an acceptable level for all their citizens. This government should not support the diversion of land funds to cover the abrogation of responsibilities by state and territory governments in the provision of essential services. I point to the victory of our friends, the so-called moderates in the opposition, in the coalition's policy on the land fund. The policy still anticipates and condones the trade-off or siphoning off of funds from land to other services. This should be seen exactly for what it is&mdash;a backdoor way of emasculating the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened very carefully to the words of the Leader of the Opposition when he referred to the land fund helping in the purchase of land&mdash;not purchasing land, but helping in the purchase of land. He alluded to state mechanisms for the purchase of land. What state mechanisms, pray tell, was he talking about? Was he talking about state mechanisms in Western Australia, funded by the Western Australian Treasury, or in the Northern Territory, funded by the Northern Territory Treasury? Let him highlight them to us. No steps have been put in place by either of those two governments for the purchase of land by Aboriginal Australians. In fact, on every occasion that there has been a land claim under the Northern Territory land rights legislation, the Northern Territory government has opposed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Territory government has sought at every turn to frustrate attempts by Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory to secure land for their benefit. Any amendments to this bill that seek to divert the land fund for use in the provision of mainstream services should be seen for what they are&mdash;blatantly political and hypocritical attempts to subvert the purpose of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note importantly in the Prime Minister's speech the continued support of the Prime Minister and the government for the ATSIC program for the acquisition and management of land during the initial period of the establishment of the Indigenous Land Corporation and of the way in which the land fund should be used to purchase land in the Northern Territory. It is important also when acknowledging those remarks for ATSIC to clearly recognise its responsibilities in relation to meeting the special land needs of Aboriginal territorians in the initial period. The Prime Minister has properly and adequately canvassed what is entailed in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the contribution of the Leader of the Opposition. To say that his contribution was appalling is an understatement. To say that it demonstrated gross hypocrisy is also an understatement. To say that he was unctuous is also an understatement. This is the man who said just some weeks ago that the opposition could not support a land fund. In trying to say as he did in his speech&mdash;it was not well put&mdash;that this bill should be about the provision of health, education, housing and economic opportunity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, he totally and purposely missed the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was at Utopia on the day that the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow spokesperson arrived. I did not hear his introduction, but I am told that he did not bother to introduce his shadow spokesperson. When he first arrived, he got involved in a media scrum and had to be pulled away by an Aboriginal person who pointed out to him that the purpose of his visit was to talk to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that the opposition leader shows very little understanding of the issues facing Aboriginal people. It is no wonder that he failed to heed comprehensively what was said to him by Aboriginal people in Central Australia. Did he listen to the views of Aboriginal people or those of the doctor at the Utopia health service? An article by Mike Seccombe referring to the trip of the Leader of the Opposition states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later, he flew to Utopia station, about 280 kilometres north-east of Alice Springs, to visit an Aboriginal health centre, where medical staff told him that without secure land title, Aborigines suffered significant health problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The doctor at Utopia, Dr Karmananda Saraswati, said assessments of the relative health of Aborigines had proved that secure access to land and, particularly, the return to more traditional outstation lifestyles, brought major health benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said the cost of evacuations and in-patient treatment at Utopia was less than 50 per cent of that at other communities. The people ate more healthily from traditional food sources and alcohol and substance abuse was negligible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"If you take away land rights&mdash;once you cut off their spiritual link&mdash;you may just as well be machine-gunning people down," Dr Saraswati said.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what this legislation is all about: providing those Aboriginal Australians who do not have access to land with an  opportunity to acquire it. Hopefully, they will get back some of their traditional country and secure a native title claim over it for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not surprised at the way Aboriginal people in Central Australia perceived the visit by the Leader of the Opposition. I am sure that what he said here today will reinforce their view. One Aboriginal man said the opposition leader was `like a snake'. He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He's over here then we turn around and he's over there, another place.</PARA>
<PARA>That is him. Yesterday and the day before he was with the hard Right in Tasmania. Today, he is seeking to woo the moderates in his own party as a result of his sacking the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson)&mdash;a crude political stunt, and it will be seen as a crude political stunt. Aboriginal people are not going to be fooled by him, and nor should they be. But he is not alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tome of amendments is being proposed by members of the opposition, and if we the government do not accept them they will not support the bill. Is the Leader of the Opposition joking? Is he serious? He seems to be. But that again shows the political purpose of his approach. But, as I say, he is not alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these amendments he is saying that we ought to allow the states and local government to play a role in determining the program for the land fund. How would you like to be an Aboriginal person in the Northern Territory or Western Australia having Richard Court or Marshall Perron looking after your interests in relation to land, or indeed social justice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year on ABC radio the Northern Territory Chief Minister commented on social justice as part of a total social justice package. The interviewer quoted the Northern Territory Chief Minister as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social justice . . . would result in a levelling down of society rather than a levelling up.</PARA>
<PARA>Then the Chief Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To me, Tony, it's a frightening term. It's a term that the democratic socialists used to justify all of those, let me say, non-wealth creating, non-job creating issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is he serious? Then in reference to social justice he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's certainly given us the sorts of things that have infuriated our society about how some sections of the community are entitled to taxpayer funded benefits that others aren't entitled to.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote from the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 11 May, when he referred to the land fund:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will never fix the problems of Aboriginals or people who call themselves Aboriginals&mdash;in Redfern of course&mdash;by limiting this to the rural environment. I am sure that, whether they earn more or less than $100,000, every Aboriginal in this country will have their hands out for a share of this taxpayers' slice of social justice.</PARA>
<PARA>An entirely progressive view, no doubt one which is shared by many people in the opposition&mdash;but I note not all. In relation to the land fund, when asked by a reporter on ABC radio what does it matter if the federal government wants to make $1 billion available to Aboriginal people and put them in a position, therefore, of being property buyers like everybody else in the community, the Northern Territory Chief Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well, it matters a great deal. The principle is you're using taxpayers' funds to satisfy those Aborigines who do not have access to land under Native Title or Land Rights legislation. In the Northern Territory we have nearly 50% of the NT already Aboriginal land or under claim. The balance of the Territory is largely pastoral property. If you provided another 2-3 million dollars in the NT situation you could probably buy 90% of the NT and that would mean that 25% of the Territory's population would own nearly all of the NT.</PARA>
<PARA>They have no problems selling it off to the Sultan of Brunei or to any overseas interest, but woe betide any Aboriginal person who seeks to purchase any additional land. I wonder if he realises that one commercial commentator has indicated that around 60 per cent of all pastoral leases in the Northern Territory are up for sale and leaseholders are jumping over themselves to sell to Aboriginal interests. That is the market&mdash;but of course the free market does not prevail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hypocrisy of the opposition's position could not be better highlighted than by this simple fact: the Leader of the Opposition said to us here this afternoon that we ought to be using this land fund for the purposes of health, education, housing and such like. This bloke has been in parliament for some time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be more inclined to take the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), more seriously if I thought there was some sincerity about them. I find it difficult to believe that there is when I know that he is a member of the left wing who opposes Aborigines earning royalties from uranium mining. They earn something like $15 million to $20 million a year in royalties from the Ranger uranium mine in Kakadu, but they could be earning far more if, for example, Koongarra was allowed to open.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That honourable member has no concern at all for the Aboriginal people when it comes to that issue. He just has his ideological blinkers on&mdash;somehow we can mine uranium here and cannot mine uranium there. If he were fair dinkum, he would listen to what the local Aboriginal people are saying, including the land council Aboriginal people in that part of the world, and allow that mine to open at Koongarra so that the Aborigines in that area could benefit, as they wish to do, from the many millions of dollars that would flow through in royalties. I think the Ranger mine alone has already paid out something in excess of $260 million since about 1980. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussing the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill, it is important to understand from the outset why the government has found it necessary to introduce it into the House. It all stems originally from the Mabo or native title legislation. There was an admission from the government that when this legislation was brought down there would only be five per cent of mainland Aborigines that would actually benefit from the Mabo legislation. Out of that five per cent, the great concentration would lie to the west of this country, primarily in Western Australia. Very few Aborigines in eastern Australia would benefit at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By definition, the native title legislation was discriminatory in a sense. Therefore, further measures had to be taken. The land acquisition fund legislation that we are debating here today is one of those. I believe that in the new year the government will also be bringing down a social justice package which will particularly concentrate on urban Aborigines. That is the situation as far as that goes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all appreciate the plight of Aboriginal people. I think it is fair to say that honourable members debating this bill on both sides of the House have highlighted that. It is a plight that frustrates all of us because we have seen precious little to show for the $10 billion or so that has been spent over the last decade on Aboriginal people, and that is only in specific grants. Aborigines quite rightly have access to other grants that are available to all of us, such as the old age pension, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one pretends it is easy to overcome the difficulties or the plight that Aboriginals find themselves in. In the time that we have had in this country, with the resources we have utilised and the money we have spent, I do not think it is improper to question why we have very little to show for this effort. We do not even have proper benchmarks in place to measure the success, or the lack of it, of all the programs we have. The situation is very complicated indeed. Even in the area of land, apart from the so-called ordinary land that any Australian, including Aboriginal Australians, can purchase, we have land rights land, we now have Mabo land, ATSIC land and we will soon have land acquisition fund land&mdash;and so it goes on. It is quite a complicated position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I asked any one of a number of Aborigines I might bump into in any street in my electorate to explain the situation, I doubt whether any of them could. It is something that seems to get more and more bureaucratic and hidden in the Aboriginal industry area. The benefits which are supposedly intended for the Aboriginal race never seem to flow through. I venture to say that this bill being presented today is nothing more nor less than another cruel deception for the Aboriginal people. An expectation that seems to be built up every time programs are introduced or bills are brought into this House is that somehow Aborigines will benefit substantially. The reality is that they end up getting very little every time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In my electorate of north-west New South Wales, which would take in more Aborigines than anywhere else in New South Wales, the main problem is centred around the dignity of the Aboriginal people. The fact that they cannot get a job and cannot get proper housing and their health, due to alcohol and substance abuse, are big problems. There are massive problems with domestic violence, particularly amongst the Aboriginal women, and education programs all too often do not seem to cater specifically for the Aboriginal people. What we put in place for the rest of Australia seems to be thrust upon them and is not relevant to them. I think more work has to go into that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one seems to go out to consult with the true Aboriginal people. At best, there seems to be some sort of superficial consultation with the Aboriginal industry. I get little complaints and grumbles in my office, and when I run into people around the traps from time to time I am told none of the benefits of these programs seem to get through to them. They have programs imposed on them and money thrust at them, but there is no true consultation, no real training, no proper supervision and no accountability processes. Nobody ever seems to follow through and evaluate the programs that have already been put in place and no discipline ever seems to go with these programs. The only thing there seems to be a lot of is paternalism towards Aboriginal problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a sad mess and a tragedy in this country. A few Aboriginal people are doing very well, but a section of them are running around with chips on their shoulders and are bitter for what has gone on in the past. The great bulk of the Aboriginal people feel very neglected. They feel that they are missing out on everything that is being spent by the government and they are in a state of despair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is nothing more nor less than another cruel deception. Originally, the Aboriginal people were told that over 10 years something like $1,500 million would be spent out of the budget buying land for them. We now find that the bill has been constructed in such a way that only an extra $24 million a year will be spent on purchasing land, on upgrading the land they already have and on the management of that land; only a fraction of it will be spent purchasing land. There will be nothing like $1,500 million spent over a 10-year period for the benefit of the Aboriginal people. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the current account deficit is concerned, the figures that came out yesterday were not pleasing but they were one month's figures. It has been said many times in the past that there is not much point in simply using one month's figures. The trends over the last 12 months have not been too bad. There has been a very useful increase in exports, particularly of elaborately transformed manufactures. A substantial contributor to the worsening current account deficit is the importation of equipment for productive investment. That is not a development which is bad or inimical to the interests of the economy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In justifying the coalition's bid to block this savings measure, Senator Robert Hill said `the federal opposition will move to protect students from government plans to lower the HECS repayment threshold'. Let me just say categorically that, by this budget measure, we are not either lowering the threshold or increasing the amount.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clinic is in very real danger of closure. It should not surprise members in this House to learn that this is occurring because of a failure by the Northern Territory government, which has been in government for 20 years, to provide adequate funding for that service. It is not fulfilling its obligation to its Aboriginal constituents, and that should be a matter of concern to all members of this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened in this case was that the Bathurst Island community was asked to take over responsibility for the clinic from the Catholic church. The funding it received from the territory government to take over the clinic was completely inadequate, which is something that the territory government has actually acknowledged. By its own subsequent admission, the territory government has under-funded that clinic to the tune of $180,000 per year. It is not getting sufficient money to run the clinic for the needs of the 1,200 people who cannot get health and medical services anywhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, by its own admission, has failed to take account of the fact that when the church was in charge a lot of that work was done by volunteers, principally the nuns.

The people there have been sold a pup. They have been asked to be self-determining but have not been given enough money to do it. It will find no support from this government in this House.

My favourite call to the hotline was the person who rang and asked, `When it is December in the United States, what month is it in Australia?'

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SI4">Mr PUNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for her question and her interest in this matter. To put the question in its context, honourable members will be aware that in the Senate last week a report into sexual harassment in the armed forces was tabled. It is a very good report. It is constructive and it is a very sober assessment of where we are at in the ADF on this issue. I have already commenced discussions with the services with a view to a quick and decisive response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Having said that and to answer the honourable member, I note that some 87 per cent of positions in the Defence Force are open to women, following the government's decision in 1992 to open up more combat positions. This compares favourably with, for example, the period around 1988-89, when the percentage was around 41 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women currently comprise 13 per cent of our armed forces. I am very pleased to say&mdash;I am sure the honourable member will be pleased to hear this&mdash;that, on average, amongst new recruits that percentage is climbing to 25 per cent. I should say for the information of honourable members&mdash;I am sure that a number will be most interested in this&mdash;that the quality of women recruits is very high. Over the past eight years, women have won 12 of the 40 major prizes at the academy, including three times as dux. That is an excellent record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, despite this obvious very high level of quality amongst women joining the ADF, it is clear that they are not reaching senior ranks in the proportions in which they should. Sadly, less than three per cent of women make up positions at lieutenant colonel level or equivalent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Last Thursday, with this in mind, I announced four initiatives which are designed to ensure that women in the ADF have the maximum opportunity to compete with their male colleagues for career progression. Those four initiatives include, firstly, the establishment of a defence advisory forum on discrimination, which hopefully will act as a very pertinent exchange of information mechanism with the defence forces on appropriate strategies and approaches for generally handling discrimination issues that are adopted in the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there will be a study on cultural and institutional barriers to career progression for women in the defence forces. I call this the glass ceiling survey. I think we all know that those glass ceilings exist. It is another thing to identify them and do something about them, and that is what the government wants to do. Thirdly, we will be studying why more women are not making the Defence Force a longer term career option for themselves. That is, in the old traditional human resource study vernacular, we will be doing a separation study on women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, and I think most importantly, I have reached agreement with the defence chiefs that there will be a set of performance indicators installed to monitor the achievement of women in the Defence Force, particularly to measure their career progression against normal male service expectations. These performance indicators very importantly go to the heart of the matter because they will address the selection for promotion, training programs and various staff colleges. Those issues are fundamental to career progression for anyone in the armed forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, let me reiterate again what my predecessor, Senator Faulkner, said: the defence of this country is too important to be left to only a proportion of the population. All Australians must have the opportunity to join the defence forces, given the requirements on health and so forth, and as far as women in the ADF are concerned that is very much the government's policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not a whole heck of a lot is the answer to the last part of the question. I have seen Professor Quiggin's article and it has these three strands of logic in it as its basis: firstly, that an asset owned by the government provides that government with a stream of earnings into the future; secondly, the present value of the stream of earnings is the value of the asset to the government if it is retained in government ownership; and, thirdly, the government will not be able to get a better price for the asset than that figure for its value if retained in government ownership. If the three-step argument were valid and if Professor Quiggin's logic were to hold, it would never be responsible to sell anything.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look back over the history of this country in terms of public ownership&mdash;particularly at the state level&mdash;of various facilities and enterprises. Take the example of my home state under the Scaddan government which, in a period of about five years, brought under state ownership various tourist resorts, a state sawmill, a state dairy, state butcher shops in Perth and Fremantle, state fish shops in Fremantle and Midland junction, a state brick works, a state implement works, a state meatworks at Wyndham, state quarries and state abattoirs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that in the home state of the honourable member who just interjected there was a state tobacconist. Most of those other butcher shops and the like, in Queensland too, did produce, from time to time, a level of state ownership. The logic of Professor Quiggin's argument is that they all ought to be in government ownership today. What Professor Quiggin overlooks is that there is the possibility of a mutually beneficial transfer of ownership of an asset. His logic would apply not just to the government sector but also to the private sector. If every asset had the same present value to every possible owner, there would be no point in transferring any asset to anybody. Of course, that situation does not apply. Every asset has to be looked at on a case by case basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were quite valid reasons for some of those state assets to emerge in this country. These reasons went to the fact that, in some instances, no alternative supply source was available. It was necessary for competition. Indeed, I think one of the Liberal Premiers&mdash;at least his family, the Forrest family&mdash;had an absolute lock on all meat supplies in Western Australia. The setting up of butcher shops and state meatworks was to introduce an element of competition to what was then a private monopoly. Honourable members would find that there were a lot of reasons like that to proceed down the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point was that it has been the case over the last decade that, at the state level and from time to time at the Commonwealth level, assets have transferred in and out of the public sector, generally speaking, at that point in time when there is clearly no requirement on the government to continue to supply the service, product or whatever it happens to be. The circumstances of each case can change over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, as I said, Professor Quiggin's argument ignores the fact that a potential owner may value an asset more highly than the asset in the hands of another owner&mdash;in this case, specifically the government&mdash;because it may believe it will have efficiencies or be able to effect other economies which will enable it to earn a better profit stream, in which case the price it is prepared to pay will be greater than the value of that asset in continuation in government hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst Professor Quiggin's article was a noble attempt to persuade us in another direction, it is not an article which would stand up to any form of historical analysis.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The specific event of the last year, in so far as it impacted upon that set of statistics, was basically a very substantial collapse in the liner trades towards the middle of the year. What was already a bad competitive position for ANL in a number of those trades became a very difficult position indeed. I think specifically they were the liner trades in Europe and in north-east Asia. They produced a very substantial change in ANL's accounts and that has produced a situation in which, along with other things, the comments that the Minister for Transport made, though dramatic, are conceivably justified and borne out by the due diligence process that was put in place and provided more detailed financial assessments on ANL to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hence, a management team was put in place to see what operations of ANL needed to be discarded in order that those operations which are potentially profitable may continue, whether owned by ANL, operated by the current company or by somebody else. I think a reasonable reading of the publicly released part of the due diligence process suggests that there were financial problems building up in ANL. One cannot see the events of the last six months to a year as entirely decisive in that regard; there were other problems. But I would say this: I do reject completely the notion that has been put about from time to time that somehow or other the due diligence process dumped itself upon the competitive arrangements in the trade to Europe and the northern Pacific. That proposition is too far fetched to even begin to contemplate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. It is a particularly important question, given that the government's target of 75 per cent of students finishing school by 1996 has already been met. That target was met a couple of years ago, and the rate is now climbing towards 80 per cent. Although the government has provided 3,400 new places for universities this year, it needs to be remembered that 60 per cent of year 12 school leavers do not go on to university. For this reason, the government has put in place a number of important measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three measures are of particular importance at this time. Firstly, the government has committed additional growth funding of $1.1 billion to ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, for training from 1993 to 1996. In this year alone that growth money will provide for an additional 265,000 places in TAFE. Secondly, around 10 days ago the Prime Minister launched the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation, which will provide $38 million over four years to help link the world of school to the world of work, industry based pathways in our schools and a more relevant curriculum stream for those 60 per cent of students. Thirdly, the government is piloting the AVC, the Australian vocational certificate. There are now over 150 institution and industry based pilots in place to test this new system for combining work and training and to extend training to all those young people who do not have the opportunity to participate. The results are already showing. The numbers of young people commencing an apprenticeship or a traineeship are up from 50,000 two years ago to 67,000 this year&mdash;an increase of 35 per cent. Initiatives contained in the white paper for an additional 50,000 entry level training places will see those figures climb significantly in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of contrast, it is appropriate to look at the record of the opposition. I remind the House that, when the government took office in 1983, retention rates in our schools were 36 per cent; around one student in three completed year 12; and we were at the bottom end of the OECD countries. It is instructive at this time to think of what became of those early school leavers of the early 1980s. Eleven years on, those school leavers are now in their late 20s. It is instructive to look at the pattern of long-term unemployment and to discover that those people in their late 20s comprise the single largest group of long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, those early school leavers of the early 1980s&mdash;those youngsters abandoned by the coalition when in office; the forgotten youth of the early 1980s&mdash;have become the long-term unemployed of the early 1990s. But for the policies of this government they would be facing the prospect of permanent dislocation from society.</PARA>

Private patients claim just as much benefit from the public system as they put in. If you look at the figures, the Medicare levy paid by privately insured patients raises about $1.4 billion. That is pretty much the same amount of money they get back in the form of subsidies and rebates for medical and hospital expenses. So we need to be very clear about that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment we have the unholy prospect of state governments all around the country, with the exception of Queensland, withdrawing very significant amounts of funding from our public hospital system. I made comment on this before, but this is one of the major issues we face at the moment. I mentioned earlier today a problem with the Northern Territory health system, particularly in relation to Aboriginal people. I think the House needs to know that the Northern Territory has cut its own contributions to health care to the tune of $15 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is at the same time as the Commonwealth government, under the Medicare agreement, increased funding by a net 62 per cent, a net $15 million. So what we are seeing in the Northern Territory, New South Wales, Victoria and now in South Australia sadly is that state governments are pulling funding out of the public hospital system at the same rate as we are putting it in from the Commonwealth system. That is a significant problem which has to be addressed and I hope that the opposition will to start to come to terms with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other points I would like to make about Mr Wood's article. One of them is that he suggests we abolish community rating. I think all honourable members of this House will know what that suggestion means. It means that older Australians would pay premiums some four times greater than everybody else. I am pleased to hear the shadow spokesperson indicating that the coalition would not move to abolish community rating either, because I think that is very important. I certainly want to say to Alan Wood that that proposal is not embraced by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other little bone I would like to pick with Mr Alan Wood. One of the things that we have seen in that article and heard from some members of this House is that it is inappropriate for a Western Australian member to have her senior public servants travel to that state. I have to say that the people of Western Australia do not think so, the people of Queensland certainly do not think so and the people of Tasmania certainly do not think so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government and its Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) have got themselves in a terrible mess over industrial relations reforms. Their knickers are really in a knot. They have been trying to implement coalition policy for the reform of the industrial relations system in order to implement enterprise bargaining&mdash;but they know not how. Even if they had any idea how to do it, the ACTU is still pulling the strings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central issue today relates to the national wage case before the Industrial Relations Commission.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, in the national wage case hearings before the AIRC, the government proposed to eliminate compulsory arbitration. This is a coalition proposal that was well and truly taken to the last election. The government forgot to tell itself so in the legislation which the minister brought down and which finally became law on 30 March this year. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 24 August confirmed the government's new approach. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Federal Government yesterday told a Full Bench hearing that the IRC should not be able to arbitrate generally on any claims above a set of conditions contained in the award safety net.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She also raised the prospect that the commission would have difficulty in defining the level and precise nature of the core provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>Since the minister has not been willing to appear, to debate this issue, and is apparently so comfortable with his position, perhaps we will tell a bedtime story. Once upon a time there was a Prime Minister, known by sections of the press as the master blaster, who thought to himself, `How will I get myself re-elected and reform the economy so that the Australian people will trust me once again?' One night, he said to himself, `Ha, ha! I will steal the coalition's policy.' It is a typical master blaster operating technique&mdash;to steal the coalition's colours and take its clothes, which he well and truly did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 April 1993, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gave a speech to the Institute of Company Directors in Melbourne. In that speech, he proposed major changes to the industrial relations system in Australia. He really got employers quite excited. The employers thought, `At last, we actually have a Labor government that understands the issues and will be prepared to take the necessary actions to free up the system. Let us negotiate with our employees at the workplace and get on with reforming the economy which will make our businesses grow, make us more competitive, allow us to produce more in Australia and increase our exports.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that speech, the Prime Minister made a few important statements. In describing a new model of industrial relations that he was working towards, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitration tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a model under which compulsorily arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety net.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have laws which give the AIRC a role and powers that are not well suited to the present system we are trying to create.</PARA>
<PARA>That, my colleagues, is the essence of the problem. The problem is that we now have a reformed Industrial Relations Act which does not have the powers that the government is currently arguing in the national wage case before the Industrial Relations Commission.

It was because what he had come up with was unacceptable to the union movement. In fact, what he finally came up with was as a result of overt union pressure. Jennie George put it well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there was ever a demonstration of why the Liberal Party has been in opposition for 11 years in this House, and if there was ever a demonstration of why it will remain in opposition for another 11 years in this House, it was the speech from the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). It contained no policy content at all. He is not game to come into this House and tell us what the opposition's policy alternative is. What we get is the approach that we get from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). Those opposite will not talk about the republic; they will not talk about privacy; they will not talk about industrial relations; they will not talk about land rights. They know that the policies they hold dear to their hearts are so repulsive to the Australian people that they are not game to enunciate those policies in the House today. That is the problem with the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for La Trobe spoke about passion. There is passion in the labour movement about the wage system. Why should there not be? That is how people live. People actually have to rely on their wages to live, but you would not know it when you listen to those opposite talking about industrial relations. We know that they secretly desire a system which abolishes minimum wages, abolishes the industrial umpire and abolishes all of those things which produce the safety net in this country upon which so many workers in our community are dependent for their standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have just heard a 20-minute speech from the honourable member for La Trobe&mdash;and not one word about the opposition's policy alternative. We get cliches about a more flexible labour market, but no content. Does that not sum up the Liberal and National parties in this House? Does that not demonstrate why they are going to be in opposition for a long time to come?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech of the honourable member for La Trobe reminded me of an article I read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 3 August. It followed a party one of the prominent republican Liberals in New South Wales attended with the Premier of New South Wales. The article was headed `Why the federal Libs weren't at Marise's party'. A prominent senior Liberal cabinet minister in New South Wales said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the features of being out of government is that you become more and more out of touch with people and more and more in touch with yourself . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The language used by the honourable member for La Trobe, which I will not repeat here, was so much out of touch with our community and so offensive that I cannot understand why someone on the other side of the House did not get up and ask him to withdraw. He has so little understanding of what is going on in the wage system for workers who operate at 100 per cent capacity that he would have no understanding of what would happen in our community for workers who operate at 50 per cent or 40 per cent of their capacities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The fact of the matter is that there is no inconsistency among the Industrial Relations Reform Act, the government's submission to the Industrial Relations Commission and what the government is doing in terms of its policies. The government position which was outlined in the Industrial Relations Reform Bill is for the maintenance of a strong award system. What we did in the bill that went through this House at the end of last year was put in some extra guarantees to strengthen the award system. We guaranteed a fair minimum wage, equal pay, 12 months unpaid parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal. Every one of those fundamental rights has been opposed by those sitting opposite us. But were any of them mentioned in the debate today? Of course they were not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> With the bill that was introduced into this House last year, we simultaneously brought in a series of provisions which would enable this country to establish, on top of the award system, a system of enterprise bargaining. The bill which we brought in was designed to accelerate the spread of enterprise agreements within the federal system of industrial relations. And spread they have since that bill was introduced. They have spread not only in the federal system but in the state system in Queensland, where they have been replicated in state legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This twin approach&mdash;that is, the platform of a strong award system, strengthened by those minimum ILO conventions, plus enterprise bargaining&mdash;goes to the heart of our approach, which is bitterly opposed by the opposition. It does not want flexibility upwards, building on a strengthened award system; it wants flexibility downwards. It does not want workers to get together and negotiate collectively; it wants workers to negotiate individually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If you go through the submission that we have made to the Industrial Relations Commission, you will get to the heart of why this government is in touch with the work force, why it has passionate discussions with the union movement and why those opposite are so absolutely irrelevant to the needs of the Australian people. At the heart of that submission is the accord agreement with the trade unions. We are seeking a widening of access to the $8 safety net wage adjustment to those workers who have not yet received it. That is a very important part of our submission. There are workers who have not been able to access the $8 increase. The government is also supporting a further $8 increase at the conclusion of the current case and a further $8 increase from 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For some workers, that means three increases of $8 over three years. Have you ever heard the Liberal and National parties come into this House and support a wage increase? Has anyone ever heard them come in and talk about a wage increase in our community, particularly when we consider that real unit labour costs in this country have dropped around 10 per cent&mdash;that is, real wages have fallen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country has become 30 per cent more competitive in the last decade and we owe an enormous amount to the sacrifice of the work force over recent years. But does anyone opposite ever thank the workers of Australia, who have accepted lower real wages over the last decade in the interests of making us more internationally competitive, generating more long-term sustainable jobs in the private sector and ensuring that their children will have not only sustainable, well-paid jobs but jobs with careers? Does anyone ever acknowledge what the work force has done over the last decade to make sure that we export more, that we grow by five per cent per year and that we have had four per cent employment growth? This is being done not solely, but certainly largely, on the back of wage restraint from the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do we not get support from the other side when we go into the Industrial Relations Commission and ask for three $8 increases for the work force that has made those sacrifices? We do not get support from the other side because its only solution to economic problems in the country is to slash wages. It does not regard labour as an element of the work force; it regards it as something akin to a nut and bolt or just another factor of introduction which has to be pumped into the computer to produce these mythical outcomes. But we understand that we need a very strong safety net in this country. Those three $8 increases are a very important part of the government strategy. They are completely absent from any approach taken by those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of our submission to the Industrial Relations Commission relates to looking at what constitutes the foundation provisions of awards. Our approach is entirely consistent with the approach taken in the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993, and the government has asked the Industrial Relations Commission to identify what constitutes the fundamental or foundation elements of the award safety net. When we are talking about the foundation or fundamental elements of the award safety net, we are talking about things like minimum wage rates, loadings, key leave entitlements, hours of work, termination and redundancy provisions, superannuation, public holidays and so on. It is entirely appropriate that these matters should be looked at if we are going to build on top of our award safety net a system of enterprise bargaining which works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the approach that we favour, with a strengthened award safety net and, on top of that, flexibility built in through enterprise bargaining, can be contrasted with the approach once again of those opposite, when they are game to admit it. They do not favour all of those entitlements being the core elements of awards; they have a very weak commitment to one or two minimum sets of conditions and nothing more. That is consistent with their view that all of the problems in the economy stem from the wage system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third element of our submission is that the section 150A review process will provide the opportunity to modernise our award system and to provide a less prescriptive award system. This simply relates to rewriting and simplifying current awards, particularly in their use of language. It also involves the removal of a lot of unnecessary detail from awards and the more extensive use of enterprise flexibility clauses and facilitative provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everything the government has said in its submission to the IRC is consistent not only with the bill that passed through this House last year but also with the strategies outlined in the employment white paper brought down earlier this year. Working Nation is essentially saying that in this country we want to have a future built on growth, on being internationally competitive, on exporting more and, particularly, on a fair share of jobs in the community. The most fundamental factor affecting the redistribution of wealth in a community is the distribution of jobs and, if we do not do something about long-term unemployment, there will be an unfair distribution of jobs and an unfair distribution of wealth. But we are not only concerned about more jobs; we are concerned about better paid jobs and jobs with careers. The beauty of Working Nation is that it encompasses the policy of growth plus: that is, long-term sustainable jobs come in the private sector and to get those jobs we have to be competitive&mdash;we have to export more and import less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a strategy which is absolutely opposed to what those opposite believe in their heart of hearts. In their  heart of hearts, they are what I call economic fundamentalists&mdash;they simply believe that to solve unemployment you must slash wages, cut the deficit and so on. That view was completely buried in our white paper. Our moral, social and economic stance says that people are entitled to a fair standard of living through the economy. The most fundamental form of welfare is a job, but not a job on any conditions, not a job on any wages, not a job without training. We are committed to jobs which have careers, training and a fair level of remuneration&mdash;all of those things which are absent from the approach of those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have through the accord and through the white paper set ourselves the task of creating more jobs and better paid jobs&mdash;not low paid jobs. We are not going down the American road that those opposite advocate. What you would love to see in this country is the army of the working poor. You would love to see wages go down so low that everyone would be working for starvation wages. You know from the work of people like Professor Bob Gregory that, if you were to make any significant impact outside of growth on unemployment through pure wage cuts, you would have to slash wages in this community by 30 per cent because that is the only economic strategy you know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has got a much more sophisticated approach to growth, a much more sophisticated approach to the creation of jobs, and a much more sophisticated approach to the living standards of working people in this country. Through the accord, we have been committed not only to the strength of the award system, with enterprise bargaining and flexibility upwards, but also to giving the work force tax relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we brought in the tax cuts last year, they were attacked constantly and incessantly by those opposite. When we dropped the marginal rate of tax from 39c in the dollar to 33c in the dollar for someone earning $25,000 a year, those opposite ran around the country saying that was fiscally irresponsible. Once again, those opposite want to take the money out of people's pockets through the tax system and the wage system. When are they going to put any money back into the pay packets of workers in this country? When will they get a policy which will do that&mdash;not cut public expenditure and wages?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This parliament has not been well served by the contribution made today by the honourable member for La Trobe. He really demonstrated what is wrong with the current Liberal Party. On radio yesterday morning, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), said that the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) most certainly was not the voice of moderation in the Liberal Party. If he is not the voice of moderation, and the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for La Trobe are to the right of him, God help Australia. God help Australia if they are all to the right of the honourable member for Wentworth. Does that mean we still have the 15 per cent GST hidden away in the cupboard? Does that mean we still have the $3 an hour youth wage hidden away in the cupboard? Does that mean we still have the $10 billion public sector cutbacks hidden away in the cupboard?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Labor often boasts about its special expertise in industrial relations, but there are probably few areas in which its policy has been more confused and more inconsistent than this area. There have been few areas in which Labor has been a greater proven failure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) told us during his presentation that there was no difference in those two positions, that there is consistency between those two opposite positions. He tried desperately hard to justify that position. The problem for the honourable member for Lilley does not come from us; it comes from Justice O'Connor, the lady the government appointed not very long ago to preside in the Industrial Relations Commission. She is the one who pointed so obviously to the dichotomy between the government's position and the current act when she questioned whether the Industrial Relations Reform Act allowed the IRC to be prevented from this arbitration. She also raised the prospect that the commission would have difficulty in defining the level and precise nature of the core provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The president of the commission is herself pointing to the obvious disparity between what the government is saying before the commission and what it passed through the parliament&mdash;the Industrial Relations Reform Act. There is indeed a grave inconsistency, one which the honourable member for Lilley has totally failed to dispel. He tried to throw a smokescreen on the coalition's policy in the area of wage setting. It has never been the coalition's policy to abolish the commission. It has never been our policy to abolish minimum wages. The coalition's policy is based on choice&mdash;choice between awards and fair agreements, choice between union membership and non-union membership. Our policy supports increased pay based on increased productivity. What can be fairer and more consistent than that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations should be about providing appropriate and fair mechanisms so that employers and employees can agree upon the sorts of work arrangements which should apply in their work enterprise. That is not what Labor is interested in. It wants to bias the system so that it overwhelmingly favours its trade union mates to the disadvantage not only of employers but also of workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has a close relationship with the union movement&mdash;it could be called a subservient relationship. The unions make the rules; the government obeys the orders. If people have any doubts about that, I refer them to the words of Jennie George&mdash;a prominent union official&mdash;which will certainly echo through history. She lectured the employers after the election and said, `We won the election! Not the Labor Party, not the government; the trade union movement won the election and now it expects to collect its rewards.' It has no concern for the economy, national interest or the ALP's election policy; it is there to collect its rewards after winning the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industrial relations legislation was part of the trade union movement's payback. The press release announcing all of these changes did not come from the cabinet room or from the minister's office, it came from ACTU House, where all the news on these sorts of matters seems to emanate. ACTU House&mdash;the Kremlin; the Vatican of union policies&mdash;was where it was decided what would go into the Industrial Relations Act. This is the payback for the assistance of the unions in the election campaign. They were not really entitled to a payback because most of the money that they donated to the Labor Party election campaign came from the taxpayers in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government during the previous term had provided $25 million-plus in donations to Labor unions. At a Senate estimates committee, a group of 16 unions was identified which received $2.5 million in grants, and those same 16 unions donated $2.2 million to the ALP. In addition, all the union staff, office facilities and paid candidates were turned out to assist the ALP during the election campaign. There was no obligation for any payout. The ALP was being given money provided by the taxpayers. The ALP has set up a gigantic siphoning system to transfer money from the taxpayers to Labor Party funds through the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of the lack of justification, the payback occurred&mdash;the industrial relations legislation. The country was inflicted with the new secondary boycott provisions which place unions above laws which apply to all other Australians. Unions are able to ride roughshod over the rights of other Australians. The legislation also contains unfair dismissal rules&mdash;rules which terrified business and jammed the courts in only two months. The government had to back off and change the rules. This led to more confusion and more inconsistency. The legislation contains strike provisions, which were described recently by one leading employer as industrial blackmail. Indeed, that is what they are. The unions received this payback because of what they contributed towards the election win. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone seemed to forget to tell the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) what was in this payback deal. Just after the election, on 21 April in Melbourne, he turned up to tell employers that he would accept some deregulation of the labour market. He said that there would be some retention of awards with core conditions but that most arrangements of working conditions would be negotiated at an enterprise level. During the election campaign, when the coalition proposed this sort of arrangement, the ALP suggested that it would basically bring an end to civilisation; that it would be the end of the world; that it could not possibly happen. When elected to government, somebody forgot to tell the Prime Minister about the deals and he promised the employers there would be some degree of deregulation in the industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That promise from the Prime Minister is not unreasonable. After all, depending on whether Mr Hawke's $50 book version is believed or the Prime Minister's backroom briefings to journalists, the Prime Minister was the one who believed in the deregulation of the banking system, exchange rates and the marketplace. It is all right for everybody else, so perhaps it is all right for the union movement and industrial relations to be deregulated. If small business has to fend for itself, why can other people in the workplace not fend for themselves? The Prime Minister promised some real reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not unusual for the Prime Minister to be confused. In 1991 he described the Industrial Relations Commission as `dredging around trying to find a place for itself in the new economic society of Australia and not knowing what is happening'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor is really there to protect the unions. There are still a few people left who believe that academic union officials and bureaucrats who sit around in Melbourne are better able to decide working conditions than workers and their employers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although honourable members would not know it from the contributions made by the two members opposite, the topic of the matter of public importance today is the alleged unworkable dichotomy between the government's Industrial Relations Reform Act 1994 and the position the government is taking on the award system before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on the current national wage case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the alleged unworkable dichotomy between the principles of the Industrial Relations Reform Act and the government's submission to the national wage case? The Industrial Relations Act was enacted in December last year to take effect from 30 March this year. On 16 December the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) issued a media release welcoming the passage of that legislation through the parliament. One of the key points he referred to was employers and employees being able to negotiate enterprise arrangements and having them approved by the AIRC. He talked about minimum standards based on ILO conventions, fair minimum wages, equal pay, 12 months unpaid parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal. He also said that the changes would promote enterprise bargaining and at the same time maintain the award system as the safety net of industrial relations in Australia. The central philosophy behind the government's approach is promoting enterprise bargaining but maintaining the award system as the safety net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That approach is also reflected by the Working Nation statement. If members opposite bothered to look at the Working Nation statement, they would see that pages 31 and 32 detail the `safety net'. Again, this reflects the consistency of our beliefs and philosophy in this area. Page 31 of Working Nation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that enterprise bargaining should be underpinned by minimum standards of wages and conditions provided through the award system. This should provide protection of core provisions such as minimum wage rates and loadings, leave, hours of work, termination . . . public holidays&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The list goes on. Page 31 of the Working Nation statement also refers to the role of the award system as an effective safety net. The award safety net allows for flexibility in enterprise agreements while protecting workers through the `no disadvantage' test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the submission of 18 August by the Commonwealth to the Industrial Relations Commission on the current national wage case. There are three issues before the commission at this point in time: first, the safety net of award wages and conditions; second, the safety net wage adjustment claims of $8; and, third, section 150A award review provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The philosophy of the government's submission is entirely consistent with the Industrial Relations Reform Act passed by this parliament in December last year and reaffirmed by the Working Nation statement. The government's submission refers to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">consolidating the shift to an effective system of decentralised wage fixing . . . while preserving the integrity of their safety net role . . . Awards should be focused on their safety net role.</PARA>
<PARA>Page 2 of the submission states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The safety net needs to be secure and relevant for it to play the role intended for it by the new legislative framework and to engender the workforce confidence and commitment necessary for effective enterprise bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA>And on it goes. There is reference to the role of the minimum rates award system, providing a relevant safety net to underpin enterprise bargaining, which was reinforced in the recent reforms. The whole philosophy of the government's submission is the award system and the safety nets. In the conclusion to the submission, on page 111, we see reference to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposals outlined here are designed to gear the award system to its changing role . . . ensuring that awards provide a meaningful and effective safety net to underpin direct bargaining . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is an entirely consistent philosophy behind the government's approach in this matter through the act itself, Working Nation and the submission to the national wage case. What have we been about in the industrial relations area in the last 10 or 11 years? We have seen massive increases in productivity. We have seen a massive reduction in industrial disputation. We have seen great increases in international competitiveness because of the changes we have made&mdash;workplace flexibility, and the introduction of enterprise bargaining. Real unit labour costs have fallen by about 10 per cent over that period but, at the same time, we have ensured that safety nets are in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the opposition stand for in this area? You remain handcuffed to Fightback.

You wanted to effect wage cuts. What has been your position on just about every national wage case since about 1983? You have opposed wage increases before national wage case hearings. We know what you stand for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where, therefore, do we find the unworkable dichotomy? There is only one unworkable dichotomy around here and that is the opposition. Any standard dictionary will tell you that an unworkable dichotomy is a division into two parts. It nearly applies to you because you are in intellectual and physical splinters. There are more than two parts to your show. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have recent times and recent events shown about you and your dichotomies? Look at the Leader of the Opposition's Central Desert fiasco, Tasmania and the recent dismissal of the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), from the shadow ministry. I think they show three things about the opposition: firstly, that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) cannot lead and he cannot be believed; secondly, that the opposition's attempts to pretend that it is a policy-free zone is its way of hiding the fact that it remains handcuffed to Fightback and that its economic and social policy is determined by the hard right; and, thirdly, that the opposition does not have the capacity to organise its own affairs and, therefore, is in no state to present itself for government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see where we might find some evidence for those suggestions&mdash;first, the assertion that the Leader of the Opposition cannot lead. On Sunday we saw the member for Wentworth interviewed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program by Laurie Oakes. Mr Oakes said to him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the day that Alexander Downer told you he was going to challenge you for the leadership, did you say to him `Alex, you and I both know you don't have what it takes to be leader'?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Doctor Hewson: Look I'm not going to go into the detail of those personal conversations. They have no bearing on what's happened.</PARA>
<PARA>What is that code for? That is exactly what he said. That is exactly what he believes in his heart of hearts, and the Leader of the Opposition knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said the Leader of the Opposition cannot lead. The Leader of the Opposition could not lead the Liberal Party out of a wet paper bag, let alone the Central Desert or Tasmania. More importantly, he cannot be believed. What do we know about the Leader of the Opposition's credibility? In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), Margo Kingston had this to say in reference to the Leader of the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike Downer, he has not been an obvious destabiliser of Hewson's leadership, having chosen not to be so publicly effusive and privately contemptuous.</PARA>
<PARA>It gets the Leader of the Opposition right on the nail. We know he is basically misleading&mdash;saying one thing in public, one thing in private, one thing in one state and one thing in another. That was confirmed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian Magazine </EMPHASIS>of 23-24 July, when Mike Steketee wrote an article titled `The day of the dream team'&mdash;you now know that your worst nightmares are just about to begin. The article referred to how the Leader of the Opposition conducted himself when there was a battle for the Liberal leadership between the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for Wentworth after the last election. It is stated on page 16:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Downer told the Hewson camp that he had voted for the winner, doing his chances of becoming shadow treasurer no harm at all. That surprised the Howard forces, because Downer told them that he had voted for Howard. When tackled on the issue by one of the Howard supporters, he said that, actually, it had been Howard but he didn't feel he could go and tell Hewson now.</PARA>
<PARA>He has no capacity to lead, and no capacity to be believed. The second point I make about the recent events is the attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to present the Liberal Party as a policy free zone. This is simply a guise to hide from the public that they remain handcuffed to Fightback, to hide from the public that their economic and social policies are determined by the hard, right wing ideologues in the Liberal Party. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on Wednesday, 24 August there was a story headed `The day business took Downer aside for a quiet chat', which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senior business leaders have warned the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Downer, that the Coalition must provide detailed policies if it expects to win the support of business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Downer told the group that the Liberals would not be repeating their mistake of releasing detailed policies ahead of the next election.</PARA>
<PARA>Why is that? Because we know, and I go back to the article by Margo Kingston referring to the member for Higgins, that there are `deep fears about right wing views and hard right party connections' and `deeply conservative social beliefs'. We on this side of the chamber know their policy remains that of being committed to Fightback. The honourable member for Wentworth on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, when asked about Fightback, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean, the fact is the Liberal Party has never been more unified than it was in support of that policy document, and&mdash;you know it's easy to have a selective memory after the event, but we went to that last election with everyone in there fighting for what we believed in, a policy document that was entirely consistent with our philosophical basis in politics.</PARA>
<PARA>Your philosophical basis in politics on this issue is to slash the wages of working people, to have no safety nets, to have no protection from awards, to refuse to give workers who are not engaged in enterprise bargaining access to safety net adjustments. You stand condemned for that. Your entire solution to every economic problem is to slash the wages of ordinary working people. We on this side will not allow that to occur. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was interrupted for question time and the matter of public importance debate, I was saying how this land acquisition fund for the supposed benefit of the Aboriginal people has been, in many ways, a cruel deception. It was set up following the Mabo legislation for rural Aborigines, particularly in eastern Australia, who will not benefit from native title. Also, I believe a social justice package will be brought down next year for mainland Aborigines who live in urban areas, who will benefit neither from native title nor from the land acquisition fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we first heard of the land acquisition fund when it was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), we were led to believe that something upwards of $1,500 million would be set aside. Whether or not one agreed with the fund, one would have to say that was a very significant amount of money. But it appears that this is not to be the case. Some $200 million is to be set aside, through a mechanism which I will explain in a minute, in the first year and then $121 million each year thereafter for the next nine years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This money is not to be given to anyone; it is only to be transferred from the consolidated revenue fund to the general trust account or land fund. The money in the trust fund will not belong to the Aboriginal people at all. It will form part of the Commonwealth public account and will remain the property of the Commonwealth under the control of the Minister for Finance, who technically could shut it off at any time, if he or she so wished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a complicated mechanism&mdash;I must admit even I have difficulty understanding it&mdash;any return on the land fund investments must go back to consolidated revenue and then a set grant will be given from consolidated revenue to the land fund by way of a standing appropriation, I am told. The land fund will then give an indexed amount each year to the Indigenous Land Corporation, which is another body to be set up under this bill we are discussing today. I believe $45 million, indexed, will be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC already has a land acquisition and management program under way to purchase land now and to manage it. It already receives $21 million a year. Under this legislation, that will be taken over and the $21 million that ATSIC has previously received will come from the land fund. In effect, this means that the money going to the Indigenous Land Corporation will amount to only $24 million, if one can follow all that. In other words, over a 10-year period Aborigines will not be given $1,500 million to purchase land but will be given a quite miserly sum, in comparison. Some $24 million of new money will be given to the Indigenous Land Corporation each year. That will be for the first few years. Then from 1998 onwards the ATSIC fund will cease, its $21 million will be transferred to the Indigenous Land Corporation and it will manage $45 million a year, indexed, thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An Indigenous Land Corporation board is to be set up. That will have a chairperson who, under the legislation, must be an Aboriginal person. There will be a deputy chairman, the ATSIC chairperson and four ordinary members. Apart from the overall ILC chairperson, four other members of the seven member committee have to be of Aboriginal descent. The purpose of the board will be to purchase land, manage land, draw up a regional and national land strategy&mdash;whatever that means&mdash;and upgrade land which is already owned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this money is going to be spent, I certainly agree that a portion of it should be put towards upgrading land already owned, because many Aboriginal properties that are run now are undercapitalised, resources or potential resources are under-utilised and the properties, in many cases, are run down. I am also pleased to see that money can be used towards hiring agricultural and other expertise to help run those properties in a professional manner. I hope this works out better than it has in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many things to be considered and time will allow me to mention only one or two. I notice that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS>, put out by the Parliamentary Research Service, raises certain things that are not properly covered. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Selling or mortgaging land acquired through the ILC</EMPHASIS>: Where land has been acquired by an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporation directly from the ILC, or through a grant of money from the ILC, then the land cannot be sold or charged (e.g. mortgaged) without the consent of the ILC. If the land is sold or charged without ILC consent, the sale or charge is of no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means that if an innocent third party bought the land, the sale would be of no effect and they would have no legal right to the land. The Bill does not provide any protection for innocent third parties in this position. It does not appear that the ILC would retain an interest in the land which would allow it to place a caveat on the title alerting potential buyers of the problem, nor does the Bill create a public register which would allow people to see if the land they wish to buy is subject to this disability. As an `Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporation' may not be immediately identifiable as such (because a company only needs to be controlled by Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders to qualify), the practical consequence of this provision would be that any person intending to buy land from a company anywhere in Australia would have to check with the ILC to ensure that the land was not subject to the disabilities in clause 191S.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is something in this bill that needs careful consideration by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other concern I do have is that all of the land that will be purchased by this fund will be placed in collective ownership. While I do think this is appropriate in some circumstances, for all of the land to be so deemed leads to certain problems. Collective ownership of land has never worked properly anywhere around the world. I would have liked to have seen provision for Aborigines to own some of this land individually. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has made one suggestion that there should be a soldier settler type scheme set up whereby individual Aborigines could own the land themselves. I see merit in this suggestion, because if it were implemented it would give proper incentives for Aborigines to work and benefit from the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I travel around my electorate, which takes up 40 per cent of New South Wales, and around the rest of New South Wales and Australia. I do not actually know of any farming or pastoral properties that Aborigines own except collectively. I believe that is a very sad indictment of both sides of this chamber. If we get on a plane and fly from one city to another, we cover a lot of property and can see it as we look out the window. Every one of those properties which is owned individually is owned by non-Aboriginal people. To think that originally Aboriginals owned this land and do not individually own any of it now is something this parliament should be looking at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to see a scheme implemented where Aboriginals could own land individually and try to make a go of it themselves. I realise it is very hard to make a go of farming land these days&mdash;everybody is struggling in that regard. It would be nice to think that there could be some scheme implemented where Aborigines could own the properties themselves, could buy and sell the land themselves, could keep the profit they make out of the land and could work them in this manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other things could be said about this bill, but there are many speakers on the list. I will not say any more except to reiterate that this is a very small amount of money that is being given to the Aboriginals. The government is making a big thing out of the $24 million a year that the Aboriginal people will be receiving. If it was genuine about it, the government could have&mdash;almost by regulation&mdash;added the money to the amount that ATSIC is already receiving for land purchase and management rather than trumpeting out there that Aboriginal people will be getting almost $1 1/2 billion dollars when, in fact, they will be receiving only an extra $24 million a year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) say that this is a small amount of money. I will make sure that I quote high and low across the country that the coalition believes this is a small amount of money we are giving to the Aboriginal community. I would tend to agree. It is probably one of the best real estate deals of this century. For only a small amount of money, we have taken away the long-term historical rights of a whole people who once had tenure of the whole of this land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to hear that the honourable member thinks it is such a small amount. Therefore, the opposition will probably not be too heavy in trying to stop this fund from going ahead. However, it goes on. The honourable member also showed a complete and total lack of understanding of people he purports to represent in his electorate. Having come from the central west of New South Wales, I know the area the honourable member for Parkes talks about. I know the type of people the honourable member represents. Their first statement is usually, `I'm not a racist, but . . . ' They say, `Some of my best friends are Aboriginals'; `I've known an Aboriginal.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the honourable member was actually saying and pull apart some of the things he said. He maintained that it was a blight on the government that Aboriginals who did own pastoral stations did so collectively. He went on to say that it was a blight on both sides of this House that Aboriginal people did not own land on an individual basis. The honourable member for Parkes falls into one of the most common pitfalls for anyone who tries to adjudge other people. He looks from his own perspective. Unfortunately, he is not able to render himself aloof from his own prejudices and his own way of life. In other words, when he judges, talks, thinks or makes any comment about Aboriginal society, he does so from his own peculiar white perspective. I say `peculiar' because he is, after all, a member of the National Party. </PARA>

As a member of the native title committee which recently went over to Western Australia, I would suggest to them that what they should do is go across and listen to their Aboriginal folk. Their Aboriginal folk do have opinions. The days when they needed white folk to articulate their views are well and truly over. What they are now after is a bit of justice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not. I own it as part of a family. Collective ownership, the concept of a larger family or community, is not something that one should feel disgraced about. In fact, for the honourable member to make statements that Aboriginal people have to live our style of life&mdash;that is, that they have to isolate themselves&mdash;I feel would be offensive to many people in the Aboriginal community. My family was an extended family in that grandparents lived with us. I note that with the concept of the nuclear family that is not really the go these days. What you are supposed to do is drop your grannies on the side of the road, stick them in a nursing home or off-load them in some way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal community that I know may be a different Aboriginal community from the one the honourable member knows. Maybe he does not get to know the people in the Aboriginal community because they will not talk to him as they know his views. The people in the Aboriginal community who talk to me tell me about themselves and allow me to enter their homes and lives. They are a very caring community. They are a community that has a stronger sense of interrelationships than many people in the white community. On that basis, I find it quite acceptable that people in the Aboriginal community should be able to collectively own land and hold it in perpetuity for their community, their kids or their grand kids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things about capitalism is that people are allowed to go broke. We have noticed in monarchies, where an hereditary process is involved, that someone who is a bit scatty or loose in the brains department can make a mess or a meal of a whole family fortune. We have seen this happen again and again. Land held in perpetuity cannot be alienated like that. For instance, are we trying to say that the people who traded Melbourne for beads, trinkets and axes did a good real estate deal and were not in any way used or their naivety abused? I think one could say that they were sold a little short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an old saying in the real estate game, `Never give a mug an even break.' I think this has happened to many indigenous people, not only the Aboriginal community of Australia but also aboriginal indigenous people around the world. The same thing happened in America. Blankets and trifles were given in exchange. There is a glaring example in New Zealand, where a treaty was struck and provisions put in the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What most of the indigenous people did not fully comprehend was that the deal involved their complete alienation from their land. Further, they really did not fully comprehend that the deal was not going to be reversed. In the case of the Treaty of Waitangi, the indigenous people did not realise that the whites were not going to uphold their part of the bargain. That is one of the things that indigenous people&mdash;and the Australian Aborigines are no different&mdash;have found. White Australians have made deals with the Aborigines and invariably broken them&mdash;again and again. There are countless situations in New South Wales where reserves were put aside, people were told that that was their reserve and that they and their families could live their lives out there. But again and again they have been moved on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">White Australia does not have a good record in terms of honesty and integrity. The land fund acknowledges that we cannot go back; that we must go forward. This generation of Australians is saying, `Without taking on any blame or pointing the finger at any one individual in history or in the present, we are going to do the best we can to try to get a just resolution to what has been a problem for 200 years.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the problem? Quite simply, we stole their land. We only have to look at the basis of terra nullius. My understanding is that George III indicated that we could not claim the land if it was held by indigenous people. The way around that situation was to declare this land an empty land and deny the human rights of the Aboriginal people for 200 years. It was to deny that they were even human. For some people now to stand up here and want to play hard ball on the way the legislation should be implemented suggests to me that they do not understand that. The honourable member for Parkes probably does not concede that we stole anything. He probably does not even concede that, prior to white sightings of this continent, Aborigines actually owned this land. In a way he is correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding of Aboriginal culture from the people I have met is that they do not own the land. They are part of the land; the land owns them. That is a very strange concept for many of us to come to grips with. The easiest way to come to grips with this concept&mdash;and the way that most of us do it&mdash;is to take the example of the recent Commonwealth Games. We are all Australian and we are all proud to be Australian when we see athletes running down the track. We take ownership of the word `Australian' and the endeavours of those people but we really do not physically do anything ourselves. I did not run around the track or do a high jump or anything like that, yet I took ownership of those medals that were won on behalf of Australia. </PARA>

They do not have to own the land to be part of it. To be part of something is not to play a dominant role. They do not have the adversarial system of law which we have. Our system of law has two parts&mdash;the right one and the wrong one. The process is that one view challenges the other.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am trying to make is that it would be beneficial for those in the coalition to stop wobbling their lips and tongues, kick their brains into neutral for a while&mdash;out of self-interest&mdash;and then change up to empathy. Try to be compassionate. Try to get your brains into that gear which brings with it understanding. To do that, somehow you will have to get out of your white skins. Look at it as if you were theologians looking at the various religions of the world and make assessments, not judgments. Try to come to an understanding. I am sure that some members of the coalition have very good hearts, but I think they have to take some time to actually try to understand the differences in culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, when I was a young bloke, I thought, as all young blokes do, that I knew everything. When I was a young teacher I camped at Wallaga Lake. I asked the local people for permission to stay on their land and they gave me permission. Some young blokes from out west came and camped nearby. We were sitting around a fire and they started to talk and I could not understand every fifth, 10th or 12th word. Honourable members would understand that, when you are talking, if a pivotal word in a sentence is taken away, it is sometimes very difficult to understand the meaning of what was said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a teacher and I had been through university and had a Diploma of Education, but for the first time in my life I realised that Aboriginals had a language problem because English was their second language. The coalition needs to realise that there are many differences that are not apparent on the surface. Rather than telling the world what their view of Aboriginal culture is and should be, they should shut up and listen. If we were to trawl through the Aboriginal communities in Australia and ask them whether or not they wanted this land fund, I think we would find that the Aboriginal communities would say, `If we are given our view, yes.' But let us look at reality. We are going to decide whether or not the legislation enabling the land fund goes through. Quite frankly, I have not seen too many black faces in here. I have not seen too many people in here who have claimed aboriginality. Again the Aboriginal people are faced with the situation that big brother white man is going to make decisions which are integral to their futures and their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know that there is a way around that problem at this point in time. One can only hope that people at least on this side of the House are listening to the Aboriginal people. I do not think people on the other side of the House want to hear them. They want to listen to people like Richard Court who operate according to their vested interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, the message that I would like to give to Australian people is that we did steal the Aboriginals' land, and I admit it. I am not personally responsible. I have never shot an Aborigine; I have never abused one; I have never put any in chains; I have not kicked any heads off babies. However, the point is: even though I personally am not guilty, does that absolve my culture and my civilisation? My answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the Prime Minister of Japan is not guilty of beating and badly handling Australians while they were in prison in New Guinea. Yet he sees a point in going around all Asian nations saying, `We acknowledge the faults of our past and we are sorry. We will do what we can to make sure that in future Japan is a different place.' I think members of the parliament of Australia, via the land fund, the native title  legislation and a sincere commitment on behalf of the people on this side of the House, should say from their hearts to the Aboriginal people, `We will do all that we can, knowing that that will be very short of what is required to give a real sense of justice.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you live in New South Wales, I can understand that you might have some apologia. It is my understanding that the state of New South Wales has never produced much legislation for Aborigines or given them much land. In fact, you could add up all the land that New South Wales has ever produced for its Aboriginals and put it into one medium sized, drought stricken sheep station in western New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not apply universally across Australia. For example, in my state of South Australia, the first reservations for Aborigines were produced in 1842. Even by the 1860s, people like George French Angas were saying that Aboriginals had been very badly treated. I am not saying that that was not true. But, as long as pastoral land acts were enacted in my state, there were always, in every acre and hectare of pastoral land, reservations for Aborigines to hunt in and live on; they could occupy any part of those pastoral lands, with a couple of exceptions near homesteads and waters. That has been the circumstance in South Australia and Western Australia almost all of the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is not the circumstance in Victoria. Almost no land in Victoria has been provided to Aborigines by any government. It is the same in New South Wales. If you have a guilt and you come from New South Wales, I could understand it. I point out that we do not have quite that level of guilt. The Prime Minister, in his second reading speech, said that contemporary Western culture tends to view land as something of a commodity, something which can enrich us, not something which we must cherish and nurture, which in turn will nurture us. Your contemporary culture might think that, but ours does not. If you think that land is the only thing that is important to all Aborigines, you are wrong. If you think that land is not important to some Europeans or Asians, you are equally wrong. If you think that all Aboriginals want landownership alone, then you are wrong again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cathy Freeman is the best example of this in recent times. She has been much quoted in this House not only for her extreme courage in coming from behind several times but also for the extraordinary maturity with which she handled the problems which she faced over there. She has shown us that she is totally involved in an aspect of Australian life. I would like to see Australians given the opportunity&mdash;and many have in the past, but not enough&mdash;to be involved in any aspect of Australian life, whether it be in the professions, in politics, in business, in tourism or in sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that `assimilation' is a word that has passed us by and that is not politically correct, but total involvement is correct. This idea which is getting around the place&mdash;and it has been raised in some Aboriginal communities and by some Aboriginal spokesmen&mdash;that you can separate people and do good for them is something that many people would refute; I certainly do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's fundamental purpose in creating this land fund was to help those who would not benefit from successful claims emanating from the Native Title Act. We remember that the proportion of successful claims was variously estimated by the Prime Minister and others. We heard from some that perhaps 10 per cent of Aboriginals would benefit. Lois O'Donoghue said five per cent would benefit, and Sol Bellear said that maybe as few as three per cent of Aboriginals would benefit. The purpose of this bill was to benefit other people. The preamble to the Native Title Bill reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also important to recognise that many Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, will be unable to assert native title rights and interests and a special land fund needs to be established to help them acquire land.</PARA>
<PARA>I presume that this is the land fund. The explanatory memorandum reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising that many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will be unable to secure native title and to benefit directly from the High Court decision, the Bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the old Native Title Bill, now the act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">establishes a National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it was to be directed to those people who were not able to get an advantage. Nowhere in this bill does it appear. Of course, it cannot appear. We know why it cannot appear. It is patently obvious that, for years and years to come, nobody will know who will not benefit from native title claims. The native title claims are coming in thick and fast all over Australia. They will go on in this tribunal and that court for years to come. This is notwithstanding the fact that the Native Title Act was to be the act of parliament that would solve all those problems. The Native Title Act was going to save us from the court decisions that emanated out of the High Court Mabo decision which was going to take such a long time to solve in every court of the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening now? The gentleman who was put in charge of the tribunal, Mr Justice French, is saying that he needs some more court decisions. After the Mabo decision and the Native Title Act, which took so long and had about 200 amendments&mdash;it must have been beautifully drafted&mdash;suddenly the gentleman who is put in charge of administering the tribunal says that he needs some more court decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister threw in an idea to see whether it floated or whether the fish would take it. He said, `We might have to amend the Native Title Act.' Of course you will have to amend the Native Title Act&mdash;or repeal it and start again, which is probably what any sensible person would do. You cannot run a land fund based on your original premise. Your original premise has gone out the window because you cannot get any decisions on native title in a hurry. Everybody who was thinking hard on our side of the House told you that and knew that all through the last two years of debate on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just touch on the matter of claims. Again in this House the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the Prime Minister said, `Don't worry too much about pastoral leases. Pastoral leases will be okay because the Mabo decision itself will make sure that claims on pastoral leases are unsuccessful.' We do not know about that yet because here we are 2 1/4 years after the Mabo decision and we have not had any decisions that I am aware of emanating out of the Mabo decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have claims for absolutely hundreds of thousands of hectares of one state alone&mdash;Western Australia. The latest one hit the deck about 10 days ago claiming nearly all of the Argyle diamond mining area and the future Ord River irrigation area. Is it not an amazing coincidence that all of a sudden these claims are coming in for the extremely and extraordinarily valuable areas of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think people are starting to understand, as some of us said some time ago, when you look at maps of Australia that have claim marks all over them&mdash;which claims could never be decided in a hurry because the evidence on each one of them will be different&mdash;that it is a very great worry for the future investment propositions in this country, and it does not augur well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me expand on that slightly. It is said amongst some of the legal profession who are worried about this matter that the only country that is safe from native title claim will be freehold land where the title was issued prior to 1975. That may be true or it may be an exaggeration. It is also said that freehold land issued after 1975 will probably be safe but that maybe there will be some compensation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs said, as did the Prime Minister, `Don't worry about pastoral leases; they will be okay.' But I think it is true to say that all pastoral lease in this country at the present time is unsafe; all pastoral lease is probably vulnerable whether it is term lease, perpetual lease, conditional lease or in whatever form of leasehold it comes in whatever state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, it looks to me, as I flagged in this House a year or so ago, that those states that took the trouble back in 1893&mdash;in the case of South Australia in the early part of this century and in the case of Western Australia in the 1920s&mdash;to make some reservations for Aboriginals, where they could live, walk, hunt and conduct their original affairs on all of the pastoral country just as they had in the past, may be more vulnerable to native title claims on their country than the other states which actually wiped out the possibility of Aboriginals having those sorts of advantages. These matters need to be dealt with very seriously and very urgently. That is why we have proposed a number of amendments to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister was right to have changed the text of his prepared second reading speech. He changed his prepared text which he put out to the press and everybody else. He added:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that the opposition intends moving amendments relating to health, housing and other matters of welfare to Aboriginal and Islander people&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which we are. He also added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will, of course, consider all amendments, but will maintain the primary view that the fund must be about land . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Native Title Act has been through the parliament. It enables Aboriginals to claim a bundle of rights up to full possessory rights perhaps in some cases. We then say that we are going to advantage those people who are not advantaged by having a fund&mdash;but actually we do not; we change the basis of the fund and have the fund anyway&mdash;and we do not address the disadvantages in regard to Aboriginal health, education or any of those things while we are doing it. So we produce some more money for some more land on top of the land that is able to be purchased for Aboriginals by ATSIC and on top of the land that has already been provided by the states and is continuing to be provided by the states. Again, I quote my state of South Australia where 20 per cent of the land is in Aboriginal hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer back to the collective ideology of the honourable member for Gilmore about Aboriginals and say that some of those people who live on the Pitjantjatjara land are now starting to question the fact that, because they own inalienable freehold title, they cannot deal with any individual rights or the commercial realisms and possibilities that they have sitting under that extraordinarily valuable piece of ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The life expectancy for an Aboriginal boy was 18 years shorter than his non-Aboriginal counterpart in 1992; the life expectancy for a girl was nearly 20 years shorter; and infant mortality rates were three times the rates for all Australians and so on. Here we have another bill about land which does not deal with these very important issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now come to the bill itself. The bill deals largely with the mechanics of establishing the Indigenous Land Corporation and the funding arrangements. In the process it amends the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act. It will bring about a statutory corporation with the management vested in the board of directors of seven persons, five of whom must be indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just address that matter. The board is to be appointed by the minister. The directors hold office for not more than four years. The board is responsible for the proper and efficient performance of the Indigenous Land Corporation and will determine the policy of the Indigenous Land Corporation with respect to any matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem to me that one of the essential requirements of that board is to have business expertise. After all, if it is going to exist, it is going to be a board which will purchase and determine the policy of land worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In fact, the way I read the bill, there will be somewhere in the order of $500 million available, if used, in the first 10 years or so for the purchase of land for collective Aboriginal groups. Leaving all other things in the bill aside, I would have thought the one essential requirement should be that those people should be as expert as you can possibly get. As far as I am concerned, if they are all Aboriginals, that will be great. But it seems to me that the primary requisite must be their expertise. That is the first thing I would like to raise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of questions that need to be raised on this matter and I would like to very quickly go through them. The major deficiencies of the bill really fall into four categories. It provides little direction on economic improvements and how they will be delivered to Aboriginal people. I raised that before. There is insufficient distinction concerning land acquisition between the bill and the Native Title Act. I referred to that original intertwining which has now disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It allows the funds to be directed only through Aboriginal corporations. That is the second important matter I want to raise. Why only Aboriginal corporations? Why not individuals, families or corporations in the legal sense? Why could they not be minority groups, for example? If we are really serious about doing some good for Aboriginal people, why are we not dealing with the sorts of things that will encourage them to get on individually like Miss Freeman and others of her abilities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public accountability stipulations are insufficient. I have many questions. Apart from land, what economic benefits can be directed out of this bill to Aboriginal people? They might be there incidentally, but they are not in the bill. What assistance can the ILC give Aboriginal people to establish their own businesses&mdash;none or very little&mdash;or to facilitate Aboriginal involvement in businesses? Why a 50 per cent limitation? Why is financial assistance limited to Aboriginal corporations? Why discount the possibility of Aborigines holding minority interests?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the ILC directed to create job opportunities? It is not. Where is the ILC directed to provide surety of loans other than the connection with land purchase? Why does the bill exclude land claimable under Aboriginal land rights but not land claimable under the Native Title Act? We know why that is; nobody knows who is going to get land under the Native Title Act. Why is the definition of the interest in land wide enough to include native title land?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What proportion of funds does the government expect to go to land acquisitions versus land management? What proportion of funds does the government expect to go to metropolitan based Aborigines versus rural based Aborigines? What proportion of funds does the government expect to be directed to each of the states? What cognisance will be taken of the fact that some of the states have done a lot for their Aborigines? As I said, New South Wales and Victoria have done almost nothing. I probably would have to include Tasmania, although there are not many Aborigines left in Tasmania. What proportion of funds does the government expect will be directed towards housing and infrastructure versus land acquisition? Those are extremely important points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the flexibilities in this bill simply are not great enough. If the government is serious about trying to do good for the Aboriginal cause and for Aboriginals in general, then it will take notice of our proposed amendments and not simply run around accusing us of trying to make the hurdle too high to jump over it. I have been to all of the people who objected to the Native Title Act, as I still do, and all of those people say, `If this bill has the right results, we are all for it.' If the government takes notice of that, it will get some benefit from it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of conscientious commitment and a basic understanding of the issues and objectives that are involved, as well as the purposes that are sought to be achieved, there are many members on the opposition benches who will not be able to look back on these years of policy change and changing circumstances with a great deal of personal pride&mdash;for example, if at some time in the future their descendants have some occasion to peruse the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the debates to see what their ancestors were saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These developments were momentous occasions in Australia's history. At the end of 200 years of very significant dispossession, why should they not be? They were long overdue. This legislation is part of the Commonwealth's overall response to the Mabo decision. The Native Title Act was the first significant response that we made. The point has been made that the Mabo decision and the resultant Native Title Act were put into place as a means by which those Aboriginal Australians who today, after 200 years of dispossession, are able to establish a continuing association with the land with which they are currently associated and which they currently occupy can perhaps make a valid claim for that land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 30 per cent of the Australian Aboriginal population of about 260,000 presently live on Aboriginal land&mdash;that is, the old Aboriginal reserve land. A relatively small proportion of Aboriginal Australians will be able to use the native title legislation to make a valid claim for the land with which they are able to prove some continuing association. That means that 70 per cent of Aboriginal Australians cannot benefit from the native title legislation. The question then arises as to why that should be so. Of course, the reason is that those 70 per cent are the most dispossessed of all Aboriginal Australians. They are the ones who were forced off their land. They are the ones who were tossed off their land. They are the ones for whom circumstances were made impossible. They are the people who have now moved off the land which their forefathers occupied for 60,000 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 14 per cent of the Australian land mass is now owned by Aboriginal Australians, who constitute about three per cent of our population. I have heard members of the opposition say that that proves they own a disproportionate area of the Australian land mass. Everyone knows that that 14 per cent of the Australian continent which Aboriginal Australians own, which they have been able to retain and have had declared as land over which they have title, is probably incapable of even very sparse grazing. If it had been arable, valuable agricultural land or good grazing land, it would not now be theirs. The nature of the 14 per cent of the Australian continent which they own is obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This legislation will establish a fund that will make it possible for 70 per cent of Aboriginal Australians&mdash;those who are the most dispossessed&mdash;to access funds and, in turn, buy back some of the land. I simply say to members of the National Party in particular that some members of my wider family are still on the land after my great-grandparents took out leases in the last century. In some cases there are now three generations. Those relatives of mine say they have a very strong attachment to the land. They do; they cleared and developed it. They have enjoyed the successes of utilising that land and they have suffered the hardships such as droughts, floods and fires. The good times and the bad times have all been part of their experience. But that is three generations over about 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Aboriginal Australians occupied that land from which they were dispossessed for possibly 60,000 years. In many cases, the point has been admirably made that the occupation of that land for 60,000 years established a very close and necessary relationship&mdash;a fundamental relationship&mdash;between Aboriginal Australians and the land. That underpins the type of approach which this government has been taking to this question. It really is not good enough for members of the opposition to say that the land question should, in a sense, be put aside and that we have to concentrate exclusively on housing, health, employment and other types of social and economic conditions. Of course, we have to pay attention to them, but not to the exclusion of land, which is fundamental&mdash;in many respects, it is at the core&mdash;to Aboriginal concerns and culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The purpose of establishing the fund is to make it possible for indigenous Australians to acquire and manage land in a sustainable way to provide economic, social and cultural benefits. It has been very carefully tailored. The way in which the fund will be developed means that, at the end of a 10-year period, there will be about $1.1 billion in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have suggested that indicates that all the money being made available will not be immediately available for the purchase of land. Of course it will not. In the first year it will be about $45 million. Over the 10-year period, a progressive cumulative amount is available. The larger proportion of the total allocation each year is put into a fund for investment purposes so that, after 10 years, that $1.1 billion, with estimated interest on the investments at 4.5 per cent, will be providing about $45 million in today's money terms&mdash;in real terms&mdash;for the progressive purchase of land by Aboriginal Australians to make it possible for them to develop and to re-establish their links with it. It has been carefully tailored. It is a very sensible approach. For all those reasons, I strongly support this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have not yet been able to see the detailed amendments. I do not think they have been distributed because they have not yet been moved. Our understanding, on the basis of some of the contributions that have been made by members of the opposition thus far, is that the opposition is concerned that the purposes of the land fund should be broadened to include health, housing and other types of social and economic community benefits for Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The reason for this legislation is to put on top of those other arrangements a specific provision for the most dispossessed Aboriginals to have access to funds which will make it possible for them to purchase land. In other words, it appears to me&mdash;I hope that I am not misrepresenting the opposition's position&mdash;that a central part of its position is that it is prepared to support the land fund if it is not a land fund. That is just too cute. At the same time opposition members say, `What we are concerned about is making sure that additional funds will go into housing, community services, employment, health and education.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the last election all members of the opposition endorsed a package called Fightback. They all defended and promoted it. It was their manifesto for the last election. Fightback involved a cut in the funding of ATSIC of $90 million. We retained that level of funding. In fact, there has been an increase in it. The funding for ATSIC and all those other programs has remained intact. This is new funding. The total amount of new funding over that 10-year period is something in excess of $1.2 billion for this specific purpose. I despair at the position which has been adopted by opposition members when, as I say, in that very politically cute way they say, `We will support the land fund if you change it so that it is not a land fund.' We have specific purposes in introducing this measure. I believe that the amendments will be considered genuinely, as they should be, because that commitment has been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). I do not think there is any chance in the world that this government will allow those possible amendments to destroy the purpose of this legislation, and nor should it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I do not think people should be fooled by the attitude which the opposition has adopted. Everyone needs to remember that the opposition was dragged screaming by the forces of public opinion in connection with this issue. Very serious divisions exist within the opposition concerning this question and the general question of Aboriginal affairs. Its whole philosophy, sentiment and inclination is against the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This might be an attempt to paint a moderate face for the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), who describes himself as a progressive conservative. What in heaven's name is a progressive conservative? Does a progressive conservative remain in the same place by moving forward, or does he move forward by remaining in the same place? We have the Left, Right and Centre in the Labor Party and the non-aligned or independents. We have some right in the centre of the non-aligned. But I understand that the two major groups in the opposition are the conservatives and the progressives. So what would those who want to straddle both groups and seek elevation to leadership call themselves?</PARA>

He raised the question as to whether or not the fund should also make it possible for individuals, families, trusts or Aboriginal partnerships to acquire land. One of the problems created by that is that there are no simple means by which the continuity of ownership can be provided for. We are concerned with ensuring that the land is owned by the corporation, which will make it accessible for Aboriginal people to develop and use in different ways.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Some of the particular amendments that will apparently be proposed by opposition members stem to a very large extent from some of the concerns that they have expressed before.

Even Dr Brendan Nelson, a person who I think has acted as a very effective spokesman for the Australian Medical Association, was very concerned about the position opposition members had adopted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will endeavour to do so. I think it is sad that, when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) indicated that we would look to support this bill, provided that there were some amendments, before those amendments were even mentioned or put on the table in any shape or form we had an instantaneous reaction from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and from the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), talking about confidence tricks and so on. This clearly demonstrated that the government is not sincere about taking a bipartisan approach. As I have said in this place before, this is a re-run of what happened in the Mabo debate, where on two separate occasions we approached the government to see whether we could sit down and talk about establishing some common ground. Specifically, the Prime Minister and the minister were not interested in trying to establish common ground with the opposition on these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not comfortable for government members to be reminded of these occasions because they like to pontificate about taking a bipartisan position, but they want a bipartisan position only when we are going to do everything they want. They do not accept that there can be sincerely held views on this side of the chamber that are well motivated and absolutely genuine, and that perhaps we ought to sit down and talk about some of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been very noticeable that that attitude has developed in this parliament. In the previous parliament we talked about setting up the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, and those discussions could and did take place with a very fruitful outcome. But, since we have had this Prime Minister, that has unfortunately not been possible. It is important that that is understood from the outset. Government members talk about there being people of goodwill on this side of the House so, when people on this side of the House who might have some common views with those on the other side seek to get that cooperative response, I believe that there is a responsibility on the government to show that generosity of spirit that I mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have recently travelled around this country a lot on Aboriginal affairs matters. I did it as a shadow minister, I have done it as a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and I have done it with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Affairs over the last four years or so. My position on the land fund has been on record for some time as being very much in support in principle. But it is also important to recognise that land alone is not going to solve all of the problems of the indigenous people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a holistic approach and that holistic approach has to include the subject of land. We have to recognise that Aboriginal people around the country have a very strong and quite sincere belief in the significance of land and they have an almost spiritual attachment to land. Certainly the rural community and the non-Aboriginal community will say that they also have a special attachment to land. I have talked to farmers and Aboriginal people around this country and there are strongly held views about this by both communities, but quite clearly what comes across is that indigenous people do feel a particular attraction for the land that cannot be articulated in the way that the Western culture would have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that, regardless of whether we understand it or like it, the reality is that land is very important for Aboriginal people. Therefore, we should be supporting this bill if we possibly can because it seems to me that it is part of that holistic approach. There are those who will argue that land in itself really will not do any particular good for Aboriginal people, and many statistics show that Aboriginal people who own their land are not necessarily in a particularly better condition than those who do not. But I do not think that that is the fundamental point. The ownership of land philosophically should be an important motivator in any other remedies that we try to put in place to improve the lot of indigenous people. The Australian experience has shown that owning land per se has not done a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a recent overseas trip I looked at indigenous issues in Canada and the United States. Whilst there are areas in Canada and the States where indigenous people own their land, their wellbeing in health, housing and education has not necessarily significantly improved. Having said that, the land issue should form part of a holistic approach and not just be put on one side. If we want to deal with health, housing, education and the like, we also have to deal with the land, because it is such a fundamental aspect of this issue. It seems to me that the state governments have accepted that for many years. However imperfect some of those state governments may have been in land issues for Aboriginal people, programs of one sort or another have been in place for some time. For the last four-odd years, ATSIC's program has had bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation deals with land, land management and the upgrading of land. All those things are important. The coalition has suggested that, in addition to those functions&mdash;not instead of&mdash;we perhaps need to give some more emphasis to economic development and that, where purchases are made, there should be some demonstration of Aboriginal wellbeing&mdash;part of that holistic approach. The amounts of money involved are relatively small. By the time we take into account the money that ATSIC already spends in this area, we are talking about only another $24 million a year&mdash;not a huge amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have suggested some amendments to extend the scope and so on of the legislation and to make some accountability improvements. Some of those amendments go to the sorts of things that the government itself talked about putting in place when it first mentioned this legislation, but it has not actually put them in the detail of the legislation. It would help everybody concerned if we could sit down and look at some of those amendments more calmly and slowly, rather than hurl epithets across the chamber. The amendments can make the legislation better. The accountability will help provide more effective management and direction, and that is so necessary to break the welfare dependency that unfortunately has grown up in so many Aboriginal communities. I do not want to stand here and catalogue the many disadvantages in the Aboriginal communities, but it is important to remember that we are talking about trying to take a multifaceted approach to this issue. Land is an integral part of that approach, and we have to deal with the health issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very saddened by the comments made earlier this afternoon by the honourable member for Moreton&mdash;with whom I have always got along very well&mdash;on spending in the area of health. A lot of the alleged extra health money announced by the government this year was effectively a continuation of the national Aboriginal health strategy that is already in place but was about to expire. Let us not play games with money and let us not play games with health. Health is important. We need to do things in the field of health from the bottom up. Health is important in improving the lot of Aboriginal people; without proper health, those other things will not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have stood in this place and told stories of experiences I have had in Aboriginal communities around this country where there are 25, sometimes 30, people living in a house. No human being should be expected to live in those conditions. There is obviously much to be done in the area of housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people do not get education, they do not get jobs. If they do not get jobs, they do not get an income. That means that they do not get a house and that means that their health is not any good. There is much to be done in the area of education. The rates of attendance at and achievement in schooling for Aboriginal people are appalling compared with the rates for the broader community. I do not condemn the Aboriginal community for that; I am saying that it is a fact that we have to deal with. Having had a decade&mdash;there is no question about it&mdash;of good intention from the government to fix those issues, the reality is that many of those issues have not been fixed. Therefore, we have to look at new ways of trying to deal with some of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in good times, the Aboriginal unemployment rate is so much worse than the unemployment rate for the rest of the community that we have to look at special measures to generate economic activity in the area of employment in indigenous communities. If we do not do those things, if we do not provide some self-esteem and some self-respect, which derive from good housing, good health, good education, employment and ownership of one's own land and one's own property, we get what we have seen so often. With that loss of self-esteem and self-respect, and with people having idle time on their hands, there is substance abuse, crime, over-representation in the legal system and all the terrible problems that come with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that saddened me in recent months&mdash;I have seen this over several years in Australia&mdash;was that, although America and Canada take slightly different approaches than us, the profiles for indigenous people are very similar. Even where they have given land, the profiles are very similar. Therefore, whilst I accept the importance of land to this issue, it is only one facet of the issue and we have to take a holistic approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although ATSIC has not had relatively all that long to make an impact, it has had its share of challenges and difficulties. It is not unreasonable that we make sure that any new body that we set up is set up having learnt the lessons from the past. ATSIC has certainly been overcentralised and it has not always had the experience it has needed in particular areas. In its first three years of operation, its own deputy chairperson has been consistently vocal about the fact that it did not have the expertise to run health, for example. The government has obviously acknowledged that. Therefore, in this area, we have to make sure that management of this ILC has that sort of expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about involving the states, government members&mdash;in some senses, I suppose, understandably&mdash;scoff, `What about the states?' In many ways some states have not been as constructive as I would have liked to have seen them be over the years on this issue of Aboriginal affairs. I do not perceive that as necessarily taking a party political complexion. Whichever party is in power in some states, we tend to have some difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to make some progress on these issues, where those services are often delivered at a state level, we need to try to involve the states and to get them on side. Therefore, when we talk about amendments that will try to involve the states in the process, it is not to abrogate the responsibility that this parliament picked up in the 1967 referendum. It is to say that the reality is that we need to involve all players in the process. It is important that we try to involve the states, in the same way as it is important that we try to get appropriate skills. I simply reject the notion, as put forward by the honourable member for Moreton earlier today, that it is a confidence trick and that we are distorting the legislation, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite sincerely believe that we need to take a bipartisan approach and if they sincerely believe that there are people on this side who are, if you like, the good guys&mdash;I think the honourable member for Charlton has paid me that compliment from time to time&mdash;I ask them in all seriousness, in all sincerity, to take a constructive look at the amendments. Let us really try to improve the legislation for the sake of the indigenous people and let us get the whole parliament pulling in the same direction. Let those opposite not just say, `We have not agreed with you for months and you do not like our legislation, so we will not accept any of your amendments.' Do not reject them out of hand. Let us have a bipartisan approach. The leader of the coalition has said that he wants to support the legislation subject to those amendments. Let us try to do it. Let us try to work in a sensible way. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision of Mabo v. Queensland (No. 2) on 3 June 1992 was a significant event in the history of Australia and for its indigenous peoples. On 10 December 1992, another significant event took place. On that day the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating) made the most significant act of public reconciliation to that date. In his speech in Redfern he talked about the need for the rest of Australia to recognise `that it was we who did the dispossession; that we took the traditional lands and smashed the traditional way of life'. That was tough talking and very appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps in urban Australia, and certainly not in the Adelaide Club or the Melbourne Club, it is not recognised how significant this statement was to Australia's indigenous people. When I campaigned as the Labor candidate for Leichhardt in remote communities in the Cape York Peninsula, the Prime Minister's speech was well known, yet information to such remote communities from Canberra is often scarce; such was its significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill today turns the Prime Minister's words into reality. It is that significant. It is crucial for any reconciliation with Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that those dispossessed indigenous people now receive compensation&mdash;I emphasise the word `compensation'. When the Prime Minister said `we' he probably meant those people who came to Australia after European settlement, but `we' must also include those people representing `us'; that is, the government. From the first colonial governments to state and federal governments, there was official support, and complicity in a lot of cases, for what is now recognised as dispossession. A notorious example of this is what happened in my electorate in the late 1950s and early 1960s to the communities of Weipa, Napranum and Mapoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complicity of the government in dispossession culminated in 1963 when the Mapoon community was literally razed to the ground by fire by the Queensland government and people were forced to move to what is now called New Mapoon in the northern peninsula area. The people of Mapoon have led a very courageous fight to retain their land, and that settlement is now booming. People are returning, and with the support of both the Queensland and the federal governments there is a great future for Mapoon. Mapoon has all the problems that have been referred to in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, but I am confident that those people returning to their homeland will find a future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to see what happened in Weipa. Father Frank Brennan's book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land Rights Queensland Style</EMPHASIS>, states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After John Pilger's documentary "The Secret Country" was screened in Australia, Mark Rayner, the managing director of Comalco complained that the review of the film perpetuated "the long discredited claim that the Mapoon Aboriginal mission was closed to make way for Comalco's bauxite mining activities". Rayner was right when he refuted the assertion "that the Mapoon mission was closed to enable Comalco to mine there". But he did paint an incomplete picture. In 1959, Comalco was granted special bauxite mining leases over a large part of the Weipa Aboriginal reserve which is south of Mapoon. To accommodate Comalco's interests, the Queensland government, without compensation, reduced the area of the Weipa reserve from over 354,000 hectares to a mere 124 hectares. The Queensland government continued to misrepresent to parliament the area of the Weipa reserve until November 1982 when the then Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs admitted a discrepancy of over 354,000 hectares. Though Comalco had surrendered much of that land back to the crown, it was never regazetted as an Aboriginal reserve.</PARA>
<PARA>In reality, we cannot talk about this bill without talking about the complicity of prior governments. It is not just a matter of guilt, as has been suggested by some previous speakers, but a matter of compensation. This government acts with both compassion and responsibility. We have to compensate those acts of dispossession which cannot be assisted by the native title legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Leichhardt, many Aboriginal people miss out under the Native Title Act. The Wik people at Aurukun have a close affiliation with their land. The community of Injinoo in the northern peninsula has a similar affinity. In the same area, there are also the communities of Bamaga and Seisia, which are made up of people mainly from the Torres Strait, mainly from Saibai Island. Most of those people came relatively voluntarily; nevertheless, those communities would not benefit in any way from the native title legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Mapoon, which is in the northern peninsula, consists of dispossessed people from Mapoon. Umagico, a community in the northern peninsula, consists of people who were resettled&mdash;I use `resettled' as a euphemism&mdash;from Lockhart River. The community of Lockhart River has been shifted geographically several times. Lockhart itself consists of different language groups. The Yarrabah community, which is south of Cairns, is a very relevant example of the need for this legislation. The Yarrabah community consists of people who have a long affiliation with that land. At one stage Yarrabah was basically a penal colony. People were sent to Yarrabah if they transgressed even minor rules of other reserves and missions. Other people were forcibly moved to Yarrabah from other parts of Far North Queensland. There are other such examples in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Mabo is not enough. We need this legislation. I thought for a while that there was some recognition by the Liberal Party in this regard. But I think the coalition's attitude on this matter is quite confused. On 9 September 1992 the leader of the Liberal Party in the Queensland parliament, Mrs Sheldon&mdash;the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), is a Queensland member so no doubt he will be influenced by his own state policy on this matter&mdash;was reported as follows in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberals would establish an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Land Acquisition Fund with an initial $6 million, with $3 million to be added each year, Mrs Sheldon said when launching her party's northern policy in Cairns.</PARA>

<PARA>That was the Liberal Party policy as at 9 September 1992. The honourable member for Aston, who preceded me, came to Normanton in the Far North, at the same time as the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) and a lot of other people, as part of the opposition's consultative process on the Mabo judgment. He said that the local people should see Anne Warner about when land was raised. He said that the Fraser government brought in land rights in the Northern Territory, and he referred to a 7 1/2 per cent land tax which he seemed to favour. He then said that Goss and Warner should look at the same idea. Apparently, on 5 July 1993, the honourable member for Aston agreed with Joan Sheldon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now come to today, and I really do not know what the opposition's position is. As I said before, if you listen to each opposition speaker you get a different point of view. It seems that the opposition's position is that the money would be better spent on health and education. This very clearly flies in the face of what Australia's indigenous people want. I am not suggesting that they do not want money spent on those areas&mdash;of course they do&mdash;but it is sheer hypocrisy from a party whose policy at the last election was Fightback. Under Fightback there was to be a 10 per cent reduction in expenditure in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. That was the policy those opposite took to the last election, and at the same time, it seems, they advocated that a land fund was much more important than spending money on health, housing and all those matters, as long as the states did it. They have done a complete backflip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where the honourable member for Aston's argument completely falls down. The point is: those opposite have not consulted with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There is no Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person, spokesperson or group who supports their position. If there were, Mr Deputy Speaker, you could bet that the Liberal Party would have them on the television screens of the nation tonight. The Liberal Party would bring someone out who supported its position. But we have not heard anybody because no Aboriginal person with any standing in the Aboriginal community would support its position. The shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), seems very confused about these issues. She said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 22 August:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal people themselves say that land is a key to their wellbeing and I think for those Aboriginal people who live in the outback . . . that is very true.</PARA>
<PARA>In the same interview she said she had `no illusions that I am going to come up with solutions' to the problem of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. She is very honest, yet I understand that the gist of one of the amendments suggested by the coalition before the House is that before any purchase of land they must show&mdash;I do not know who `they' are&mdash;how it will improve health, housing and economic needs. Who must show this? Who must they show this to? Who is going to make that judgment? The shadow minister has no illusion that she has solutions. That shows what a farce the opposition's position is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Aston says that he has consulted throughout the Aboriginal community. I admit that the honourable member for Aston does travel to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities more than most people opposite, but in reality there has been no consultation by the coalition in relation to its position. It has just been cooked up in the last day or two after a party brawl. How can you suggest that is consultation? It is a position that is clearly a factional compromise within the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, this government has consulted with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people far and wide. The Special Minister of State (Mr Johns) wrote to all ATSIC regional councils and prescribed organisations under the Native Title Act and peak indigenous industry, farming, mining, environmental and religious organisations on 11 April 1994 seeking the submission of views on the structure and operation of the proposed land fund. Responses, on the whole, were positive and constructive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister met with representatives of major Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations on 18 April this year. At that meeting, indigenous representatives agreed that the land fund be administered by an independent specialist body with a focus on indigenous land issues. We have the bill before the House. The Prime Minister met again with these representatives on 16 June 1994. Prior to that meeting, representatives were provided with copies of the draft bill. Consensus was reached on the main features of the legislation and a number of changes were made to address the particular concerns raised at the meeting. Contrast that with the coalition's approach: a party brawl and a mishmashed compromised policy to shore up the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However the coalition's position is disguised or dressed up, it will still be recognised by Australia's indigenous people for what it is: a rejection of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's right to compensation for acts that were perpetrated by governments&mdash;colonial, federal and state&mdash;over the last 200 years. Add that to the 10 per cent cut in Fightback and what do you have? A rejection of Aboriginal people's moral right for their land with which they have a deep spiritual affiliation. In remote areas of Australia, you cannot divorce potential economic independence from land tenure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident this bill, as part of a trilogy&mdash;that is, the native title legislation, this bill and the social justice package&mdash;will meet many of the aspirations of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people coming out of the High Court native title decision. To this can be added a very important further dimension: the question of housing. It is particularly pertinent for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in regional and urban Australia that we get the question of Aboriginal housing right. I am very pleased that the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), has had long consultations with ATSIC about this issue. I am very confident that we will get a package in consultation with the states, and I hope that what seems to be the coalition's change of heart over this bill will reflect some more benevolence in relation to Aboriginal housing from the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it would be foolish for me, or any other government speaker, to suggest that Australian people are unanimous in their support of the government's approach on this issue. Reconciliation still has a long way to go, but at least the Australian people know where this government stands on this issue. At least the Australian people know where the Prime Minister stands. The people of my electorate know where I stand. As for the coalition, after the mess that came out of today's party room blue, after the Leader of the Opposition's little foray in the Northern Territory, after the 10 per cent cut promised in Fightback and then the complete backflip on health and education, the Australian people would not have a clue where it stands on this issue. In this House, we stand very proud in support of the native title legislation and in support of this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), one has to say that he has followed a memorable list of speakers who have demonstrated beyond any doubt that a bipartisan approach towards Aboriginal policy is about as far from the mind of the Labor Party as it is possible to be. I say that with genuine sadness. I cannot understand how honourable members on all sides of this House have in recent years been able to achieve a considerable degree of bipartisanship on complex national issues such as immigration, but have failed utterly to demonstrate a similar level of bipartisanship when it comes to that component of Australia's indigenous population who, for 200 years, have more need of our support than certainly any other community in this land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will go down in perpetuity that this government, in the 11 years it has been in power, despite all its rhetoric, has achieved so little. Every attempt has been made in this debate on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill, commencing with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at lunch time, to paint the opposition as a perfidious group of people who cannot be trusted. The Prime Minister was followed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who said we were treacherous in our attitude towards this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take the time of the House very briefly to go through the history of Aboriginal policy in recent decades. In 1967, 92 per cent of the Australian people, in a rare successful national referendum to change the constitution, determined that Aboriginal Australians should be given the same opportunities as everyone else. If I could read into that, I would say that they said something else. They told the parliament of Australia and everybody in it, `Don't turn Aborigines into some sort of political football. Fix the problem.' The years have passed into decades and efforts have been made by all sides when in government to do this. I put it simply to the House, in the context of this legislation, that the greatest progress has been made when there was demonstrable bipartisanship, and the least progress has been made when this House has remained divided on fundamental issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak on this subject as a former shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. I accepted in those years, as I do now as a member of this parliament, that a sacred trust is incumbent on all of us to assist our fellow Australians, especially those original Australians, to give them opportunities similar to those available to everyone else. That is why this legislation has been held up by the opposition to close examination and some criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land is an essential ingredient in the social as well as the economic and religious background of the Aboriginal people. It must also be remembered that in many respects Aboriginal communities differ as widely as those of any other community in this country. On the one hand, there are the tribal communities, whose affinity with the land is absolute. Most people in this chamber would not doubt that. At the other extreme, there are urbanised communities of Aborigines who have different social and economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale behind this legislation was simply that the vast majority of Aborigines would not be beneficiaries under the Mabo decision of the High Court and under the Native Title Act. I think that is an established fact, although, as was pointed out by my honourable colleagues earlier, so far very few, if any, have seen any results over the last two years. Nevertheless, the point we are making is that when the government talks about over $1 billion for investment in land it should do so without making a distinction between land investment and the need to face the range of so clearly identified social and economic problems faced by many Aborigines whether or not they will be living on that newly purchased land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people in this chamber&mdash;I am one&mdash;have had the opportunity in recent years to visit a range of Aboriginal settlements and cattle properties in Queensland, the Northern Territory and elsewhere. Perhaps the most common comment we hear while on those visits is, `Yes, we have the land; there is no dispute about that. But we do not have the capital. We do not have the means. We do not have the knowledge. We do not have access to knowledge to make it possible for us to turn that land into a viable economic capacity to clothe and feed our people and to give them the opportunities they need.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation gives us an opportunity to address that. The legislation makes the point very validly that it will benefit existing Aboriginal holders of land who previously, as I said, had the problem that they did not have access to capital. On the other hand, it will also benefit future purchasers of land on the same basis. We wholeheartedly support that principle. Unfortunately, there are aspects of the legislation that are not, in our opinion, so satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go into the detail of the bill, I will make a wider point about the whole context of Aboriginal policy as seen by the opposition and as seen from the government's side. As I noted earlier, the government has nothing kind to say about our policy. Nevertheless, the fact of history is that the first land rights legislation passed by an Australian parliament was that of the Fraser government in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point I want to emphasise is that during the eight years of the Fraser government we probably achieved a greater degree of bipartisanship on Aboriginal land policy issues and on general issues relating to the need to improve the circumstances of Australia's Aboriginal population than we have seen in recent years. I think that is regrettable. I would like to see that bipartisanship return to this parliament, because I believe that is the best and the only route by which we will be able to address, in a total sense, the very genuine problems faced by our fellow citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion has been made by the government that we have opposed everything that has ever happened in Aboriginal policy. What rot! Let us see the record. As I mentioned, the first land rights legislation was passed by the Fraser Liberal-National party government. The ATSIC legislation was supported by the opposition. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was supported by the opposition, and the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) serves as our delegate on that council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mabo decision of the High Court was accepted by the opposition. We had problems with the Native Title Act. We emphasised, through both chambers of this parliament, the problems we saw with that legislation. At least we were honest enough to face them. We pointed out the difficulties the government was going to face. Over two years later, as I have already pointed out, the record is virtually bare. It has achieved so little because of the manifest difficulties with the Native Title Act, which we identified at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we are here to debate the land fund legislation. We have put forward a range of amendments. They are open to negotiation with the government. We are serious about a bipartisan approach because we believe it is essential that both sides of this parliament take seriously the whole issue of Aboriginal land rights and what can be done to solve many of their problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of speakers in this debate have emphasised some of the shortcomings of this legislation. One of the issues they have raised, and one of the matters which at some stage in the future should be addressed, is the collective ownership of land on the one side as distinct from individual ownership of land on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no question that, when you are talking about Aboriginal communities in their tribal environments, collective ownership&mdash;through land funds and so forth&mdash;is an acceptable formula. There is no doubt about that in my opinion. But the point I made earlier has to be addressed: that is, not every Aboriginal belongs to a tribal community and, therefore, not every Aboriginal sees his or her role with the land in that particular context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember when I was the shadow minister going out to the west of New South Wales and time and again meeting young Aboriginal men and women. They would say, `All that land in front of us belongs to our community. But my children and I cannot get a share of it.' You would ask them why, and the answer would be that it came down to the politics of the community. Aboriginal communities are no more free of politics than are white or any other communities. This parliament may presume that we can simply pass laws which will create a pristine and beautiful future for every Aboriginal simply through the virtue of the transference of the ownership of land, but it will not work. All human beings have the capacity to make variations to situations and to use for their own benefit the influence and the power that they may have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of an individual title to ownership, or variations of title&mdash;which is obviously what we need to be looking at&mdash;is to take account of those Aboriginal communities, Aboriginal citizens and Aboriginal families, whether they be extended families or otherwise, who want alternatives to simply trying to access land through the collective ownership model, which we have applied in recent years. The point I am making is simply this: it has not worked and it will not work. Therefore, it is incumbent on the government to look far more seriously at that problem than it has done in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purpose of this legislation is to establish an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land fund which provides for the acquisition of land for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are unable to benefit from native title. I would like to see for myself how the government is going to use this legislation to help the Torres Strait Islanders, most of whom do not live in the Torres Strait and many of whom are in precisely the community situations and individual family situations which I referred to earlier. Their land problems in Queensland, which is where they principally live, are not the same as the land problems found in traditional Aboriginal communities. Nevertheless, this is an area to which the government has made a commitment. But the question is: to what extent is it going to be able to live up to it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue which we would like to raise relates to a weakness in the legislation as it currently stands. I refer to the relationship between the land councils and the states. Of course, you mention the word `states' in this House and members of the government usually double up in horror and amusement. The fact is that the states were operating in this country before the Commonwealth was, and they have rights and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to give the House the benefit of hearing the experiences of my own state of New South Wales which, over recent years, has had an excellent record of providing land for Aboriginal communities. In 1983 the Aboriginal Land Rights Act was passed, which provided for all reserves held by the Aboriginal land trust to be transferred to Aboriginal people. The act allowed Aboriginal people to both claim and purchase land, creating a system of land councils. It provided for the equivalent of 7.5 per cent of all New South Wales land tax revenue to be paid into a land council account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each year the total amount has varied between $31 million and $51 million. Since 1986, the act has required that 50 per cent of annual appropriations and all interest on investments be accumulated in a statutory investment fund until 31 December 1988. In fact,  as  at  12  July  1993  there  was $263,131,712 in the statutory investment account, in the New South Wales Aboriginal land council fund, the freehold land and building fund, the fixed interest fund and the building fund. That money would include accumulated interest. The other 50 per cent of moneys is available to cover administration and most will help some of the 113 local land councils throughout the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Most of the states&mdash;but not all, regrettably&mdash;also have legislation in place for the provision of funds for the purchase of land for Aboriginal Australians. Yet in this legislation there is not a word about that. As far as the government is concerned, it just does not exist. So when we are talking about the transference of funds for the purchase of land, I put on the record that we are not only talking about the just over $1.2 billion which was covered by this legislation over 10 years; consideration also has to be given to the funds provided by the various states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to be serious about this, it is clear that a system has to be in place&mdash;on a state-by-state and regional basis&mdash;where the states are taken into account. After all, we are talking about the same Aboriginal communities&mdash;whether they are beneficiaries of federal or state legislation is immaterial. They want the money, access to the land, the opportunity to develop that land and the economic and social independence that access to that land should provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also raised issues relating to accountability. As I said, dating right back to the referendum of 1967 the Australian people said, `There are problems facing Australian Aborigines. You, the government, are responsible for fixing those problems.' There would not be a member in this House who would not know that on many occasions we have had to face audiences who, with some scepticism, said, `You are now spending 1 1/2 billion-odd dollars a year federally alone&mdash;not counting state funds&mdash;and you have not solved the problems.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) in his opening speech this morning, the sad fact is that many of those problems are as bad today as they were 11 years ago when this government came into power&mdash;in some respects, they are even worse. In that context, the question of accountability is vital. Yes, the Australian people want the problem solved and yes, they are willing to have their taxes in their billions made available to help solve these problems. But there is a degree of cynicism out there. There is a belief that too much of this money goes to white Australians and not to indigenous Australians, and that, whatever the policy direction may be, the realities are that the solutions have not been found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is almost bizarre that, in recent years, we have had legislation before this House in which benchmarking has been mentioned. Yes, there will be benchmarking in health, there will be benchmarking in education and there will be benchmarking in various aspects of Aboriginal social activity. But after the initial speech, precious little evidence has been brought before this House to demonstrate whether that benchmarking has had any benefit at all. Indeed, in most cases very little has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The records of health and education, for example, of indigenous Australians compared with statistics for other Australians stand to be seen for what they are.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whether we are talking about income, assets, home ownership, employment, education, qualifications, or housing, this evidence clearly demonstrates that there is no area in which the figures for indigenous Australians are in any sense comparable with figures from across the country. For example, only 12 per cent of indigenous Australians own their own homes compared with 43.1 per cent for the remainder of the community. Of indigenous Australians, 18.2 per cent are purchasing homes compared with 28.5 per cent in the rest of the community. Therefore, a total of 30 per cent of indigenous people own&mdash;in the wider sense of the term&mdash;their own homes compared with 71.6 per cent of the community as a whole. The story is similar in education or anywhere else. It is not an impressive record, considering the time and the money that has been spent over recent decades.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final comment to the House is this: the opposition genuinely wants to see a bipartisan policy in this area. We have come forward with a range of amendments which we believe will strengthen this legislation and make it more effective.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that self-deception is the greatest treason. There is probably no greater treason in the world than to do the wrong thing for the right reason. The ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill is at best a silly bill and at worst very dangerous. Frankly, I am going to vote for this legislation because I am a coward. I cannot be bothered facing up to the hassle of those within the party who would use that against me. I console myself with the fact that my vote will make no difference. The bill will be passed anyway, so to oppose it would in a sense be a futile gesture. I hope the many Aboriginal people in my electorate and throughout Western Australia whom I have discussed this bill with understand and recognise my predicament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt&mdash;I do not know who said it but the truth has been demonstrated today&mdash;that the emotion of any argument is inversely proportional to one's knowledge of the subject. Today, we have heard speaker after speaker from both sides of the parliament saying that land is absolutely essential to the wellbeing of Aboriginal people&mdash;essential to their health and every aspect of their lives. As always, the truth is that that is sometimes correct. In my electorate I have community people who would, in their off pay week in Derby, probably sell all their land for a corned beef sandwich. That does not mean that there are not others who are very committed to their land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the facts of the matter. If we look at Aboriginal dispossession in those areas of Australia where it has been most complete&mdash;Victoria and Tasmania&mdash;we see that the average health of Aboriginal people is far better than that of those who are surrounded by land. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) was up at Utopia a few weeks ago making a fool of himself. Utopia is a case in point. People in Utopia have owned their land for 15 years. The condition of the people at Utopia is the same today as when I visited them some years ago. I am not saying that there have not been beneficiaries because of course there have. Overwhelmingly, the beneficiaries have been those employed by the Aboriginal industry and particularly the lawyers and employees of welfare groups. We need to look at the real problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) talked about the referendum in 1967. He said that the people of Australia voted to give Aboriginals equality. He is wrong. That is what they thought they voted for. That is certainly what I voted for in that legislation. We actually voted to give the government of the day the right to make separate rules for our Aboriginal people. Mr Deputy Speaker, I can tell you that when apartheid comes to this land it is under that heading that it will arrive. That will be the constitutional grounds on which it is established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to land, this legislation merely perpetuates the mistakes of the past. It has been made clear to me by Aboriginal people that there is no shortage of Aboriginal land. However, there is a gross shortage of ability to use that land. Let us see what actually happens. The member for Braddon talked about bipartisanship and rejoiced in the fact that we have a bipartisan approach in this House to immigration. The people who have been disfranchised in that debate are the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the people of Australia were asked whether they agreed with the policies of the Labor Party or the Liberal Party they would have renounced them completely because both parties are in thrall to those pressure groups that support high immigration and multiculturalism. That is not the view or the wish of the Australian people. Similarly, the same thing has occurred because of a bipartisan approach to Aboriginals. What we need in Aboriginal affairs is some new thinking. We do not need any more of what we have because what we have does not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gary Foley said the other day that over $3 billion was going into Aboriginal affairs. The only way I can see reaching that total is to include welfare payments which, in my view, should not be included because, if Aboriginal people are eligible, they are as entitled to those payments as anyone else. The money is considerable&mdash;over $2 billion. Two billion dollars is enough to give every Aboriginal family in this country a new house every two years. They have not got that because the money never gets there. Do honourable members think that Aboriginal people are fools? Do honourable members think that they do not realise what is going on? Of course they realise it. They are angry about what is happening. They know that this legislation is more of the same. It does not give them any self-determination and it does not give them access to any more power. It gives the power to the Aboriginal industry&mdash;the industry that has held them back for all these years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate I probably represent more Aboriginals than any other member in this parliament and I listen to them. I know what they say. They do not like what is happening. I listen to Dickie Cox, the chairman of the Yungngora community at Noonkanbah. I have known Mr Cox for many years and he is a very wise person. He has no great education but he has enormous commonsense. He tells me what he thinks the land acquisition fund will end up as. He says that the money will be channelled into land councils that will buy land in the Kimberleys. The Kimberley Land Council does not have the respect or the votes of all the Aboriginal people in the Kimberleys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cox says that such councils will buy stations and say to the Aboriginal communities, `You can have the station provided that you apply for land under native title.' He also said, `You people are so silly that you will modify your terms and give it to them anyway.' He says that nothing will be done with the land and then they will blame us and say, `We cannot do anything with the land because of the 200 years of dispossession. We need our own state.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Uniting Church in New South Wales has recently decided that it will support the establishment of an independent Aboriginal state in Australia. The United Nations treaty arising from the International Year of the World's Indigenous People calls for full social, political and economic independence. I ask: what is that if it is not a black state? The black state will not be run by Aboriginal people, and they know that. It will be run by the same legions that run the Aboriginal industry today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there has to be some rethinking on this matter. There is an overwhelming problem with Aboriginal health. The answers are not those that I hear from the so-called experts. I suggest that Aboriginal health is contingent on housing more than on any other single factor. With adequate housing must also come a commitment to teach people how to live in those machines which they are not actually used to. Then we need to tackle health on a community health basis, not on the ad hoc bandaid basis that we use at the moment. Then comes education, then comes training and then comes employment&mdash;that vital factor. If any one of these steps is missed out the whole edifice collapses. We have to realise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will look at New South Wales which got some recognition today. The $264 million in the state land fund has been of no benefit to Aboriginal people whatsoever. A few have benefited a lot, but in general there have been no benefits. It would have been of enormous benefit to take industry out to those reserves across New South Wales which are too small in the main to be economically viable for any acceptable industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were committed and if we were inventive we would have looked around for industries that would fit into those areas. Emu farming is one such industry. If we look at the history of emu farming, we find that there are now over 50 emu farms in Western Australia&mdash;two are owned by Aboriginal organisations. All the funding for emu farming in Australia came out of the Aboriginal affairs budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the advent of Don Wieringa's crocodile farm at Fremantle, it could equally be said that all crocodile farm technology had arisen from research done at Edward River out of the Aboriginal affairs budget. Had we taken emu farming across western New South Wales, we could have created wealth and employment for Aboriginal people. With that wealth and employment would have come a sense of purpose, a sense of dignity and much better health. But it was not done because, at the end of the day, I believe that the Aboriginal industry does not want success. It wants to perpetuate itself and it does not want to seek Aboriginal advancement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to Aboriginal funding. There are examples where ATSIC or its predecessor bought land across vast areas of my state. I will stick mainly to Western Australia because I know it better than anywhere else. They usually paid top dollar for these stations&mdash;much more than the properties were worth. They were set up with five-year plans, which in the main were quite workable and reasonable. But then the problem started. The funding did not arrive on time. The funding did not arrive on 1 July. It arrived halfway through the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to use that funding, the Aboriginal people have to bring in a contractor. The response from the wider community is, `Look at those lazy black bastards. We give them this money and they call in the gudia.' The reason they call in the white person is that they know that, if they do not use the money, it is rolled over and they will have to apply for it again. If it arrives late the next year, the same thing happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Noonkanbah is a station in excellent condition. The improvements by the Aboriginal people are A1; they are as good as you will see done by any contractor. If you go to other places in the Kimberleys, you will see the same sort of thing. What Noonkanbah needs is 4,000 head of breeders. But it will not get them because it would then be self-sufficient. The Aboriginal industry knows that there would no longer be a requirement for it. So we see this industry perpetuate Aboriginal poverty. That is exactly what this bill will do. It simply puts more land, more money and more power into the hands of the same people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal people of this nation are not fools. They know that the governments are listening to people who do not represent them. Let us consider the people who purport to speak for Aboriginals. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that he had in his office 36 of the most high powered Aboriginal people in Australia. It was the greatest collection of Aboriginal power. I pointed out to the Prime Minister that those 36 Aboriginals represented nothing but self-interest. They were not elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I knew the six who came from Western Australia well. I said, and I would say again, that I would be prepared to stand against those six in an election in which only Aboriginal people voted. I am confident that I would outvote them because Aboriginal people know and understand. They are not fooled by this. Aboriginal people need a greater participation in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly need improved health. Will this bill give that? The answer is no. Will this bill give greater wealth? The answer is no. It will not benefit Aboriginal people. It may benefit some communities. But, when you look at the structure of these communities, it is very hard to see how this welfare and how these benefits trickle down into the community. For the most part, they do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of this is the CDP program. I was a great advocate of CDP. I thought it was a great idea. The reality of the CDP program is that, unless you have management, the schemes are a disaster. In most places there is no management. But what does ATSIC do? It invariably intrigues and appoints its nominees. When they fail, it walks away from them. I have had this experience repeatedly in my own electorate. Right now I have a problem with the Nomad's country in the Pilbara. People in ATSIC took the view that Nomad was an anomaly that must be done away with. Nomad was a group in which the tribal elders made community decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that a white man was involved, Don McLeod. He was involved because, in 1954, he was the only friend that these people had. In many ways Don has passed it, but I know that these Aboriginal people will not desert him because they are not like that. They will stay with him and, therefore, ATSIC has a responsibility to deal with that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does ATSIC do? It subverts them. It supplies funds and sets up a council of young people who have absolutely no title to that land. The title is all held by the Nomad foundation. It appoints a community adviser, a CDP organiser. This gentleman clearly usurps his power and cuts off the power to the school. He boasts that he will drive out this existing organisation. He is going to change the school. At the moment, it is an Aboriginal community school. He is going to introduce a Catholic school. Unfortunately, he did not tell those people who are involved in Catholic education, and I know that they will not be silly enough to face the same sort of treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC sits back on its hands and says, `These people have self-management.' Countless crimes are being committed against Aboriginal people in this country under the name of self-management, and we do it again and again. This legislation perpetuates the myths. If an Aboriginal community says, `We require a police station,' that is self-management. The committee makes that decision. Immediately this is done, ATSIC and all of the other organisations rush in and say, `Oh no, you have self-management. You must solve this yourself.' We never say to the wider community&mdash;a community much more able to solve things for itself&mdash;`You do not need a police station.' We provide the facilities, and so it should be. Aboriginal people say to me over and over again that they want to be mainstream. They want to be part of Australia. They say, `We are Australians.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember a poignant case that I had in Karratha many years ago when a very intelligent Aboriginal woman for whom I have the highest regard approached me and berated me for the situation that was occurring. She said, `Why is it that Greeks can come to this country and their kids are accepted as Australians in the first generation? My kids have to prove it over and over again.' She turned to the police station and said, `Look. That is my flag, isn't it? I am an Australian. Why can't I have that flag? Why do I have this other flag? Where did that come from?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy to say where the other flag came from. In 1972, Mr Thomas thought it seemed like a good idea to create it, and it was immediately endorsed. But we should not kid ourselves. It would not have got the massive publicity, coverage and exposure that it has had it not been for the bleeding hearts, the social engineers, the white community. We foisted that flag on Aboriginal people, and it is a flag that many of them are beginning to see as a millstone around their necks. Their view is&mdash;and I get this repeatedly&mdash;`We are Australians. We don't want anything other Australians don't get. We are part of Australia. We want to be proud of our nation.' We keep trying to tell them that this is not quite so, and this is inherent in the change to the constitution which was passed in 1967. We did not give them equality. We gave ourselves the right to make special legislation for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am, in a sense, ashamed that I am going to vote for this bill. I have explained the reasons for it. There is a future and things can be done for Aboriginal people. The problem is not insurmountable, but it does require a fresh approach. We have to massively increase housing, and this too can be done if we say to the communities, `You can build houses with your CDP. We will provide the people to teach you the skills required to build and own your own houses.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) says, the reality is that even in those communities Aboriginal people are asking for freehold title. When I returned to Noonkanbah, Dickie Cox said, `We said to ATSIC, "Just give us the freehold title, and we will raise the money on the station."' ATSIC said, `Oh no, you can't do that, you poor Aboriginal people. You might lose.' He said,` Yes, we might. We are pretty good at business and, if we lose, it is our fault.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was prepared to take that chance, but we were not. We, of course, are determined not to give that equality to Aborigines.

I have actively sought the opinions of local residents and have worked closely with the protest committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I myself am personally not convinced that the transport department has accurately defined the problem in the northern suburbs, let alone proposed a solution. The aim of the proposed motorway is supposedly to solve airport traffic problems. I do not believe this proposed motorway will do that at all. It will have a limited impact on existing north side traffic congestion and on congestion on Sandgate Road. It does not solve airport access problems, particularly those relating to Kingsford Smith Drive, the Gateway Arterial Road and the old airport site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chronic congestion on Sandgate Road is caused by commuting traffic entering and exiting the city from the north. The congestion on Nudgee Road is caused by northern industrial traffic and the congestion on Kingsford Smith Drive is caused by east-west industrial traffic. Most of the airport traffic actually comes from the south over the Gateway Bridge, from the north along Sandgate Road and Nudgee Road and from the west along Kingsford Smith Drive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Airports Corporation estimates that only 20 per cent of airport traffic goes to the airport from the city or from the western suburbs. That is 80 per cent of the traffic congestion in the area is to do with problems on the north side of town and will not be solved by a road from the city to the airport. </PARA>

The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bugle</EMPHASIS> recently issued a press release which purported to chronicle a conversation I had with a shopkeeper about this matter. This press release was inaccurate and was never checked with me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some concerns regarding the implementation of tax in this country and the costs that apply to small businesses. I often listen to government ministers talking about our levels of taxation compared with those of other countries. In some instances our taxes are on a par with those of other countries. But one of the major problems that small businesses have in this country is not the percentage of taxation, but the implementation of the tax and the costs of applying the tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One needs only to look at the legislation within the tax act, which is a pile about 2 1/2 feet deep when it is stacked on a desk, to see the problems. Most small businesses when they go along to their accountants these days find that the information they can obtain is insufficient to give them the confidence that they should be able to have when applying the tax in their particular business transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads to the tax agents going along to specialists in various fields to seek further advice, which is a cost to the business. These are all on-costs that apply and do not get taken into consideration by the government in the implementation of the tax. The fact of the matter is that in many areas the implementation of the tax is not understood by the department itself. In fact, many of the people that I have spoken to recently in my electorate still have the same problem with business transactions that I had. When they phone up or check with the department on the sales tax level on particular products, the figure that is given to them is different from the figure given to somebody else in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This might not sound significant&mdash;we could say that it may be an interpretation&mdash;but there are several cases where documentary evidence provided to one company concerning the sales tax that applies is different from documentary evidence provided to another company. This is a major factor to businesses because the business that has the lower rate of tax applied to it has a major advantage over a competitor with a higher level of tax. All of these considerations must be taken into account by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that, when the government talks about our levels of taxation compared with those of other countries, it looks at the technical presentation of the legislation as well as at the rate of tax. In most countries overseas the way it is presented is far simpler. Businesses understand the implementation and the costs associated with it. The difficulties for small businesses in this country, compared with larger businesses which can afford to have an accountant on staff who can work through some of the areas that are related to them, is that they must go outside to seek the assistance and help. As I said at the start, every time they do, that is an additional cost to that business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other significant area associated with this is the varying percentages that are offered&mdash;and we talked about it prior to the last election. All of that money in taxation at the retail level sits on the shop shelf. Every business that is buying products to put on the retail shop shelf is sitting government taxation there as a cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 15 to 20 per cent tax on the products sitting on the shop shelves is very significant to most retail businesses. There really is a need for the government to recognise this and to understand the problems that our small businesses have in comparison with their competitors overseas. I urge the government to look closely at this and to address some of those problems to give the necessary relief to these small businesses that are still suffering as a result of the recession we had to have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in this chamber members debated a private member's motion moved by the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and seconded, with pleasure, by me. The motion dealt with the price we gain when selling our coal and the commercial corruption that engulfs the coal industry today. Again today the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> carries an article that the General Manager of the South Bulli Colliery, Mitch Jakeman, has delivered a threat to the workers and the United Mineworkers Union, Southern District. The headline in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> is `Miners told: change or we'll close South Bulli'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The General Manager of South Bulli Colliery has issued a document to all employees and members of the CFMEU. He states in that document, which hangs from a corkboard at the mine, that business is suffering from uncooperative work practices. He gives the workers and the union which represents them a choice. Option one is to operate productively for the next four- or five-year period. Option two is to close the mine. This is industrial relations from the coal mine owners of 1994! No-one&mdash;from the workers to the union officials to me&mdash;wants to see South Bulli Colliery closed. Such a move would damage the Illawarra and place a great strain on the families of those workers who over the last decade have already undergone the strain of having to shoulder the burden of restructuring a vital industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise briefly some of the issues which go to the heart of the options, which have been presented like a line from a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Godfather</EMPHASIS> movie. South Bulli demands that flexible work practices occur, as happens in other mines. Flexible work practices are occurring. Flexibility is available to South Bulli under the work models of the industry, which is an agreed position between the coal owners and the unions. So out the window with that one!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Bulli refers to overtime restrictions. The pit already works seven hours, plus one hour per day overtime. There is a 14 hours per week limitation in the district. However, when South Bulli has requested that this limit be lifted, the union has agreed to raise the overtime limit to meet the requirements of South Bulli. So there is another one out the window. The other demand is quite interesting. The employees and the unions are asked to accept absentee management. This is a very interesting concept. South Bulli has an award provision to protect it. The union members have the same award protection. So there is another one out the window. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that really provokes the patience of the employees, the union officials and, indeed, me is that there must be a cooperative approach to problem solving. There is no greater joke than a cooperative approach to problem solving from this pit. We have seen the approach in the statements of the General Manager of South Bulli Colliery. He says, `You have two options: you can either do as we say or we will do the really brave thing and close down the pit.' This, like the acceptance of absentee management, must be a new concept. I think all members would agree that this is cooperative problem solving at its very best and that the creativity of the approach is breathtaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is plainly another trade union bashing exercise. Nevertheless, it has very serious overtones which cannot be ignored. South Bulli cannot be closed. The implications for the Illawarra and the families of those miners are too great. I call on the General Manager of South Bulli Colliery, Mitch Jakeman, to make good on his own demand for a cooperative approach to problem solving. It is no good making threats of closing down the mine. It is no good threatening the families of the miners, who do not need this additional worry. It is time the South Bulli Colliery management threw away those old-style industrial relations approaches. It is time for the management to be true to its own word and to be cooperative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sick of the attitude of the management. I am sick of the threats. I am sick of the attacks on the union, its members and officials. I am sick of hearing the yelps for a cooperative approach. I wonder how the miners from Sydney's North Shore, in the electorate of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), who spoke yesterday on the coal mining industry, would respond to these threats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mine workers are very interested in the approaches of the coal industry. They have just presented an exhaustive submission to the Australian Coal Industry Council covering a wide range of issues which will be important to the future of the industry and mines such as South Bulli. So the union, through its members and officials, has the runs on the board. The union always rises to the occasion; it has always done so and it always will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now the company's turn to show its concern for the industry by what happens in South Bulli. The essential point is that the company is alone in its union bashing exercise. The employees at the pit have today expressed renewed confidence in their union by an endorsement unanimously carried. This expression of confidence is totally contrary to what management has been saying. South Bulli's management can show its seriousness by withdrawing the threat of closure immediately and bringing its industrial relations policy into the 20th century. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a well-known fact that many students are financially better off in the short term if they enrol for unemployment benefits rather than Austudy. Most students will tell you life is easier on jobsearch; they are certainly paid more than they are on Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue has been staring the government in the face for some time, yet nothing has been done to redress it. For the most part, the rates of pay for Austudy and the jobsearch allowance are the same until the individual hits 21. Then an independent student on standard Austudy receives $241.50 a fortnight, while a person on jobsearch receives $294.10. The person on Austudy is obviously $52.60 worse off. It is even worse if the person receiving Austudy is living at home. The student can then receive $159.10 per fortnight while the same young person living at home on jobsearch receives $294.10. The Austudy student receives $135.00 less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When our students can receive more on the jobsearch allowance than on Austudy, what signals are we sending out? Study is difficult enough as it is, without considering the financial hardship it usually involves. It is a long-term commitment which increasingly involves leaving home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put ourselves in the shoes of a young person. We have several choices: look for work and receive the jobsearch allowance while we do or further our studies and apply for Austudy. If a person chooses to study and is lucky enough to be eligible for Austudy, he or she can look forward to an annual income of about $6,000 and another three to four years at college, university or TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After that three to four years of study he or she joins the job market competing with another two million other Australians who would like a job. On top of that, if the student finally gets a job, the government taxes him for his past studies in the form of the higher education contribution scheme. It is a long route to the top. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a country student the route can be even longer. In 1991, 21 per cent of higher education students were from rural or remote areas. A country student one is more likely to be living away from home, and this means paying rent or board. It also means buying food, organising transport, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While new courses are increasingly being offered in country areas&mdash;and I am proud to have the only regional campus of the University of South Australia in my electorate in Whyalla&mdash;many students are still forced to move to Adelaide to study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been several letters to the editor in my electorate recently outlining students' frustration with the current system. One of the letters was written by Joseph Hay, president of the student association in Whyalla. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should people studying to improve their career choices be subject to live below the poverty line where people waiting to get work on unemployment benefits get much more from the government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Handouts and charity are no way to get through life. Do we want to go back to the `50s, where only the rich could afford to study and people were forced to live with the fate dealt to them?</PARA>
<PARA>Another Whyalla student, Derek Taylor, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way students are treated by the Federal Government these days is a disgrace. The message comes through very strongly from the government that they want you out of the education system and on the dole.</PARA>
<PARA>Sadly, I must agree with his point. This government, over its 11 years in office, has expanded the welfare state and encouraged dependency on benefits. Michael Porter, Executive Director of the Tasman Institute said this earlier this year:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government seems to have given up on full employment and is focussing on welfare systems, welfare payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, I agree. Working Nation, devised by the government to address our fundamental problem of unemployment, was just a huge political and publicity exercise. It amended a few social security programs, making it easy for people receiving jobsearch to have part-time work, et cetera. However, it did not go to the crux of the matter. The federal government was too weak to take a cold, hard look at itself and address the fundamentals of its taxation or industrial relations systems to see what is really stalling jobs in this country. My final point is this: welfare payments do not create jobs, but encouraging people to study and contribute to the clever country just might. </PARA>

Colin Brown, or `Col' or `Brownie' as he was affectionately known, retired undefeated in March this year as mayor of Gladstone. His 15 years in the role were distinguished by unprecedented progress in the city he served and promoted with such commitment and enthusiasm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Toowoomba boy by birth, Col Brown was educated at St Laurence's college, South Brisbane. He married Carmel Macfarlane in 1953 and had three children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By a strange quirk of fate, his many successful occupations prepared him with unique attributes for the task ahead of him.

From there he moved to the publishing game and became an accomplished editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gladstone</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Observer</EMPHASIS>. Finally, prior to moving into almost full-time public life, he ran a successful boat and marine equipment business in the rapidly expanding port of Gladstone. Employees of that firm spoke of the marvellous relationship he had with his staff during that period and as friends for years after. So this rare blending of protocol, justice, due procedure, communications, public relations and an understanding of the local marine environment made him one of the state's best equipped mayors when he came to office, defeating the incumbent mayor in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There have been a number of phases in the development of Gladstone in its move from a seasonal meatworks town to a bustling, confident powerhouse of industry. This rapid expansion in just 30 years brought with it enormous problems and challenges. A crucial stage was reached in the late 1970s when infrastructure, social welfare and recreation services, to say nothing of image, had reached a crisis level. It was at that stage that Col Brown demonstrated that he was the right man for the right job at the right time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1982 he negotiated with the state government for a visionary $50 million infrastructure package, which provided a new hospital, high school, primary school and preschools, a state government building, sewerage and roads. But his major concern was that the city he loved should shrug off its down-market industrial image. He formed an image committee, which in mid-1983 became the Gladstone and District Development Promotion Bureau. It is now recognised as one of the state's most effective bodies. This, his own council's commitment and the motivation he imparted to community groups turned the image right around, not just in name but very much in deed, as those who have visited this beautiful city will readily attest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Care of people was another of his many attributes. This was reflected in years in Rotary and a sports foundation, and the development of a heated swimming pool and a transport-for-the-aged bus, in which he played major roles.

The flag, as many people would know, was the culmination of a worldwide competition for a flag to mark the unity of the Australian states under the name `Commonwealth of Australia'. It was selected from over 30,000 entries containing a vast range of designs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 3 September 1901 the designs were displayed in the Exhibition Building in Melbourne and five were selected as being of equal merit. On the day the winners were announced by the then Prime Minister, Edmund Barton, a large flag embodying the designs was flown on the Exhibition Building, Melbourne. Photographs of the day show it as having a design similar to that officially proclaimed later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1908 the government of the day decided that a seven-pointed star, symbolic of the six states plus the territories, should replace the large six-pointed star shown in the original design of the flag which previously represented the states. It also conformed with the star in the crest of the coat of arms granted that year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is evident that rational thought processes were put into place by the Australian people and government at that time to produce the present flag. The flag embodies the history of this country and is, as I mentioned before, so attractive and elegant that all Australians should be proud of it, and I am sure that the majority are. However, there are always exceptions, and unfortunately we have one notable exception in this case. I refer of course to Australia's Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who, since taking office, has spent a good deal of his time bagging the national flag and other symbols at home and, what is worse, abroad. His visits to Indonesia and France are the two most recent examples that spring to mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, along with many other Australians, find it curious to say the least, when I hear the Prime Minister verbally portray himself as such a great nationalist, that he is capable of displaying such disloyalty to his own country. One of the Prime Minister's objections to the national flag is that it has what he describes as a `foreign' flag in the corner. At the same time, he mouths phrases to the effect that Australia must be `independent'. This, too, is curious, considering that it was he, first as Treasurer and then as Prime Minister, who has been more responsible than any other single person for putting us into debt to foreign financial institutions to the tune of $161.5 billion&mdash;the figure released today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting that, during the time of the Labor government of the last 11 years, Australia has been a signatory to countless United Nations treaties which have effectively made Australians less independent than they have been at any time since Federation. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, after due consultations, you were strongly and reliably recommended to us by a friend of mine who is a president of Nigerian Chambers of Commerce. Although, we have never met or entered into any kind of transaction with you before as to know the extent of your honesty, but based on the recommendation, I personally want to believe that you are honest enough and you would not sit on the money if finally gotten into your account.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on. Mr Deputy Speaker, the man to whom this letter was written has received about three or four of them. I cannot work out whether it is $35 million or $35 billion being offered, but it is a lot of spondulicks. This man keeps on getting these letters. Some people are going to give him $50 million and some are going to give him $30 million, which are enormous amounts of money. I think that the people offering this money are actually quite serious because I know of other people who have received serious letters of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and final matter I would like to talk about is the home child-care allowance. I defy any member of this House to come in and look you, Mr Deputy Speaker, or me straight in the eye and say that we have not had any problems with it or had any inquiries from our constituents. Quite frankly, it is a classic case of governments going terribly wrong. They use election promises for their own good and then when it comes to the time for the allowance to be implemented, what do we see? Absolutely no planning at all. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a report in the `Herald-Sun' newspaper on the 27th of August, the Association said that families will be slugged with a hefty tax bill of $28 a week because of different rulings in the Social Security Act from those in the Taxation Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to continue the speech I was giving last night on the Perth Dental School, which to all intents and purposes is an absolute disgrace. I visited that school on 7 July and made an inspection of the accommodation and the condition of the building. I can tell the House that it was disgraceful. I mentioned last night that amongst the various things that I located were structural cracks in the dental library, which is the dental library for the state. It is so small that it is unsafe and is an embarrassment, and I imagine that occupational health and safety experts would have a field day in there. In fact, a cloakroom attached to it has been made into a storeroom to handle the overflow of books because the library is so small.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the main stairway serving the building, there is a broken handgrip. It is so badly broken that they are probably waiting for somebody to fall over because of it. One of the step grips on the steps is broken. There are white ants in the patients' area and white ants have completely eaten through the frame of the ground floor door to the building. The students' common room is an absolutely disgusting room. Rat droppings are continually found on furniture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hospital is supposed to be a referral centre for regional dental clinics. The students' prosthetics labs, where dentures and such are made, is like something out of Charles Dickens; and the operative technique labs where students have lectures have a capacity of only 32 students, which is just not enough for the number of people who want to use it. The postgraduate clinic, which is a very important place, as I mentioned earlier, where regional dental clinics refer patients, has an open fluorescent lighting system and rat droppings are often found on the dentist chairs or operating areas. This is, of course, not only unhygienic but a darn nuisance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday evening I mentioned the issues paper, the review of the dental school which had been circulated. Tonight I mention some of the responses to it. It has been put to me that any discerning reader would draw from the document&mdash;that is, the document that was circulated as part of the review process&mdash;the fact that it appears to have a fundamental lack of understanding of the factors dictating the circumstances in which the Perth Dental School now finds itself. There is no positive appraisal of the potential role which a dental school could play in a university and how a dental school could aid its parent university in its relationships with the community within which it exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there does not appear to be any noticeable appreciation of the tangible and fundamental changes which have occurred in this school. The dental school has left behind many of the philosophies which have plagued its relationships at all levels over so many years. In answer to the specific questions raised at the end of the discussion paper mentioned by me last night are the following responses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response No. 1, the projected population increase for Western Australia appears to have been underestimated in its terms of real growth. Use of population to dentist ratios appears to also underestimate the community need for dentists. Given these two facts and the revised demographic estimates for Western Australia, on the basis of the arguments raised in the recent review of dental therapy in this state, it would be reasonable to argue for an increase in the undergraduate quota of about five places. Interstate and overseas demand would appear to support an overall undergraduate commencing load approaching 50. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second response, as already stated, it would be feasible for an undergraduate intake of close to 50 to be achieved for the school. In accordance with what has happened in Britain and Sweden, geographical and political factors provide a rationale for the school remaining open, even at present undergraduate levels. The school could certainly offer a diploma style course if the staffing facilities were available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, close liaison with the Perth Dental Hospital would enable the school to use hospital facilities which are currently unavailable. These, plus modest additions to provide research and teaching facilities, would provide the capacity to house a greatly expanded school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other responses which time does not permit me to raise. But I would make one point: the national body which oversees dental school and university matters is a committee of deans. This body apparently recently wrote to the federal Minister for Human Services and Health, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), to request a meeting. I understand that request was refused. That body says that it met previously with her predecessor on a number of occasions. It meets only twice a year and its members wanted to discuss a review of the DEET funding model which evidently results in a direct relationship between university funding and research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The WA dental school is caught in a cleft stick. It has neither the staffing levels nor the facilities to undertake the sort of research which would gain it funding. For example, the school is down to a staff strength of nine full-time equivalents in part-time staff who together make up the equivalent of full-timers, where it should have 17 full-time staff. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994, which was debated this afternoon, there was an interjection from a very senior government minister. As I have not advised the minister that I would be speaking this evening, I will not name him. He indicated, when the first mention of amendments was made by the Leader of the Opposition, that they would not in any way be countenanced and that they would be refused.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite extraordinary that the minister concerned, who I suspect will be one of those with carriage of this matter, was able to say, before he even saw these amendments, having just heard of them, that they would be knocked back by the government. This is an extremely sensitive issue. It deserves a bipartisan approach that goes way above that sort of comment. He should not under any circumstances have said that the government would not be looking at those amendments. He should have said that they would be viewed, reviewed and discussed with the shadow minister involved, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), and then a decision made by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is serious about this matter being bipartisan, if it would like us to participate in the debate, that is not a good start.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is pursuing a range of policies aimed at increasing employment and investment, including at the local level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, the Government has put in place macroeconomic policies conducive to sustaining strong, low inflation growth over a period of years, recognising that such growth represents the most effective means of reducing unemployment. The success of these policies is demonstrated by the fact that the Australian economy is one of the fastest growing in the OECD, employment (seasonally adjusted) has increased by 376,000 since the trough in employment in April 1993 and the unemployment rate has fallen to 9.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the microeconomic level the Government has implemented a broad ranging program of reform over a number of years to improve the performance and flexibility of the Australian economy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centrepiece of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> is a far reaching set of measures to directly assist the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, to regain employment.
