<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the information of honourable members, I present a report of an inspection of electronic voting equipment used in the parliaments of Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the United States of America and in the European parliament building in Brussels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the spirit of parliamentary reform, which we all seem to be embracing at present, this report is something of a landmark. The visit to which the report refers was undertaken with the agreement of the prime ministers of the countries which have a history of electronic voting. Sweden first installed a system in 1932 while Finland installed a system in 1951. Both systems have been upgraded. The other countries visited were Denmark and Belgium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report summarises the technical aspects of the equipment used. A full description is held within the Parliamentary Information Systems Office. One of the major points made in the report is that none of the parliamentary presiding officers or officials seen by the team expressed any reservations whatsoever about the appropriateness or efficiency of the equipment used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report canvasses the advantages and disadvantages of electronic voting. The advantages were seen as a saving in the time of the House and its members; the immediate availability of the complete details of a division in both electronic and hard copy; the ability to show on an electronic display panel the question or matter before the House; and electronic recording of votes results, which leads to more statistical information being available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The perceived disadvantages were the loss of an opportunity for a pause or cooling-off period while divisions are being held; the possibility of a member voting for an absent colleague&mdash;of course that would never happen here&mdash;the lack of a visual indication as to how a member votes; the possibility of additional divisions being called; and the significant cost involved. These concerns have been addressed in the report and I believe largely dispelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mission considered that a system could be built that meets the needs of the House. While it would not be appropriate to estimate the costs on the House of Representatives chamber, a broad indication of the cost estimates are of the order of $3 million spent over a three-year period for both the House of Representatives and the Senate chambers. If electronic voting is installed only in the House of Representatives chamber, the costs would be around two-thirds of the equipment costs and one-third of the installation and maintenance costs of $300,000 per annum over three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major benefit would be a saving in the time of members of the House of approximately nine hours per annum. The equivalent is almost equal to one full day's sitting. There would also be other advantages in the more timely availability of information. The report recommends that the government, opposition and other non-government members confer to seek in-principle agreement to the installation of electronic voting equipment and that officers of the parliament undertake the detailed planning for such a system which would be based on a personal identification card for each member. This system would require that members vote in the House itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was recently suggested that modern parliaments deserve to have modern management systems. Electronic voting is such a system. It would not only save the time of the House and its members but also improve the recording of the activities of the House and of the way in which visitors to the House can be informed of the activities of the House itself. I commend the report to all members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the absence of my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and before the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) moves to take note of the paper, there are several aspects to electronic voting that I wish to refer to. Mr Speaker, I heard no reference to costs or time of installation in your statement. Could those aspects be brought to the attention of the parliament so we know what processes are involved, how much delay would be involved in its introduction and what the costs would be?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The broad indication that we have been able to ascertain is a cost, over a three-year period, of about $3 million for the installation of electronic voting equipment in both chambers. Again over a three-year period, the maintenance and installation costs would be approximately $300,000, which would be absorbed as part of that process. In terms of how quickly something like this could be developed, as I have indicated and as is indicated in the recommendations contained in the report, we would hope to get an in-principle decision in support of this from all members of the parliament. The Sound and Vision Office and the Parliamentary Information Systems Office would be asked then to do a full and detailed costing of the proposal, which would be given to government for consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will not oppose these appropriation bills which are supplements to the government's main budget bills. The three appropriation bills before the House provide additional appropriations of $710 million which are partially offset by savings of $545.5 million from appropriation acts Nos. 1 and 2. The current bills therefore represent a net increase in expenditure of around $164.5 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I would like to concentrate on the government's performance on the expenditure front, its inability to rein in the budget deficit, and its negligence in dealing with Australia's dangerously low level of national savings and resultant foreign debt crisis. Australia is sinking into a morass of foreign debt. This has not stopped the national Left declaring war on the government over the weekend, demanding higher expenditure and putting in a new ambit claim for new tax spend policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national Left, in complete defiance not only by the backbench members and trade union members of the national Left faction within the Australian Labor Party but also, apparently, with the concurrence of senior ministers in that faction, put out a statement over the weekend putting in new proposals for tax spend policies, essentially to bring the efforts of the government to a higher plane, as it were, and in a vote of no-confidence in relation to the current administration by the right wing faction of the Labor Party represented by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are beginning to see the deep divisions in the Labor Party over policy come to the fore not only in relation to the budget but also in relation to the proposed industry statement which will be developed over the next couple of months. Deep divisions are emerging within the Labor Party over the role that the government should play in industry policy. The Left clearly wants the government to take an active role in picking winners and then tailoring policy to help those particular winners and, clearly, it wants the government to assume a much greater and much more dramatic involvement in relation to the economy and essentially to begin directing investment through tax breaks, depreciation rates and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the Labor Party have no shame? Senator Cook says that the days of handouts to industry and of picking winners are over. Even the committee on employment opportunities which wrote the green paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Restoring full employment</EMPHASIS> said in relation to industry policy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . programs should generally be generic in nature rather than industry specific.</PARA>
<PARA>The example set by the former minister for industry in picking personal winners should have been enough to deter and warn of the dangers involved in such a policy. Yet we see significant sections of the Labor Party operating on the motto: fingers burnt, lessons unlearnt&mdash;let us return to the policy of getting government ministers to pick those winners in private industry so that the government can ensure that funds and its policy of investment and the like is directed to them. Meanwhile, the national Left is digging in and preparing for a siege over the jobs levy. The Minister for Finance was saying on Sunday morning that a proposal for a jobs levy was located on the edge of a cabinet table, clearly implying that it was about to be pushed off the cabinet table and into the wastepaper bin. But by Sunday afternoon, the national Left, apparently with the concurrence of senior figures such as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), indicated that it still was committed to a jobs levy, wanted more taxes on business and a new 60 per cent marginal tax rate in order to fund $3 billion in its tax and spend bid. Those initiatives would do nothing to improve national savings or improve the lot of Australians, especially the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prospects of a sustained economic recovery is heavily dependent on Australia's ability to lift its critically low stock of national savings. Without a rise in national savings, Australia faces the prospect of another boom-bust cycle. What is even worse is that the government has had plenty of warning of this impending problem. The government itself commissioned a report, known now as the FitzGerald report because it was produced under the chairmanship of Dr Vince FitzGerald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 2 April last year former Treasurer Dawkins announced that he had commissioned a report to be prepared by Dr FitzGerald on the major factors impinging on both private and public sector saving and the issues that needed to be addressed in lifting Australia's savings performance. On 29 June last year, Dr FitzGerald delivered that report on national savings to the Treasurer. Unfortunately, the government has taken no substantial interest in it apart from using it as a cover, an excuse, to implement a whole raft of tax increases in last year's budget, which it never had the decency to explain to the Australian people before the election and which it magically popped out of its conjurer's hat after the March 1993 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the last election, of course, the government's position was: we will announce our tax policy after the election. It essentially went into that election with no tax policy or, rather, a hidden tax policy&mdash;a tax policy to increase wholesale sales tax, wine tax and the like, after the mug punters had cast their votes in the election ballot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we saw on budget night the FitzGerald report, which was a serious report and a serious attempt to address a very important issue in this country, namely the level of national savings, just became a smokescreen, an excuse to try to justify a government which had not been open and frank with the Australian people and which had gone into the last election with a deceptive position in relation to its tax policy. What did the report say? The report found that national savings had fallen to critically low levels. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our underlying structural rate of national saving has fallen to around 18 per cent of GDP, 5 percentage points of GDP below the average of the past three decades.</PARA>
<PARA>Who did the FitzGerald report find is the chief villain in the erosion of Australia's national savings? It pointed the figure firmly at the Commonwealth government and it pronounced it guilty. The report states further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main contributor to our long term decline in national saving is a decline in public sector saving.</PARA>
<PARA>What did the FitzGerald report recommend to address Australia's savings decline? It recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth should seek to return its general government overall deficit to persistent surplus.</PARA>
<PARA>What was the government's original response in the budget to this report? Its immediate response to a report, which it had commissioned and which had said that the government should be returning its position to persistent surplus, was to go ahead and increase the budget deficit&mdash;to take the budget deficit from an outcome of $14.6 billion to $16 billion. After the FitzGerald report on national savings had come in saying, `Listen, you had better start heading south', the government headed north. It took a long journey south via a northward direction. It had almost a plea from the FitzGerald report for a commitment to start decreasing its budget deficit, but the government turned out to be moving in precisely the opposite direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government found itself in a difficult position. It also proposed to increase taxes, the secret taxes that it did not tell the people of Australia about before the election: the taxes related to petrol and wine; the wholesale sales tax; and the tax on accrued but untaken annual leave and long service leave. The logic of raising taxes to solve Australia's national savings problem does not bear scrutiny, because merely raising taxes has only the effect of reducing private sector savings, which are also part of the national savings equation. There is only one way to raise savings; widen the gap between income and consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine the commitments given by this government in relation to its quest to rein in the budget deficit. In the One Nation statement the government had said that the budget would be back in surplus by 1995-96, even though it was committed to promising $8.6 billion in personal income tax cuts. The One Nation statement, as honourable members will recall, was supposed to introduce into the Australian economy the prospect that we become gang busters; that the Australian economy had taken off in such a way that the Prime Minister could give $8.6 billion worth of tax cuts and still get the Commonwealth account back into surplus by 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the One Nation statement did not last very long because even prior to the March 1993 federal election the government's commitment had slipped. Now the target was for a budget deficit of between 0.5 and one per cent of GDP by 1995-96. Then came the election campaign. The government commitment to reducing the size of the deficit slipped even further. The target became a budget deficit of one per cent by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that election campaign, when the Prime Minister was being asked about his income tax cuts and how they fitted with prospects to reduce the government's budget deficit, who will ever forget the famous words at the National Press Club?  The Prime Minister said, `Look, I am not just promising income tax cuts. It is not a promise. It is l-a-w&mdash;law. I have put it into the statute. So do not come down here and ask me whether I am going to deliver. I have already delivered. It is l-a-w'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course he was probably misspelling law, and what he meant was l-o-r-e. That is probably what he had in mind when he was down at the press club talking about his income tax cuts and how they fitted with his proposals in relation to the budget deficit. On 21 July the then Treasurer took the rap for the deception that had been made to the Australian people before the last election. He announced that the promised tax cuts were under review. The next day the Prime Minister announced the indefinite deferral of the second round of the promised tax cuts. If this government could not deliver a tax cut which it said was law between March 1993 and the budget of 1993, who would ever believe that there is any prospect that it will deliver on those income tax cuts down the line?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia were promised&mdash;not just promised but delivered&mdash;an l-a-w income tax cut prior to the election, which disappeared by the August budget. The government came around and said, `Look, we're sorry, we cannot deliver on those but we might do in four or five years time'&mdash;in other words, `We can't keep our promise over four or five months, so why don't you trust us to keep our promise over four or five years?'. One would have to be as incredulous as some of the Labor backbenchers, who actually believe that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) was doling out sports rorts grants on the basis of need, to believe that. We might as well face the fact: those income tax cuts have gone. This government has conveniently pushed them out beyond the next election, so it cannot even be held to account in the next election for those broken promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget, the budget deficit target began sliding even further. The budget deficit reduction strategy had blown out again. In the budget brought down on 17 August the government's deficit reduction target had slipped this time to 1.1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. In the aftermath of the budget, in the government's wheeling and dealing with the Australian Democrats and the Greens to get the budget through, the deficit reduction target slipped even further; now it had become 1.2 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. In the space of 18 months the government's deficit reduction target had blown out four times, even after the government had ditched over $5 billion worth of tax cuts. If we were making forecasts like this in a prospectus trying to raise money from the Australian investing public, the Australian Securities Commission would be down there having a look at us&mdash;</PARA>

What if Mr Skase said to him, `Look, I do my accounting on a whiteboard and then it is rubbed out? Does he think that would be accepted in the Federal Court? Why should we accept it from a federal minister? Why should there be one standard for the private sector and another for the government sector?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is always the approach of this government&mdash;one rule for everybody else and one rule for us. Thousands of small business people out there want to know why they have to keep all their records when the government does not keep its. Thousands of people out there are being held personally liable for prospectuses, for companies that are making trading forecasts, and they want to know why the government is never held to account and liable for its forecasts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw the budget deficit reduction target blow out over four times. We come to the critical question: why is it absolutely essential to begin to make inroads into the budget deficit and lift the insatiable demands on national savings by the public sector? The answer to this question also lies in the FitzGerald report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot, on a sustainable basis, continue to finance the investment we need to grow over the 1990s, and into the new century, by going progressively further into foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA>The report said in no uncertain terms that Australia cannot continue to increase foreign borrowings indefinitely. It warned of the dire consequences which would face future Australians if we do not mend our profligate ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FitzGerald report said that our overall level of foreign debt is already very high and that foreign financiers are building premiums into the terms on which they are prepared to finance us. What does that mean? It means that we are required by overseas lenders to pay higher rates of interest on our loans in order to compensate them for the risks associated with Australia's high level of external indebtedness, and it will become more and more expensive for Australians to get funds from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A high level of foreign debt also makes Australia more vulnerable and increasingly at the mercy of international financial markets. As the FitzGerald report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a high level of debt makes us increasingly exposed to changes in commodity prices, investor sentiment or other external shocks</PARA>
<PARA>In short, Australia is mortgaging its prospects of future wealth and prosperity on a mounting foreign debt. With every extra dollar of foreign debt which accumulates, the economic sovereignty, the ability of Australians to choose freely and openly from every possible alternative which is before them, is diminished just that little bit more. But do not just take my word for it. Dwell for a moment on the words of the Prime Minister when he was Treasurer in his May 1987 ministerial statement. He boasted that the budget was on the verge of a return to a surplus and he said that we were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . on the verge of freeing ourselves and our young people from the dictates of international financial markets.</PARA>
<PARA>He said the government was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . clawing back Australia's financial independence. But to see this process through we cannot relax for a moment. To do so would risk slipping back down the slope of international indebtedness.</PARA>
<PARA>That was at a time when net foreign debt was around $86 billion and now it is $178 billion. I am glad we did not slip back down the slope! We catapulted back down the slope, in terms of foreign indebtedness. At a time when the Prime Minister was saying to the Australian people, `Look, we are going to free ourselves from the dictates of the international financial markets', we were only down by about $86 billion. By the time he had finished the freeing process we were down for $178 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the way he was actually managing the economy. This was the world's greatest Treasurer. This is the man who said, `I ought to be given the Legion of Honour for all of my efforts, and I am going to free you from the dictates of the international financial markets by doubling the net foreign debt'. What an absurd performance. What a pathetic performance. At the end of the September quarter of 1993 Australia's net foreign debt stood at $178 billion. This is the burden which the fledgling economic recovery has to carry on its back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 February in this House during question time the Treasurer pronounced the recession was finally over and that happy days were here again. He released revised economic forecasts for the 1993-1994 financial year. But the storm clouds descended the very next day with the release of the December balance of payment figures which saw a blow-out in the current account deficit to $1.765 billion. FitzGerald warned the government over its management of the economic recovery. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot, and should not, as a nation expect to finance future growth on our economy by going substantially further into debt to foreigners. The extent to which we can grow over the mid and late 1990s and beyond will depend on how much we can lift domestic savings.</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer has been recently paying lip-service to the need for the government to more aggressively rein in the Commonwealth deficit. But with all the big budget ticket items that the government is mulling over in the preparation for its budget, with all the ambit claims that are being put in by the national Left, with all the claims to try to deliver on pork-barrel promises to get themselves back there at the March 1993 election, I suspect that the Treasurer is in a good deal of trouble. The Treasurer has to placate and allay the fears of the financial markets, but more than that, he has to deliver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government was truly committed to solving the unemployment crisis and helping people find jobs it would, for a start, jettison one of the major structural impediments in the labour market in this country&mdash;a complex, clumsy, highly legalistic, union controlled system of industrial relations which is not designed to allow people to work on the best terms and conditions and in the best and most productive way for their own benefit and their own wages, and the benefit of the companies and corporations that they work for. If the government was truly committed to solving the unemployment crisis it would not be spending more money on shuffling unemployment queues&mdash;on those labour market programs that do not work, and merely rearrange the queue of one million unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do not get pious about unemployment in this country. You created it. In 1981 after the metalworkers had their sustained pay campaign, the present Prime Minister was barrelling metal industry leaders for the unemployment that they had caused. Those opposite will remember his graphic phrase, `You've got 100,000 dead men hanging off your belt'. This government has one million dead men and women hanging off its belt. It deliberately induced a recession in this country and put people out of work. It went about creating the recession we had to have. The Prime Minister himself said that it was the recession we had to have. I do not know why those opposite dispute it. What a great success he was. He set out to give us a recession and he succeeded.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government were truly worried about this country's unemployed and if it were concerned to do something for its victims&mdash;the victims of the Keating Labor government&mdash;it would set about building the foundation of a sustained economic recovery, turning its deficit to surplus, raising Australia's critically low level of national savings. We have a government which is threatening the prospect of a sustained economic recovery through its fiscal negligence and its misguided belief that any problem can be solved by throwing money at it. That will not prove to be what is necessary to give the unemployed real jobs in real corporations with real careers in the way that they want. Real jobs in real corporations doing real things for real wages come as a result of an economic recovery built on the back of business investment and, most particularly in relation to this speech, business investment that is financed out of Australia's savings and which does not take its toll in relation to foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With international interest rates still at low levels, the burden of servicing Australia's massive foreign debt has taken on a deceptive lightness. As the world economy picks up and the European and Japanese economies become more buoyant, there is a risk that international interest rates will rise as investors start to compete for funds. If international rates start to climb, the full magnitude of servicing Australia's massive foreign debt will begin to show in the burgeoning monthly current account deficit figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently there has been a lot of comment that the missing ingredient in the economic recovery has been business investment. I raise the question: what is going to happen to Australia's foreign debt and the balance on the current account when business investment begins to pick up further? Where is business going to find funds to finance new investment? The shortfall in national savings forces the private sector to look offshore and to rely on the savings of foreigners to fund investment. The continued shortfall between the amount of national savings and investment means that our  reliance upon the savings of foreigners will continue and our excessive stock of foreign liabilities will get worse, increasing both the cost of funding and the nation's exposure to external shocks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the question of why the Prime Minister deliberately engineered the recession of 1991-92. It was originally going to be a soft landing but it turned into the recession which Australia had to have. The rationale behind the government's scorched earth monetary policy in the late 1980s and early 1990s was to rein in Australia's current account deficit and the massive build-up in foreign debt. However, the scorched earth monetary policy of high interest rates sent the economy crashing into recession but has failed to address the underlying problem of the current account deficit. The real solution to the current account deficit problem was, and still is, to increase national savings. The greatest contribution which the government can make is to do something to get its budgetary position back into surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fascinating aspect of this savings problem has been the Commonwealth's rhetoric directed against the states. In a press release on 27 June last year the then Treasurer started sermonising and hectoring the states about the need to increase national savings. He claimed that the Commonwealth had a track record of fiscal discipline and would play its part and that the onus was on the states to play their role. In an ultimate piece of hypocrisy he said, `This may require state politicians to take hard decisions but the nation as a whole needs the states to improve their fiscal performance'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dawkins had some charts to try to back up his claim that the Commonwealth had been more effective than the states in restraining the growth in outlays. But those charts were nothing more than an elaborate exercise in conjuring. They contained no data, omitted important social security and welfare expenditure and could be described as an elaborate statistical construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that a substantial amount of the fiscal restraint that has been achieved by the Commonwealth over the course of the last decade has come as a result of the Commonwealth squeezing the states. It has been a case of the Commonwealth government saying to the states, `Do not do as I do, but do as I say. We will not be setting the example here, but we will be making you carry the can'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only say that it is a very lucky break for this Commonwealth government that we now have Liberal administrations in states such as Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. It is a very lucky break for the government, because those states have had the decency to try to address the things that this government never could and never would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government continues to spend without applying to itself the standards it demands of others. It is a credit junkie in search of a continuous fix. It ignores the warnings of Dr FitzGerald in relation to savings. The future economic prosperity of this nation depends on this government coming to terms with the FitzGerald report, getting the budget back into surplus and lifting the stock of national savings. The tragedy is that this is a government that plainly has no idea and does not have the commitment to see that task through.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting when we talk about the Appropriation Bill to see where the opposition stands on these questions. As the honourable member for Higgins walks out the door, I ask: what is the policy of the opposition at the moment on any fiscal matter? Let us see what the opposition has had to say about fiscal policy recently. I would like to look at what the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has had to say. On 30 November 1993 on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> Kerry O'Brien asked him whether it was the case that he was still committed to the basic sense and direction of Fightback. When asked whether he was still committed to the broad approach, the Leader of the Opposition stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the broad approach is pretty much the same in terms of the principles.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Liberal Party is still, in broad terms, committed to Fightback. But, when it comes into this House and starts talking about taxation, do we hear anything about a GST, the great monster it still has hidden in its cupboard, which I am sure it will bring out after the next election if it is successful in being elected to the treasury bench? The Liberal Party has no other taxation policy apart from its commitment to a GST. Kerry O'Brien went on to question the Leader of the Opposition. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You weren't always quite so coy about this spectrum question. In 1986, you told writer, Craig McGregor: `I'm clearly on the right of the Liberal Party; I'm a pragmatic dry I like competition'.</PARA>
<PARA>There is plenty of competition at the moment in the Liberal Party. There is no doubt about that. The Leader of the Opposition is true to form&mdash;he is certainly a dry&mdash;promoting competition on his 56-strong front bench. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's nothing like putting yourself on the line.</PARA>
<PARA>Kerry O'Brien asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But you haven't changed philosophically?</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No. The basic direction's the same, although I think, having reflected on it, words like right and dry don't mean all that much now.</PARA>
<PARA>That is pretty right, because everybody coming in to the front bench of the Liberal Party is all right and all dry. They have at least that in common with the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>Kerry O'Brien said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But when you say that the principles and the directions of Fightback still prevail, what are the principles and directions of Fightback that still prevail?</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, we still stand by the need to cut government expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>Kerry O'Brien asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Massively?</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well massively is your word.</PARA>
<PARA>Kerry O'Brien said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, ten billion over three years was Fightback.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well obviously we're reviewing a lot of those cuts . . . But let's understand it. The issue was a smaller more efficient and more responsive public sector. Yes, we stand by that . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is, `We stand by the Fightback cuts and we stand by the GST that funded all of the other policies in Fightback'. So what we have is a Liberal Party which has been overtaken by professed populists, particularly down there on the Palm Beach peninsula&mdash;Bronny's peninsula&mdash;where they are all hard and dry. They are all running around the place pretending to be warm and caring but underneath they are still committed to the principles of Fightback, still committed to cutting public expenditure by $10 billion or $20 billion, and still committed to massive hikes in indirect taxation. What did we get from the Leader of the Opposition following the election, when he dumped the GST? On ABC radio on 20 April 1993, he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No I wasn't rolled on the GST . . . I think probably in the Party Room more people spoke in favour of keeping it . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Than opposed it, that is. So the majority of members on the opposition benches&mdash;those who are game to admit what they stand for&mdash;are still supporting the GST. Of course, the Liberal candidate in the recent Werriwa by-election made no bones about his support for the GST because that is where the rank and file of the Liberal Party is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frequently in this House we have the opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), advocating Asian levels of taxation and expenditure. Of course, what Asian levels of taxation and expenditure mean in Australia are cuts to revenue, as the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has said on many occasions, to the tune of $10 billion to $20 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What programs will the opposition cut if we are to have Asian levels of revenue implemented in this country, as its Treasury spokesman frequently advocates in this House? Are we going to knock out aged pensions altogether? That is about $8 billion a year. We know that those opposite oppose all of the labour market programs, so they might pick up around a billion there. It probably means they want to oppose family allowance and family income supplements. In the absence of any other policy pronouncements from the opposition, and given the statements of the temporary Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth, we can only conclude that they still stand for all of those principles put forward in Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons we as the government have so many problems in trying to attack those opposite as to what they stand for in terms of policy is that we cannot find any current pronouncements because they are too busy fighting each other over the leadership. An example is what the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) had to say on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> on 14 February. The reporter asked him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How damaging is the leadership issue in terms of the Party being able to move forward in 1994?</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for La Trobe said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well it's horribly damaging because no one seems to take us seriously.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course they do not take you seriously. We cannot take you seriously in this House. The honourable member went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And with respect, it's difficult to take us seriously if we do not speak as one on issues, and if we've got no sense of where we are or where we're going or where we want to take the country.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And with respect, it's difficult to take us seriously if we do not speak as one on issues, and if we've got no sense of where we are or where we're going or where we want to take the country.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the policy position of the Liberal Party in this House. How could anybody take the Liberal Party seriously? The opposition has 56 members in its executive when it adds in its whips and parliamentary secretaries. Every child player wins a prize in the Liberal Party. The opposition front bench is sardine city. You cannot fit in. You are all squashed up on the front bench all busily jockeying for positions on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> and all the other programs in the country trying to see who is going to be the most humble, popular, warm, caring politician in the Liberal Party who can take over the leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had Alexander Downer on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>. Mr Downer, the honourable member for Mayo, was with his Victa on a Saturday afternoon genuinely mowing his 3,000 acres. He was very humble, very warm and very caring. But what has Mr Downer had to say about Fightback? What has he had to say about a GST? Of course, he was one of the foremost exponents of that policy. Now we have two new candidates endorsed in the lower House who are all pretending to be warm, cuddly and caring, but underneath are really representing the hard right edge of Reagan and Thatcher. That cannot be hidden from the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have endorsed a candidate in the electorate of Warringah. He believes that he is somehow a direct descendant of Queen Victoria and seriously puts forward the proposition that Australia should not have an Australian head of state. Who really believes that in Australia anymore?  If that is the future direction of the Liberal Party, that is a very bizarre way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not really matter which faction of the Liberal Party we are dealing with. There is Alexander Downer mowing his 3,000 acres with his little Victa on a Saturday afternoon. There is Tony Abbott, who thinks renters are inferior people. He was a central designer of and propagandist for Fightback. There is Amanda Vanstone, who runs around the place saying that policy development in the Liberal Party should be a bit like a bus&mdash;people should just know the general direction; they should not worry about whether they have brakes or seats. When we have those sorts of contributions from prominent people in the Liberal Party who are touted as having leadership potential, is it any wonder that we on this side of the House simply sit here and say, `If we cannot work out what you are saying about current issues, then you must really believe in Fightback and you must still really be committed to all of those principles put forward in Fightback.'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we get down to it&mdash;whether you are talking about industrial relations, or debating economics, or talking about the home child-care allowance, or talking about the child-care rebates&mdash;there is only one central policy that you believe in: lower wages and higher indirect taxes. For average people in this country that means lower living standards. That is ultimately where you are. Through all your policies, you want to engineer a redistribution of wealth in this country from the bottom and the middle to the top. That was what Fightback was all about. If you want to have a debate about the equity of what this government has done in tax, we are quite happy to do so. You have only one taxation policy: to support the GST. When this government brought in its tax cuts for lower and middle income earners, dropping the marginal rate for those people earning between $20,000 and $38,000 from 38c in the dollar to 34c in the dollar, what did we get out of you? You stood around the Senate and said that you were going to block the tax cuts. You were going to take the money out of the hands of average wage and salary earners. When we brought in a deficit reduction strategy, what did you do? You opposed it. Today you come into this House and pretend that you have some sort of policy framework to increase national savings and to get rid of the deficit. It is a joke. The only policy that you have is a $23 billion GST Fightback tax policy to tax the living hell out of every ordinary person in this country and skew the distribution of wealth up the scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to move on from the poverty of the policy position of the Liberal and National parties and talk about some substantial issues. One thing that this government is doing is addressing the substantial issues. We are addressing the substantial issues this year in the context of the white paper on employment opportunities. I think this appropriation bill provides the opportunity to talk about the challenges in the year ahead; the sorts of challenges which go to the heart of what sort of society we are and what we want to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jobs, living standards and family relationships are central to where this nation is going. Underlying these issues and policy responses are key questions about economic values and social values. How many jobs do we require in this country? How do we create them? Who will be the beneficiaries? How do we support our families? How can government policies assist families? How can we, as a community, live together safely and with respect and care for others? They are the key value questions which go to the heart of the government's policy response through the white paper and through programs such as Medicare, the home child-care allowance, the family allowance, the additional family allowance and so on. That is where those opposite are so derelict in their duty&mdash;they have no policy alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussing these challenges that we face in the year ahead, I briefly refer to a speech that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gave on Australia Day. He made the very important point that this economic recovery must be a recovery for all of us&mdash;not for some and not others. It is a key point which I believe those opposite will not address at all. They only have one solution for the problems of long-term unemployment and that is to abolish all labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has a realistic approach to the problems of unemployment and employment opportunities through its policy of growth plus&mdash;get the economy growing as strongly and as quickly as possible but recognise that the beneficiaries of that growth will not necessarily be the long-term unemployed. The jobs created through that growth will go primarily to new entrants to the labour market and others who are re-entering the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what will we, as a community, do for those people who, through no fault of their own, will not be the beneficiaries of sustained growth, who will not obtain the jobs that come with that growth and who, unless there is strong intervention from the government, will remain on unemployment benefits permanently? Are we, as a nation, so rich and vigorous that we cannot or should not devise policies for those people? What do we get from opposition members and their ideologues in some of the employer organisations around the place when this government's green paper talks about a policy of growth plus and of job compacts? We get harangued with rhetoric from the likes of Mr Ian Spicer and those opposite on the front bench, particularly the honourable member for Higgins, who today suggested that the sorts of proposals put forward in the jobs compact are simply make work schemes. They are not make work schemes; they offer real work, real experience and real jobs for Australians who would otherwise remain permanently unemployed and form a part of an underclass that this country cannot afford, socially or economically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We stand here as a government absolutely committed to significant initiatives in that area, determined to do something not only about growth and jobs through exports and so on but also about those people who cannot benefit in it. We want to share the growth and wealth in this country with these people. There is no concept of that from those opposite in any of their pronouncements. There has been no recognition from them that we as a nation&mdash;as the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said some time ago&mdash;are now in the best position that we have been in for 30 years in terms of generating growth, the best conjuncture of economic circumstances that we have seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a strong recovery and low inflation, which, if we get the settings right, give us the potential to make this recovery enduring, sustainable, and one which we can share with all of the community. But what do we get from those opposite and some of the ideologues in the employer organisations? As the recovery generates strength, which is then demonstrated in all of the figures, they get up and say, `No, we can't do anything for the long-term unemployed. We can't have the jobs compact. We can't have any of that. That is just wasting money'. I assure those opposite that there is an absolute determination to move forward and to do something for those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the House, we are committed to doing something for the long-term unemployed through the jobs compact and through labour market programs, which are absolutely essential to the long-term economic health as well as the social cohesiveness of this country. What is ignored by the ideologues and the economic fundamentalists opposite and those in employer organisations is that it is in the economic interests of the government to intervene through labour market programs to provide work experience and placements for the long-term unemployed. If we don't intervene it will lead not only to a very inefficient labour market but also, if not dealt with, to excessive wage inflation, because the simultaneous coincidence of high unemployment and scarcity of available vacancies could occur simply because there could be a complete mismatch between the vacancies that are emerging and those people that are available to fill them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For reasons of economic efficiency, there is a very powerful case for the jobs compact. But the case is made even more powerful for reasons of social cohesiveness. Those opposite come into this House and talk about values. There is one value held dear by all Australians: looking after mates&mdash;putting a helping arm around those less fortunate than themselves and helping those who are innocent victims of economic restructuring. For those opposite to maintain that there should be no special intervention for these people, and to then talk about values and to complain about rising crime rates and so on, simply exposes how uncaring and hypocritical the opposition really is. A recent report from the Australian Institute of Criminology makes the very obvious link between lack of necessary interventions in this area and the development of a US style underclass and rising rates of crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very valid reason for the opposition to support this appropriation bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the honourable member for Lilley and those on his side of the chamber are embarrassed about the levels of unemployment in this country and, on top of that, the levels of underemployment, which probably double the formal figure of nearly one million unemployed in this country. He says his government stands for employment and stands to remedy long-term unemployment. Well, it has been in office for about 11 years. God help us if government members did not stand for employment. All they have managed to do is give this country a legacy of something approaching two million people unemployed and also underemployed because some people simply do not choose to seek work given the hopelessness of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills set out to augment the budget which was brought down in August last year. The 1993-94 budget has really failed to give hope to those people who are currently suffering in the aftermath of the greatest economic recession in Australia since the 1930s. This was a recession presided over by the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and was a recession&mdash;as we all know&mdash;that the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, insisted we had to have.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members talk of solving the unemployment problem but the figures stand there for everyone to read. They talk about the problem but they have not come to grips with it, and the prospects of them doing so in the foreseeable future are very bleak indeed. Job and training levies, higher personal taxation and a set minimum corporate tax rate are about all this government has to offer. That is all we are hearing in the run up to the next budget, which we understand is to be brought down in May.

Until I do, I am not going to be influenced&mdash;and I hope other people will not be influenced&mdash;by this claptrap that government members go on with about coalition policies when they do not have any written policies to put before the public of Australia. The honourable member for Lilley was trying to convince us that the budget represented policy. That is not a Labor Party policy; that is something produced within the shadow cabinet. It has no relevance to Labor Party policy. It is presented as a fait accompli. </PARA>

On this point I would imagine all of us in this place surely agree. Where we differ is the means by which to remedy the problem. Talk of Labor's social conscience is diversionary and deliberately intended to ignore the coalitions's appreciation of the real problem at hand. The coalition's sentiments need to be matched by the government. That involves a determination to follow a policy line which at times may be painful but will solve the unemployment problem in the medium term, and there is no sign of that. </PARA>

Investment as a percentage of gross domestic product is at its lowest level in 40 years. Of this, investment in plant and equipment is at a postwar low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs a massive injection of investment in productive assets if the recovery is to be sustainable and real jobs are to be created. The public sector, comprised of federal, state and local governments, has been cutting back on its contributions to overall investment. The national accounts show that total public sector investment has declined whereas consumption has skyrocketed. The investment in public infrastructure that does occur is a pale imitation of the past quality of public sector investment. Much of the investment now occurring is not in revenue earning productive investments but in social capital. This is reflected by the decline of investment in public trading enterprises. The continuing shift to consumption from public investment has been made worse by the rapid increase of consumption spending whilst public investment has plummeted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mike Nahan of the Institute of Public Affairs has stated that public sector consumption spending grew at an unprecedented rate over the four years to 1992-93. Of this, the government borrowed more than $15 billion over the last two years just to cover the running costs of its non-commercial operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives which the government should pursue with vigour are clear if the level of national savings is to be markedly improved and if sustainable growth in the private sector is to be achieved. The government has to reduce the budget deficit and move it into surplus. It has to reduce the ratio of consumption to investment and increase both public and private investment in real terms. It has to bring forward the deficit reduction program from 1995-96 to 1994-95 and it has to resist reducing the budget deficit by increasing taxes and charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's revised estimate of a budget deficit of $14.75 billion is a massive turnaround from its surpluses of only a few years ago. The turnaround is of the magnitude of $20 billion. It cannot be blamed just on the impact of the recession. If the government's debt reduction strategy is ever put in place, it will still result in a budget deficit of $5.8 billion in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should have been aiming for a budget surplus by then and not a deficit. The government recognised this as a desirable goal in its One Nation economic statement of a little over a year ago. That document called on the government to produce a budget surplus within the same time frame that Labor now anticipates producing a budget deficit of, as I have just mentioned, nearly $6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive to observe that the government's most recent budget deficit figure for 1996-97 is based on growth forecasts that are even more optimistic than the forecasts contained in the now infamous One Nation statement. So we have every reason to be worried as to whether the government's new fiscal targets, such as they are, will be reached. The government has imposed on this country a chronic budget imbalance of a magnitude that dwarfs the budget surpluses of a few years ago. This chronic budget imbalance seemingly has no end in sight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than a reduction in the budget deficit, what we have under this government is an increase in the size of the budget deficit for the current financial year and an increase in the public sector's call on national savings. That is very significant. If Labor's growth forecasts are not realised&mdash;which would be the usual state of affairs, given the record of this administration&mdash;the Commonwealth's finances are in even more serious trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of shifting the increasing imbalance between public sector consumption and investment, it appears that Labor is not prepared to act in a decisive manner. Even the most hardline response from the government shows that, based on budget projections, capital outlays are expected to decline by 42.1 per cent between 1992-93 and 1995-96. In the same period, recurrent outlays are to increase by approximately 22.5 per cent. This is a guesstimate over a period in which the nation is supposed to expect above average economic growth and, hopefully, rapidly improved job creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that arises is: why will the Commonwealth's future non-capital expenditure outlays be rising at such a rapid rate? Surely there will be a decline, if its aims are met and if its forecasts are accurate in the welfare bill, and an increasing ability to pay for it, if its forecasts are accurate. It appears most likely that any improvement in the budget deficit position will be squandered on projects that are dear to the heart of the Labor Party but do little to aid real job creation and improve Australia's competitive position. That situation will largely arise because of Labor's grovelling stance before the perceived might of certain pressure groups. We all know about that. We could, if we chose to, get on to the sports rorts as an example. Perhaps that will be done later today by others. Programs are created that are promoted as being worth while by this government but, on closer inspection, are just a method of providing a base from which political correctness and government largess can be spread. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government needs to keep key objectives in mind as it frames the upcoming budget. The deficit reduction strategy should be a surplus creation strategy. The government needs to redress markedly the ratio of consumption spending to investment spending in favour of investment. It is necessary that the government bring forward its deficit reduction strategy, meeting tighter targets in 1994-95. The government also needs to reduce the current fiscal imbalance, not by increasing taxes but by showing a firm hand and reining in its recurrent expenditure. In the past, much proposed belt tightening by the government has largely been achieved by reducing funding to the states. This should be achieved by the government cutting its own consumption. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join in the discussion on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) before the House this afternoon. It is worth while at the outset to relate a few of the additional expenditure measures involved. Some honourable members have suggested that they are program items that are in fact discretionary, that they are not significant and so on. Included in the measures that the House is discussing this afternoon are a $50 million grant for the capital works associated with the Olympic Games site in Sydney; $20.7 million for the rural adjustment scheme, which, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, is very important to many areas of rural New South Wales; additional funding relating to the health sector; additional funding as a result of the government's commitments to the people who suffered in the bushfires in New South Wales in January; and also measures relating to child care because of the additional take-up rate of child-care assistance to what was anticipated at budget time last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that those measures are there suggests that the government has quite rightly identified areas where there will be a need for additional expenditure and has provided for that through these appropriation bills. In aggregate, something like $165 million is attached to the measures in Appropriation Bill (No. 4). The debate this afternoon has obviously not focused on that. It has been a more wide-ranging debate, as these appropriation debates usually are, on the state of the economy, on various people's expectation about growth and other things and on employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to have that debate, I think we should start from the basis that the economy has grown strongly since the budget was brought down last August. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) has brought in revised figures for the budget deficit. At budget time, we were told by the opposition that the $16 billion figure was going to blow out, and that all these problems were going to occur because the government's estimates at that stage were unsound. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the economy has grown far faster than anyone anticipated at budget time, to such an extent we have had a revision in the budget deficit to $14.75 billion for 1993-94. That is still significant, but it is perhaps worth noting that that deficit represents only 3.5 per cent of GDP in 1993-94. If we look at most of our comparable trading partners and compare their budget deficits with our deficit even for this year&mdash;it is at the bottom point of the cycle in terms of the cyclical adjustment that has occurred with the recession&mdash;I think we can legitimately say that it is a pretty good starting point. In the next few years the recovery will gather pace. Clearly employment will gather pace. We have the settings right in terms of low interest rates, a low inflation rate and a low inflationary expectation to ensure sustainable improvements in our budget position over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why at budget time we had the deficit reduction strategy through to 1996-97. The estimate is that we will work towards approximately one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. There will be various ebbs and flows in expenditure and revenue forecasts throughout that time, but one thing we can say is that the government has demonstrated a real determination to ensure that we do have a mature outlook towards outlays and that we do have a responsible fiscal process through that period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the track record to support that. In the 1980s we actually had three budget surpluses. I listened to the contributions made earlier by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). They were berating the government because of the deficit. The fact is that the three surpluses which have occurred in the last 30 years have been under a Labor government. The government has made it clear that, over the next few years, it will have a responsible strategy as far as the deficit reduction plan is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have done that while keeping faith with important commitments such as reducing the company tax rate to 33 per cent, to get ourselves on a comparable basis with our trading partners and our near neighbours which have very significant economies and which are our competitors. We have done that while implementing the tax cut, in fact, bringing forward the tax cut for this financial year to 15 November. Over a full year it means that $3 billion worth of tax cuts will be delivered to the Australian taxpayers. Again, that has helped stimulate the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also recognised that, in formulating our budget plans, we need to have a recognition of those cyclical issues that the opposition decries but, nevertheless, are now showing through in the economy. At the time of the One Nation statement it was important that there be a commitment by the government to kick-start the economy. It was not happening in the private sector; it had to happen because the government took initiatives, as it did with the rail program and all sorts of other things that occurred at that time. Over $2 billion worth at that stage was put in to kick-start the economy. That was important. It has been shown that it was the right strategy in terms of our economic performance since that time. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the nation</EMPHASIS> statement built on that and gave incentives to the private sector as far as depreciation allowances and major development project incentives were concerned. All of those things were designed to encourage the growth that is now occurring in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our economy is now growing at 3 1/2 per cent. I would suggest that that is very significant when compared with the performance of our trading partners and the OECD countries. Most of those countries come out and talk to us because they want to find out more about how they can achieve growth rates of that level. I think we can achieve more. All the indications are that, over the next couple of years, the economy will grow at an even faster pace. But it will be a sustainable growth. That is just as important in this context. I think we have the right ingredients to have a sustainable and durable recovery for Australia built on that low inflation setting and the fact that we are starting to get jobs growth and the right balance through the economic process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the position at the time of the One Nation statement and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the nation</EMPHASIS> statement, the opposition attacked every single one of those measures. We have had something like 13 cuts in interest rates in the period since February 1990. On every one of those occasions the opposition said, `This is not the time. We're forcing the pace. There'll be a run on the dollar. There'll be all sorts of other consequences because interest rates have been cut too much in their terms'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was important to bring those interest rates back, and they were brought back in a way that will be sustained in the future. The outlook for inflation means that interest rates can stay at their lowest level in 30 years for an extended period. There is nothing more important for Australia's sustainable economic recovery than keeping that low inflationary setting and those low inflationary expectations. Once again, we need to encourage a setting in which business and all those people who are interested in doing business in the economy are planning and investing on the basis of that low inflation outlook.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those things point to the success that has been achieved in building the recovery in a strong and durable fashion. There is no doubt that, when considering where the economy is heading in the future, everyone's focus is on employment, and rightly so. That is the last element, if you like, in the recovery process. It always appears to be that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last six months, we have seen employment growth: about 148,000 jobs have been created in that period. We can be confident about the future of that structural improvement in employment and the employment outlook. The worrying indicator in all of the deliberations that have been going on is the number of people who are in the long-term unemployed category. That is a matter that should be of great concern to the whole of the parliament. It is not a case of just coming in and rubbishing every proposal that comes along; it is a case of recognising that it is an issue that the nation has to deal with in a very direct and appropriate fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How is that best achieved? Despite the opposition's continuing negativity, a range of those labour market programs has been identified in various studies as being appropriate mechanisms to meet part of that challenge. Other things need to be done, but those arrangements, which have the appropriate flexibility, are part of the important adjustment that needs to take place in order to provide for the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of that long-term unemployment does have as its core the structural adjustment that has occurred in the economy. Necessary structural adjustment has occurred in regions right across Australia in order to improve our competitive position; nevertheless, it has been at a substantial social cost that we, as a government, are determined to address. It is a case of finding the right balance when addressing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view&mdash;and I think the employment green paper makes this clear&mdash;that development of something like the jobs compact is an appropriate way to target much of that concern. It is important that, as part of that process, we try to look at all of the initiatives that are currently in place to ensure that we are getting the optimum value out of the programs that exist and, where necessary, we build on those in an appropriate way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the economy is growing and the employment situation is improving is obviously part of that process. But it will be just as important in the forthcoming budget to address those issues. Inevitably, there will be a range of speculation as to the appropriate mechanism to do that, but what is important is that, at the end of the day, when the budget is delivered on 10 May, we can be satisfied that real sustainable effort is being made in that regard. All the opposition's hysteria about new taxes, other charges, a blow-out in the budget deficit strategy and so on will be shown for the sort of humbug that it is in this exercise, because the government will deliver on those strategies, as we have committed ourselves to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the other things that need to take place in the nation. Opposition speakers spent a long time talking about national savings and the FitzGerald report. One of the key areas of national savings that has been important for the nation over recent years is that of national superannuation, the comprehensive retirement incomes package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the opposition's approach been to the determination and the drive on the part of the government to deliver on that retirement incomes package and to recognise the nature of the demographics of the population and the need to focus on providing for people's retirement incomes? As recently as last week, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said that he would not proceed with national superannuation as proposed by the government. He apparently does not believe that the fact that workers did not have access to national superannuation in the past is of much concern. I assume that he wants to go back to an arrangement such as applied before Labor came to power, where the vast majority of award based workers had no access to superannuation; superannuation was not a prerogative of the work force throughout the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That attitude has changed in a way that will mean there will be sustainable national savings and real improvements in the national economic outlook for people to provide for themselves responsibly through a superannuation regime built on the various social security arrangements that provide the appropriate safety net for people as they phase into superannuation arrangements over the next few years. I think the importance of that to national savings has been underestimated. The fact that the opposition wants to wind the clock back in that regard highlights the fact that much of its talk about national savings has really missed the mark very badly indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that more things need to be done to promote investment. This government has ensured that we have competitive tax scales for companies. We have a regime that has ensured that the profitability of the company and manufacturing sectors is improving and business outlook is more positive. Surveys show that business is increasingly more positive about the future. One assumes that the lag in investment from the private sector will start to improve with the profit share being where it is today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiatives that have been taken by this government are worth recounting. I have mentioned the reduction in the company income tax rate to 33 per cent. We have had a change in dividend imputation, removing the double taxation on dividends. We have also had a range of new initiatives as far as the depreciation investment allowance is concerned. All of those measures are designed to give companies more scope to be positive and aggressive with investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the challenge is there for business and increasingly it is taking up that challenge to provide more investment. More investment will mean more jobs in the future and more scope for the Australian economy to grow and be competitive in a world sense. The other important aspect for the company sector is the structural adjustment that has occurred there. We need to look at the change that has occurred in relation to the manufacturing sector of the economy. We need to look at the trade position over the last few months, at growth in manufacturing exports and what that means for industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business has a more outward looking focus because we have removed tariff protection and the other things that ensured that we had a closed economy. This government changed that. We have made our economy open and competitive. We have made business look outwards to explore and develop new markets. We have also created the circumstance where companies that are coming to invest in Australia can move forward and look competitively at Australia. We recognise how important it is to promote in Australia regional headquarters of businesses so that we ensure that we have the breadth of industry that is necessary in the global world of trade. That is a very positive initiative and one that is gathering momentum. We have seen that Australia is increasingly being looked upon as a hub for financial services and a range of other high-tech services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those things add to the breadth of the economy and add to the scope for a sustainable recovery. This will mean that as the economy picks up over the next few years the opposition's drive to talk the economy down all the time will be seen for what it is. It will be seen as a political exercise that has very little significance other than in scoring a few cheap political points. It is designed to keep the Leader of the Opposition where he is&mdash;or, in the case of the honourable member for Higgins, to allow him to replace the Leader of the Opposition. This is really what parliament has been about so far this year. There has not been much focus on the other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the appropriation bills that we have before us today highlight the fact that there has been substantial economic change over the last 12 months. It is very hard to look back over that period and not be impressed by the fact that we have continued to generate strong growth. We have an underlying inflation rate of two per cent and an interest rate regime that is the lowest in 30 years. With this setting it means that business can look to expand in productive ways over the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can compare that sort of scenario with the fact that, as I was saying, the opposition has continually wanted to diminish that recovery. It has continually wanted to undermine the strength and the growing nature of the economy across the various sectors. It keeps referring to the fact that we have had budget deficits over the last few years. Our public sector borrowing requirement is still comparatively small and is still very competitive in world terms, yet the opposition wants to portray those deficits as being somehow irresponsible financial and fiscal management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, much of the borrowing that occurred in the late 1980s did not come from the Commonwealth government sector; it came either from the states or from the private sector. We have turned that around in a way that means that there is now a focus on savings across the board. We have suggested that appropriate stringencies apply to the states in a number of areas, but we have also been prepared to tackle those issues of micro-economic reform that mattered in the national economy&mdash;be they in rail, or be they in the broader areas of trying to get agreement across the electricity grid and so on. So we have not shirked those responsibilities in telecommunications and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has continually said that those measures have not gone far enough, but we have been concerned to ensure that employment, as well as the economic conditions, remains important. That should be a focus for us all. What would the effect have been of the idea that the opposition advocated in Fightback: to slash and burn the budget deficit&mdash;$9 billion or $10 billion worth of cuts in outlays? As far as the government is concerned a massive cutback in government services, in rural-regional areas, and in support to people such as the aged and the frail is not acceptable. Right through our policy process we wanted to ensure we had a sound financial position built upon a recovery. The government kick-started the economy with the One Nation and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the nation</EMPHASIS> statements, and gradually that was wound back to enable the private sector to take up the investment as its confidence in the economic recovery grew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ingredients are there now for that investment to occur. I believe these appropriation bills reinforce the strategic way in which the government has approached its management of the economy over its time in office. I have no doubt the adoption of these measures and the measures that will flow through in the budget for 1994-95 will ensure that the sustainable recovery and the jobs growth which are so vital to all Australians are achieved in accordance with the government's objective throughout its time in office. </PARA>

Any dispassionate observer would also admit that executive dominance has evolved to such a degree that this House has only marginal public relevance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that question time is a largely hypocritical charade which only appeals to people's worst instincts, both here and in the community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to claims by some honourable members about how the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has debased parliament and question time, the running of parliament has not been greatly different for many years, both here and generally at state levels, in terms of public benefit.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But over and above all of this the fundamental reason why question time, the role of the Speaker and of the House itself can never operate in a satisfactory manner is the nature of the development of political parties over the last 80 years. In a recent paper, the Clerk of the Senate very clearly summarised the position. His view merely confirms what many political scientists and dispassionate observers have concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rigidly organised and disciplined modern political party has prevented Parliaments from exercising their original or supposed function of controlling Executive Government . . . Modern political parties are a radical negation of Parliament as an institution . . . They are organisations designed to prevent parliamentary government from working . . . Modern parties are to Parliament what collusive oligarchies are to a market. Just as collusive oligarchies prevent the price mechanism of the market working, parties prevent the operation of the mechanism of responsibility which was at the heart of Parliamentary Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years the centralisation of power within political parties has been refined by the so-called principles of inner cabinet solidarity, cabinet solidarity and caucus solidarity, the purpose of which is to remove any voting power from the majority of the members of the House and remove any accountability of the executive to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members within parties are often prevented from representing what their electorates think, or even from presenting their own views. The modern party requires regular suspension of individual conscience and individual responsibility of its members, something which was condemned at Nuremberg and something which I, along with an increasing number of the public, can never accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end result of party development is that the House of Representatives is no longer parliamentary government; it is party government. We no longer have any real parliamentary control over executive government in the lower house, but a complete reversal of what the constitution envisaged&mdash;total control of the House of Representatives by executive government, a situation reflected in most state lower houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this is not the fault of political parties or even the individuals in them. Political parties, as a means of development of public policy through organisations of like-minded people, have a valuable public purpose. Unfortunately, their development within the framework of our combination of American and Westminster systems, which failed to incorporate an essential separation of powers, has caused a loss of purpose. More often than not they are now mechanisms to obtain and perpetuate power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no accident that we have seen conspicuous failures of integrity in recent years. Virtually every state has become embroiled in controversy. We have had the Fitzgerald commission in Queensland, the Slattery commission and the ICAC in New South Wales, the bribery royal commission in Tasmania, the State Bank investigation in South Australia and the WA Inc. royal commission. In Queensland and Western Australia the commissioners clearly identified the root of the problems as the failure of parliament to be a check on executive government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's recent statement of so-called reform of the House contains many noble sentiments on face value, but between lines it reads `executive dominance'&mdash;not to any great degree but it moves in that direction. The fact that ministers will be less subject to scrutiny of a minimum sort and that question time will probably not be broadcast live, watched by fewer people in an edited and more boring form, does not add up to a great deal. It is just another example of the philosophy that the rules of the game promote: never give a sucker an even break. Polling no doubt indicated that question time was not reflecting well on the government in spite of the applause within the ivory tower, so they sought to change the rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not blame the Prime Minister. In his isolated position, after a lifetime of dedication to pursuing dominance of the system, in effect an elected dictatorship between elections, which the system encourages, little else can be expected. Given the minimal relevance of the House, why should he and his ministers not spend the minimum time here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government can bury its head in the sand and shrug off these problems, but, unfortunately for the government, the Australian community will not accept that position. The present state of the Senate is a reflection of this, as is the long-term trend around Australia with an increasing non-major party vote. This dissatisfaction is a public reflection of the failure of partisan overgovernment to address the economic, social and environmental difficulties of the country. Major party support is at its lowest level in at least a quarter of a century and the government should not deceive itself that the last election result indicated increased support for it. The extremist policies of the coalition gave the community little choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate situation cannot be remedied by an expanded version of changing question time rules or by corrupting the voting method of the Senate to eliminate minority views, as suggested by Senator Gareth Evans. That would change nothing and address none of the long-term problems, except probably to ensure a change of government at the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of executive dominance achieved since 1901 is not acceptable to any thinking person and disenfranchisement of minority views to perpetuate that dominance is not acceptable to the Australian community. Many reforms are necessary. The federal system is desperately in need of genuine reform. Calls for further centralisation by the dissolution of states are futile and undesirable. It would result in a massive centralisation of power but not address the problems of executive dominance and checks and balances. At present, the states are a bulwark against executive dominance in Canberra, but that worthwhile check comes at too high a cost to the efficiency of the country. There are local, regional and national interests which must be reflected by governments, but a massive reorganisation of the functions of the three levels is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While some reform is proceeding, it is too slow. The nine Australian governments are all suffering in various degrees from partisan politics and executive dominance themselves. Even though federalism does provide some accountability and defence against central governments, a Balkanised conflict of unelected executives, often representing no-one but themselves, does little good for the country as a whole. The establishment of the principle of parliamentary sovereignty over executive government, which is emerging from the community's increasing refusal to give absolute power to any one group in various parliaments around Australia, is certainly a progressive move. The fact is that last year's budget was negotiated, and the present struggle about the sovereignty of parliament is an indication of this, as is the constitutional reform occurring in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth of mechanisms around Australia in the last few years, such as the various royal commissions and corruption bodies, is another reflection of the community's need to protect itself against executive dominance. That these bodies are tending to become permanent does ensure some improvements in accountability and is some defence against the misuse of centralised power; however, they deal really with symptoms without attacking the cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reform of the voting system is long overdue. It is amazing that a reasonably advanced society that calls itself a democracy has accepted the primitive single member electorate system for so long. This system is a gross distortion of the public will, with that will only randomly reflected in seats in parliament. It is a `winner take all' approach which eliminates minorities. Political history at federal and state levels is littered with examples of distortions, such as the 1990-93 federal government with 39.6 percent of the vote, or the current coalition representation from New South Wales. The Liberal Party gained 32 per cent of the vote and the National Party gained 10 per cent of the vote, yet both have eight seats in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Executive dominance needs to fear fair voting systems, such as proportional representation. The people, however, are in no such position. It is notable that on only two occasions in memory the public, rather than the executive, were given a choice of voting systems; in the Australian Capital Territory and New Zealand, they chose proportional representation. It is ironic that Australia has the best example of proportional representation in the world: the Hare-Clark system of Tasmania, which is supported by both major party executives, albeit reluctantly, as long as it is never allowed to escape from Tasmania. Many other incremental reforms can&mdash;and I hope will&mdash;be made, but the bottom line is the proper separation of executive and legislative powers, something well recognised for over 200 years as essential for a fully democratic system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people should be given the right to vote directly for the government. This separates executive government from parliament, removes the need to enforce iron party discipline, empowers all members of parliament, allows representatives the right to individual conscience and individual responsibility, ensures to a vastly greater degree the accountability of the executive and removes to a large degree partisan politics and the emptiness of opposition and the pathos of minorities within the government of the day. It would even put the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) out of his misery by making the position redundant. It removes the corrosive effect of personal leadership and ministerial ambitions which corrupt the parliamentary process. It would open up the choice of cabinet positions to the whole community and makes possible fixed term elections and stable government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ironically, such a change in our political system was unthinkable until the Prime Minister, the high priest of centralisation of power and executive dominance, opened up the republican debate. This, in turn, has opened up the whole question of constitutional reform, and symbolic change versus substantive reform. Many commentators, academic studies and bodies, such as the Constitutional Centenary Foundation, are now pursuing these questions on a long-term basis. Certainly, if the people get their way, they will elect a new head of state rather than accept an appointed hub cap favoured by the political establishment. This will be a substantial step towards a full separation of powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of long-term reform, opposition to the unaccountability inherent in the present executive dominance and the futility of government by swapping small oligarchies every so often at elections is now publicly entrenched. Attempts to enhance executive dominance by the recent so-called reforms to the House or the threats by Senator Evans to eliminate minorities in the Senate will only hasten real reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no greater honour or responsibility for an Australian than to serve in our national parliament, more so in the electorate of Werriwa, which has been represented with such capacity by the great men of Labor&mdash;Whitlam and Kerin. I hold immense gratitude and affection for my predecessors: Gough Whitlam for his instruction, inspiration and comradeship; John Kerin for an orderly transition in Werriwa and forever displaying a dignified and very decent approach to public life. In every respect in this Parliament, as Bob Hawke once described Kerin, he was a self-made man. He applied a broad yet homespun intellect to the development of Australia's best set of rural and resource policies. Throughout Werriwa and the nation, he earnt respect with his commonsense and egalitarian approach to issues and, as no one could doubt, he made sure that he wrote all his own jokes.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since World War II Werriwa has reflected each of the mainstream issues of Australian politics and has acted as both a catalyst and a testing ground for Labor policy&mdash;through the urban expansion of the 1950s and 1960s to the Whitlam renaissance and the structural adjustments of the 1980s. My electorate remains very much a microcosm of Australian society and the challenges for national policy in this decade. It is an urban, demographically young and multicultural electorate, grappling with the challenges of economic development, better planning and service delivery&mdash;all underpinned by a growing sense of confidence and identity. This is very much the Australian condition in the 1990s. These appropriation bills provide an opportunity to argue how issues and experiences in my electorate&mdash;while strongly confirming this government's agenda and direction&mdash;in several areas of federal responsibility highlight the need for new or adjusted policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sydney's south-west, covering the electorates of Fowler, Werriwa and Macarthur, provides an outstanding case study of the means by which the government can promote regional economic development and accelerate the pace of micro-reform and competition policy throughout the national economy. The south-west region has developed competitive strengths from its large consumer market, capable work force and relatively cheap and well-serviced industrial land. The one gap in the effectiveness of the regional economy&mdash;now being targeted and overcome&mdash;reflects the great competitive weakness of regional Australia, that is, inadequate transport investment to efficiently move goods and people by road, rail, sea and air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent Kelty report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Developing Australia</EMPHASIS> identified transport services as a crucial development issue in each of the 63 regions surveyed. Significant gains are required for Australia's transport system to reach average practice, let alone international best practice. On an island continent with dispersed population centres, economic efficiency inevitably depends on the effectiveness of the transport system. Whenever the economic distance between markets is reduced, Australia enhances its competitive advantages, both for domestic and external trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits of improved transport investment are beginning to be realised in Sydney's south-west. The federal government has developed a regional transport program with new road and rail links and, most importantly, through an inspired announcement during my by-election campaign by the minister for transport, inviting private sector investment to accelerate Badgerys Creek Airport to international status. More needs to be done, however, in Werriwa and across the nation to improve the effectiveness of our transport system. The government needs to build on the achievements of One Nation through four new initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, it should embrace federal responsibility for urban railways just as One Nation picked up federal funding for national highway links through urban areas. From its own funding sources the New South Wales government has been unable to construct a new rail line in Sydney's west or south-west since the time of Jack Lang. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the government should tie federal road grants to regional economic strategies. The New South Wales government has linked its capital works budget in Sydney solely to the urban release program. Without targeted infrastructure assistance for industry clusters, the metropolitan area has produced high commuter travelling times and a large imbalance between the location of jobs and the location of housing estates. Untied road funding in New South Wales has also resulted in National Party pork-barrelling and under-resourcing in areas of greatest need. Even though Sydney's west and south-west represent 30 per cent of the state's population they receive just 14 per cent of funding from the Roads and Traffic Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, the government should redirect federal expenditure not just through fiscal equivalence on road charges, as recommended by the Kelty report, but also by scaling back areas of overinvestment on other economic programs. For instance, if the education system more capably met the needs of the long-term unemployed, the government would not need to spend as much as $12 billion a year on DEET programs. In my assessment, government responsibilities on the demand side of the labour market are more critical than those on the supply side. The only long-term answer for the long-term unemployed is a growth economy pushing back towards full employment. Fourth, the government needs to improve the taxation treatment of infrastructure bonds and pooled development funds to foster more private investment in Australia's transport system. I look forward to this being a key feature of the forthcoming industry statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the fast-track development of an international airport at Badgerys Creek. This project represents the best opportunity for industry clustering and employment growth in Sydney's west and south-west in the 1990s. A study by the national institute in 1991 revealed total employment potential for 36,000 new jobs over the next 20 years on and around the airport site. Presently, Badgerys Creek, like most major airports in Australia, is under the control of a public sector monopoly&mdash;the Federal Airports Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unhappily, the substantial opportunities for aviation and economic development arising from Badgerys Creek are prejudicial to the interests of the FAC and its commercial charter. The FAC runs Kingsford Smith, as its most profitable airport&mdash;in 1992-93 sustaining 55 per cent of the FAC's nationwide profit of $89 million, while 12 of the other 18 FAC airports returned losses. The development of Badgerys Creek and the attraction of modern airport technology and curfew free operations would bring substantial competition to the aviation market in Sydney and cut into the profits of Kingsford-Smith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the restraint of airport competition, the economic development of Sydney's west and south-west has been restricted for the sole purpose of propping up the FAC's profits and cross-subsidising provincial airports outside Sydney. I am delighted that the new Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), knowing the issues so well, holding the electorate of Kingsford-Smith, is not one to put up with bureaucratic delay, or obstruction, or the featherbedding of public sector monopolies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government need not be restricted by the conventional wisdom that competition policy will damage the development of regional economies. In the areas of Sydney's west and south-west&mdash;regions with mature industry structures and very encouraging growth&mdash;competition policy would stimulate economic development. Breaking up the FAC's monopoly is an essential micro-economic reform, not just for my electorate but across the nation. While many parts of the world&mdash;the European Community and NAFTA&mdash;are slotting into trade blocs, Australia has no right of entry into its targeted markets in east Asia and south Asia. Our only advantage is proximity, but without efficient and comprehensive air and sea freight systems this competitive edge will be wasted. This demonstrates the central truth of economic management in the 1990s&mdash;how all policy must be set within the context of an open and competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government's basic reform of the economy is now entrenched. There is no way back to the subsidies, regulation and sheltered markets of old Australia. The only meaningful debate is about the pace of reform, not its direction. There is always a temptation for politicians wanting to exercise their power to regard industry regulation and intervention as a way to remake the market. In truth, no government can knock the market out of the ring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's greatest achievement has been to kill off the last remnants of the Australian settlement; that is, the laws and institutions on which Australian politics founded a consensus in the first decade of federation&mdash;centralised wage fixing, industry protection all round and White Australia. The settlement was designed to institutionalise Australia's standard of living&mdash;then among the highest in the world. This enshrined the ethos of a lucky country, sheltering from the demands and competition of the international economy while enjoying national wealth out of agriculture and mining. This government has been about restoring the competitive edge Australia lost in the postwar period and putting back some of the luck. Hence the ethos of an open and competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competitive advantage of nations comes from industrial upgrading to the new investment technology and managerial capacity which give companies an edge on world markets. Firms which remain static are imitated by competitors and soon lose their market advantage. Ultimately, nations succeed in certain environments because their corporate environment is dynamic and challenging, pressuring firms to upgrade and widen their advantages on domestic and international markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more companies rely on government assistance, the less likely they are to upgrade their competitive position. The role of government is to stimulate market competition, not smother it with tariffs, subsidies and central planning. This illustrates a very important point about how to best judge the success of economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition of any kind is never static&mdash;not between firms and not between nations. In an isolated and closed economy, international comparisons count for little; in an open and competitive economy, however, they are the only test of national success. Australia can have no room or reason for complacency. If we wish to trade successfully in our region, among the fastest growing and changing economies in the world, our pace of adjustment must be just as rapid. Quite simply, nations with competitive weaknesses cannot move fast enough to rejuvenate and restructure their economies. The longer politicians avoid reform, the greater the decline in productivity and competitive advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The focus of national policy must centre on structural efficiency&mdash;securing for Australia international best practice in our transport, communications and industrial relations systems. Structural problems require structural solutions and that, of course, is the agenda of this government. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is domestic competition which makes companies lean and beckons them to look for opportunities abroad . . . the promotion of competition in all areas has to be the cornerstone of policy.</PARA>
<PARA>Competition policy has two components. First, strong anti-trust laws are needed to prevent horizontal mergers and market collusion. Second, governments, federal and state, must challenge and break up the privileged market conditions of the professions&mdash;doctors and lawyers&mdash;and increasingly expose government business enterprises to the benefits of competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate should not be about public versus private ownership but about the huge differences in productivity between competitive and monopoly markets. The Industry Commission, for instance, has estimated how reform of Australia's public utilities would add two per cent to the nation's GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The heads of government meeting in Hobart later this week will measure the resolve of all governments in Australia to accelerate and expand competition policy across the public sector in electricity distribution, water and gas supplies, ports, international shipping, airports, railways, telecommunications, postal services and even local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate, however, it is essential to recognise that governments cannot control the competitive advantage of nations, they can only influence it. There is too little questioning in Australia of the pace of reform by the private sector. According to the Australian Manufacturing Council, only 10 to 15 per cent of the manufacturing businesses that could be exporting are actually doing so. If companies reform their own performance as quickly as they expect governments to change policy, Australia would be in a much stronger economic position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my predecessors Gough Whitlam argued in this parliament how the quality of life for Australians, in particular the value placed on community services and opportunities, depends more on where they live than how much they earn. Experiences in Werriwa confirm how this principle remains as valid in the 1990s as it was 20 and 30 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate continues to experience the rapid population growth which has been a feature of its demographics since World War II. Like many of the suburbs of Sydney's west and south-west, the rate of growth in government services&mdash;federal, state and local&mdash;has not kept pace with the increase in population. It is unacceptable, for instance, that west and south-west Sydney have 10 per cent of Australia's population, with a high proportion of young people, but only three per cent of student places in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is much easier for politicians to fund new services from growth in government revenue than relocate resources to areas of greatest need. Australia's economic circumstances, however, have killed off this soft option. The government needs to place the redistribution of public resources at the centre of its agenda for social policy. Only by tackling the problem of regional inequality in Australia can we move towards one nation. An obvious measure is to reform the charter by which federal authorities allocate grants to the states and local government. State boundaries&mdash;lines drawn in at Whitehall last century&mdash;have shown themselves to be an irrelevant guide to locational inequality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, it is absurd to suggest, as the Grants Commission does every year, that community needs in Hobart and Darwin are two to seven times greater than those in Campbelltown and Blacktown. Questions of equity and service delivery need to be judged on a regional rather than state basis. With limited government resources, funding formulas must be prepared, on the basis of need between regions, to take away as well as give. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government successfully used this approach for the local capital works program in 1992. The $6.5 million allocated to Campbelltown and Liverpool councils not only boosted local industry but addressed leading lifestyle issues through the construction of new community cultural and sporting facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In electorates like Werriwa, the federal government must provide greater support for services and facilities which, in other parts of Sydney, are secured through higher private incomes. The quality of life in Australia depends substantially on the services and opportunities which the community provides from the combined resources of government. Less privileged areas are particularly affected by the lack of resources available to local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is little understood in Australia's federal system of government how, of the five community services from which young people derive their lifestyle opportunities&mdash;education, child care, recreation, cultural pursuits and libraries&mdash;all but education are provided by local government. By restoring the local capital works program to these appropriation bills or, more likely, in the May budget, the government could overcome part of this imbalance between municipal responsibilities and municipal finances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scarcity of government funds in the 1990s will continue to focus attention on the cost-effectiveness of service delivery. An element of competition between service providers can improve both the quality and the efficiency of the public sector. This means separating the demand and supply functions of government into a purchaser-provider split. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Dick Scotton, who with John Deeble devised the Medibank program, has used these principles to advocate an overhaul of Australia's health system. His proposal is much more than an efficiency measure, as it provides the government with an opportunity to regionalise health care in Australia and ensure a fair distribution of resources between regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distribution of hospitals in Sydney reflects historical rather than contemporary patterns of urban settlement. This lag means that most beds and services are where the people used to live, not where they live now. The East Sydney Area Health Service, for instance, has 6.9 beds per 1,000 population while south-west Sydney, which covers the electorate of Werriwa, has 2.4 beds per 1,000. The south-west region has 11.1 per cent of the state's population yet receives only 7.3 per cent of health funding. Just as the federal government cannot rely on the states to redistribute health resources on the basis of need, it cannot count on them to tackle the growing gap in Australia between the demand for health care and the availability of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Internationally, health policy makers have grappled with the problem of securing greater efficiency and cost control in the delivery of services while maintaining universal insurance. In many cases, this has resulted in the national government establishing service contracts with both public and private hospitals for the provision of core services. A single national insurer offers a range of options for health coverage linked to the principle of capacity to pay. This system could be used to integrate the public and private hospital systems in Australia, just as the federal government two decades ago ended the distinction, for funding purposes, between public and private schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of public beds in private hospitals would address the problem of underutilised resources in our national hospital system. The direct funding role for hospitals would be administered by regional authorities, allowing the federal government to allocate funds on the basis of need. The service provider role would involve competition between both public and private health institutions to win performance based contracts from the regional authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By taking up the responsibility which the 1946 referendum conferred on this parliament to provide medical services, the government can establish a national health system. All Australians, no matter their income, no matter their location, can have equal access to essential health services under the universal coverage of national health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no inconsistency between a belief in market economies and the legitimate role of government in the redistribution of income and public resources. Social democracy has set itself the countervailing role of sustaining those things the market either cannot provide or actually takes away. Ultimately, Labor's hopes for a more equal and just society rely on a certain judgment about human values: the belief that whilst people will always defend their own interests they also care enough about the society in which they live to advance the interests of others. This is what Australians have always meant in the national ethos of a fair go. It is basic to the rejection, election after election after election, of the conservative notion that self-interest is satisfied only at the expense of other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian society is changing in a way that opposition members will never understand. This is reflected in the coalition's claim that this government is somehow trying to remodel Australia through reforms such as the republic. This is the tired old script of conservatives through the ages: too insensitive to understand that society has already remodelled itself; too obtuse to accept that good government and reform involves the skilful anticipation of change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that Werriwa reflects a young and multicultural community with 40 per cent of the electorate aged less than 20, and 25 per cent born overseas. For these people, without memories or emotions for Britain, Australian independence is a natural feeling. This is what makes the republic inevitable and so too a more independent foreign policy in Australia.

Mr Speaker, I will give my very best to this task and, in discharging my responsibilities as the member for Werriwa, within the great Labor traditions of this electorate, I commit myself and all my efforts to the achievement of an open and competitive economy and our mighty crusade for a more independent, tolerant and equal Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, at the outset allow me, on behalf of the Liberal and National parties, to congratulate the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) on his impressive maiden speech. He will, of course, allow me to disagree with some of the points at least that he raised. I thought the comment about the National Party being pork-barrellers was a bit rich. It was a totally generalised and gratuitous comment, unlike the charges levelled at the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1993-94 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1993-94 which are before the House, I would like to direct my comments to Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and specifically to the allocation of $7.3 million in additional assistance to those affected by the New South Wales bushfires. As you will recall, Mr Speaker, this House dealt with the tragedy of the New South Wales bushfires at the first available opportunity, which was during private members' business on Thursday, 3 February this year, at which time a motion moved by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) received bipartisan support. It may benefit the House for me to repeat the resolution:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) expresses its sadness at the loss of human life and damage to fauna and property caused by the recent NSW bushfires; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) commends the efforts and sacrifices of regular and volunteer firefighters from New South Wales and interstate in quelling those fires.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Bradfield and other honourable members who took part in debating that motion deserve to be commended. They all expressed shock and dismay, principally at the loss of life but also at the loss of fauna and property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly taken with the contribution by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), whose electorate, like those of others who spoke, suffered enormously from those devastating bushfires. Essentially, although time did not allow, the honourable member for Lyne touched on three aspects of the bushfires from which lessons must be learnt. The first was for the provision of adequate support and equipment for those volunteers as well as for the professional firefighters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that a large number of firefighters from my electorate of Gippsland travelled to New South Wales to fight the bushfires. On their return they have expressed to me their surprise&mdash;to put it at its very mildest&mdash;at the antiquated equipment with which many of the firefighting units from New South Wales were expected to face up to these fire storms. The honourable member for Lyne did touch on that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another lesson he stressed is that New South Wales, and Australia more generally, does not have a significant aerial firefighting capacity. If time permits, I would wish to touch on that, because in Victoria and South Australia we have developed a very extensive, sophisticated and effective aerial firefighting network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue which the honourable member for Lyne touched on is the need for a greater level of control burning. I wish to direct most of my remarks towards that issue. Needless to say, the New South Wales bushfires were of more than a little interest to Gippslanders, Victorians and, for that matter, Australians generally. But, as Gippsland is dominated by the Great Dividing Range and East Gippsland has hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest, Gippsland has suffered terribly from bushfires over the years. We are very conscious of the dangers of bushfires. Over the years we have tried to develop the very best system possible for combating them. No-one is perfect; we are learning all the time. A great many lessons from New South Wales will also be taken on board by Victorian firefighting and emergency services authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My comments are in no way complacent because we will accept advice from anybody on how to improve our performance and protect life and property. A number of very concerned constituents have been to see me since the New South Wales firefighting experience. I seize on the comments of Mr Fred Ward of Bairnsdale because he represents a very widely held view in Gippsland that we in Victoria, and Gippsland specifically, have allowed much of the same problem to grow up in our area as appears to have occurred in New South Wales. That is in regard to the growth of fuel in the forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, Mr Ward does not believe that there is enough fuel reduction burning in alpine and subalpine vegetation. In Gippsland we seem to allow only small areas in selected terrain. It has to be said that there is a lot of ignorance in the ranks of the authorities with regard to the need for fuel reduction burning. I believe, as Mr Ward argues, in conjunction with Mr Jack Treasure, a legendary mountain cattleman resident in Gippsland, that the authorities must listen to those who have spent a lifetime working and living in the Great Dividing Range and in the forest areas of Gippsland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ward and Mr Treasure intend to pursue the need for fire fuel reduction in all categories of bush, whether it be national park, heritage areas or the like. I must stress that Mr Ward&mdash;and no doubt this also applies to Mr Treasure&mdash;is not critical of those called on to fight fires; instead, he is critical of the failure to prevent them in the first place by reducing the amount of fuel in the forests. In summary, there is a belief in Gippsland that there is not enough preventive work taking place to reduce the amount of dangerous undergrowth. It must be borne in mind that burnings must be on a regular basis, otherwise bush and scrub can grow up to a very heavy extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred Ward, a well-known identity of East Gippsland, is not a cattleman, a mill owner, a farmer or a person with any financial interest in the resources of public land. Therefore, he speaks objectively and with a great deal of experience. His experience includes survival of the 1939 Black Friday fires at Omeo. I note that, during the debate on 3 February, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) recalled his experience of the 1939 bushfires in Gippsland when he lived in that area and his father was involved as a volunteer. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has very vivid memories of the tragic and widespread fires in Victoria of 1939. I must say that the 1939 fire is deeply entrenched in the consciousness of all surviving Gippslanders from that era. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ward also did voluntary service as an equipment officer for the Omeo Bush Fire Brigade after the 1939 fires. As a skier, trout angler and gold prospector he has an extensive knowledge of the wild country around most of East Gippsland. He has been employed on snow clearing, road construction and timber work. Mr Ward wishes to draw attention to the extreme fire hazard which exists in the national parks, wilderness areas, general forest and grazing lands of eastern Victoria and the adjacent New South Wales Alps. He only ever wants to offer constructive criticism and advice based on real experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has told me that in his view the worst fires that Australia has experienced have been caused mostly by lightning strikes. Such strikes can and do occur on days of minimum humidity, maximum heat and the highest wind velocities. So, where these conditions persist, it is certainly likely that fire will become unmanageable. When talking to any of the firefighters involved in the New South Wales fires or fires elsewhere, they all tell us that once the fire is up and raging there is nothing that can be done and they are very heavily dependent on the natural elements changing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ward believes that the factor most conducive to the spread of wildfire is the thermal updraught. This occurs, he believes, at the top of forward slopes or above large masses of fire or it can also occur in certain weather conditions and result in hail and snowfalls. He maintains that the power of thermal updraughts is such that it can carry burning material for many kilometres ahead of the fire mass and create the classic example of spot fires. He categorically states&mdash;and this is supported by all of those who have worked and lived in the East Gippsland bush&mdash;that with the present state of excess fire fuel the Great Dividing Range is the worst fire hazard that exists anywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, Mr Ward makes the point that, after the disastrous fires of 1939 and Ash Wednesday 1983, fuel reduction has become more and more ineffective simply because the rate of fuel reduction burning is not keeping up with the production of that fuel. In the immediate sub-alpine snow gum and woolly butt forests around the Alps, fire-killed and fire-initiated regrowth of these tree types has increased by some 100 per cent. He has translated that increase into fire intensity and he believes that that is the basis for a complete disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ward believes that fuel reduction burning can be effective only if the areas of fuel generation are attacked. He believes it is obvious that this has not yet been done. For effective control, breaks must be prepared along the tops of ridges by bulldozing and raking. Fires should then be lit down the forward slopes at a distance so close to the break that no chance of significant updraught can be created to carry the spot fires forward. This should be done progressively until the bottom of the forward slopes is reached. This would create a mosaic of bush that could be burnt every time it will burn, on the generation areas, and safely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the backwards slopes, the shady sides, Mr Ward believes they will burn when it is dry enough. The major criticism he has of the present methods of fuel reduction is that it is being done over a very short period and the most difficulty can be expected to be met while trying to get it to burn. He argues that the nettle has to be grasped and burning under control must be done in summer. His answer to the howls of protest is simply that if we can fight fire with fire when the whole country is alight&mdash;as it was near Sydney&mdash;by back-burning, why then cannot we do the same with fuel reduction? The big advantage we would have is that we can pick our time, place and weather. The only alternative to controlled burning is to let lightning strike fires burn themselves out, and that is obviously an alternative fraught with enormous risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also makes the point that access to fire outbreaks in any part of the whole fire prone areas of bush is vital to the continuing existence of flora and fauna. Therefore, improvement of access should be a high priority. In conclusion, Mr Ward believes that his comments and advice to me and to Victorian state ministers are based on his belief that a catastrophic fire event is inevitable in Victoria unless action is taken now. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later time. </PARA>

Why has the government decided not to establish a proper independent inquiry into the serious allegations that have been made concerning the operations of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service by some of its former officers? Have their claims already been investigated by the government? Does the government agree that the Australian people need an assurance that ASIS is operating in accordance with its charter and in accordance with Australian law, and that a judicial inquiry with appropriate national security standards and safeguards is the best means of providing that assurance and recommending the most appropriate form of accountability?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not necessarily the case that an intelligent government responds immediately to a set of suggestions, propositions or whatever put in the context of a television program the night before. A government that is actually used to governing does not jump off the mark at the mere presentation of those statements. I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, has had a deal to say on this matter. Questions have been directed to him on it, and he has put out statements. He, of course, is the minister directly responsible for the operations of ASIS. So, as the honourable member knows&mdash;having had an opportunity through his colleagues, if he bothers to read their questions and the answers to them&mdash;he has an opportunity to find out the answers to those particular questions by questioning the relevant minister in the Senate.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Questions without notice shall be asked only of those Ministers who are rostered . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The point of order I take is that I understood the Leader of the House, by his reference to other ministers being responsible for this matter, to be suggesting that no minister present in the chamber can possibly be responsible. So he is seriously saying&mdash;Mr Speaker, I seek your guidance on this&mdash;that, as a result of the rostering, if a matter relating to national security is raised and the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs or his representative are not present, then there is nobody in this parliament, nobody on the government side, who is responsible for dealing with that question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and, indeed, I had the opportunity to visit his electorate last month. It is true that significant job opportunity does exist in the area of environmental management and related industries. It was against that background that this government introduced an employment program called LEAP&mdash;landcare and environment action program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our commitment to this program in the budget 1992-93 was $60 million. That has been spent and it saw the creation of 5,530 jobs. Because of the success of the program, in this current financial year 10,000 further jobs have been committed under the program. It has been a very successful initiative because it has enabled us to combine work on the environment and work that is important for regional areas in terms of economic development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Leichhardt referred to the rainforest reafforestation project, which came about because of this government's commitment to, on the one hand, preserving the wilderness and, on the other hand, recognising that there was a demand for certain species of timber that should be managed in a plantation sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We set about developing programs whereby we could achieve the win-win situation: preservation of the wilderness, therefore increasing the attraction of Far North Queensland to tourism, and the protection of the wilderness&mdash;a very strong environmental approach&mdash;but at the same time creating job opportunities by training people in planting particular species of rainforest timber that can grow faster in certain parts of the country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member were prepared to read the green paper he would understand the particular problem that we as a country are going through and which other countries have not followed. Because we have embarked on the process of structural reform much more strongly, the problem that has occurred in this nation is a twofold outcome of a significant increase in jobs but, at the same time, an increase in the numbers of unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the period from 1983 to now, the period that this Labor government has been in office, we have created 1.6 million jobs. Canada has got nowhere near that number. At the same time, we have taken the participation rate in the labour force from something like 59 per cent to 63 per cent. A one percentage point rise in the participation rate absorbs 88,000 jobs. So the 250,000 unemployed are more than taken up by the increase in the participation rate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent years, Telstra's public payphone business has not been able to generate a profit, due largely to the high cost of providing the service and ensuring that it meets its universal service obligation. Telstra has also significantly improved the payphone service quality, with availability improving from 65 per cent in 1988 to 93 per cent in 1993. I am sure the right honourable member for New England regularly uses the phonecard services which have been introduced by Telstra in recent days.</PARA></TALK.START>

In particular, I would point out that 20 per cent of payphone users do not have a home phone and make four times as many calls as other payphone users. In addition, a tariff increase for public payphones would have a most significant impact on low income people with no home phone. For these reasons, I had some discussions with Telstra about these particular issues. Telstra wrote to me on 16 February and withdrew its application in order to draw up a package which addresses these issues that I have outlined to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to commend Telstra for its initiative in showing some concern for low income earners who would be hardest hit by the proposed payphone increases. I have written to my colleague the Minister for Social Security seeking the assistance of his department in ensuring that we can develop some measures that assist low income earners. Once this issue has been satisfactorily resolved, I would expect Telstra to resubmit its application for an increase. I have also requested the assistance of the Minister for Social Security in exploring a long-term solution in making it easier for low income earners to have access to home phones.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal Legal Service is a private organisation and therefore does not come within the mandate of the Auditor-General. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission provides funding to the Aboriginal Legal Service. The service is obliged to submit financial returns that are audited in return for receiving those funds. In addition, under the recent changes to the ATSIC legislation, both the commissioners and the Office of Evaluation and Audit within ATSIC have a capacity to evaluate particular aspects of operations of the commission, including private operations of the commission, so that if there was any auditing per se to be done, it would be done from within the framework of ATSIC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's powers in relation to the Aboriginal Legal Service, in so far as they are there at all, go to the right to audit ATSIC itself. In the course of auditing ATSIC, as honourable members will be aware, the Auditor-General has enormous powers to seek information from the community generally, as well as from officers of the organisation. But I think it is probably true to say that, except via that indirect process, no aspect of the Aboriginal Legal Service would necessarily come within the ambit or mandate of the Auditor-General. It would come within the ambit, to some degree at least, of the audit operation within ATSIC itself.</PARA>

When a line relating to revenue that the government anticipates receiving from sales appears in the budget, it is sometimes argued that those figures are a little wobbly in the upward direction. In the course of the sale of those shares, in accordance with the anticipation in the last budget, the proceeds totalled some $1,686 million&mdash;that is $236 million greater than the estimates included in the 1993-94 budget. It was an outstanding success, particularly compared to the amount that we had anticipated spending on selling those shares. The cost of managing the sale was only $14.5 million&mdash;less than one per cent of the total proceeds and $21 million less than was allocated in the budget.

The House would be aware of the important COAG meeting that will be taking place in Hobart later this week&mdash;micro reform is high on the agenda.

We as a nation have to commit now to that strategy to ensure that the jobs required in the future will be serviced by a range of skills in the workplace. If we do not commit now, the reality is that we will add to inflationary pressures unnecessarily, and we will add to the increase of imports into our economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been done to date in this area. There is an agreement with the states on a range of targets, particularly to expand the number of people going into post-secondary levels. This agreement builds on the success that this government has already achieved in increasing the numbers remaining on to year 12. In addition, we have established ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, which has the function of driving the skills formation agenda. We are committed to growth in TAFE funding. The Commonwealth, in the period 1992 to 1996, has said it will contribute an extra $1 billion in funding to TAFE. As my colleague the minister responsible for vocational training and schools indicated in the last session, we are already getting significant results in this area.</PARA>

If we can achieve this result, it will be good for young people in this country, it will be good for skilling the work force, it will be good for ensuring that we sustain our economic growth.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr BEDDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Hunter for his question. I also note your longstanding interest in this issue, Mr Speaker. Earlier there was a settlement between the Australian coal companies and the Japanese steel industry. Regrettably, that led to a decrease in both tonnage and price of coal. That came about due to a couple of issues. As we all know, one factor was the economic downturn or, in fact, the recession in Japan. That has had an impact on the demand for steel. The production of Japanese steel is down to about 90 million tonnes. Usually it is in excess of 100 million tonnes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem with the coking coal issue was that the Canadians were having long industrial disputes leading up to this year's negotiations. Those disputes have been settled. They were trying to get an increased share of the Japanese coking coal market, but they were not successful. The Australian industries were able to maintain market share, even though it was of a decreased amount of tonnage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of negotiations are now taking place and we hope that those dealing with steaming coal will conclude in the near future. The outlook for steaming coal is much more buoyant, as honourable members will know. I pay credit to the honourable member for Throsby and a number of other government members who spoke in a debate relating to this matter yesterday. I thought a number of members of the opposition made significant contributions too. The outlook for steaming coal is more favourable. Between now and the end of this century, the demand for steaming coal in our region will increase by in excess of 40 per cent. That is a very significant amount of additional steaming coal. The outlook for the price negotiations should be much more positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the Japanese steel industry, the Japanese power generation industry has not suffered any adverse economic effects. It is doing very well indeed. I have indicated that I expect those steaming coal prices to be maintained. We are trying to break the nexus. For many years coking coal was the pre-eminent coal that was sold to the Japanese. As the demand for steel has diminished, we are trying to ensure that we break the nexus between coking coal and steaming coal and that we get the true market price. Over the ensuing years, many of the other Asian nations will have a higher demand for steaming coal and Australia will be able to reap the benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though we have only five per cent of the world's resource of coal, we have 30 per cent of the world's trade. This is truly one of our great industries, even if some members of the opposition do not accept it. It is worth some $7 1/2 billion per annum, and I am sure it will continue to be a significant factor in the economic growth and recovery of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS> was approved by government earlier this month. It is the latest in a series of published documents in which this government has presented and explained the development of Australia's defence and strategic policies over the past decade. But this document is the first major step in the adaptation of our defence and strategic policies to the major changes now under way in the regional and global security environment following the end of the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS> looks ahead three to five years to assess the consequences for Australia's security of key strategic developments now under way globally and regionally, and it proposes policy approaches to meet those challenges over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the first part of a two-stage process. The second part is a white paper, which is now being prepared for government consideration. We expect that will be published later this year. It will look further ahead into the next century and set long-term approaches to maintaining our security and managing our defence resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the past 10 years Australia's defence forces have been developed to meet regional contingencies, not to fight the Cold War. But the end of the Cold War has set in train long-term processes which will profoundly change our regional strategic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to start adapting now to these emerging trends. Predictability in security matters has declined. Relationships are now more complex, fluid and uncertain. These are not necessarily unfavourable, but they do place new challenges on defence policy making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the fundamentals of regional security are reflected in two major trends. The first of these, flowing directly from the end of the Cold War, is the evolving role of outside powers in regional security affairs, particularly the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">America's continued engagement in the Asia-Pacific region is not in question. Despite big cuts, America will for the foreseeable future remain the strongest military power in the world by a wide margin. America will retain strong interests in the stability and security of the Asia-Pacific region. Those interests will remain fundamentally aligned not just with Australia's interest but with those of the region as a whole. Therefore, we are confident that America will remain strategically engaged in the Asia-Pacific region, making a very important contribution to maintaining peace and stability in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is clear that Americans do not see it as appropriate for them to shoulder alone the responsibility for guaranteeing Asia's security. They will support regional security initiatives, while maintaining their bilateral relationships. Increasingly over coming years regional countries, including Australia and our Asian neighbours, will need to take responsibility themselves for the basic elements of security in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major trend in regional security is the extraordinary economic growth in the region itself. Over the next 10 years, the strategic potential of the nations of the Asia-Pacific will increase significantly as their economies continue to grow and diversify. Their actual military capabilities are likely to increase, with many new capabilities already being introduced. So by early next century the strategic potential and military capacities of the nations of Asia are likely to be substantially increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These trends do not mean that our region is necessarily becoming less secure. On the contrary, the Asia-Pacific region today is stable, prosperous and dynamic. With a few exceptions, the countries of our region show strong economic growth, stable and effective government, and a commitment to peace, stability and freer trade. We have seen that commitment reflected in the development of institutions like APEC and the ASEAN regional forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, some serious problems remain, particularly on the Korean peninsula and also, for example, in the South China Sea. But the collapse of superpower rivalry has eased many tensions in the region, and effective cooperation has helped to resolve longstanding problems like Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have good reason to be confident about the security of our region. But we cannot be complacent. The fundamental conditions which support Asia-Pacific security are changing, slowly but in important ways. Security in the Asia-Pacific region will ultimately depend on the maintenance of a new and more complex set of interrelationships between the nations of the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear message of this review is that Australia's security, like its economic future, lies in and with our region. This means that we must be a participant, not an onlooker, in regional security and other areas. We must pursue our national interest through engaging with our region. The challenge for all the nations of the region is to expand their strategic engagement alongside each nation's commitment to its own national defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These developments have important ramifications for Australia's strategic policies which are set out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS>. I will deal with these first in summary, then in more detail. The strategic review confirms that the central focus of defence policy should be our capacity for national defence. This will continue to be pursued through a policy of defence self-reliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people expect that Australia should be able to defend itself and it is a fundamental requirement of a responsible government to ensure that the nation has this capability. The forces developed for the defence of Australia will also be able to contribute to global and regional activities consistent with our national interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next, a dominant theme of our defence policy will be increasing defence engagement with the region, with a growing focus particularly on South-East Asia. Our alliance with the United States also remains important, both for the way it enhances our capacity for national defence and for its contribution to regional security. We will continue to pursue alliance activities which sustain these mutually reinforcing priorities. Finally, the strategic review concludes that we must continue to support efforts to promote effective global security mechanisms, especially through the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the opening theme of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS>, which is national defence. It is clear that at the core of our ability to contribute to those key activities I have just outlined is the maintenance of a highly competent Defence Force equipped with advanced technology and structured for Australia's unique geo-strategic environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Defence Force of today is shaped by the rigorous application of planning principles enunciated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence of Australia 1987</EMPHASIS>. The most important of these principles is that we must be confident of being able to deal in a timely way with circumstances in the future. Moreover, our capability to defend our own territory is central to our standing in the region and to the role we can play as a partner in regional security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our strategy for the defence of Australia remains one of defence in depth. This strategy and our force structure planning give priority to presenting any adversary with a comprehensive array of military capabilities capable of independent defensive and offensive operations. Emphasis, therefore, is given to clearly focused intelligence and surveillance operations, to strong maritime and air defence capabilities and to highly mobile and capable land forces which can deal with hostilities quickly on our own terms. The capabilities for these roles determine the ADF's overall force structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To optimise our force structure, the development of the ADF will give a particular emphasis to the key principles of joint operations, the promotion of competence and professionalism, the selective application of advanced technology and a rigorous approach to preparedness. Major expansion of force projection capabilities by other nations for direct attack would require long lead times which would be clearly evident to us. Our intelligence monitoring and analysis plays a key role in assessing warning time for major conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A commitment to the defence of Australia includes a commitment to the industrial strength of this nation. The development of our defence science and industry are important elements of our self-reliant defence capability. Without support from defence science and industry, the sustainability of our combat support capabilities would be quickly eroded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is committed to developing in Australian industry an ability to support and maintain Defence Force equipment and, where appropriate, to produce it in Australia. The close relationship between defence industry and defence science will be an important factor in our ability to deliver the technological advances demanded by our defence requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this government's support for local industry, defence is now better able to draw on Australian industry. This is reflected in the considerable increase in local content for defence systems and equipment from 30 per cent a decade ago to 65 per cent today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence depends heavily on Australian industry for the provision of goods and services. Local shipbuilding and electronics industries are playing a major role in the delivery of many of our major defence platforms such as submarines and frigates. Defence is also looking to industry to provide maintenance and support of equipment and, through the commercial support program, to provide a range of support services, such as catering and base support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the next theme of this review, namely regional engagement. The recognition that our future security lies with our region, not against it, provides us with significant opportunities to enhance our national interests by contributing to regional security and enmeshing ourselves in this economically dynamic region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We intend to expand and accelerate our strategic engagement with our nearer region alongside our primary commitment to developing our self-reliant capacity for the defence of Australia. We are establishing closer relations with nations of the Asia-Pacific region&mdash;especially our neighbours in South-East Asia&mdash;across all aspects of national endeavour. The enhancement of these relationships will greatly strengthen our security. Their proximity is a factor in our security and their position as major trading partners contributes to our national well-being.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia in turn has much to contribute to regional security and the capabilities we have developed for our self-reliant defence will help support peace and stability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the preparation of this review, we undertook an unprecedented series of consultations with the countries of our nearer region. It was important that we understood regional views and perspectives, and that our thinking was understood and appreciated by our neighbours as a positive contribution to our mutual security goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same approach was taken with our alliance partners. This forward-looking, open approach is a touchstone of defence thinking under this government. It has paid significant dividends in our developing relationships with our region. The result is that Australia is better prepared than many other countries to face the realities of the post-Cold War world of today, a world that is more regionally focused than before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, the Asia-Pacific region has been changing rapidly in line with the aspirations of individual nations. Australia, as an active member of this region, must make the necessary adjustments to keep pace. In South-East Asia, we are developing defence relationships based on the concept of strategic partnership. We have long stressed the need for Australia to strengthen its linkages with its neighbours and comprehensively engage with the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We aim now to move beyond the framework of existing cooperative activities to consider new opportunities, including shared training, defence science and industry cooperation and procurement. This will increase our understanding of regional defence developments and encourage effective and responsible planning for self-reliance that will add to the strategic strength of the region as a whole. Clearly, the particular nature of the partnerships which develop will vary from country to country over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our relationship with Indonesia remains central to regional engagement. Priority will be given to the development of personal and professional relationships among senior officers on both sides, combined exercises, personnel exchanges, training and other activities which foster long-term mutual understanding at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The five-power defence arrangements remain relevant to our defence policy objectives of promoting regional security and are an important element in Australia's national engagement with our nearer region.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the Malaysia-Australia joint defence program and defence science and industry working group, we have a well-established and mutually beneficial defence relationship with Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With Singapore, the relationship has broadened substantially to include access to our training areas such as the Delamere air weapons range and Shoalwater Bay and to the collocation of Singapore Air Force personnel and 30 aircraft with existing Australian personnel at RAAF Pearce in Western Australia. This agreement, totally funded by the Singapore government, is a valuable extension of Australia's defence links with Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These increasing defence force and defence industry links with regional nations are an important indicator of the growing sense of regional strategic community. It serves our interests and that of regional countries to pursue the development of such links. Such activities represent the type of openness that is one of the building blocks of regional stability and security. More broadly, the Association of South East Asian Nations will be central to efforts by regional countries to achieve workable and common approaches on regional security issues. The establishment last July of the ASEAN Regional Forum was an important step in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With New Zealand, we will seek to maintain a strong defence relationship based on the longstanding commitment of each nation to the security of the other. Our efforts to promote our shared defence interests and commitments will be based on our program of closer defence relations and the coordination of our policies throughout the region. We will also maintain strategic commitment to Papua New Guinea and the other south-west Pacific states, with a focus on cooperation, which assists in promoting national resilience and increases the capacity of these nations to deal with security problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further afield, the increasing power and influence of the major Asian powers such as Japan, the People's Republic of China and India, require Australia to develop constructive contact with these countries in the security field. In particular, we need to understand their interests and gain their understanding of Australia's objectives in enhancing regional security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuation of a US strategic role in the Asia-Pacific region remains a critical element for the future security of Australia and our region. Our alliance relationship with the United States is the next key theme of the review, with an emphasis on its importance in the context of a shared commitment to security in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia's defence relationship with the United States helps maintain US strategic links with this part of the world and thereby contributes to regional stability. It is also of enduring significance for our national strategic posture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our alliance with the United States continues to be an important factor in the development of Australia's defence capabilities. Both countries acknowledge the continuing importance of our security cooperation under the ANZUS treaty, including the continuing relevance and value of the mutual security obligations embodied in the treaty and our close consultation on issues of mutual security concern. The nature of the relationship continues to evolve, as it has over the past five decades, but it has grown ever stronger. This is a reflection of the depth of our shared values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Australian industry is increasing its ability to support the Australian Defence Force, a number of weapons platforms and technologies in our defence inventory are purchased from and supported by the United States. We could not afford to produce such systems locally. The Joint Defence Facilities and our intelligence relationship with the United States remain valuable factors in our security and they continue to make a major contribution to global and regional security. Australia's defence science activities benefit strongly from cooperation with the United States, both bilaterally and through the technical cooperation program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final theme of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS> concerns our support for the United Nations and wider national efforts to promote mechanisms that contain the spread of weapons of mass destruction. An Australian contribution to international efforts to keep or restore peace is consistent with our interests. Our participation in peace support operations is a tangible demonstration of our commitment to the peaceful resolution of international conflicts, one of our major foreign policy goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When peace support operations occur within our own region, Australian involvement also reinforces our position as a participant in and contributor to regional security, which is one of our major defence goals. Working together with regional states on peacekeeping operations&mdash;as, for example, in Cambodia&mdash;adds to a sense of regional security and reinforces our capability to act in concert in other situations if needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are limits to the amount of peacekeeping to which we can commit. Our level of contribution should not blind us to one basic point: such activities are supplementary to the central role of the Australian Defence Force in the direct defence of Australia and its interests and the promotion of those interests within our neighbourhood. Each request we receive for our participation in a peace support operation must, therefore, be considered on it own merits and with a very clear understanding of its implications for our national interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, a word about resources. In recent years Defence has made highly innovative and successful reforms to maximise efficiencies and maintain investment and capabilities broadly in line with our long-term defence policy, despite significant reductions in financial guidance. These efforts will continue, and intensify. But the maintenance of a self-reliant defence capability that can protect Australia, contribute to the security of our wider region, and support the United Nations will require continued commitment by the Commonwealth and the people of Australia to adequate sustained defence funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS> is the first comprehensive post-Cold War assessment of Australia's strategic outlook. Work has now begun on the Defence white paper, to be released later this year. It will take account of the key assessments and broad policy framework in the strategic review and from these develop detailed planning guidance for Defence into the first decade of the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will review and, if necessary, revise our basic planning concepts to ensure they fit our evolving strategic environment, and provide planning guidance on force structure development, management of regional and alliance relationships, and industry, science and personnel policy.

I know that the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer)&mdash;one of my predecessors in this portfolio&mdash;want the opportunity to speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As these are my first remarks in the House on defence issues, I make it very clear that, where the coalition supports a government policy on defence issues, I on behalf of the coalition will not hesitate to say so. Such declarations from the opposition are never controversial and so receive little media coverage. But it is important that the coalition's support for Australia's defence effort is fully and publicly recorded. This is not bipartisanship, but it does recognise the importance of public support for the Australian defence effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policy document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Strong Australia</EMPHASIS>, an excellent document for which my colleague the honourable member for Mayo was so largely responsible, details our approach to major defence issues. The honourable member for Mayo is in the chamber and I again note his continuing interest in these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To score a political point at the time of the election the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, went to great lengths to point out where the coalition's defence policy explicitly endorses existing government policy. He enjoyed making his political point but, in doing so, he obviously does not appreciate that it is in the national interest for the coalition to publicly support those aspects of policy with which we agree. Obviously, where we do disagree with government policies, we will not be slow in challenging the government to address its reasons. Time is short, so I now want to turn to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it is old wine in a new bottle and is really entirely predictable&mdash;I predicted it myself on Sunday and in an article yesterday in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the coalition does agree with some very important aspects of the strategic assessment. The end of the Cold War is now officially acknowledged in the government's strategic thinking and is recorded in this document. That is an important official assessment. It is important because it provides the basis from which a number of assessments can be made in respect of the global security position and, critically, as that impacts on Australia's region. This recognition is certainly well overdue. This review is the first such review since the end of the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the opposition have repeatedly called for the government to acknowledge one of the defining moments of the 20th century and certainly the end of the 20th century&mdash;the collapse of the Soviet Union and the implications of that both globally and regionally. In 1992, as we made this call on the government, it scoffed at the suggestion that it should update its strategic review. The minister was saying, `That is pretty obvious; we will do that in 1993'. Yet it is only because of continued opposition pressure that finally, two years later, we have this belated recognition of a critical fact in the strategic assessment. Following the logic of the thrust of the strategic assessment brings us from an assessment following the end of the Cold War to considering regional issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the second aspect of this report that has the endorsement of the coalition. There is no question that the end of the Cold War has both created uncertainties and provided some beneficial results. For example, in our own region, the near resolution of the Cambodian conflict has arisen as a result of the fracturing of the USSR sponsored client-state relationships and obviously the relationship with Vietnam. That is a beneficial result. But some uncertainties have been generated as we have seen the end of the great ideological battle of the 20th century between the two economic systems. It means that in our own region there are differential consequences, but those consequences need to be factored into the thinking which underpins Australia's strategic assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, the government has now officially endorsed for the region the 1992 policy initiative of the coalition entitled `Cooperative regional defence'. That document is perhaps most significant for its acknowledgment of the importance of such a policy stance in our future relations with our regional neighbours. Such a regional mechanism, in our view, should seek to complement rather than replace the network of existing security alliances of individual countries of the region. I stress that a regional mechanism can never be a substitute for a strong Australian Defence Force capable of independent action. Cooperative regional defence needs to be a carefully worked out program developed in consultation with regional partners to ensure that it is more than a rhetorical flourish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say in passing that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS> was prepared during the calendar year 1993, and we certainly welcome the transparent approach adopted by the government by being prepared to discuss with some of our neighbours the contents of the document prior to its public release. That is a low cost but an important means by which we can build a close and working dialogue with our regional neighbours. I endorse that aspect of the preparation of this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before going on to financial issues which are commented upon towards the end of the strategic review and which were also mentioned by the minister in his tabling statement, I flag a number of matters which invite further comment and analysis arising out of the review. Of the 60 pages of the document and the 15 pages of annexures, only three pages&mdash;admittedly a stand-alone chapter, chapter 4&mdash;were devoted to the alliance with the United States. The minister in his tabling statement said that the alliance with the United States is a key theme&mdash;obviously it is and one which we very strongly endorse&mdash;and that it has grown stronger in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We not only have initiated the cooperative regional defence concept but strongly support it. In doing so, we would not want in any way to distract from the strength of our relationship with the United States. That is an enduring aspect of Australia's security arrangements. We would go further than the government and say that a number of practical, sensible things could be done which would enhance what is already a strong relationship. The coalition policy document for the last election listed a series of measures&mdash;including, for example, the pre-positioning of equipment by the Americans in northern parts of Australia as one small but useful measure which could be undertaken after consultation with the Americans and which would generally enhance the relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that Australia and the United States have a strong relationship, which obviously has bipartisan support, but I do not think there ought to be any gilding of the lily. Where opportunities to improve that relationship can be undertaken, they should be undertaken. From time to time we have cameo events which make us wonder whether or not the language of the report is as succinct, precise and concise as it ought to be. For example, recently in the Senate the Minister for Defence referred to his expectations about the future of Nurrungar. A few days later, his statement was contradicted by military authorities in Washington. That issue receives a very bare mention in this strategic assessment. It does get a mention by the minister, but I think a clearer statement from him as to the future of those facilities at Nurrungar would be welcomed by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of the very bare chapter on the United States is the trading relationship and the end of GATT. I mention it because the export enhancement program has been a matter of controversy and public debate in Australia. I would have thought that, as this document has just been endorsed by the cabinet in 1994, and as GATT was concluded at the end of 1993, some passing reference to the prospects of a diminution in the EEP in the future might have been made in the three pages of chapter 4 in respect of trade issues. Trade issues as they impact on the US-Japanese relationship are mentioned elsewhere in the document. I think they could have been usefully mentioned in chapter 4 in respect of Australia's alliance with the Americans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategic review can also be looked at from a point of view of what is not in the document. One of the measures which I have noticed is the reference to Australia's strategic review in 1989, during which there was a lot of discussion about community involvement in Australia's defence effort. Obviously, the defence effort is a multifaceted effort. In this document, we properly see mention of the defence industry and the work of Australian scientists backing up our defence effort. There should also be a general reference to the importance of community and public support for the defence effort, but it does not get a mention in this document. Perhaps there may be some embarrassment in some quarters of the government about the closure of certain bases around the country where there has been a community backlash because their opportunity to participate in Australia's defence effort has been reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third factor that ought to be mentioned is the question of the air-sea gap to our north. On a first reading of this document, there seems to be a potential shift in thinking as to the control of the air-sea gap as opposed to previous strategic assessments. A policy of denial seems to be a more accurate description of the general approach which our strategic planners take to those areas to the north of Australia. I only flag it; it is only a question at this stage. On my second reading of this document, I flagged a number of points, which I think further debate will elucidate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fourth point to be flagged is how this strategic assessment will impact on the white paper. I suspect that, from the government's point of view, this two-stage process has its benefits, as the assessment ends up being not quite right. In the white paper we might see a little shift in that assessment in order to match the final policy position. The honourable member for Groom will correct me if I am wrong, but I think they call that situating the appreciation, as opposed to appreciating the situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I know the acronyms, I will tell everyone. That is an important point, because this document says that this strategic assessment is for a three- to five-year time span. It forms the basis for the white paper, which sets out the government's policy on equipment purchases and the general stance of the defence force, yet the white paper is likely to be predicated on a 10- or 15-year time span. So we have a document produced in 1993 which gives a strategic assessment. The government says the white paper will be out this year. If we assume that the white paper will come out in early 1995, which is probably more accurate, this assessment will be two years out of date. It has only a three- to five-year time span. If the white paper is clearly predicated and premised on this document, as it is said to be, it seems to me that the two-stage process of the strategic assessment may create some difficulties. Only time will reveal that, but it is an important point to watch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document is longer than the last one; it touches on many issues and is perhaps a more comprehensive effort. A lot of other issues and assessments are made in this document which I think need further examination. For example, one colleague said to me that some of the comments about PNG and Bougainville were blunter than expected. I am interested to hear more of that assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by mentioning the money involved in this review, because it is one thing to have an assessment and an ongoing program, but, ultimately, these things all have to be paid for. A lot of people close to the issue will be asking themselves whether this is just a case of champagne tastes on a beer drinker's income. Reading between the lines, I have a suspicion that whilst this document approaches the strategic issues in the way that it does it may be softening us up for some further defence expenditure cuts in the future. That seems to me to be the thrust and the general direction. It is one thing to make an assessment, but the government has made these assessments before. It has been talking about a cooperative regional defence for 12 or 18 months, and this is the first official statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Mayo has said on a number of occasions, if we look at how much money the government has actually put into closer regional cooperation in the ASEAN area, we find that it has been peanuts&mdash;$15 million one year; $16 million the next. A budget is coming out in May. If we do not see a greater commitment, all of this will be hot air and all the headlines in the last few days will be of interest today but fish and chips tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broader point is that if we are to have comprehensive and adequate defence policy, commitment and capability then they have to be paid for. That has implications for the coalition as well. In my view, we have a good record. A fair measure of defence expenditure is to equate it as a measure of gross domestic product. During the Fraser years, defence expenditure as a percentage of GDP was 2.4, 2.4, 2.3, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6. In 1983-84 it started at 2.6 for the first four years, and since then they have been 2.3, 2.1, 2.1 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.3. If the figure remains at 2.3 or less, it will mean that during the Hawke-Keating years defence expenditure as a percentage of GDP never rose above that spent during the Fraser years. Furthermore, except for the first four years of the 13-year period of the Hawke-Keating government, defence expenditure has been lower than that in any of the Fraser years. We were quite right in the last election to argue for expenditure restraint and for a recommitment of funds to a combat end, but I think we are also right to review it, because the government, after saying that the cuts were vandalism, has made cuts. The strategic review requires a further review. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, the Australian Bureau of Statistics published one of the most miserable sets of data that I think we have seen in this country in a very long time. I suspect it will not receive a great deal of publicity because we are getting increasingly used to this sort of bad news in Australia. The Bureau of Statistics today revealed that the number of long-term unemployed in Australia has tripled over the last four years. It is really worth our while reflecting on that barren statistic&mdash;that the number of long-term unemployed has tripled over the last four years. One of the most damning indictments of the Hawke-Keating years is that they allowed that sort of underclass to develop in our society. In 1973, 3.6 per cent of the unemployed were long-term unemployed. In August 1993, 36.5 per cent of the unemployed were long-term unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to compare Australia's record with that of other countries. The Labor Party has tried to transmit a message to Australians, `All right, we have high unemployment in Australia but everybody else has high unemployment, so what?'. One of the enduring features of the debate about unemployment in this country is going to be the fact that we have a disproportionately high level of long-term unemployment. In the United States, the long-term unemployed make up around 11 per cent of total unemployment. The figure is 36 1/2 per cent in Australia. In Canada, the figure is similar to that of the United States and, in Britain, the long-term unemployed make up about 28 per cent of the total unemployed. Again, I remind the House that, in Australia, it is now 36.5 per cent. So for all of the Labor Party's denunciation of the Thatcher years and these sorts of things the fact is that, in the United Kingdom, the underclass that long-term unemployment has created is proportionately very much smaller than the underclass the Labor Party has created in Australia. This will, of course, be an important issue to the voters in the Fremantle and Bonython by-elections in particular, because in those electorates&mdash;more, I suspect, than in Mackellar and Warringah&mdash;reside the unemployed and in particular the long-term unemployed. </PARA>

It said that there would be no new taxes if the Labor Party were elected but that, if the Liberals and the Nationals were elected, we would get the GST. We all know the government ran an outrageous scare campaign about that. Let us forget the scare campaign and just focus on what the Labor Party said, and that is that there would be no increases in tax. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that kind of political morality is utterly reprehensible. It is one of the reasons&mdash;if you like, the overwhelming reason&mdash;that Australians are so cynical about the political process in this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may be interested to reflect on the political strategy behind what the Labor Party has been doing. That was all revealed in an article written by Dr John Edwards. Those on the other side of the House will know who their mate John Edwards is. He is the Prime Minister's economic adviser. In an article which was published in a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Governing in the 1990s</EMPHASIS>, he basically let the cat out of the bag. He revealed what Labor's strategy is. I thought it was an extraordinarily candid article. He said that economic policy under Labor has:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . involved a good deal of opinion management, often of a sophisticated kind, especially the exploitation of public fears or widely held misconceptions to advance objectives which would otherwise be difficult to attain.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to refer to the process as&mdash;and I use his word&mdash;`manipulation'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . with one rationale for action giving way to another more sophisticated one as each was successively undermined by fact and experience.</PARA>
<PARA>He added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Very often the personal success of politicians or the continued electoral success of the government depends on the ability of the cabinet members and their officials to persuade us to see the world as they wish us to see it and then, when reality intrudes, to persuade us to see it in a somewhat different way without noticing the change or being annoyed by the contradiction.</PARA>
<PARA>They are not the words of the opposition; they are the words of the Prime Minister's economic adviser. These words basically summarise clearly the quite devious, insincere and dishonest way that the Labor Party has managed economic policy over the last 11 years and I think, in particular, over the last 12 to 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation now where members of the Labor Party, particularly those on the backbench but some of the ministers and cabinet ministers as well, are saying that they need increases in spending. There are new programs that they have to put more money into, such as programs for the long-term unemployed, regional initiatives and the so-called Mabo social justice package. After 11 years in office&mdash;it is not as though it is a new government&mdash;government members have suddenly decided they had better focus their minds on unemployment. After 11 years they have decided it is about time they gave some thought to regional Australia. After 11 years!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Labor Party's answer to any problem? It is to increase spending. Government members always want to throw money at a problem. It does not matter where it comes from, as long as a dollar is spent it must be a good thing. But how are they going to do it? How are they going to raise the money in order to do this? The left of the Labor Party, which includes the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), a number of other cabinet ministers and, of course, a significant proportion of the backbench, told us at the weekend what its members want to do. They want to effectively increase the company tax rate; they want to impose what they euphemistically describe as a jobs tax&mdash;that is just a tax rise; and they want to increase as well a range of other income taxes. When we ask members of the cabinet such as the Treasurer (Mr Willis)&mdash;today we have the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear)&mdash;or the Prime Minister whether they will rule out these measures proposed by the left wing of the Labor Party, they refuse to do so. They will not rule those increases out despite the fact that they promised Australians at the time of the last election there would be no increases in tax. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not one member of the backbench was asked about the tax policy to be taken to the next election. The instincts of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) were right&mdash;he at least got it right&mdash;but he changed; he should have stuck with his instincts. The simple fact is that the honourable member for Mayo got everyone down in the party room, got out this big dead cat of a policy and chucked it in. The marginal members of the Liberal Party would have needed smelling salts once they had seen his policy. The people of Australia knew what he was on about. He was about raising taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out in the party room this morning that only two members of the Liberal Party have served in government. One of them, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), is the world's worst Treasurer. This is how far the Liberal Party has come. In 1994, he is still a contender for the leadership of the Liberal Party. He is the world's worst Treasurer!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he was Treasurer in 1983&mdash;we will always remember this&mdash;he presided over the bottom of the harbour tax systems. We were the laughing stock of the Western world. Only in Australia, they said, could the rich have the option of paying tax. They were not our words&mdash;they were not Labor Party words&mdash;they were the words of the royal commissioner. The system is different today and the honourable member knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mayo mentioned Fremantle. In my home state of Western Australia, they will not have a bar of the honourable member for Bennelong. They remember when he went back and tried to get the bottom of the harbour tax schemes. The fundraising committee for the Western Australian Liberal Party read like a who's who of the bottom of the harbour tax system. That is why opposition members from Perth will always vote for either Bronwyn Bishop or the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). They will never vote for the honourable member for Bennelong in Western Australia because they remember what a useless Treasurer he was. They will never forgive him for going back on the bottom of the harbour scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mayo does not understand the imputation system. He has difficulty in getting his facts straight on compliance costs. We on this side of the House are wondering what will happen when Bronwyn Bishop comes into the house as the new member. Will he be leading the debate in these MPIs or will she?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the economy. Listening to the honourable member for Mayo would make one think there was doom and gloom all over the place. But the simple message is this: consumer confidence is up; business investment is up; company profits are up; business expectations are up; and retail trade is up. Let us go through a few of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumer confidence is at a six-year high. In the last eight months the index of consumer confidence has gone up 20 per cent. Company profits are 90 per cent higher than they were in 1991. Business expectations&mdash;which is very important in terms of business investment&mdash;for the March quarter are all up. Retail trade in the December quarter is once again up by almost two per cent. Job vacancies are up. The trends of the ANZ, ABS and DEET figures all record strong growth in recent months. In fact, in January employment went up by 22,000 and over the year to January it was up by 187,000. All this done with inflation at two per cent!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see that the economy is growing particularly strongly. Employment growth is up; consumer confidence is up; and private investment is picking up&mdash;all with an inflation rate of two per cent. Something the opposition could never do in government was to get inflation into single figures, let alone down to two per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition, of course, is always intent on talking the economy down. Anyone who listened to the honourable member for Mayo would think that they were in a different country altogether. The simple fact is that, around here when the opposition talks about the economy, no-one is listening. No-one could care what those opposite say about the economy. In fact, around here the Leader of the Opposition is invariably known as `double dip Hewson'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He first made the prediction of a double dip in November 1992. In that month he made the leap from recession into depression when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This country has been thrown into a prolonged recession. I think we are now in danger of drifting into a depression.</PARA>
<PARA>On a number of occasions in January and February 1993 the Leader of the Opposition started to predict that unemployment would go to 12 per cent plus. None of those predictions ever came true. But not content with that, in February and May of 1993 he was back to his double dip prediction again. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All this talk about how the economy is growing very strongly is just dead wrong.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, with the benefit of hindsight we can see who was just dead wrong: it was the Leader of the Opposition once again. On all of the predictions that he has made about the economy, he has been wrong on every occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell the honourable member about the policies of the government. I am glad he is here to listen to this. He sat through most of the debate at the time and opposed a lot of it. I can remember those divisions over the changes we made to the taxation system to put some decency back into it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that, since we have been in government, we have changed the taxation system. It is a much more effective, efficient and fairer tax system now than the riddled mess that we inherited back in 1983. As I said, back in those days it was optional whether the wealthy paid tax at all. Another royal commissioner pointed out that the fastest growing industry in Australia was the tax avoidance industry. How is that for a record on taxation? And those opposite wonder why they have been sitting in opposition since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since we came into government we have broadened the income tax base and we have lowered the tax rates. In 1983 the top tax rate was 60 per cent. It is now back to 47 per cent. But, more importantly, when we became the government in 1983 the bottom tax rate was 30 per cent; now it is 20 per cent. This was all done by broadening the tax base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We always remember the tax reforms that went through the parliament, although I am not sure whether the honourable member for Mayo was here. When we put through the capital gains tax provisions, we had to do it fighting the Liberal Party all the way. In fact, the opposition tried to make an election issue out of it in 1984. As the government of the day, we said that we would keep all our options open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We remember back in 1980 when those opposite ran a shameless campaign. At that time they lied to the people of Australia. They said that we were going to put a capital gains tax on their houses. Nothing could be further from the truth. The federal government of the day stuck with an open policy and open intentions in terms of the capital gains tax. It is now in; it is a fair system; and it is now part of the taxation system. It is not challenged by anybody out in the community. It is only people in the Liberal Party who want to change the capital gains tax. Of course, there was also the fringe benefits tax issue where people could structure their incomes so that they paid only tax on the cash component of it. Opposition members opposed that here and they opposed it in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the statistic that hurts&mdash;I understand why the honourable member for Mayo is leaving. He is always talking about the fact that we are a high taxing government. Why, if we are such a high taxing government, are we the lowest taxed nation in the OECD? Back in 1986 Australia was the sixth lowest taxing country in the OECD. Today we are the lowest taxed country in the OECD. We have achieved that position with a comprehensive social program that has lifted pensions, that has seen Medicare maintained and that has seen all of the income support in terms of jobsearch allowance not only maintained but increased&mdash;and with all of those reforms that we have made to the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have a look at the government's fiscal strategy, we see that the last budget set the parameters for the next three years or the medium term. We wanted to make sure that the federal government gave the fiscal stimulus when it was needed; that is, as the economy is growing. We added a fiscal stimulus at that time with a view to winding back the budget deficit to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. That has been accepted not only in the community but also more widely by the business community. At the time, after the Liberal Party had dealt itself out of a deal by opposing everything, the business community came out and said that the budget strategy was correct and they endorsed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is this: we never ever hear from the opposition any proposals about what it might do in government. It has been just about a year since the election. There is absolutely nothing we could ask any opposition member about any of their policies. I will pose a question for the next speaker. Those opposite talk about high taxes. The fact is that we have brought business tax down from 46 per cent to 33 per cent, along with a dividend imputation system to make sure that the profits on companies are not taxed twice. Those opposite were going to lift the rate to 42 per cent. Talk about a high taxing party. The opposition is the high taxing party. It went to the last election with a 42 per cent company tax rate. Maybe the next speaker can tell us a little bit about the opposition's tax policy, if he knows anything about it. Is the opposition going to keep that policy of lifting the company tax from 33 per cent to 42 per cent or is it going to do something else? What is it going to do?  Nobody around here would know, of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about lowering taxes, it is not only personal taxes that have gone down but, importantly, company tax has gone down. With a dividend imputation system in place, we know that we are giving Australian businesses the best chance of making sure that they compete out in the wider world. That is complemented by other policy initiatives which include: the 150 per cent deduction for research and development; pooled development funds; concessions to assist investments in small businesses; 10 per cent development allowance for large projects; 10 per cent investment allowance for qualifying plant and equipment ordered before 1 July 1994; accelerated depreciation, particularly for assets with long effective lives; increased write-off allowances for hotels and factories from 2 1/2 per cent to four per cent; the introduction of a 2 1/2 per cent write-off allowance for structural improvements; and tax advantages for infrastructure borrowings. All of those elements have been put in place, along with a much more competitive and fairer taxation system, to make sure that Australia is a more effective place in terms of its business and to make sure that people out in the wider community understand that Australia does have a fair and efficient taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mayo, who submitted this matter of public importance today, seems to think that he could ask a question in question time yesterday, race out and do a doorstop and claim that the Prime Minister refused to rule out tax increases in the budget. Robert Garran reports that the honourable member for Mayo made the claim that this is going to be a great issue in by-elections. The simple fact is that the Liberal Party has never learnt that it cannot impose issues on by-elections or elections from here; what it really should be doing is going out and listening to people to see what they believe the issues are in by-elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was it not revealing when the Liberal Party picked its candidate for Fremantle? It said, `Local issues will be important, won't they?'. The candidate said, `Yes, they will'. The next question asked was, `What are they?'. He replied, `I don't know'. The Liberal Party is so good that it must go looking under rocks for the sorts of people who stand in by-elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The by-elections around Australia will be fought on issues such as unemployment and who is believed to be better placed to run this country. I predict that the Labor Party will do well in all of the elections that it contests. It will not be because of anything that is said in here; it will be because the people out there understand that we have a government in place that knows how to govern. By contrast, the opposition has no policies. It has three or four leaders.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One thing that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has just told the House for certain is that these by-elections will be fought on unemployment and this government's record. The people who will vote in their electorates over the next month or six weeks will recall how very carelessly this government handles the truth. We are not allowed to call the government liars in this place. We cannot say that it tells lies. We cannot say that it lied about taxes at the last election. But in my previous place of employment my boss used to say to me, `This fellow handles the truth very carelessly'. That is exactly what this government does. It has made that a trademark of its performance in governing this country over the last 10 years. It handles the truth very carelessly. It does not matter whether government members are talking about economic figures, economic forecasts or unemployment figures. They put a spin on it to suit themselves. At this stage the Australian people are starting to wake up to what it is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer spoke about the so-called economic recovery. He espoused different forecasts and reports from different organisations about consumer confidence and business confidence. I do not know where he gets his information from, but I am sure it has come from the cocoon of the bureaucracy in Canberra. If government members go into the electorates and talk to small business people, the PAYE salary earners, they will discover that these people do not know when the recovery is coming; they have not felt its arrival yet. So we call it a so-called economic recovery. If we are to have this recovery, there must be business confidence and consumer confidence. I disagree with the Assistant Treasurer that the recovery exists now. The people I talk to are not telling me that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must also be solid private investment. It worries me that private investment is the missing link in the current so-called economic recovery. The private sector is being forced to rely totally on foreign savings to fund investment at a time when competition for the world's savings is at an all-time high and when the risks in investing in Australia are high and getting higher because of our large current account deficit and foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After more than 10 years of this government, we have seen nothing but increased taxes and increased spending. This is a high taxing, high spending government that I am quite sure is the greatest impediment to economic growth and recovery in this nation at the moment. The Assistant Treasurer talked about our position on taxation in relation to the OECD and the Western world. The Pacific rim is becoming our trading area. Why do we not compare ourselves with the South-East Asian nations? Under this Labor government, taxation revenue increased from $45.1 billion in 1983-84 to $89.2 billion in 1992-93. That figure has almost doubled while the Labor Party has been in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Levels of taxation in Australia are almost twice as high as the average for the east Asian region. For example, according to the latest International Monetary Fund data, central government taxation in east Asia in 1990 averaged 14.3 per cent of GDP compared with 24.7 per cent in Australia in the same period. With state and local government taxation revenue included, tax as a proportion of GDP in Australia was 31.4 per cent in 1990-91. How can businesses operate under that strain? How can PAYE salary earners operate under that strain? The Assistant Treasurer was talking about the changes to the taxation regime that this government has introduced. What he did not talk about were the changes to indirect taxation that this government has introduced. That is where it is picking up the revenue and it will continue this year. The people of Australia may as well be aware of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government must urgently address the issue of increasing taxes and must put a hold on its policy of high taxing and high spending. The question must be asked: when will this government make a believable commitment to the people of Australia not to increase taxes? In particular, the government must reject pushes for more taxes on business in the upcoming budget&mdash;pushes from sections of the Labor Party and the labour movement which have absolutely no idea what it takes for the private sector and for individuals to generate income and, ultimately, wealth for this nation. They do not understand what it takes to generate that income and wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increases in business tax will have two effects: they will make Australia far less competitive and they will leave Australian companies with fewer resources to invest and, ultimately, to employ people. We heard from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) about the terrible indictment of this government that unemployment is. This government has overseen the worst 10 years in Australia's history of unemployment levels. Today we heard the terribly sad figure that 36 per cent of the total number of people unemployed in Australia are long-term unemployed. This nation will have to deal with that for many years to come. It is something for which this nation will remember this government for many decades to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Left must wake up and recognise that an increase in company tax will cost jobs, not create them. The jobs tax will cost jobs, not generate them. When will the Labor government make a believable commitment not to increase taxes? On 16 January 1994, Mr Ian Spicer, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is just a nonsense to continue with a wholesale sales tax, excise and payroll taxes, when their effect is to push up the cost and therefore the price of goods and services we want to sell to the rest of the world . . . To maintain a tax system that increases costs is asking business to compete with the best in the world with one hand securely tied . . . The tax law must be simplified. Tax law has grown enormously both in its size and complexity and the sheer cost of compliance by business is crippling. This operates as a significant restraint on any growing business.</PARA>
<PARA>Taxes on businesses are not only too high but also too complex. I am a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which recently released a report recommending changes to simplify the tax laws. This Labor government must show some real leadership and simplify the tax laws and not just shelve this report to gather dust. If the government does not simplify the tax system urgently, it will continue to be a greater burden to business than the archaic and overcomplex tax system that it oversees. I understand that the Labor Left has recommended for this year's budget an increase in company tax. I also understand that it wants a restoration of the 60 per cent marginal tax rate for employees who earn more than $75,000, as well as the well-documented jobs tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fuel excise continues to rise this year. This government must review further tax increases on fuel excise that will occur on 1 August this year&mdash;a further 2c a litre for leaded petrol and 1c a litre for unleaded petrol. It is criminal. The so-called good news Treasurer (Mr Willis) could address this issue in this year's budget if he had the desire to do so. Fuel increases will be damaging to commerce and industry, particularly in regional and rural areas of Australia. It will make regional Australia less competitive and it will reduce the export potential of Australia. This is a sad indictment of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the comments of the Assistant Treasurer when he referred to the way the government had restructured the taxation system. It may have restructured the direct taxation system, but let it be known that it has certainly restructured the indirect taxation system. In the Labor Party's term in office, we have seen federal government revenue on fuel rise from about 7c a litre to 41c a litre. When we are paying 69.5c a litre for fuel in Sydney, the government is getting 41c a litre. How much is being spent on roads? Nowhere near that much&mdash;probably about 7c or 8c a litre. Where is the rest going? It is going to prop up the government's big spending programs that it does not have the guts to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth repeating and stating as clearly as possible in this public forum that if the coalition were in government it would not increase the burden of tax in Australia. We see that sales tax is going to rise again later this year. Again there will be more indirect taxes. Prior to the last election&mdash;and this shows the careless way this government has handled the truth&mdash;we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the then Treasurer say, `What I am promising is not to put up tax', `I do not think the incidence of tax should rise' and `We will not be introducing new taxes'. Those statements were made prior to March 1993. We have seen nothing but the opposite since this government was re-elected.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a very effective time wasting tactic by the honourable member for Bennelong. So let us have a look at what the opposition has said about policy. What those opposite have hidden in the cupboard is one big GST. They cannot meet the sorts of commitments that they talk about in this House unless they bring in a GST and that is why it was in Fightback. So what has the coalition had to say about its position on Fightback? On 30 November last year the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . John Hewson's still committed to the basic sense and direction . . . that we took to the last election. . . . the broad approach is pretty much the same in terms of the principles.</PARA>
<PARA>Kerry O'Brien asked him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You weren't always quite so coy about this spectrum question. In 1986, you told writer, Craig McGregor: `I'm clearly on the right of the Liberal Party; I'm a pragmatic dry. I like competition. There's nothing like putting your balls on the line'.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, there is no doubt he likes the competition with the 56 members on the opposition frontbench. He certainly likes that competition. The basic point is that the Leader of the Opposition is still committed to Fightback. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline </EMPHASIS>interview continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">KERRY O'BRIEN: But you haven't changed philosophically?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOHN HEWSON&mdash;No. The basic direction's the same although I think, having reflected on it, words like right and dry don't mean all that much now.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know why that is the case. Members of the opposition frontbench are now all running around pretending that they have thrown Fightback out the door, that they are now compassionate, that they do not oppose labour market programs, that they do not oppose family allowance payments and that they do not oppose pensions and all those things that the taxation policies of this government deliver to people who live in places like Fremantle and Bonython. Further in that interview it is very instructive:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">KERRY O'BRIEN&mdash;. . . what are the principles and the directions of Fightback that still prevail?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOHN HEWSON&mdash;Well, we still stand by the need to cut government expenditure . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">KERRY O'BRIEN&mdash;Massively?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOHN HEWSON&mdash;Well, massively is your word.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">KERRY O'BRIEN&mdash;Well, ten billion over three years . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOHN HEWSON&mdash;Well, obviously, we're reviewing a lot of those cuts . . . But let's understand it. The issue was a smaller and more efficient and more responsive public sector.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the policy of the Liberal Party. So the policy of the Liberal Party has not essentially changed. The Liberal Party is still committed to massive public sector cuts. So when those opposite go out to Bonython and Fremantle they should tell the people what programs they are going to be taking away. Those opposite should tell the people, secretly, that, if this country were ever unfortunate enough to have the Liberal Party on the government benches, the only thing that it is really committed to is Fightback and the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable member for Mayo comes into this House and says that we should have Asian levels of taxation, as put forward by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), those opposite should go out and explain to people in Fremantle what that means. It means cutting the revenue by $10 billion to $20 billion, and all of the programs that were mentioned before have to be in the gun. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have a dreadful record in relation to tax matters because they are the high taxing parties. We are the lowest taxing country in the OECD but we can deliver a social welfare safety net through Medicare, labour market programs, the family income supplement, the home child-care allowance and child-care rebates that the people in this community really appreciate. We can deliver those benefits to people. Those opposite want to take them away. So those opposite should make issues of those things and put those issues forward in the forthcoming by-elections. Please do that. The government will put forward its record on tax cuts to average wage earners. They were tax cuts that those opposite opposed of $10 a week for people on average weekly earnings. There has also been a cut in the corporate rate of tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite come into this parliament day after day and raise issues to do with sports grants. One of the great reforms of this government in the area of taxation was the averaging of taxation for sports people. It has meant the averaging of taxation over five years for sportsmen who have a short period in which to earn their income. So those opposite should not pretend that they are concerned with sport in this country. They should not pretend that they have some interest in sport as they fawn all over famous sports stars at venues all over the country. When those opposite were in government they never had any knowledge of or did anything about the taxation problems of sports people. The Labor Party is the party of tax reform and we have a record of tax reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are talking about the issue of unemployment we should really judge the credentials of those opposite. The essence of Fightback was the abolition of labour market programs&mdash;all of those programs that are so absolutely essential to the long-term unemployed. Those opposite had never mentioned the words and had never heard of long-term unemployed until we put the white paper process on the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are mature enough to recognise that the strong rates of growth that are emerging in this economy will not be sufficient to create jobs for the long-term unemployed, because the jobs will predominantly go to new entrants to the labour market and to people re-entering the labour market&mdash;that is, they will be soaked up by a rising participation rate. The opposition has no approach to deal with those unemployed who are left over. Through no fault of their own, those people cannot be the beneficiaries of sustained growth. The opposition stands out there with the Ian Spicers and Judith Sloans of this world, and all of the other economic fundamentalists, and says that the sorts of schemes that we need for the long-term unemployed are make work schemes and useless. That really reveals just how uncaring the opposition is and how little it has changed since Fightback was brought down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people involved in the by-elections in Bonython and Fremantle need to be aware that the Liberal Party, when it is all said and done, is still committed to a GST and is still committed to the principles of Fightback, and that if Australia were ever unfortunate enough to have a Liberal government those are the principles which would be put in place and the people that would suffer would be average wage and salary earners and the unemployed. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It adds a fifth amendment relating to the conclusion of private members business which updates the current arrangements, as applied prior to this Monday, to incorporate a division within a reasonable period. Honourable members will recollect there was a prohibition on divisions until a certain time on a Thursday. This has now been shifted to an equivalent position on a Monday&mdash;equivalent not in terms of the time of the day but in terms of the hours being sat to that point. I indicated to the House when I moved these changes some time ago that, from time to time, there would be a requirement for finetuning. The first two proposed amendments have stemmed from cross-references that were drafted when a number of options were being pursued in placing the various elements in the business routine for sitting Mondays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alteration to standing order 106A, members statements, is simply a cross-referencing change. The changes proposed to standing orders 104 and 193, relating to deferred divisions on sitting Mondays, have their basis in the need for a cross-referencing change. The opportunity has been taken to provide for such deferred divisions to occur after question time, whereas the translation of the sessional orders previously in force would have located deferred divisions in the time set aside for members statements. As a maximum of only 15 minutes is provided for these statements, divisions at that time, as currently conducted, would substantially erode the time available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suggested amendments 3 and 4 relate to appropriation and supply bills. The changes to the initiation of legislation agreed to by the House result in ministers presenting bills and explanatory memorandums and, after the first reading, moving for the second reading to be made an order of the day for a future sitting. Subsequently, at that later sitting when the second reading is moved, debate may, and normally would, ensue immediately. These arrangements would not be appropriate for the appropriation and supply bills generally, and for the presentation of the budget and the main opposition response in particular. The amendments proposed will enable the Treasurer to continue to deliver the budget speech on the presentation of the main appropriation bill for the year and for the opposition response to be made at a subsequent time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When, as I did the other day, I receive feedback from honourable members on the operation of the standing orders there might be a need for further machinery changes in the future. Honourable members should reflect on how the budget is normally presented in this place and the fact that we do not really desire to alter that&mdash;and that in itself is going to present a few problems come 7.30 p.m. on the Tuesday of the relevant week. It is obvious that we cannot have a situation where the Treasurer stands up and presents the bills, sits down immediately and the next day, or a week later, gets up and presents the budget. Nor would it be terribly sensible if we did not have an arrangement that enabled the opposition to reply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These changes are of themselves fairly unexceptionable. I do not know that I can make a fiery, impassioned and substantive speech about each and every one of them, but I take this opportunity to address one or two issues in this quiet procedural interlude. Firstly, I reiterate the concern that the opposition still harbours about all of the changes which have been made by the government to question time and other arrangements relating to the proceedings of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever anybody had any doubt about whether there was substance in our objections, we saw it today at question time. We saw a totally unsatisfactory, obscure and, I think, perplexing situation. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) wanted to ask a perfectly legitimate question about national security matters. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was the senior minister on duty&mdash;although, interestingly enough, I noticed that he was not bold enough to sit in the Prime Minister's chair. I have never known the minister to be, how shall I put it, an inconspicuous person. I have never known him to be a shrinking violet when it came to taking his due political place. I was, therefore, a little amused that he was being so coy that he did not take his position in the chair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought that the ambience of question time today would have been disappointing to those who believe in a robust and fully accountable question time. One of my colleagues remarked to me on the way out, `Talk about the second XI; it was about the third or fourth XI'. There is something very lopsided in the rosters that have been prepared by the government for appearances by ministers at question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the House should be aware that when the Leader of the House, in accordance with the newly adopted standing orders, sent the roster of ministers to me I sent back a four-part message to him. The first part reiterated our total rejection of the idea of a roster. The second part asked whether he would give an assurance that when he appeared in the parliament as the senior cabinet minister at question time he would answer questions not only in his capacity as Leader of the House&mdash;not too many questions go to him in his capacity as Leader of the House&mdash;but also in his capacity as Minister for Finance. I would venture the view that under standing orders he has no alternative but to do that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third part of the message raised the question of whether, in the spirit of what was originally intended by the now retired member for Bonython, the Hon. Neal Blewett, a roster system would operate on the basis that, if the government received due notice from the opposition that a particular minister should appear at question time on a day that that minister was not rostered for attendance, the government would respond to that. That would be on the understanding that, if a minister was given notice to attend but was not asked any questions, perhaps on the next occasion such a request was made the government would not feel disposed to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, when I first discussed some of these matters with the then member for Bonython, he raised with me the possibility of there being a roster and I said, `That will cause us a lot of trouble'. He said, `We appreciate that it could work only on the basis that if you wanted to question somebody we would have to deliver up that minister'. The standing orders state that the roster has to be drawn up in consultation with the Manager of Opposition Business. I tried to exercise my rights under standing order 151A. I thought part of the consultation was for me to go back to the Leader of the House and say, `Would you please take our concerns into account?'. I put those matters to him. With very great regret, my powerful advocacy appears to have fallen on completely deaf ears. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting. In the spirit of accommodation, which the Leader of the House takes upon himself during this debate, perhaps he would like to explain to me in terms of standing order 151A, which states that the roster shall be prepared by the Leader of the House in consultation with the Manager of Opposition Business, why it is unreasonable, in the spirit of that consultation, to say&mdash;if we have a minister in our sights and we have a particular reason for questioning that minister&mdash;to the government, `I don't like the roster, but we accept that you have used your numbers to impose a roster on the parliament'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will continue to argue against a roster, but surely to goodness it is not unreasonable for the Leader of the House, even at this stage and in the spirit of that standing order, if that consultation is to mean anything, to consider delivering up that minister. For example, if we were to go to the Leader of the House at 9.30 in the morning and say, `We want to question Ros Kelly at 3 o'clock in the afternoon'&mdash;I just pluck her name out of the air as a minister we might want to question&mdash;surely it is not unreasonable for the Leader of the House to deliver up that minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand people on the other side arguing, `We come along as ministers; we sit here all day and we do not get asked any questions'. A principle of accountability is involved there. But when there is a clear intention to ask a question of a minister I do not think it is unreasonable for that minister to appear. I continue to press the Leader of the House on that. If he is just going to say `I do not agree with that' and not go through any process of consultation, perhaps he would like to buy me a beer and explain why it would be impractical. He might like to meet the spirit of the standing order instead of treating it as the piece of empty sophistry that it has apparently been. I rest my case on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise the operation of standing order 321. The Speaker and I had an exchange about this at the end of question time today. Everybody will be aware that during question time today the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) was asked a question and she came back at the end of question time and added to her answer. It was plain to everybody that she was reading from a document. The entirety of the addition to the answer was taken from that document. Added to that, she read it at such a rate of knots that it was impossible for a number of people on this side of the House to hear what she was saying. We were left to conclude that that was deliberate. I certainly could not follow what she was saying, and many of my colleagues nodded when I made that point to the Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had the ludicrous situation that she said it was a confidential document. Having insulted our intelligence by reading the totality of her supplementary answer, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), by saying that the document had been tabled before the committee, revealed how she had misled the House. We have had trouble with this standing order before. It is plainly unsatisfactory that the question of whether or not a document is confidential should be determined entirely by a unilateral statement from the minister that she was quoting from the document. The standing orders ought to be amended so that it becomes an objective test. That will put the acid on ministers in future not to falsely assert to the parliament that a document is confidential when plainly it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was obvious on this occasion that she had been given a briefing note in anticipation of certain questions, yet she had the nerve and the audacity to say that was a confidential document. I can understand that there will be occasions when ministers quote from genuinely in-confidence and secret documents. I have no argument with that, but if they equally have no argument with being open and accountable they will not object to this change to the standing orders that I am proposing. I will be moving an amendment&mdash;I will hand up that amendment in the appropriate form in a moment&mdash;which proposes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the following words be added to the motion:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Omit `stated to be'".</PARA>
<PARA>It will then become an objective test. It will mean that a minister will not come into this parliament, as ministers day after day do in this government, and falsely say that documents are confidential when plainly they are not confidential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That particular standing order has been dreadfully abused by members of this government. The extent to which it has been abused by members of this government was revealed very dramatically today when the honourable member for Wide Bay pointed out that the document the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories quoted from had been tabled before a committee of this House, yet she actually had the nerve to say it was confidential. How on earth can it be confidential?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Speaker had no alternative but to say, `The standing orders say "stated to be" and I am the servant of the standing orders'. Therefore, that standing order is stupid. The law is an ass on this occasion. The law is the standing orders and the law ought to be changed. It ought not to be possible for a minister to stand up at the dispatch box and say that something is confidential when that document is not confidential and for the Speaker of this parliament not to be able to bring that minister to account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very simple change we are proposing&mdash;there are many other changes to standing orders that could be proposed&mdash;is that we take out the words `stated to be'. That will mean that, in future, ministers will not lightly get up and say `This is a confidential document' when plainly it is not. We will not have the ludicrous situation of everybody knowing that it is not confidential and the minister saying that it is. That situation is really making a mockery of this parliament and it is making a mockery of the procedure in relation to confidentiality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not mind a proper provision for confidentiality. I do not mind for a moment acknowledging that there are documents which contain commercially confidential information, but for a minister to have a briefing paper that has clearly been prepared to protect her against a political attack because of her incompetent administration and when the relevant document has actually been tabled before a committee of this parliament and for her to have the gall, the nerve and the contempt to get up here and say that it is a confidential document shows what she, her Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the House think about treating this parliament seriously. As far as this minister is concerned, we are such a mob of mugs that she thinks she can actually say that something is confidential when it has been tabled and made public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Standing order 320 makes it very plain that all papers and documents presented to the House shall be considered public. This document was presented to a committee of the House so, as the standing order states, it is then deemed to be a public document; yet the sports minister would have us believe that it is confidential. What is worse, she can get away with that kind of deceit and that kind of dishonesty because of the provisions of standing order 321. I think any fair-minded member of this House would acknowledge that in those circumstances the only thing to do is fix up standing order 321 so that the minister cannot mislead this parliament again on the confidentiality of documents. I use those words very deliberately because that is what she did and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) caught her out. I think it is a disgrace and I think this standing order ought to be amended. Therefore, I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the amendment. I would like to say a few things about the motion now before the House. It is becoming more and more apparent that the changes to the standing orders are there to protect the executive from the parliament, not to subject our democratic institution to some improved process. The former member for Bonython and my colleague the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) do not remember that being the purpose of the deliberations of the Standing Committee on Procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad part about the changes was apparent at question time today. There is little doubt that today's question time was an absolute farce. With only a few ministers on the front bench and with a significant matter of major public moment newly arisen with respect to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service being raised before this chamber, we were told incredibly that the answer was being given in the other chamber&mdash;that place of the `unrepresentative swill'. I find that an absolute contempt of the House of Representatives. I find it appalling that there is nobody in this place at question time apparently with the authority or the ability to utter any significant comment about major matters of public importance newly arisen. That to me was the first sign of failure of these changes to standing orders that we are now addressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the only issue. There was the question of the inquiry into the affairs of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths). Again, that is a matter which has arisen as a result of a finding yesterday by the Australian Federal Police and by a statement issued outside the parliament by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that there will be an inquiry. The Prime Minister made a commitment to an inquiry. He does not seem to understand that the former minister was a minister of this parliament. He was not a minister out there for the press or something. He is the honourable member for Maribyrnong and was appointed a minister by the Prime Minister from within this House. He resigned from his ministry from within this House. To not be able to be told about the processes of inquiry into whether or not he has breached the disclosure obligations to this House strikes me as yet another example of how the executive of the Keating Labor government is running away from the proper scrutiny that our democratic processes have written into past standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third thing I point out is quite apparent. We have been talking about the Minister for the Environment, Sports and Territories (Mrs Kelly). It is impossible for a minister to run away, where there is a continuing matter of inquiry which has been unsatisfactorily answered and with new matters arising day after day, and for there to be no apparent opportunity for that minister to be questioned on successive days simply because that minister has not been rostered on. That makes an absolute farce of our process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree entirely with my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) when he suggests that at the very least there ought to be in the consultative processes written into the standing orders an opportunity for the Manager of Opposition Business to consult with the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley)&mdash;not just be directed by him in some perfunctory way&mdash;and for him to come to some form of agreement which allows a minister to attend question time when not rostered. Frankly, already, at first blush, the changes to the standing orders have not addressed the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Procedure. They have not addressed the requirement to make the executive accountable or responsible. On that basis, I see no reason for them to be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said on other occasions when this matter has been before us, there are two elements that I find objectionable. The first is that, ultimately, whether or not the standing orders in this place work depends upon the ability of the person in the chair to feel able to address whatever issue is before the parliament without fear or favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find the circumstance of people tending to be appointed and dependent on their continued appointment because of the party process a reflection on the chair. I know it is all very well for me to assert that in a climate where neither side of the House has yet agreed to have an independent Speaker, but we have had extraordinarily independent Speakers in this place from that side of the House. I regard former Speaker Harry Jenkins as an excellent Speaker. I regarded the authority he exercised from that chair as being one where he was quite able to tell members of the government, as with those on this side of the House, whether or not he thought a particular issue should be pursued in an appropriate way and to hold members accountable if he did not. So, too, was the late Billy Snedden. Billy was quite prepared to assert his authority against the Prime Minister, as we all know. They did not enjoy exactly the most harmonious of relationships. That in no way affected Billy Snedden's ability to be a very good Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what it is all about. If the person in the chair exercises, as I know you have, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, authority in a distinct and appropriate way without fear or favour, then I do not believe changes to the standing orders are necessary. There is always an unwritten authority by the person in the chair. That person under our standing orders has absolute authority over the conduct of the affairs of this chamber. If people assert their authority, no one of us has an ability to do anything about it. The only authority is within the mechanisms of the Labor Party. The Labor caucus, we know, will assert its authority and the Prime Minister will call that Speaker to task. I find that a gross abuse of parliamentary process and that, of course, is in no way amended or restricted by these changes to the standing orders. I find that very regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I find regrettable is that, for all that the Leader of the House has said about these changes to the standing orders being able to be amended at some subsequent time, all the changes should have been made as sessional orders. I do not believe it appropriate to fiddle with standing orders. We are flat out trying to find out which is a new standing order, which is going to be a continuing standing order and whether or not a particular one will be permanent or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House even today when introducing these few amendments has identified the fact that there will be a need for some changes, even within the practice of the government. I do not accept that the intent of the government is necessarily that the standing orders should not be changed again. That being so, I think it would have been far better to have used the practice that has become custom in this place of changes being sessional orders and not standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other aspect of questions without notice that I want to address is that I find it unfortunate that people in this place do not go back to the antecedents of the development of our peculiar questions without notice procedures. It was not until, I think, the beginning of the 1950s that there were any standing orders that provided for questions without notice in this place. They had developed from the time of the establishment of our federal parliament by way of grace and favour of then Speakers and subsequent rulings of Speakers. That enabled as free an exchange as possible&mdash;for example, I refer to the United Kingdom House of Commons. That was part of our developing and individualistic Australian institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For our part, on our side of the House, we think we need to be Australian. We can see no reason for our being subservient to the United Kingdom and its practices. I find it incredible that the Prime Minister has used, as the basis for his changes to question time, the fact that the House of Commons has some procedure which allows for prime ministerial questions. `The man who would be emperor' tells us that he would like to do the same. The whole thing is an absolute farce!</PARA>

How ridiculous can you be! That is the only rational reason we have heard. As we have heard on other occasions, the House of Commons sits twice as frequently and, even under its system, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is available for questioning at least twice as much as the Australian Prime Minister under our changed procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very unhappy about the new processes. I believe that today's question time illustrated that they are not working as far as the accountability of the ministry is concerned. I do not believe that any changes to standing orders should be there only on the premise that they are there to protect the executive from the parliament. That to me is the only basis on which they have been introduced in their present form. They are not the changes recommended by the former member for Bonython, Dr Neal Blewett. They are a government adaptation used on the premise, as the Leader of the House has just acknowledged, as Mick Young once said, `When you have the numbers, you might as well use them'. Frankly, I find that regrettable. As the honourable gentleman will recall, he too will enjoy his time in opposition shortly. When he does, he will accept that there is another basis on which the arguments can be advanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the motion that my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong has advanced. There is no greater farce under the Labor regime than the way in which ministers have resorted to the protection claimed under standing order 321. It is absolutely ridiculous for a minister to read an answer word for word and then say, as some have on other occasions, `Oh, but they're only notes'. If honourable members look at standing order 321, they will see that it says nothing about the fact that they are only notes; it says `a document'. It is not printed words, it is not written words&mdash;it does not specify&mdash;it says `a document'. As far as I am concerned, notes are a document, and there is absolutely no reason why notes relating to public affairs should not be a document within the meaning of standing order 321. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But today's example by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) really trumps them all. Has there ever been anything more ridiculous than to have successive replies read verbatim and then for the minister to claim that they are confidential? Then, to cap it all, when the minister came in and wished to add to her answer, she read from a document, and then we found that that document had been tabled before a committee&mdash;but not just before a committee; before a committee in public hearing. In other words, that document had been exposed not just to the members of the committee but to the world at large. It was a public hearing, the House television was there and the document was available for inspection. Standing order 320 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All papers and documents presented to the House shall be considered public.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know that proceedings before a committee are equal to proceedings before the House. So the presentation of a document to a committee of the parliament is exactly the same as presentation to the House. Standing order 320 says that the documents are public&mdash;thanks to the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), who identified the document and said that it had been tabled in public session&mdash;and the minister says, `No, I declare it confidential'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it interesting that at the same time we are debating these standing orders, there is another matter shortly to come before this chamber which will allow those confidential papers, cabinet minutes, to be revealed after 50 years. I do not intend to debate that subject now for I am in favour of that motion. But I do wish to say that, with freedom of information, and with the nature of our society becoming more open, I find it totally repugnant that the government relies on a ministerial claim to confidentiality. It is an absolute farce for a minister to read something and claim that it is confidential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very real problem in our society that, if people are going to claim confidentiality for matters that are not commercial-in-confidence, everybody is suspicious of why they wish to hide whatever that document contains. There are problems in matters that are commercial-in-confidence. I would accept that that is an acceptable area for matters to be declared confidential. Equally, I would accept that matters pertaining to national security are matters which, rightly, have become confidential. But even there we have had the farce for successive years where one can read the records of the United States Congress and find matters that are disclosed that we are told out here by this ministry are confidential. I confess to having done the same myself, so I had better refrain a little on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a problem. Let us accept that in this day and age the confidentiality of documents of whatever character needs to be carefully considered and applied not on individual ministerial discretion and certainly not in response to standing order 321. On that basis, I believe it only appropriate that we amend standing order 321 by omitting the words `stated to be' so that the standing order will now read:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A document relating to public affairs quoted from by a Minister or an Assistant Minister, unless of a confidential nature or such as should more properly be obtained by address, shall, if required by any Member, be laid on the Table.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important that documents be available to the public. I do not believe that it is appropriate for ministers, by individual fiat, to act in the way that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories did today. I believe that misleading the House is a fundamental flaw and a fundamental sin. Were we to follow the words of that godfather of the Labor Right, then I am afraid that minister would have resigned long ago. But she seems to have another claim to continuity. Be that as it may, I believe that standing order 321 needs to be amended. I totally support the motion of the honourable member for Bennelong. I suggest to the Leader of the House that he too, on calm and cool reflection, would find those words more appropriately omitted from that standing order than being included. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the comments of and motion moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and seconded in a most admirable fashion by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). Standing orders are the essence of the proceedings of the House of Representatives; they are the essence of parliamentary democracy. Changes to standing orders are not lightly embarked on. Yet here we have the first patch-up job to the major change to the standing orders which occurred a fortnight ago and which the House is still labouring under as it adjusts to the new standing orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the confidentiality aspects of the tabling of documents, there are two other areas of continuing concern: the amending of standing orders, which the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has brought before the chair at this moment, does not yet embrace any alteration to a bill which is not an appropriation or supply bill and which is going to be declared under the government's option as being one to be dealt with by the House as a whole and not having a seven-day factor built into the apparatus. The Leader of the House will probably respond by saying that is not the case now. I point out very clearly to members of the public and to the House that, if a bill is recommended to go to the second chamber, it will have a seven-day delay factor built into the apparatus. If a bill is going to roll on in the main chamber, the government&mdash;no matter what the opposition thinks about it, in a sense&mdash;can, in fact, roll it through at a fairly fast rate of knots, without a seven-day factor built in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have this quite curious anomaly in the construction of the standing orders as they exist today: a seven-day delay factor if a bill goes to the second chamber, but that is not so on other types of bills if they come through the main chamber. I highlight that matter to the House. It is a matter of concern. It will always rely on the convention or practice to some extent that will be pursued by the government, and we will be watching that closely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other matter that I will raise, because I know that others want to speak in this debate, relates to the routine of business on Mondays, which is very different from the routine of business on the other three days of the week. Only on Mondays do we have private members business for 1 1/2 hours or thereabouts, the grievance debate for 1 1/2 hours, and 90-second statements which, as members on both sides of the House have alluded to, have been welcome additions in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government decides to construct the sitting weeks so as not to commence on a Monday but on a Tuesday, it cuts back on private members business. The draft parliamentary sittings for the House of Representatives circulated by the Leader of the House show that this year the House will not be sitting on a Monday for four sitting weeks. Therefore the protection of, and activities relating to, private members business, 90-second statements and the grievance debate will be lost for those sitting weeks as the standing orders are constructed. That was the case for the very first sitting week this year, as it will be the case for the sitting weeks beginning on 21 March, 2 May and 22 August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Leader of the House that it would be a very nice and comforting gesture, showing the esteem and goodwill with which he approaches these changes to standing orders, if he were to consider a further patch-up and amendment whereby, when the House does not sit on a Monday, Monday's routine of business will apply on a Tuesday. That will protect the rights of private members and will provide for a grievance debate and, at the very least, the 90-second statements. How can the Leader of the House deny the House the constructive colour of the 90-second statements which have become part of the furniture, and a very appropriate part of the furniture? I have even heard you, Mr Deputy Speaker, speak admirably about the 90-second statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My two points are relevant and valid to the very patch-up job the minister is on about. On top of the inconsistency with the seven-day rule is the fact that Monday is knocked out of a number of key parliamentary sitting weeks this year. That is something that the House ought to be very conscious of when it deliberates on these further changes to our standing orders. </PARA>

The matter was due to come on for debate at 5 o'clock today&mdash;we are a little behind schedule at the moment, as the Leader of the House is aware. The shadow minister had received no indication that these amendments were to be moved; he had received no information about them at all. They relate to certain matters that impinge on the states.

We can experiment with changes through the sessional orders, find out how they are working and then move on from there. That is a reasonable way to do it. The honourable member for Bennelong pointed out, also on the issue of bona fides, that he had an understanding about what consultation meant in relation to ministers appearing in this place. However, the procedure actually followed and detailed by him does not approximate to anything that I or any reasonable person would call consultation. Sadly, it is a matter of copping it sweet, as we have heard a number of times from the Leader of the House in relation to procedures, ministerial statements&mdash;all sorts of things. When there has not been a reasonable, logical answer, he has got up and shoved it down our necks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that worries me is that a government that starts to behave with that sort of arrogance towards not only opposition members&mdash;whoever they may be&mdash;but also this parliament is a government that will visit grief on the Australian people. When debating associated matters during the last sitting week, I pointed out my concern that what the government does is very poorly reported in this country. I have seen how that affects a government's behaviour, and I have lived with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have lived with an administration whose members believed that their minister would never properly be brought to account at question time, much less by the press&mdash;it took a royal commission. Employees of government went out and wreaked evil acts on members of the public. I am referring, of course, to the Queensland police force. I do not want any smart answers from the Leader of the House about the colour of that government, because it is happening now in Queensland&mdash;but once again we have a silent press. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a scandal about the disbursement of public money by a minister. Is it not amazing how the changes to question time suddenly become urgent when the government has a real scandal on its hands that people are really paying attention to? Members of the Australian public are really paying attention to it because sport affects them like virtually no other issue. They are interested in where the sporting dollars go. It has caught the public's imagination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other issues that this government arrogantly brushes off day after day&mdash;issues that should be matters of great public concern. Ever more frequently now, it seems, the government rolls measures in here that take away from the ability and authority of this chamber to do what it should do, which is not to advance the Liberal Party, or the Labor Party, or the National Party, or any other political party, but to advance the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very recently someone close to the system both here and in the United States commented to me that if politics were carried out there in the way that it is here then that country would not be the country it is now. I think there is substance in that. Whilst that might be a subject for another time&mdash;I note that the Leader of the House raises his eyebrows&mdash;it would be worth debating, if we ever got the opportunity in here to debate an idea, but that rarely happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way business is conducted in this House, the rules that govern it and the way it flows outside are matters of great concern to me and, I believe, to other members&mdash;not only members of the opposition. The much laboured report of the Standing Committee on Procedure is a good instance of that. Government members recommended matters which have not been reflected in these standing orders. These standing orders have moved a long way away from the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong has put forward a proposal to give some teeth, reality and real meaning to a standing order which is flouted daily in question time by ministers of the government. It will be interesting to see whether the government has any bona fides on that sort of change. Of course not. The Leader of the House would have exercised his mind only on how he could have scored some debating points in the course of this debate and not on how he might have addressed the subject. Sometimes I think the Leader of the House actually does care and have some concern about this place. Sometimes I think he would like to see it function well. The times I think that are when he does not reply to the debates, when he seeks to make some cheap debating points, when he knows in his own mind that he ought to be ashamed of the job he has been given to do here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to the proposed amendment to the standing orders and subsequently close the debate. There has been a pretty reasonable discussion up to this point. I can understand a fair degree of the frustration and bitterness of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), after 11 years in opposition, but the changes to standing orders do not deserve the strictures directed at this government. There are areas of honourable debate over whether or not those opposite quite like the changes we have made to question time. If they do not work over the next few months, we will look at them and try something else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those changes were written into the sessional orders. Virtually the only objections that the opposition has raised to any of the changes to the standing orders that we have brought during the last couple of weeks in response to the Blewett report have not been to the changes we have put into the standing orders but to the changes we have put into the sessional orders. So, contrary to the words of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), when he enjoined us to contemplate these things within the framework of changes to sessional orders, by and large we have not made changes to standing orders where there has not been consensus. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the opposition's proposed amendment to a standing order which predates this government. The right honourable member for New England would have us believe that at the time it was devised governments did not use their numbers in this place. That is not my recollection of his role of Leader of the House&mdash;when he exercised it from time to time. Perhaps as the years go by, however, memories grow dim on both sides and we have a much more forgiving attitude towards our youth than would have been the case at the time when perhaps that pomp was roundly and cheerfully exercised, whatever the objection of the opposition of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standing order refers to a statement that a document from which a minister is reading is confidential. I am amazed that the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) believes that the particular document the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) was quoting from was a document opposed to an issue that had been before the committee. I was sitting next to the minister and it was not possible for me to see the detail of the document, as it evidently was for the honourable member for Wide Bay, who was sitting on the opposition back benches. Although I cannot necessarily say for certain, because I was not examining the document, it looked to me like a standard ministerial briefing with the appropriate confidentiality attached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that that part of the document dealt with an issue that had been considered by a committee is neither here nor there, because what establishes the confidentiality of the document is not what is read out by the minister but what exists in it elsewhere. Quite clearly, if the entire document were confidential, the minister would not be reading from it in any shape or form in the parliament. The point to be considered about confidentiality is whether or not other aspects of a document, the advice to a minister, are of a confidential nature. I have a memory of what it is like to be in opposition&mdash;hardly anyone on this side of the House now does, but I do at least&mdash;and I can recollect numerous occasions when ministers quoted. It was standard practice. </PARA>

When we were in opposition, when a minister stood in this place, picked up a document and read from it at question time, instantly the relevant person on the opposition side would stand up and ask for it to be tabled. It is the normal, sensible thing for an opposition to do. Just as frequently, whenever that was asked of those opposite when they happened to be in government&mdash;a long time ago now&mdash;they protected the document with confidentiality. Sometimes the document was tabled, as is sometimes the case now, but far more often in both cases the document was kept by the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

At the same time, we had the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) stand up in this place and ask us to shift private members business, particularly the 90-second statements, to another day.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens in the House of Commons? Is the House of Commons an ineffective body, one incapable of handling the major issues of the day because the Prime Minister is only there twice a week and is not there for the other two days of sittings, and the secretary for foreign affairs turns up once every three weeks to answer questions? The minister for education in the British House of Commons turns up once every two or three weeks. Has the system collapsed in the British House of Commons? Is it a ridiculous, ineffectual place as a result of the fact that ministers appear once a fortnight for questioning, including ministers concerned with state security? Obviously, the British House of Commons has gone to the dogs! The ministers are not available. The British secretary for foreign affairs is not available on a daily basis for questioning on what is happening to Britain's security services. The Prime Minister is only available twice a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not come on with this nonsense about the fact that it sits twice as much as we do&mdash;it does. If we take the appearances by our ministers pro-rata to the appearance of ministers in the British House of Commons, we would not be having ministers rostered on twice a week, we would have ministers rostered on once in every two-week session and on occasions twice. That is what we would be doing if we went pro-rata with the British House of Commons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's question time in the British House of Commons goes for 15 minutes, not 45. I notice that whatever complaints opposition members raise about the way in which the roster operates at the moment, they still managed to just about double the number of questions they have asked in the entire year of the Prime Minister. They doubled it in one day under this system. So they are not really having much trouble coming to grips with the opportunity to question the Prime Minister. So there we have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is so much cant and hypocrisy around this place, which is indeed depressing after opposition members had so much time and opportunity to make their points. There is absolutely no substance to the complaints of the opposition. I can understand their bitterness on that, but the fact of the matter is that there is at least as much accountability&mdash;in fact, a great deal more accountability&mdash;of individual ministers that people want to question. A particular minister is capable of being questioned four times in a fortnight instead of, admittedly under the previous system, seven times in a fortnight. But it scarcely lets them off the hook, if that is the way the opposition wants to talk about it. If we did go to the British House of Commons situation where they appeared once a fortnight, if that, we might say that ministers are being let off the hook. Nobody seriously challenges the British House of Commons, nor should they challenge our system where much better availability of ministers is the case under this new system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is no need to address those concerns. There is ample opportunity to question ministers where there are serious issues involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition reaffirms its view that individual home ownership is a basic foundation of the Australian way of life. We have always supported this concept and continue to do so. The purpose of the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill is to amend the Housing Assistance Act 1989 under which the states, with financial assistance from the Commonwealth, deliver housing assistance for rental housing and home purchase in accordance with the terms of the 1989 Commonwealth-state housing agreement which is usually referred to as CSHA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends these appropriations in subsection 7(3A) of the act so as to decrease the appropriation for 1993-94 by $38 million, increase it for 1994-95 by $17 million and increase it for 1995-96 by $17 million. I understand that these changes have been endorsed by state and territory ministers. In his second reading speech, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is also consistent with improved cash management arrangements for the CSHA which have been negotiated successfully with the states by the Commonwealth government. These arrangements provide for improved accountability for Commonwealth funds which are provided to the states under the CSHA.</PARA>
<PARA>Whether the objective of improved accountability is achieved remains to be seen. It is certainly fervently to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accountability for Commonwealth housing funds has been the subject of strong criticism by the Auditor-General. For example, his comments on aspects of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, which were tabled on 31 September 1993, contain damning comment on housing policy under the federal Labor government and the current minister. The Auditor-General's audit report No. 6 of 1993-94 at page 26 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One aspect that is frequently overlooked by departments and agencies is the need for clear identification, measurement and reporting of Commonwealth obligations of exposure under the agreement. In the case of housing, for example, data currently available to the department is insufficient to determine both the true levels of subsidies provided under the various housing assistance schemes and the overall exposure of the Commonwealth under its obligations to meet any shortfalls in the operation of those schemes.</PARA>
<PARA>The shadow minister for public housing and community service, Senator Tambling, has pointed out that these comments compounded criticisms made earlier in ANAO audit report No. 1 of 1991-92. In that report the Auditor-General commented critically on a range of housing and planning issues and agreements between the Commonwealth and state governments. Furthermore, questioning of officers of the then Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services at recent Senate estimates committee hearings elicited an admission that the department has not responded to the Auditor-General's recommendations with any degree of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The billions of dollars of Commonwealth revenue spent on public housing make this an important issue, both to the taxpayer who is footing the bill and to the many Australians in need of housing assistance. The Industry Commission's report on public housing is another shocking report card on Labor's housing record. Alarm bells should be ringing around Australia about the diabolical mess public housing is in. The commission suggested a number of reforms to the operation of the CSHA. One major reform dealt with a radical redistribution of power between the states and the Commonwealth with respect to housing provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main problems with the CSHA identified by the Industry Commission is an overlapping and blurring of Commonwealth and state responsibilities for the operation and accountability of the agreement. According to the Industry Commission report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is a partner with joint responsibility but little real control over the effectiveness and efficiency of the programs. It is currently trying to inject greater accountability into CSHA programs through performance monitoring. Shared responsibility also affects incentives facing governments. The CSHA funding arrangements reduce the incentives to provide services at least cost. State governments do not receive any financial benefit from cost savings because they must match Commonwealth payments. Indeed funding on the condition that the monies must be spent may provide a perverse incentive . . . The lack of clearly defined objectives under the CSHA weakens the incentive to make decisions transparent.</PARA>
<PARA>A key issue of concern to the Industry Commission was the need to strengthen the role of the states in housing matters and the need for better and clearer delineation of the respective roles of each level of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More specifically, the commission advocated that the Commonwealth's role be restricted to that of the provision of income support&mdash;essentially, the provision of rent assistance&mdash;and that the states be responsible for public housing and that the CSHA be replaced by bilateral agreements in line with these changes as from 1995. When the report was released on 13 January, a joint statement by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Mr Howe), the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) acknowledged the Industry Commission's emphasis on greater accountability by the federal government. The press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission concludes that more transparent funding and institutional arrangements and greater clarity in the objectives and responsibilities of Commonwealth and State/Territory government, will be necessary to enable the optimum mix of assistance measures to be identified.</PARA>
<PARA>One would think that, after a decade of power and a number of reports recommending reforms to the efficiency and accountability of Commonwealth-state housing agreements, this Labor government might have got it right by now. Unfortunately, this is not the case and those in the greatest need are the ones missing out on assistance, for example, those people eligible for public rental housing, various home purchase assistance schemes, community housing, mortgage and rent assistance and the provision of crisis accommodation, as well as those who are supposed to benefit from pensioner and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander rental housing assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission pointed out that two per cent of the federal budget goes towards housing assistance each year and even a small improvement in the performance of housing authorities would yield large benefits. Public housing authorities own and manage about 370,000 dwellings in Australia&mdash;nearly six per cent of the nation's housing stock&mdash;which means that reform would have a big impact on the housing and property sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission recommended major restructuring of public housing authorities to improve their management of Australia's $30 billion worth of public housing. For example, the commission claimed that the state and territory public housing authorities have been too insulated from the real world of property management and that they could improve both their performance and the provision of housing to needy families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major recommendation was to split the functions of housing authorities into two parts&mdash;a property management agency, which would run housing stock and be run on commercial lines, and an agency to rent subsidised properties. The commercial agency would manage and maintain the housing on either a fee for service basis or a contractual basis. Housing stock would be valued at current market prices rather than the initial capital cost, which is not a meaningful figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This splitting of the roles of housing authorities should make the provision of public housing more accountable. Further, being free from the function of building dwellings and managing properties would allow for more concentration on meeting the welfare priorities of public housing. Nevertheless, the key public housing issue still remains; namely, waiting lists and stock levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the large amount of money devoted to public housing through the operation of the CSHA, there is still a substantial shortfall in the provision of adequate accommodation for those in need. It is estimated that the current public housing stock in Australia is approximately 370,000 dwellings or 5.6 per cent of all housing. The state and territory breakdown of public housing stock numbers as at June 1992 is as follows: in New South Wales, 124,500; in South Australia, 63,000; in Victoria, 61,400; in Queensland, 38,900; in Western Australia, 35,300; in Tasmania, 14,200; in the Australian Capital Territory, 12,300; and in the Northern Territory, 9,300. In addition, it is estimated that there are between 12,000 and 15,000 community and cooperative houses spread throughout the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest available figures on waiting lists for public housing for each of the states and territories are as follows: in New South Wales, 64,895; in Victoria, 52,522; in Queensland, 24,448; in Western Australia, 14,694; in South Australia, 43,520; in Tasmania, 4,539; in the Australian Capital Territory, 6,615; and in the Northern Territory, 8,061. These figures are as at June 1992, except for New South Wales and South Australia, where the figures are as at June 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is noteworthy that the states that had state Labor governments for several years, mainly Victoria and South Australia, were the ones with the highest proportion of population waiting lists for public housing. Excluding New South Wales and South Australia, where the 1992 figures are not available, four of the other six states and territories experienced substantial increases in the number of people on waiting lists between June 1991 and June 1992. Over that period, waiting lists in Victoria increased from 44,634 to 52,522, in Queensland from 22,507 to 24,448, in the Australian Capital Territory from 3,731 to 6,615, and in the Northern Territory from 6,167 to 8,061. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures indicated that few inroads were being made in the backlog of demand for public housing and that some states and territories&mdash;most notably, Victoria, the ACT and the Northern Territory&mdash;were falling further behind in the provision of public housing. The steady increase in unemployment to more than one million after the dates I have mentioned has meant thousands more Australians have been added to those already in need. The recession we had to have, according to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), undoubtedly increased dramatically the already shamefully long waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the future housing needs of Australia's population. The national housing strategy identified a number of trends that may influence the type of housing required in the 21st century. As these trends accelerate, it is possible that the number of inappropriately housed people will increase, unless there are changes in the type of housing provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Figures provided by the Bureau of Immigration Research clearly illustrate the strong trend to an older population. The median age of the population has risen from 22.5 years in 1901 to 32.5 years in 1991. According to the Bureau of Immigration Research, in 1901 only four per cent of the population was aged 65 or over. By 1961 this figure had risen to 8.5 per cent and in 1991 to 11.4 per cent. It is estimated that by 2031, 20 per cent of the population will be in this group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this ageing population, the predominant housing style is still detached accommodation on large, often quarter-acre blocks. Such housing may not be appropriate for a number of older people who have no children and especially frail aged people who are living on their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak from experience. My own electorate includes the most popular retirement region in Australia; namely, the Gold Coast. The decline in availability of specialised accommodation for the frail aged in particular has led to many of them feeling isolated and impossibly burdened by a once loved home. Tragically, this can lead to a feeling that life itself is a burden&mdash;a lonely struggle to cope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A strongly emerging housing trend on the Gold Coast has been for developers to switch to building multiple complexes of townhouses. This certainly economises on land; however, it is no more appropriate for elderly people. The need for them to constantly cope with the physical demand of staircases in the course of daily life is not only inappropriate but also downright dangerous, given their susceptibility to crippling, and sometimes deadly, falls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, local councils need to give urgent consideration to how they can expedite the provision of an adequate diversity of appropriate housing as well as associated infrastructure and services. All too often local regulations and charges are a hindrance through inflexible, even punitive or greedy, requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national housing strategy identified two further social demographic trends that housing policy makers will need to consider; namely, women's changing role and the tendency towards smaller households. When referring to women in the work force, the strategy says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strong upward trend in the proportion of women in paid jobs is expected to continue into the future, with 60 per cent of Australian women projected to be in paid employment within 15 years time (compared with around 40 per cent now). This will create a growing need for housing that is well located in relation to such services as training and child care.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's attitude to the urban dweller is of concern to me. I refer to the proposal of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) to examine the role of cities and regions and to suggestions that urban sprawl should attract special financial penalties. As someone whose electorate is part of the fastest growing region in Australia, I am all for forward planning of infrastructure and services. However, I am utterly opposed to the Deputy Prime Minister trying to impose a building code which dictates and limits the size of our homes. For example, the Labor Party's housing policy, released during the 1993 federal election, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Almost half the households today have only one or two people living in them. Yet 80 per cent of our housing comprises buildings with three or more bedrooms on large blocks of land.</PARA>
<PARA>Whose business is that, other than that of those who choose to live in them? Even making allowance for the unsatisfied needs of some of our elderly citizens to whom I have already referred, it is not the business of government to pass judgment on whether households of one or two people should occupy homes with three bedrooms. I agree with the President of the Real Estate Institute of Queensland, Mr Ray Milton, who responded to the Deputy Prime Minister as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any new form of tax or rates penalty on people living on new estates in city fringe areas to discourage urban sprawl simply won't work, and will cause unnecessary hardship to lower income households.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that the Deputy Prime Minister's preoccupation with urban sprawl was based on social engineering, not community planning. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the material we have seen in favour of restricting so-called urban sprawl has been little more than expensive government propaganda.</PARA>
<PARA>An Australian's home has always been regarded as his or her castle. Whether a person is building or purchasing a home, its number of rooms and the number of people living in it should be the prerogative of the home owner and not some meddlesome government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn my attention to the fact that this afternoon proposed amendments to this bill together with an explanatory memorandum were tabled in the chamber. I inform the House that the shadow minister for housing and community services, Senator Tambling, was informed by the minister's office at 12.30 p.m. today that it was the government's intention to introduce these amendments. The normal courtesies  such as consultations with shadow ministers to enable further consultations with party committees and other interested people have not been observed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister then contacted various state housing ministers on the ground that these amendments were supposed to have been agreed to by them and he was informed that a number of them had not received copies of these amendments. They were apparently under the misapprehension that the item was to be placed on the agenda for a Commonwealth-state housing ministers conference next Monday. </PARA>

The overriding objective of that housing agenda has been to ensure that all Australians have access to secure and affordable housing which is appropriate to their needs&mdash;be they in the private rental market, as public housing tenants or as home buyers. The effective operation of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement is central to the achievement of that objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the terms of this bill, the Commonwealth will make available some $1.25 billion under the CSHA in 1993-94. This will comprise $1.042 billion as a planned budgetary allocation and some $89 million in unpaid funds that are carried through from 1992-93. The size of this funding is an indication of the economic and social significance of the government's commitment to public housing and community housing and its support for crisis accommodation and housing for special needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill gives effect to a number of decisions announced in the last budget relating to the CSHA and it involves the rephasing of $25 million, which was originally brought forward to 1993-94 from 1994-95 and 1995-96, for the purposes of employment generation. It also involves a rephasing of $10 million under the community housing program which was originally to be available for payment in 1993-94. It also involves a one-off adjustment of $3.5 million to new 1993-94 funds for the crisis accommodation program. All of these proposals are consistent with the government's continuing strong support for public housing, crisis accommodation and community housing in Australia. </PARA>

But it is really a case of crocodile tears from the honourable member for Moncrieff. Time and again opposition members come into this House and waste the House's valuable time with procedural motions and endless debates that have no real relevance to the nitty-gritty of the meaningful legislation that is passed through this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been adequate consultation with the opposition in this regard and it is very important that these measures be passed through this parliament today. So let us not have any more of these crocodile tears about the government ramming particular amendments through this place and the opposition being a little bit offside and unprepared.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major amendment proposed to the Housing Assistance  Amendment Bill 1993 will be introduced by the government tomorrow. Effectively it amends section 15 of the Housing Assistance Act 1989 and basically deals with the matching of untied grants provided by the Commonwealth to the states. The amendment to section 15 of this act sets out provisions for the Commonwealth minister to authorise the full level of untied grants to a particular state in 1994-95, even if the minister cannot ensure that the state can meet the balance of its matching obligation from the value of home loans provided through its home purchase assistance programs in accordance with the provisions of the existing CSHA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New section 15A sets out a provision for the Commonwealth minister to waive or reduce the obligations of a state or territory to match the balance of untied assistance provided by the Commonwealth to a state or territory for housing assistance from the value of home loans provided through home purchase assistance programs. This provision will apply only for 1993-94 and 1994-95. Such determination will be made only where the minister, after consultations with the relevant state minister, is satisfied that the state is unable to match the balance of untied grants from the value of home loans made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new provision will mean that where the Commonwealth minister is satisfied that circumstances warrant the action outlined above the Commonwealth will not have to reduce untied grant funding, as required under the act for public housing in 1994-95, in a state that expects it will not be able to meet its home lending requirement under the CSHA. The provision will also enable the minister, in 1993-94 and 1994-95, to determine that a state has met its matching obligation and therefore will not have to recover financial assistance already provided as required under this agreement. As the honourable member for Moncrieff has already informed the House, this new section 15A will not involve any additional Commonwealth outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment being proposed in this bill has been brought about by a situation in the states where demand for home purchase assistance products has significantly declined. This has primarily been due to the attractiveness of commercial products in our current economic situation. Recently in question time the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Mr Howe) outlined to the House how housing affordability has improved because of the general economic circumstances that have been engineered by this government. I refer to the low level of interest rates prevailing in the economy at the moment, particularly for housing, the low level of inflation and, of course, lower housing prices that are being brought into the marketplace due to the recessed conditions that have existed over the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSHA requires the states to match untied assistance on a dollar for dollar basis, with half the matching assistance to be provided through states grants and the other half in the form of loans made under approved home purchase assistance schemes. The CSHA provides that, in situations where the matching requirements are not met by the states, as in 1993-94, the Commonwealth can seek recovery of financial assistance already provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Housing Assistance Act also provides that, in situations where a state is not expected to meet its matching obligation, the Commonwealth may reduce its untied grant funding. I guess this is an option for the Commonwealth in the present situation in respect of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. But it is not a course of action that the Commonwealth is prepared to entertain for the following reason: were the government to pursue these options it would simply mean that less money would be made available for public housing and, given the current strong demand for public housing in this country, such an action would run counter to the government's policy of providing affordable housing to those in need of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important factor to take into account in this situation is that in past years some states have increased their lending in excess of their matching requirements. They have demonstrated to a degree their bona fides in this regard and I guess it is time for the Commonwealth to demonstrate some sympathy with the states' position. Also, in current situations where changed economic and market conditions are indeed beyond the control of the states, it would be somewhat unreasonable for the Commonwealth to pursue the aforementioned options under the CSHA. There is also a danger that if states are forced into increasing their lending through this program at this particular time we may see more loans being made to marginal clients which may not be in their long-term economic interest if economic circumstances change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new provision to allow the minister to authorise untied grants where there is some expectation that they will not be matched by the states is simply necessary because, under</PARA>
<PARA>the act's current provisions, the minister would not be  able to authorise the full level of grants for that particular year. This would mean a reduction of funds for public housing being made available by the Commonwealth and would run counter to the government's desire to maintain and expand the public housing stock in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make some general comments on some major elements of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, which in effect sets out a framework for the cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states on housing matters. The CSHA represents a clear commitment by the Commonwealth to provide, where possible, an expanding stock of public housing and an increased supply of affordable housing. This agreement should not be seen as a framework in splendid isolation from the general macro-economic settings which have produced low interest rates, low inflation and attractive levels of housing affordability not seen in this country for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy breadth of the CSHA can be understood when one fully appreciates that it provides finance for home purchase assistance schemes, public housing, mortgage and rent relief schemes, and specific assistance schemes targeted at the disadvantaged and the needy. As far as Labor in government is concerned, we have put our money where our mouth is in meeting our social justice agenda. As I said before, in 1994-95 over $1.125 billion will be committed through this agreement to housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSHA, as it stands, guarantees funding to the states for housing until the end of 1995-96 and, in return for the stability and security of this financial commitment, the  states have agreed to reforms to planning and cash management arrangements that will improve the accountability of the state housing authorities and also make their services more responsible to client needs. Improved consultation, planning and reporting arrangements will ensure that this government's objectives in the housing area are adequately met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I noted earlier, the appropriations give effect to a rephasing of $10 million for the community housing program. I would like to briefly touch on aspects of this program which was given a fiscal stimulus in the 1992-93 budget. The aim of the government is quite clear and that is to double the size of the community housing stock to at least 25,000 units by the turn of the century. We view this sector as being well placed to meet the housing needs of low income earners and those with special needs in the community. </PARA>

He also developed an aircraft known as the Ibis, which was the forerunner of the late Buccaneer and was perhaps 20 years ahead of its time. He was killed in 1933 attempting another record to Australia, crashing in the Pratomagno Alps in Italy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Friday night, 18 February, I had the opportunity to attend the Goodna Christian School in my electorate to perform the opening of stage one of the new technology building. It was certainly a very important occasion for that school community and I was very pleased to participate in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a very humble beginning in February 1977&mdash;this particular school started off with 56 students and only three teachers&mdash;the school has grown into an institution which caters for 732 students from year 1 right through to year 12. It is certainly a great record for that school in such a short time. Success like this can be achieved only through a great deal of hard work and diligence. That was quite evident to me at the Goodna Christian School on Friday night. The often intangible nature attributed to success such as this is the attitude, dedication and commitment of those associated with goals like this one. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8J4">Mr LES SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Family values as well, which is once again quite evident there. I thank the honourable member for his interjection. Students acquire their attitudes to learning and society at school, attitudes that stay with them throughout their lives. That is very much evident, again, at this school. It is a shame that too few Australians realise just what a diverse educational system this nation actually has. In Australia, nearly one-third of all students attend non-government schools. This is in comparison with Britain, which has approximately seven per cent, and the USA, which has approximately 11 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the provision of funds for projects like this new technological centre, the Keating government is continuing to support the growth of non-government schools to continue the provision of the very best quality schooling for all young Australians. The Commonwealth is firmly committed to a dual system of education, one which provides a strong system of government schools while at the same time giving parents the choice of non-government education for the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particularly important aspect of education is parental involvement. According to a recent survey by the Australian Council for Educational Research of over 7,000 Australian schools, it was clearly identified that a high level of parental involvement is a key factor in effective schooling. The Goodna Christian School, I am pleased to say, enjoys this high level of parental involvement, which is a great credit to those parents involved. That, once again, was quite evident at this function on Friday night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes that the students of today must be skilled members of Australia's work force into the 21st century. We are all well aware of the need for that. Our future prosperity as a nation will depend on their being able to acquire the skills and knowledge that will equip them for the challenges of the future. Schools such as the Goodna Christian School, along with the many other fine schools in my electorate, and I am sure many other honourable members' electorates as well, are already on the way to providing just the sort of people needed to meet these challenges with confidence. To this end, the funding necessary for the construction of the manual arts, woodworking, metalworking and welding facilities at this school was most welcome as it, along with the school's contribution, will also enable construction of a finishing area and preparation and storeroom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This project has cost some $538,000 to which the Commonwealth actually contributed $390,000. Obviously, the rest of the money was raised by the school itself. I am sure the parents involved with the school made a big contribution to that. Also, there was a lot of voluntary labour involved in the school. When I had the opportunity to inspect the facilities after the opening, some of the workbenches actually made by some of the teachers, students and parents during the school break were shown to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the school and its principal, Mr Chris Meadows, and all those people involved with this school on making these facilities the success they are. A technological centre like this is very important for our young people in the future as we all are well aware that we need more tradesmen in these times. Often during times of high unemployment, which we have unfortunately been through, we do not always see our employers training as many apprentices as they should. I welcome the initiatives by the Goodna Christian School and put on record my sincere appreciation for the way it conducts itself and for the warm welcome it gave me and others on Friday night. </PARA>

Western Mining has come out and has made all the possible public statements that are reasonable and is monitoring the situation very closely. As I have indicated, the radiation level in the water is no different from that which naturally occurs. Another example, which I thought tested the definition of `truth' fairly well, is when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) talked about the real estate of the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan).</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of `truth' today was when the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) talked about taxation. His proud claim today was that this country has the lowest taxation in the world. But there were no supporting figures and there was no discussion about the actual structure of employment in the country and no discussion about small business and the failure rate, about agriculture, or the way indirect taxation falls on small business. We all remember the promise that there would be no increase in taxation, the l-a-w one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Truth, genuine, actual or factual, is still fairly carelessly handled in this place by some. In conclusion, I think that without truth in politics our national values are eroded and democracy is the poorer for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to take the opportunity to draw to the attention of the House one of the most extraordinary collections of fine arts and antiquities in Australia. I would also like to congratulate the Abbey community residents in Caboolture who give their time and energy to ensure the success of one of Australia's most unusual museums&mdash;in fact, it is unique.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Abbey Museum of Art and Archaeology, situated in the shire of Caboolture in the Fisher electorate, has become an international drawcard for the region. It has now been open for about seven years and attracts nearly 40,000 people each year from around Australia and overseas. Some material at the museum dates back 500,000 years, and the history of the collections housed at Caboolture's Abbey Museum is as rich as the collections themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any history of the Abbey Museum must make reference to its founder, the Reverend John Sebastian Marlow Ward. This unique museum owes its rich and varied collections to the imagination and ability of Ward, one of England's most eclectic and visionary collectors; in fact, Queen Mary made donations of material to the museum. Ward was born in England in 1855, the son of an Anglican priest. He was deeply spiritual and in 1929 formed a mixed monastic community which, following in the tradition of the medieval Christian abbeys, adopted a program of education and preservation of heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1934 Ward founded Britain's first social history museum, the Abbey Folk Park, near London. He concentrated on preserving the traditional heritage of England, which was rapidly disappearing in the wake of industrialisation and change. By 1940 he had collected more than 40,000 items. The bombing of London in that year forced the closure of the Abbey Museum and Ward and his followers emigrated to Cyprus where he died in 1949. Terrorism again forced members of the community out of their home and they arrived virtually penniless in Sydney in 1956 and 10 years later moved to Caboolture. It was not until 1978 that a decision was made to resurrect the museum and make the remains of the collection available to the public. Building commenced in 1983 and the Abbey Museum was opened in June 1986 by Sir Gordon Chalk, a former Liberal leader. I was privileged to be present at that opening when previously the member for Fisher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excellent work of the Abbey Museum's director, Michael Strong, the staff and community helpers has in a short period once again brought the Abbey Museum international acclaim. This international respect is witnessed by the increasingly valuable donations of material which are being given to the Abbey Museum&mdash;for instance, material from the famous Merton Priory founded by Thomas Becket in AD 1150. Also on its way to Caboolture's Abbey Museum is an Anglo-Saxon skeleton, a gift from the Lincolnshire county council, to acknowledge the contribution of the Abbey Museum in the exhibition of the Magna Carta during Expo 88. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The museum's collections include British Bronze Age material and an Islamic and Byzantine collection. Other significant pieces include the early prehistoric collections, which date back 500,000 years, and those from medieval Europe and Roman Britain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The museum is in two sections. On entering, visitors are led through a time passage which explores history, technology, art, social and philosophical concepts, unfolding to insights of prehistoric hunters and farmers, to Bronze and Iron Age Europe, Roman Britain, Viking life and on through medieval and Renaissance periods to the 18th and 19th centuries. The second section encompasses both the ancient and classical worlds. Other displays are devoted to other parts of civilisation. The collection is still predominantly that made by John Ward and in line with his monastic community in the early 1900s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Abbey Museum provides an excellent educational facility. An average of 800 students per month visit the museum from schools all over Australia. The museum is, however, in much need of further funding to construct a second wing, which would greatly enhance the facilities and educational resources on offer. The museum has also pioneered the rescue of Aboriginal sites in the Caboolture shire. It also stages an annual medieval tournament, which is fast becoming one of the most important historical festivals in south-east Queensland. Thousands of people attend each year and generally some 250 `knights' in full authentically reconstructed armour take the field. This year I was honoured to be invited to open it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The museum and its related work offer a singularly valuable addition to Australia's heritage. During my first term in parliament in the mid-1980s, I was able to assist the Abbey Museum in obtaining a CEP grant which enabled much work to be done. I have given the museum my continued support throughout the years and I have watched it develop to a museum of international standard. I hope in the future to see additional funding made available to this important facility so that all Australians and school students have the opportunity to travel back through the centuries and enjoy the richness of history and art which is on display at Caboolture's Abbey Museum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The World Health Assembly resolution 39.28 urged Member States to ensure that the small amounts of breast milk substitutes needed in maternity wards and hospitals be purchased through normal channels and not through donations or subsidised sales from infant formula manufacturers and importers. A number of actions have been taken to reach the goal of June 1994 set by WHO for the implementation of this resolution:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arising from this meeting, the State and Territory representatives have agreed to ascertain the impact of the World Health Assembly recommendation to cease free and subsidised supplies of infant formula, and to provide this information to the Commonwealth early in the new year.</PARA>
